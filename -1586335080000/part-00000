The team, which was once considered one of the best teams in [[Asia]], had its golden era during the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, under the coaching of [[Syed Abdul Rahim]], India won gold during the [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] and [[1962 Asian Games|1962]] [[Asian Games]], while finishing fourth at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIndia has never participated in the [[FIFA World Cup]], although the team did qualify by default for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] after all other nations in their qualification group withdrew. However, India withdrew prior to the beginning of the tournament. The team has also appeared four times in the Asia's top football competition, the [[AFC Asian Cup]]. Their best result in the competition occurred in [[1964 AFC Asian Cup|1964]] when the team finished as runners-up. India also participate in the [[SAFF Championship]], the top regional football competition in [[South Asia]]. They have won the tournament seven times since it began in 1993.\n\nDespite not achieving the same results as in their golden era, the Indian team has seen a steady resurgence since the beginning of the 21st century. Besides the SAFF Championship triumphs, under the guidance of [[Bob Houghton]], India won the restarted [[Nehru Cup]] in [[2007 Nehru Cup|2007]] and [[2009 Nehru Cup|2009]] and emerged victorious during the [[2008 AFC Challenge Cup]].

international [[Association football|football]] and is controlled by the [[All India Football Federation]]. Under the global jurisdiction of [[FIFA]] and governed in Asia by the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], the team is also part of the [[South Asian Football Federation]]. The team, which was once considered one of the best teams in [[Asia]], had its golden era during the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, under the coaching of [[Syed Abdul Rahim]], India won gold during the [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] and [[1962 Asian Games|1962]] [[Asian Games]], while finishing fourth at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIndia has never participated in the [[FIFA World Cup]], although the team did qualify by default for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] after all other nations in their qualification group withdrew. However, India withdrew prior to the beginning of the tournament. The team has also appeared four times in the Asia's top football competition, the [[AFC Asian Cup]]. Their best result in the competition occurred in [[1964 AFC Asian Cup|1964]] when the team finished as runners-up. India also participate in the [[SAFF Championship]], the top regional football competition in [[South Asia]]. They have won the tournament seven times since it began in 1993.\n\nDespite not achieving the same results as in their golden era, the Indian team has seen a steady resurgence since the beginning of the 21st century. Besides the SAFF Championship triumphs, under the guidance of [[Bob Houghton]], India won the restarted [[Nehru Cup]] in [[2007 Nehru Cup|2007]] and [[2009 Nehru Cup|2009]] and emerged victorious during the [[2008 AFC Challenge Cup]]. The Challenge Cup victory allowed India to once again qualify for the Asian Cup, for the first time in 27 years.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the India national football team}}<!--Remember, this is supposed to be just a summary.

She added that the album is devoid of the \"dangerous eroticism\" of Bieber's 2013 project, [[Journals (album)|''Journals'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/justin-bieber-changes-album-review-marriage-953011/|title=Justin Bieber's 'Changes' Is a One-Note Toast to Marital Happiness|last=Spanos|first=Brittany|date=2020-02-18|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> [[Insider Inc.|''Insider'']]'s Courteney Larocca and Callie Ahlgrim were favourable towards Bieber's \"pristine\" vocal performance, but dismissed the \"subpar\" lyrics, concluding ''Changes'' is \"ultimately a snooze fest\".

She highlighted the \"formulaic arrangements and wandering melodies\", which struggle \"to hit home in a major way\", like ''[[Purpose (Justin Bieber album)|Purpose]]'' did.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/epgbw7/justin-bieber-changes-album-review-marriage-love|title=Justin Bieber Is a Wife Guy Now|last=Garland|first=Emma|date=2020-02-14|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref> \n\nIn a two-star review, Roisin O'Connor of ''[[The Independent]]'' stated that ''Changes'' \"isn't so much an album that would rile you to the point of turning it off. Rather, it washes over you, with its mostly average beats and seemingly random cluster of guest features\", adding that it is \"full of vague platitudes about love from a singer who has yet to grow up\". O'Connor concluded that Bieber \"hasn't come all that far\" since the days of \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", as \"a number of songs about his new wife <nowiki>[[Hailey Baldwin]]</nowiki> are so uninspired that he may as well be declaring his love for a [[home appliance|household appliance]]\".<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Rating the album two stars, Hannah Mylrea of ''[[NME]]'' wrote that Bieber's \"limp comeback\" results in a collection of \"a knackering, loved-up slog lacking substance\", that is \"overly reliant on trendy production and profound(ish) romantic proclamations\". She added that it is \"a disappointing comeback from an artist who has a track record in creating hits\", as it is \"one romp that never reaches climax\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> ''[[Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s David Smyth expressed his disappointment in the album's subject matter, but complimented its production: \"In fact, so single-minded is his [Bieber] approach this time that it feels like she's [Baldwin] his only intended audience\", and thus Bieber's audience at his tour \"are going to be underwhelmed by the unchanging, lounging pace of the new material, gently ticking beats and lack of memorable choruses\".<ref name=\"ES\" /> \n\nRating the album a 4.5 out of 10, Jayson Greene of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that \"''Changes'' settles into a middle-distance, stream-friendly murmur that is more sleepy than salacious\", adding that its songs \"are all cold angles and frictionless surfaces, devoid of intimacy and heat\". He pointed out that \"nearly every song on ''Changes'' resembles every other in tempo, arrangement, and often in lyrics, which seem to be sourced from the same 10 or 15 pastel candy hearts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/justin-bieber-changes/|title=Justin Bieber: Changes Album Review|last=Greene|first=Jayson|date=February 18, 2020|website=Pitchfork|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 18, 2020}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'', Nick Roseblade opined that the main problem with ''Changes'' is that \"it isn't exciting or dynamic and suffers from dragging in places\", citing the \"lack of variation\" on the album, as a reason.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/justin-bieber-changes|title=Justin Bieber - Changes|last=Roseblade|first=Nick|date=February 14, 2020|website=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref> [[Nylon (magazine)|''Nylon'']]'s Alim Kheraj wrote that ''Changes''  shows \"how detached and uninterested\" Bieber has become. He stated that the album emulates the early 2000s, but it \"doesn't do so reverentially, nor does it borrow from a sonic palette to make it new again\", resulting in an \"uninspired and confused\" record, that \"lacks the emotional maturity\" to translate Bieber's marriage. He described Bieber's treatment of sex on the album is \"instant, bountiful, in your face, but ultimately unrealistic and devoid of any eroticism\" like [[pornography]]. Kheraj concluded that Bieber's \"misguided foray into adulthood and untapped creative potential he clearly thought it would be\", is \"a myopic result of the privilege he's gotten used to as a white male artist making art in America\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nylon.com/justin-bieber-changes-album-review|title=Justin Bieber's 'Changes' Is Not The R&B Revival We Hoped For|last=Kheraj|first=Alim|date=2020-02-14|website=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Changes'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 231,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, including 126,000 pure album sales in its first week.

Spanos called the album as the \"[[honeymoon]] phase in R&Bieber form\", thus \"sweet, uncomplicated, and maybe just a bit hard to imagine lasting forever\", with Bieber's \"charming malleability as an artist\" missing.

O'Connor concluded that Bieber \"hasn't come all that far\" since the days of \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", as \"a number of songs about his new wife <nowiki>[[Hailey Baldwin]]</nowiki> are so uninspired that he may as well be declaring his love for a [[home appliance|household appliance]]\".<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Rating the album two stars, Hannah Mylrea of ''[[NME]]'' wrote that Bieber's \"limp comeback\" results in a collection of \"a knackering, loved-up slog lacking substance\", that is \"overly reliant on trendy production and profound(ish) romantic proclamations\". She added that it is \"a disappointing comeback from an artist who has a track record in creating hits\", as it is \"one romp that never reaches climax\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> ''[[Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s David Smyth expressed his disappointment in the album's subject matter, but complimented its production: \"In fact, so single-minded is his [Bieber] approach this time that it feels like she's [Baldwin] his only intended audience\", and thus Bieber's audience at his tour \"are going to be underwhelmed by the unchanging, lounging pace of the new material, gently ticking beats and lack of memorable choruses\".<ref name=\"ES\" /> \n\nRating the album a 4.5 out of 10, Jayson Greene of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that \"''Changes'' settles into a middle-distance, stream-friendly murmur that is more sleepy than salacious\", adding that its songs \"are all cold angles and frictionless surfaces, devoid of intimacy and heat\". He pointed out that \"nearly every song on ''Changes'' resembles every other in tempo, arrangement, and often in lyrics, which seem to be sourced from the same 10 or 15 pastel candy hearts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/justin-bieber-changes/|title=Justin Bieber: Changes Album Review|last=Greene|first=Jayson|date=February 18, 2020|website=Pitchfork|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 18, 2020}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'', Nick Roseblade opined that the main problem with ''Changes'' is that \"it isn't exciting or dynamic and suffers from dragging in places\", citing the \"lack of variation\" on the album, as a reason.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/justin-bieber-changes|title=Justin Bieber - Changes|last=Roseblade|first=Nick|date=February 14, 2020|website=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref> [[Nylon (magazine)|''Nylon'']]'s Alim Kheraj wrote that ''Changes''  shows \"how detached and uninterested\" Bieber has become. He stated that the album emulates the early 2000s, but it \"doesn't do so reverentially, nor does it borrow from a sonic palette to make it new again\", resulting in an \"uninspired and confused\" record, that \"lacks the emotional maturity\" to translate Bieber's marriage. He described Bieber's treatment of sex on the album is \"instant, bountiful, in your face, but ultimately unrealistic and devoid of any eroticism\" like [[pornography]]. Kheraj concluded that Bieber's \"misguided foray into adulthood and untapped creative potential he clearly thought it would be\", is \"a myopic result of the privilege he's gotten used to as a white male artist making art in America\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nylon.com/justin-bieber-changes-album-review|title=Justin Bieber's 'Changes' Is Not The R&B Revival We Hoped For|last=Kheraj|first=Alim|date=2020-02-14|website=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Changes'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 231,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, including 126,000 pure album sales in its first week.

The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company [[The Aviation Corporation]].  This, in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways.  In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system and was renamed American Airlines.  Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing [[Trans World Airlines]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/01/10/deals/amr_twa/|title=TWA to be bought by American - Jan. 10, 2001|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAmerican had a direct role in the development of the [[DC-3]], which resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO [[C. R. Smith]] to Donald Douglas, when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the [[DC-2]] to replace American's [[Curtiss T-32 Condor II|Curtiss Condor II]] biplanes. (The existing DC-2's cabin was {{convert|66|in|m}} wide, too narrow for side-by-side berths.) Douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after Smith informed him of American's intention to purchase 20 aircraft. The prototype DST ([[Douglas Sleeper Transport]]) first flew on December 17, 1935, (the 32nd anniversary of the [[Wright Brothers]]' flight at Kitty Hawk). Its cabin was {{convert|92|in|m|abbr=on}} wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14\u201316 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. There was no prototype DC-3; the first DC-3 built followed seven DSTs off the production line and was delivered to American Airlines.<ref>Pearcy, Arthur. ''Douglas DC-3 Survivors, Volume 1''.

In 2013, American Airlines merged with [[US Airways]] but kept the American Airlines name, as it was the better-recognized brand internationally; the combination of the two airlines resulted in the creation of the largest airline in the United States, and ultimately the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Airlines|title=American Airlines \u2013 American company|website=Britannica.com}}</ref>\n\n==Destinations and hubs==\n===Destinations===\n{{Main|List of American Airlines destinations}}\nAs of December 2019, American Airlines flies to [[List of American Airlines destinations|95 domestic destinations and 95 international destinations in 55 countries in five continents]], soon to be six when American launches their flight to Casablanca from Philadelphia in June 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aa.fltmaps.com/en|title=American Airlines Map|website=aa.fltmaps.com|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\n===Hubs===\nAmerican currently operates ten hubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.aa.com/multimedia/default.aspx#factsheets|title=Newsroom \u2013 Multimedia \u2013 American Airlines Group, Inc|website=news.aa.com}}</ref>\n* [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]] \u2013 Inherited from the merger with [[US Airways]], Charlotte is American's hub for the Southeast and secondary hub to the Caribbean.

The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company [[The Aviation Corporation]].  This, in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways.  In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system and was renamed American Airlines.  Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing [[Trans World Airlines]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/01/10/deals/amr_twa/|title=TWA to be bought by American - Jan. 10, 2001|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAmerican had a direct role in the development of the [[DC-3]], which resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO [[C. R. Smith]] to Donald Douglas, when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the [[DC-2]] to replace American's [[Curtiss T-32 Condor II|Curtiss Condor II]] biplanes. (The existing DC-2's cabin was {{convert|66|in|m}} wide, too narrow for side-by-side berths.) Douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after Smith informed him of American's intention to purchase 20 aircraft. The prototype DST ([[Douglas Sleeper Transport]]) first flew on December 17, 1935, (the 32nd anniversary of the [[Wright Brothers]]' flight at Kitty Hawk). Its cabin was {{convert|92|in|m|abbr=on}} wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14\u201316 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. There was no prototype DC-3; the first DC-3 built followed seven DSTs off the production line and was delivered to American Airlines.<ref>Pearcy, Arthur. ''Douglas DC-3 Survivors, Volume 1''.

She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous.

She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous. But then, the danger makes it more exciting.\" She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}}\n\nKarina Longworth notes how \"external\" Streep's performances are, \"chameleonic\" in her impersonation of characters, \"subsuming herself into them, rather than personifying them\". In her early roles such as ''Manhattan'' and ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', she was compared to both [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]], in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, \"I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable\".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Meryl Streep - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|Streep's star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]'']]\nMike Nichols, who directed Streep in ''Silkwood'', ''Heartburn'', ''Postcards from the Edge'', and ''Angels in America'', praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, \"In every role, she becomes a totally new human being.

It is set in the turbulent years towards the [[End of the Han dynasty|end]] of the [[Han dynasty]] and the [[Three kingdoms (China)|Three Kingdoms]] period in [[History of China|Chinese history]], starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.\n\nThe story \u2013 part historical, part legend, and part mythical \u2013 romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]], and [[Eastern Wu]]. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\n''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is acclaimed as one of the [[Classic Chinese Novels|Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]]; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.<ref name=\"roberts940\">Roberts 1991, pg. 940</ref> The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in [[East Asia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|title=(Review) Historical China film lives up to expectations|last=Kim|first=Hyung-eun|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=11 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225000000/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|archivedate=25 December 2011|quote=The ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is comparable to the Bible in East Asia.

Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the ''Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi'', is now held in the [[Shanghai Library]] in China, [[Tenri Central Library]] in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world.

The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n[[File:Three Brothers (Bei, Yu, Fei).jpg|thumb|200px|''Three Heroes of Three Kingdoms'', silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.]]\n\n===Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants===\nIn the [[End of the Han dynasty|final years]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]], treacherous [[eunuch]]s and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out under the leadership of [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]].\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general [[He Jin]]. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young [[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]] on the throne and took control of the central government. The [[Ten Attendants]], a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the [[Emperor Xian of Han|Prince of Chenliu]], disappeared from the palace.\n\n===Dong Zhuo's tyranny===\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]], who seized control of the imperial capital, [[Luoyang]], under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu ([[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]]), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by [[Cao Cao]], whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under [[Yuan Shao]]'s leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of [[Battle of Sishui Pass|Sishui Pass]] and [[Battle of Hulao Pass|Hulao Pass]], so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to [[Chang'an]]. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son [[L\u00fc Bu]] in a dispute over the maiden [[Diaochan]] as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]].\n\n===Conflict among the various warlords and nobles===\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. [[Sun Jian]] found the [[Imperial Seal of China|Imperial Seal]] in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and [[Gongsun Zan]] were at war in the north while Sun Jian and [[Liu Biao]] were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and [[Liu Bei]], who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in [[Xuchang|Xu]] and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as [[L\u00fc Bu]], [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the [[Battle of Guandu]]. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of [[Cao Wei]] in the future.\n\n===Sun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong===\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the [[Battle of Xiangyang (191)|Battle of Xiangyang]] against Liu Biao. His eldest son, [[Sun Ce]], delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising [[pretender]], [[Yuan Shu]], in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] ([[Wu (region)|Wu]]), on which the state of [[Eastern Wu]] was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of [[Gan Ji|Yu Ji]], a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, [[Sun Quan]], his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from [[Zhou Yu]], [[Zhang Zhao]] and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as [[Lu Su]] to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\n===Liu Bei's ambition===\n[[File:Dai Jin-Looking Three Times at the Thatched Hut.jpg|thumb|200px|Liu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from ''Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times'', a [[Ming dynasty]] painting by [[Dai Jin]] (1388\u20131462).]]\n\n[[Liu Bei]] and his oath brothers [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]] swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and participating in the [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. After Liu Bei succeeded [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] as the governor of [[Xu Province]], he offered shelter to [[L\u00fc Bu]], who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the [[Battle of Xiapi]]. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and [[Nine familial exterminations|executed along with their families]].\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from [[Che Zhou]], the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in [[Runan Commandery|Runan]], where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to [[Jing Province]], where he found shelter under the governor, [[Liu Biao]].\n\n===Battle of Guandu===\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye. \n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\n===Battle of Changban===\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of [[Xinye County|Xinye]], where Liu Bei visited [[Zhuge Liang]] thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed [[Chancellor (China)|Imperial Chancellor]] by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan. \n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan. \n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\n===Battle of Red Cliffs===\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n\n[[File:Chibi.jpg|thumb|200px|Traditional site of the Red Cliffs.]]\n\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern [[Jing Province]] after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, [[Cao Ren]]. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, [[Lady Sun]]. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\n===Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province===\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's [[Longzhong Plan]], Liu Bei led his forces westward into [[Yi Province]] and [[Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province|seized control of the territories]] from the governor, [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]]. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of [[Shu Han]] later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the [[Hanzhong Campaign]] and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a [[vassal]] king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the [[Yangtze River]], including the battles of [[Battle of Xiaoyao Ford|Hefei]] and [[Battle of Ruxukou (217)|Ruxu]], but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\n===Death of Guan Yu===\n[[File:Chengdu 2007 360.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shadow puppet]]s in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]].]]\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking [[Cao Ren]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], Sun Quan sent his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] to launch [[L\u00fc Meng's invasion of Jing Province|a stealth invasion on Jing Province]]. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, [[Cao Pi]], forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of [[Cao Wei]] to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of [[Shu Han]] as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\n===Battle of Yiling===\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the [[Battle of Xiaoting|Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling]] by Sun Quan's general, [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]]. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's [[Stone Sentinel Maze]].\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's impression of [[Zhuge Liang]].]]\n\nLiu Bei died in [[Baidicheng]] from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, [[Liu Shan]], proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms\nPeach garden ceremony.jpg\nAn illustration from a Ming dynasty printed edition of the novel from 1591, collection of the Peking University.\nAuthor\tLuo Guanzhong\nOriginal title\t\u4e09\u570b\u6f14\u7fa9\nCountry\tChina\nLanguage\tChinese\nSubject\tAncient China\nGenre\tHistorical fiction\nMedia type\tPrint\nISBN\t978-7-119-00590-4\nLC Class\tPL2690.S3 E53 1995\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms (Chinese characters).svg\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms in Traditional (top) and Simplified (bottom) Chinese characters\nChinese name\nTraditional Chinese\t\u4e09\u570b\u6f14\u7fa9\nSimplified Chinese\t\u4e09\u56fd\u6f14\u4e49\nTranscriptions\nVietnamese name\nVietnamese\tTam qu\u1ed1c di\u1ec5n ngh\u0129a\nH\u00e1n-N\u00f4m\t\u4e09\u570b\u6f14\u7fa9\nKorean name\nHangul\t\uc0bc\uad6d\uc9c0\uc5f0\uc758\nHanja\t\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u6f14\u7fa9\nTranscriptions\nJapanese name\nKanji\t\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u6f14\u7fa9\nHiragana\t\u3055\u3093\u3054\u304f\u3057\u3048\u3093\u304e\nTranscriptions\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms (Chinese: \u4e09\u56fd\u6f14\u4e49; pinyin: S\u0101ngu\u00f3 Y\u01ceny\u00ec) is a 14th-century historical novel attributed to Luo Guanzhong. It is set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.\n\nThe story \u2013 part historical, part legend, and part mythical \u2013 romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.[1] The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in East Asia,[2] and its literary influence in the region has been compared to that of the works of Shakespeare on English literature.[3] It is arguably the most widely read historical novel in late imperial and modern China.[4]\n\n\nContents\n1\tOverview\n1.1\tExpansion of the history\n1.2\tRecensions and standardised text\n2\tPlot\n2.1\tYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\n2.2\tDong Zhuo's tyranny\n2.3\tConflict among the various warlords and nobles\n2.4\tSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\n2.5\tLiu Bei's ambition\n2.6\tBattle of Guandu\n2.7\tBattle of Changban\n2.8\tBattle of Red Cliffs\n2.9\tLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\n2.10\tDeath of Guan Yu\n2.11\tBattle of Yiling\n2.12\tZhuge Liang's campaigns\n2.13\tEnd of the Three Kingdoms\n3\tHistorical accuracy\n4\tLiterary analysis\n5\tCultural impact\n5.1\tBuddhist aspects\n5.2\tStrategies used in battles\n6\tTranslations\n6.1\tEnglish translations\n6.2\tAdaptations\n7\tSee also\n8\tCitations\n9\tReferences and further reading\n10\tExternal links\nOverview\nAccording to Andrew H. Plaks, stories from the heroes of the Three Kingdoms was the basis of entertainment dating back to the Sui and Tang dynasty. Plaks also states, \"By Sung times several contemporary accounts inform us that there existed professional oral storytellers who specialized in the Three Kingdoms hero cycles.\" The earliest written work to combine these stories was a pinghua, Sanguozhi Pinghua (simplified Chinese: \u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u5e73\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u5e73\u8a71; pinyin: S\u0101ngu\u00f3zh\u00ec P\u00ednghu\u00e0; literally: 'Story of Records of the Three Kingdoms'), published sometime between 1321 and 1323.[5]\n\nExpansion of the history\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong,[6] a playwright who lived sometime between 1315 and 1400 (late Yuan to early Ming period) known for compiling historical plays in styles which were prevalent during the Yuan period.[7] It was first printed in 1522[7] as Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi (\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u7fa9/\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u4e49) in an edition which bore a perhaps spurious preface date 1494. The text may well have circulated before either date in handwritten manuscripts.[8]\n\nIn any case, whether an earlier or later date of composition, whether or not Luo Guanzhong was responsible, the author made use of available historical records, including the Records of the Three Kingdoms compiled by Chen Shou, which covered events from the Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184 to the unification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin dynasty in 280. The novel also includes material from Tang dynasty poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.[9]\n\nRecensions and standardised text\nSeveral versions of the expanded Sanguozhi are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi, is now held in the Shanghai Library in China, Tenri Central Library in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a recension by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang.\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty, Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to Sanguozhi Yanyi.[10] The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising Cao Cao's advisers and generals were removed.[11] Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.[12]\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been\" (\u8bdd\u8bf4\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u52bf\uff0e\u5206\u4e45\u5fc5\u5408\uff0c\u5408\u4e45\u5fc5\u5206),[13] long understood to be Luo's introduction and cyclical philosophy, were actually added by the Maos in their substantially revised edition of 1679.[14] None of the earlier editions contained this phrase. In addition, Mao also added Yang Shen's The Immortals by the River as the famous introductory poem (which began with \"The gushing waters of the Yangzi River pour and disappear into the East\") (\u6eda\u6eda\u957f\u6c5f\u4e1c\u901d\u6c34) to the novel.[15] The earlier editions, moreover, spend less time on the process of division, which they found painful, and far more time on the process of reunification and the struggles of the heroes who sacrificed for it.[16]\n\nPlot\nOne of the greatest achievements of Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the extreme complexity of its stories and characters. The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n\nThree Heroes of Three Kingdoms, silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\nIn the final years of the Eastern Han dynasty, treacherous eunuchs and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of Emperor Ling, the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out under the leadership of Zhang Jiao.\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general He Jin. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young Emperor Shao on the throne and took control of the central government. The Ten Attendants, a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the Prince of Chenliu, disappeared from the palace.\n\nDong Zhuo's tyranny\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord Dong Zhuo, who seized control of the imperial capital, Luoyang, under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu (Emperor Xian), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by Cao Cao, whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under Yuan Shao's leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of Sishui Pass and Hulao Pass, so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to Chang'an. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son L\u00fc Bu in a dispute over the maiden Diaochan as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister Wang Yun.\n\nConflict among the various warlords and nobles\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. Sun Jian found the Imperial Seal in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan were at war in the north while Sun Jian and Liu Biao were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei, who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in Xu and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as L\u00fc Bu, Yuan Shu and Zhang Xiu in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of Cao Wei in the future.\n\nSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the Battle of Xiangyang against Liu Biao. His eldest son, Sun Ce, delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising pretender, Yuan Shu, in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of Jiangdong (Wu), on which the state of Eastern Wu was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of Yu Ji, a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, Sun Quan, his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as Lu Su to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\nLiu Bei's ambition\n\nLiu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times, a Ming dynasty painting by Dai Jin (1388\u20131462).\nLiu Bei and his oath brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the Oath of the Peach Garden and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the Yellow Turban Rebellion and participating in the campaign against Dong Zhuo. After Liu Bei succeeded Tao Qian as the governor of Xu Province, he offered shelter to L\u00fc Bu, who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the Battle of Xiapi. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, Dong Cheng, and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and executed along with their families.\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in Runan, where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to Jing Province, where he found shelter under the governor, Liu Biao.\n\nBattle of Guandu\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye.\n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\nBattle of Changban\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of Xinye, where Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed Imperial Chancellor by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan.\n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan.\n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\nBattle of Red Cliffs\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\n\n\nTraditional site of the Red Cliffs.\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern Jing Province after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, Cao Ren. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, Lady Sun. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\nLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's Longzhong Plan, Liu Bei led his forces westward into Yi Province and seized control of the territories from the governor, Liu Zhang. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of Shu Han later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a vassal king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the Yangtze River, including the battles of Hefei and Ruxu, but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\nDeath of Guan Yu\n\nShadow puppets in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking Cao Ren at the Battle of Fancheng, Sun Quan sent his general L\u00fc Meng to launch a stealth invasion on Jing Province. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\nBattle of Yiling\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling by Sun Quan's general, Lu Xun. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's Stone Sentinel Maze.\n\n\nAn artist's impression of Zhuge Liang.\nLiu Bei died in Baidicheng from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, Liu Shan, proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\n\nZhuge Liang's campaigns\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general Meng Da, the Nanman and Qiang tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent Deng Zhi to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led a southern campaign against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, Meng Huo.\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on five military expeditions to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general Sima Yi.\n\nEnd of the Three Kingdoms\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after Cao Rui's death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, Sima Shi and Sima Zhao.\n\nIn Shu, Jiang Wei inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another nine campaigns against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor Liu Shan also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually conquered by Wei forces. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of Zhong Hui, a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei emperor, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the Jin dynasty to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents Zhuge Ke and Sun Chen consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, Sun Hao, turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually conquered by the Jin dynasty. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nHistorical accuracy\nSee also: List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms. Other major influences include Liu Yiqing's A New Account of the Tales of the World (Shishuo Xinyu), published in 430,[17] and the Sanguozhi Pinghua, a chronological collection of eighty fictional sketches starting with the peach garden oath and ending with Zhuge Liang's death.[18]\n\nSome 50 or 60 Yuan and early Ming plays about the Three Kingdoms are known to have existed, and their material is almost entirely fictional, based on thin threads of actual history. The novel is thus a return to greater emphasis on history, compared to these dramas.[19] The novel also shifted towards better acknowledgement of southern China's historical importance, while still portraying some prejudice against the south.[20] The Qing dynasty historian Zhang Xuecheng famously wrote that the novel was \"seven-parts fact and three-parts fiction.\"[10][21] The fictional parts are culled from different sources, including unofficial histories, folk stories, the Sanguozhi Pinghua, and also the author's own imagination. Nonetheless, the description of the social conditions and the logic that the characters use is accurate to the Three Kingdoms period, creating \"believable\" situations and characters, even if they are not historically accurate.[22]\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms, like the dramas and folk stories of its day, features Liu Bei and his associates as the protagonists; hence the depiction of the people in Shu Han was glorified. The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.[citation needed]\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\nLiterary analysis\n\nA depiction of Pang De at the Battle of Fancheng, from a Qing dynasty edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the Brewitt-Taylor translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".[21] to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of Confucian political thought and the harsh realism of Legalism, as a related theme.[21] Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.[1]\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been\", added by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang in their recension,[23][13] epitomise the tragic theme of the novel. One recent critic notes that the novel takes political and moral stands and lets the reader know which of the characters are heroes and which villains, yet the heroes are forced to make a tragic choice between equal values, not merely between good and evil. The heroes know that the end of the empire is ordained by this cosmic cycle of division and unity, yet their choices are moral, based on loyalty, not political.[24]\n\nPlaks states the novel deals with the \"cyclical theories of dynastic decline,\" and relates the \"breakdown of order\" at the end of the Han dynasty to \"the improper exercise of imperial authority, the destabilization influence of special-interest groups (eunuchs, imperial clansmen), the problem of factional and individual idealism carried to the point of civil strife-all of which eventually surface in the body of the narrative.\" He goes on to say, the \"overlapping claims to legitimacy and multiple spheres of power,\" give the novel a \"sense of epic greatness\" with its \"combination of grandeur and futility.\"[5]:385,403,495\n\nCultural impact\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

Pujing made his first appearance during Guan's arduous journey of crossing five passes and slaying six generals, in which he warned Guan of an assassination plot. As the novel was written in the Ming dynasty, more than 1,000 years after the era, these stories showed that Buddhism had long been a significant ingredient of the mainstream culture and may not be historically accurate.[clarification needed] Luo Guanzhong preserved these descriptions from earlier versions of the novel to support his portrait of Guan as a faithful man of virtue. Guan has since then been respectfully addressed as \"Lord Guan\" or Guan Gong.\n\nStrategies used in battles\nCreate Something from Nothing: A strategy to make an audience believe of something\u2019s existence, when it in fact does not exist.

The first known translation was performed in 1907 by John G. Steele and consisted of a single chapter excerpt that was distributed in China to students learning English at Presbyterian missionary schools.[6] Z. Q. Parker published a 1925 translation containing four episodes from the novel including the events of the Battle of Red Cliffs, while Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang published excerpts in 1981, including chapters 43\u201350.[6] A complete and faithful translation of the novel was published in two volumes in 1925 by Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor, a long time official of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service.[6] The translation was well written, but lacked any supplementary materials such as maps or character lists that would aid Western readers; a 1959 reprint was published that included maps and an introduction by Roy Andrew Miller to assist foreign readers.[6]\n\nIn 1976, Moss Roberts published an abridged translation containing one fourth of the novel including maps and more than 40 woodblock illustrations from three Chinese versions of the novel.[6] Roberts' abridgement is reader-friendly, being written for use in colleges and to be read by the general public.[6] After decades of work, Roberts published a full translation in 1991 complete with an afterword, eleven maps, a list of characters, titles, terms, and offices, and almost 100 pages of notes from Mao Zonggang's commentaries and other scholarly sources.[6] Roberts' complete translation remains faithful to the original; it is reliable yet still matches the tone and style of the classic text.[6] Yang Ye, a professor in Chinese Literature at the UC Riverside, wrote in Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English (1998) that Roberts' translation \"supersedes Brewitt-Taylor's translation and will no doubt remain the definitive English version for many years to come\".[6] Roberts' translation was republished in 1995 by the Foreign Languages Press without the illustrations.[35]\n\nIn 2014, Tuttle published a new, three-volume translation of the novel, translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Ronald C.

It is set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.\n\nThe story \u2013 part historical, part legend, and part mythical \u2013 romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.[1] The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in East Asia,[2] and its literary influence in the region has been compared to that of the works of Shakespeare on English literature.[3] It is arguably the most widely read historical novel in late imperial and modern China.[4]\n\n\nContents\n1\tOverview\n1.1\tExpansion of the history\n1.2\tRecensions and standardised text\n2\tPlot\n2.1\tYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\n2.2\tDong Zhuo's tyranny\n2.3\tConflict among the various warlords and nobles\n2.4\tSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\n2.5\tLiu Bei's ambition\n2.6\tBattle of Guandu\n2.7\tBattle of Changban\n2.8\tBattle of Red Cliffs\n2.9\tLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\n2.10\tDeath of Guan Yu\n2.11\tBattle of Yiling\n2.12\tZhuge Liang's campaigns\n2.13\tEnd of the Three Kingdoms\n3\tHistorical accuracy\n4\tLiterary analysis\n5\tCultural impact\n5.1\tBuddhist aspects\n5.2\tStrategies used in battles\n6\tTranslations\n6.1\tEnglish translations\n6.2\tAdaptations\n7\tSee also\n8\tCitations\n9\tReferences and further reading\n10\tExternal links\nOverview\nAccording to Andrew H. Plaks, stories from the heroes of the Three Kingdoms was the basis of entertainment dating back to the Sui and Tang dynasty. Plaks also states, \"By Sung times several contemporary accounts inform us that there existed professional oral storytellers who specialized in the Three Kingdoms hero cycles.\" The earliest written work to combine these stories was a pinghua, Sanguozhi Pinghua (simplified Chinese: \u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u5e73\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u5e73\u8a71; pinyin: S\u0101ngu\u00f3zh\u00ec P\u00ednghu\u00e0; literally: 'Story of Records of the Three Kingdoms'), published sometime between 1321 and 1323.[5]\n\nExpansion of the history\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong,[6] a playwright who lived sometime between 1315 and 1400 (late Yuan to early Ming period) known for compiling historical plays in styles which were prevalent during the Yuan period.[7] It was first printed in 1522[7] as Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi (\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u7fa9/\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u4e49) in an edition which bore a perhaps spurious preface date 1494. The text may well have circulated before either date in handwritten manuscripts.[8]\n\nIn any case, whether an earlier or later date of composition, whether or not Luo Guanzhong was responsible, the author made use of available historical records, including the Records of the Three Kingdoms compiled by Chen Shou, which covered events from the Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184 to the unification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin dynasty in 280. The novel also includes material from Tang dynasty poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.[9]\n\nRecensions and standardised text\nSeveral versions of the expanded Sanguozhi are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi, is now held in the Shanghai Library in China, Tenri Central Library in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a recension by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang.\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty, Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to Sanguozhi Yanyi.[10] The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising Cao Cao's advisers and generals were removed.[11] Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.[12]\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been\" (\u8bdd\u8bf4\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u52bf\uff0e\u5206\u4e45\u5fc5\u5408\uff0c\u5408\u4e45\u5fc5\u5206),[13] long understood to be Luo's introduction and cyclical philosophy, were actually added by the Maos in their substantially revised edition of 1679.[14] None of the earlier editions contained this phrase. In addition, Mao also added Yang Shen's The Immortals by the River as the famous introductory poem (which began with \"The gushing waters of the Yangzi River pour and disappear into the East\") (\u6eda\u6eda\u957f\u6c5f\u4e1c\u901d\u6c34) to the novel.[15] The earlier editions, moreover, spend less time on the process of division, which they found painful, and far more time on the process of reunification and the struggles of the heroes who sacrificed for it.[16]\n\nPlot\nOne of the greatest achievements of Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the extreme complexity of its stories and characters. The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n\nThree Heroes of Three Kingdoms, silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\nIn the final years of the Eastern Han dynasty, treacherous eunuchs and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of Emperor Ling, the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out under the leadership of Zhang Jiao.\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general He Jin. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young Emperor Shao on the throne and took control of the central government. The Ten Attendants, a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the Prince of Chenliu, disappeared from the palace.\n\nDong Zhuo's tyranny\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord Dong Zhuo, who seized control of the imperial capital, Luoyang, under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu (Emperor Xian), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by Cao Cao, whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under Yuan Shao's leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of Sishui Pass and Hulao Pass, so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to Chang'an. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son L\u00fc Bu in a dispute over the maiden Diaochan as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister Wang Yun.\n\nConflict among the various warlords and nobles\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. Sun Jian found the Imperial Seal in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan were at war in the north while Sun Jian and Liu Biao were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei, who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in Xu and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as L\u00fc Bu, Yuan Shu and Zhang Xiu in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of Cao Wei in the future.\n\nSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the Battle of Xiangyang against Liu Biao. His eldest son, Sun Ce, delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising pretender, Yuan Shu, in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of Jiangdong (Wu), on which the state of Eastern Wu was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of Yu Ji, a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, Sun Quan, his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as Lu Su to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\nLiu Bei's ambition\n\nLiu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times, a Ming dynasty painting by Dai Jin (1388\u20131462).\nLiu Bei and his oath brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the Oath of the Peach Garden and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the Yellow Turban Rebellion and participating in the campaign against Dong Zhuo. After Liu Bei succeeded Tao Qian as the governor of Xu Province, he offered shelter to L\u00fc Bu, who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the Battle of Xiapi. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, Dong Cheng, and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and executed along with their families.\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in Runan, where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to Jing Province, where he found shelter under the governor, Liu Biao.\n\nBattle of Guandu\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye.\n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\nBattle of Changban\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of Xinye, where Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed Imperial Chancellor by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan.\n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan.\n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\nBattle of Red Cliffs\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\n\n\nTraditional site of the Red Cliffs.\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern Jing Province after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, Cao Ren. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, Lady Sun. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\nLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's Longzhong Plan, Liu Bei led his forces westward into Yi Province and seized control of the territories from the governor, Liu Zhang. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of Shu Han later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a vassal king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the Yangtze River, including the battles of Hefei and Ruxu, but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\nDeath of Guan Yu\n\nShadow puppets in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking Cao Ren at the Battle of Fancheng, Sun Quan sent his general L\u00fc Meng to launch a stealth invasion on Jing Province. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\nBattle of Yiling\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling by Sun Quan's general, Lu Xun. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's Stone Sentinel Maze.\n\n\nAn artist's impression of Zhuge Liang.\nLiu Bei died in Baidicheng from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, Liu Shan, proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\n\nZhuge Liang's campaigns\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general Meng Da, the Nanman and Qiang tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent Deng Zhi to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led a southern campaign against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, Meng Huo.\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on five military expeditions to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general Sima Yi.\n\nEnd of the Three Kingdoms\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after Cao Rui's death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, Sima Shi and Sima Zhao.\n\nIn Shu, Jiang Wei inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another nine campaigns against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor Liu Shan also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually conquered by Wei forces. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of Zhong Hui, a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei emperor, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the Jin dynasty to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents Zhuge Ke and Sun Chen consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, Sun Hao, turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually conquered by the Jin dynasty. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nHistorical accuracy\nSee also: List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms. Other major influences include Liu Yiqing's A New Account of the Tales of the World (Shishuo Xinyu), published in 430,[17] and the Sanguozhi Pinghua, a chronological collection of eighty fictional sketches starting with the peach garden oath and ending with Zhuge Liang's death.[18]\n\nSome 50 or 60 Yuan and early Ming plays about the Three Kingdoms are known to have existed, and their material is almost entirely fictional, based on thin threads of actual history. The novel is thus a return to greater emphasis on history, compared to these dramas.[19] The novel also shifted towards better acknowledgement of southern China's historical importance, while still portraying some prejudice against the south.[20] The Qing dynasty historian Zhang Xuecheng famously wrote that the novel was \"seven-parts fact and three-parts fiction.\"[10][21] The fictional parts are culled from different sources, including unofficial histories, folk stories, the Sanguozhi Pinghua, and also the author's own imagination. Nonetheless, the description of the social conditions and the logic that the characters use is accurate to the Three Kingdoms period, creating \"believable\" situations and characters, even if they are not historically accurate.[22]\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms, like the dramas and folk stories of its day, features Liu Bei and his associates as the protagonists; hence the depiction of the people in Shu Han was glorified. The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.[citation needed]\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\nLiterary analysis\n\nA depiction of Pang De at the Battle of Fancheng, from a Qing dynasty edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the Brewitt-Taylor translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".[21] to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of Confucian political thought and the harsh realism of Legalism, as a related theme.[21] Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.[1]\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been\", added by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang in their recension,[23][13] epitomise the tragic theme of the novel. One recent critic notes that the novel takes political and moral stands and lets the reader know which of the characters are heroes and which villains, yet the heroes are forced to make a tragic choice between equal values, not merely between good and evil. The heroes know that the end of the empire is ordained by this cosmic cycle of division and unity, yet their choices are moral, based on loyalty, not political.[24]\n\nPlaks states the novel deals with the \"cyclical theories of dynastic decline,\" and relates the \"breakdown of order\" at the end of the Han dynasty to \"the improper exercise of imperial authority, the destabilization influence of special-interest groups (eunuchs, imperial clansmen), the problem of factional and individual idealism carried to the point of civil strife-all of which eventually surface in the body of the narrative.\" He goes on to say, the \"overlapping claims to legitimacy and multiple spheres of power,\" give the novel a \"sense of epic greatness\" with its \"combination of grandeur and futility.\"[5]:385,403,495\n\nCultural impact\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

Pujing made his first appearance during Guan's arduous journey of crossing five passes and slaying six generals, in which he warned Guan of an assassination plot. As the novel was written in the Ming dynasty, more than 1,000 years after the era, these stories showed that Buddhism had long been a significant ingredient of the mainstream culture and may not be historically accurate.[clarification needed] Luo Guanzhong preserved these descriptions from earlier versions of the novel to support his portrait of Guan as a faithful man of virtue. Guan has since then been respectfully addressed as \"Lord Guan\" or Guan Gong.\n\nStrategies used in battles\nCreate Something from Nothing: A strategy to make an audience believe of something\u2019s existence, when it in fact does not exist.

This trick can work in three ways: firstly, the ruler can become so entranced with the feminine allure that he neglects all else. Secondly, the men will start competing for the females\u2019 attention, which will cause friction and rifts, and hinders cooperation and eradicates morale. And lastly, other women motivated by jealousy will begin to plot, only worsening the entire situation. Also known as the \u201cHoney Trap\u201d. (Ch. 55\u201356)\n\nEmpty City: When the enemy is superior in numbers and you are expecting to be attacked at any moment, drop all pretenses of seeming like you\u2019re preparing something militarily and act calm, so the enemy will think twice and will think you\u2019re setting a trap or an ambush. It is best used sparingly, and only if one has the military aptitude to do so. It\u2019s also best used if one\u2019s enemy is an over-thinker.

The first known translation was performed in 1907 by John G. Steele and consisted of a single chapter excerpt that was distributed in China to students learning English at Presbyterian missionary schools.[6] Z. Q. Parker published a 1925 translation containing four episodes from the novel including the events of the Battle of Red Cliffs, while Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang published excerpts in 1981, including chapters 43\u201350.[6] A complete and faithful translation of the novel was published in two volumes in 1925 by Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor, a long time official of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service.[6] The translation was well written, but lacked any supplementary materials such as maps or character lists that would aid Western readers; a 1959 reprint was published that included maps and an introduction by Roy Andrew Miller to assist foreign readers.[6]\n\nIn 1976, Moss Roberts published an abridged translation containing one fourth of the novel including maps and more than 40 woodblock illustrations from three Chinese versions of the novel.[6] Roberts' abridgement is reader-friendly, being written for use in colleges and to be read by the general public.[6] After decades of work, Roberts published a full translation in 1991 complete with an afterword, eleven maps, a list of characters, titles, terms, and offices, and almost 100 pages of notes from Mao Zonggang's commentaries and other scholarly sources.[6] Roberts' complete translation remains faithful to the original; it is reliable yet still matches the tone and style of the classic text.[6] Yang Ye, a professor in Chinese Literature at the UC Riverside, wrote in Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English (1998) that Roberts' translation \"supersedes Brewitt-Taylor's translation and will no doubt remain the definitive English version for many years to come\".[6] Roberts' translation was republished in 1995 by the Foreign Languages Press without the illustrations.[35]\n\nIn 2014, Tuttle published a new, three-volume translation of the novel, translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Ronald C. Iverson (ISBN 978-0804843935). According to its publisher, this translation is an unabridged \"dynamic translation\" intended to be more readable than past English translations of the novel.[36]\n\nAdaptations\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of media adaptations of Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nThe story of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms has been retold in numerous forms including television series, manga and video games.\n\nSee also\nLists of people of the Three Kingdoms, list of historical people significant to the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280)\nList of fictional people of the Three Kingdoms, list of fictional people of the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280)\nList of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms\nTimeline of the Three Kingdoms period\nMilitary history of the Three Kingdoms\nEnd of the Han dynasty\nCitations\n Roberts 1991, pg. 940\n Kim, Hyung-eun (11 July 2008). \"(Review) Historical China film lives up to expectations\".

It is set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.\n\nThe story \u2013 part historical, part legend, and part mythical \u2013 romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.[1] The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in East Asia,[2] and its literary influence in the region has been compared to that of the works of Shakespeare on English literature.[3] It is arguably the most widely read historical novel in late imperial and modern China.[4]\n\n\nContents\n1\tOverview\n1.1\tExpansion of the history\n1.2\tRecensions and standardised text\n2\tPlot\n2.1\tYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\n2.2\tDong Zhuo's tyranny\n2.3\tConflict among the various warlords and nobles\n2.4\tSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\n2.5\tLiu Bei's ambition\n2.6\tBattle of Guandu\n2.7\tBattle of Changban\n2.8\tBattle of Red Cliffs\n2.9\tLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\n2.10\tDeath of Guan Yu\n2.11\tBattle of Yiling\n2.12\tZhuge Liang's campaigns\n2.13\tEnd of the Three Kingdoms\n3\tHistorical accuracy\n4\tLiterary analysis\n5\tCultural impact\n5.1\tBuddhist aspects\n5.2\tStrategies used in battles\n6\tTranslations\n6.1\tEnglish translations\n6.2\tAdaptations\n7\tSee also\n8\tCitations\n9\tReferences and further reading\n10\tExternal links\nOverview\nAccording to Andrew H. Plaks, stories from the heroes of the Three Kingdoms was the basis of entertainment dating back to the Sui and Tang dynasty. Plaks also states, \"By Sung times several contemporary accounts inform us that there existed professional oral storytellers who specialized in the Three Kingdoms hero cycles.\" The earliest written work to combine these stories was a pinghua, Sanguozhi Pinghua (simplified Chinese: \u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u5e73\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u5e73\u8a71; pinyin: S\u0101ngu\u00f3zh\u00ec P\u00ednghu\u00e0; literally: 'Story of Records of the Three Kingdoms'), published sometime between 1321 and 1323.[5]\n\nExpansion of the history\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong,[6] a playwright who lived sometime between 1315 and 1400 (late Yuan to early Ming period) known for compiling historical plays in styles which were prevalent during the Yuan period.[7] It was first printed in 1522[7] as Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi (\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u7fa9/\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u4e49) in an edition which bore a perhaps spurious preface date 1494. The text may well have circulated before either date in handwritten manuscripts.[8]\n\nIn any case, whether an earlier or later date of composition, whether or not Luo Guanzhong was responsible, the author made use of available historical records, including the Records of the Three Kingdoms compiled by Chen Shou, which covered events from the Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184 to the unification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin dynasty in 280. The novel also includes material from Tang dynasty poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.[9]\n\nRecensions and standardised text\nSeveral versions of the expanded Sanguozhi are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi, is now held in the Shanghai Library in China, Tenri Central Library in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a recension by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang.\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty, Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to Sanguozhi Yanyi.[10] The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising Cao Cao's advisers and generals were removed.[11] Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.[12]\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been\" (\u8bdd\u8bf4\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u52bf\uff0e\u5206\u4e45\u5fc5\u5408\uff0c\u5408\u4e45\u5fc5\u5206),[13] long understood to be Luo's introduction and cyclical philosophy, were actually added by the Maos in their substantially revised edition of 1679.[14] None of the earlier editions contained this phrase. In addition, Mao also added Yang Shen's The Immortals by the River as the famous introductory poem (which began with \"The gushing waters of the Yangzi River pour and disappear into the East\") (\u6eda\u6eda\u957f\u6c5f\u4e1c\u901d\u6c34) to the novel.[15] The earlier editions, moreover, spend less time on the process of division, which they found painful, and far more time on the process of reunification and the struggles of the heroes who sacrificed for it.[16]\n\nPlot\nOne of the greatest achievements of Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the extreme complexity of its stories and characters. The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n\nThree Heroes of Three Kingdoms, silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\nIn the final years of the Eastern Han dynasty, treacherous eunuchs and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of Emperor Ling, the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out under the leadership of Zhang Jiao.\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general He Jin. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young Emperor Shao on the throne and took control of the central government. The Ten Attendants, a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the Prince of Chenliu, disappeared from the palace.\n\nDong Zhuo's tyranny\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord Dong Zhuo, who seized control of the imperial capital, Luoyang, under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu (Emperor Xian), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by Cao Cao, whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under Yuan Shao's leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of Sishui Pass and Hulao Pass, so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to Chang'an. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son L\u00fc Bu in a dispute over the maiden Diaochan as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister Wang Yun.\n\nConflict among the various warlords and nobles\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. Sun Jian found the Imperial Seal in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan were at war in the north while Sun Jian and Liu Biao were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei, who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in Xu and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as L\u00fc Bu, Yuan Shu and Zhang Xiu in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of Cao Wei in the future.\n\nSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the Battle of Xiangyang against Liu Biao. His eldest son, Sun Ce, delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising pretender, Yuan Shu, in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of Jiangdong (Wu), on which the state of Eastern Wu was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of Yu Ji, a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, Sun Quan, his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as Lu Su to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\nLiu Bei's ambition\n\nLiu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times, a Ming dynasty painting by Dai Jin (1388\u20131462).\nLiu Bei and his oath brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the Oath of the Peach Garden and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the Yellow Turban Rebellion and participating in the campaign against Dong Zhuo. After Liu Bei succeeded Tao Qian as the governor of Xu Province, he offered shelter to L\u00fc Bu, who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the Battle of Xiapi. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, Dong Cheng, and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and executed along with their families.\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in Runan, where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to Jing Province, where he found shelter under the governor, Liu Biao.\n\nBattle of Guandu\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye.\n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\nBattle of Changban\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of Xinye, where Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed Imperial Chancellor by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan.\n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan.\n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\nBattle of Red Cliffs\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\n\n\nTraditional site of the Red Cliffs.\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern Jing Province after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, Cao Ren. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, Lady Sun. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\nLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's Longzhong Plan, Liu Bei led his forces westward into Yi Province and seized control of the territories from the governor, Liu Zhang. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of Shu Han later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a vassal king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the Yangtze River, including the battles of Hefei and Ruxu, but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\nDeath of Guan Yu\n\nShadow puppets in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking Cao Ren at the Battle of Fancheng, Sun Quan sent his general L\u00fc Meng to launch a stealth invasion on Jing Province. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\nBattle of Yiling\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling by Sun Quan's general, Lu Xun. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's Stone Sentinel Maze.\n\n\nAn artist's impression of Zhuge Liang.\nLiu Bei died in Baidicheng from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, Liu Shan, proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\n\nZhuge Liang's campaigns\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general Meng Da, the Nanman and Qiang tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent Deng Zhi to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led a southern campaign against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, Meng Huo.\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on five military expeditions to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general Sima Yi.\n\nEnd of the Three Kingdoms\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after Cao Rui's death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, Sima Shi and Sima Zhao.\n\nIn Shu, Jiang Wei inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another nine campaigns against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor Liu Shan also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually conquered by Wei forces. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of Zhong Hui, a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei emperor, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the Jin dynasty to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents Zhuge Ke and Sun Chen consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, Sun Hao, turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually conquered by the Jin dynasty. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nHistorical accuracy\nSee also: List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms. Other major influences include Liu Yiqing's A New Account of the Tales of the World (Shishuo Xinyu), published in 430,[17] and the Sanguozhi Pinghua, a chronological collection of eighty fictional sketches starting with the peach garden oath and ending with Zhuge Liang's death.[18]\n\nSome 50 or 60 Yuan and early Ming plays about the Three Kingdoms are known to have existed, and their material is almost entirely fictional, based on thin threads of actual history. The novel is thus a return to greater emphasis on history, compared to these dramas.[19] The novel also shifted towards better acknowledgement of southern China's historical importance, while still portraying some prejudice against the south.[20] The Qing dynasty historian Zhang Xuecheng famously wrote that the novel was \"seven-parts fact and three-parts fiction.\"[10][21] The fictional parts are culled from different sources, including unofficial histories, folk stories, the Sanguozhi Pinghua, and also the author's own imagination. Nonetheless, the description of the social conditions and the logic that the characters use is accurate to the Three Kingdoms period, creating \"believable\" situations and characters, even if they are not historically accurate.[22]\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms, like the dramas and folk stories of its day, features Liu Bei and his associates as the protagonists; hence the depiction of the people in Shu Han was glorified. The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.[citation needed]\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\nLiterary analysis\n\nA depiction of Pang De at the Battle of Fancheng, from a Qing dynasty edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the Brewitt-Taylor translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".[21] to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of Confucian political thought and the harsh realism of Legalism, as a related theme.[21] Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.[1]\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been\", added by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang in their recension,[23][13] epitomise the tragic theme of the novel. One recent critic notes that the novel takes political and moral stands and lets the reader know which of the characters are heroes and which villains, yet the heroes are forced to make a tragic choice between equal values, not merely between good and evil. The heroes know that the end of the empire is ordained by this cosmic cycle of division and unity, yet their choices are moral, based on loyalty, not political.[24]\n\nPlaks states the novel deals with the \"cyclical theories of dynastic decline,\" and relates the \"breakdown of order\" at the end of the Han dynasty to \"the improper exercise of imperial authority, the destabilization influence of special-interest groups (eunuchs, imperial clansmen), the problem of factional and individual idealism carried to the point of civil strife-all of which eventually surface in the body of the narrative.\" He goes on to say, the \"overlapping claims to legitimacy and multiple spheres of power,\" give the novel a \"sense of epic greatness\" with its \"combination of grandeur and futility.\"[5]:385,403,495\n\nCultural impact\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

The latter presents every manner of stratagem and fraud and may tempt older readers to engage in such thinking.\nThe writing style adopted by Romance of the Three Kingdoms was part of the emergence of written vernacular during the Ming period, as part of the so-called \"Four Masterworks\" (si da qishu).[26]\n\nBuddhist aspects\nSee also: Chinese Buddhism \u00a7 Han Dynasty (206 BCE\u2013220 CE)\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms recorded stories of a Buddhist monk called Pujing (\u666e\u51c0), who was a friend of Guan Yu. Pujing made his first appearance during Guan's arduous journey of crossing five passes and slaying six generals, in which he warned Guan of an assassination plot. As the novel was written in the Ming dynasty, more than 1,000 years after the era, these stories showed that Buddhism had long been a significant ingredient of the mainstream culture and may not be historically accurate.[clarification needed] Luo Guanzhong preserved these descriptions from earlier versions of the novel to support his portrait of Guan as a faithful man of virtue. Guan has since then been respectfully addressed as \"Lord Guan\" or Guan Gong.\n\nStrategies used in battles\nCreate Something from Nothing: A strategy to make an audience believe of something\u2019s existence, when it in fact does not exist.

The first known translation was performed in 1907 by John G. Steele and consisted of a single chapter excerpt that was distributed in China to students learning English at Presbyterian missionary schools.[6] Z. Q. Parker published a 1925 translation containing four episodes from the novel including the events of the Battle of Red Cliffs, while Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang published excerpts in 1981, including chapters 43\u201350.[6] A complete and faithful translation of the novel was published in two volumes in 1925 by Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor, a long time official of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service.[6] The translation was well written, but lacked any supplementary materials such as maps or character lists that would aid Western readers; a 1959 reprint was published that included maps and an introduction by Roy Andrew Miller to assist foreign readers.[6]\n\nIn 1976, Moss Roberts published an abridged translation containing one fourth of the novel including maps and more than 40 woodblock illustrations from three Chinese versions of the novel.[6] Roberts' abridgement is reader-friendly, being written for use in colleges and to be read by the general public.[6] After decades of work, Roberts published a full translation in 1991 complete with an afterword, eleven maps, a list of characters, titles, terms, and offices, and almost 100 pages of notes from Mao Zonggang's commentaries and other scholarly sources.[6] Roberts' complete translation remains faithful to the original; it is reliable yet still matches the tone and style of the classic text.[6] Yang Ye, a professor in Chinese Literature at the UC Riverside, wrote in Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English (1998) that Roberts' translation \"supersedes Brewitt-Taylor's translation and will no doubt remain the definitive English version for many years to come\".[6] Roberts' translation was republished in 1995 by the Foreign Languages Press without the illustrations.[35]\n\nIn 2014, Tuttle published a new, three-volume translation of the novel, translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Ronald C. Iverson (ISBN 978-0804843935). According to its publisher, this translation is an unabridged \"dynamic translation\" intended to be more readable than past English translations of the novel.[36]\n\nAdaptations\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of media adaptations of Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nThe story of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms has been retold in numerous forms including television series, manga and video games.\n\nSee also\nLists of people of the Three Kingdoms, list of historical people significant to the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280)\nList of fictional people of the Three Kingdoms, list of fictional people of the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280)\nList of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms\nTimeline of the Three Kingdoms period\nMilitary history of the Three Kingdoms\nEnd of the Han dynasty\nCitations\n Roberts 1991, pg. 940\n Kim, Hyung-eun (11 July 2008). \"(Review) Historical China film lives up to expectations\".

It is set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.\n\nThe story \u2013 part historical, part legend, and part mythical \u2013 romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.[1] The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in East Asia,[2] and its literary influence in the region has been compared to that of the works of Shakespeare on English literature.[3] It is arguably the most widely read historical novel in late imperial and modern China.[4]\n\n\nContents\n1\tOverview\n1.1\tExpansion of the history\n1.2\tRecensions and standardised text\n2\tPlot\n2.1\tYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\n2.2\tDong Zhuo's tyranny\n2.3\tConflict among the various warlords and nobles\n2.4\tSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\n2.5\tLiu Bei's ambition\n2.6\tBattle of Guandu\n2.7\tBattle of Changban\n2.8\tBattle of Red Cliffs\n2.9\tLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\n2.10\tDeath of Guan Yu\n2.11\tBattle of Yiling\n2.12\tZhuge Liang's campaigns\n2.13\tEnd of the Three Kingdoms\n3\tHistorical accuracy\n4\tLiterary analysis\n5\tCultural impact\n5.1\tBuddhist aspects\n5.2\tStrategies used in battles\n6\tTranslations\n6.1\tEnglish translations\n6.2\tAdaptations\n7\tSee also\n8\tCitations\n9\tReferences and further reading\n10\tExternal links\nOverview\nAccording to Andrew H. Plaks, stories from the heroes of the Three Kingdoms was the basis of entertainment dating back to the Sui and Tang dynasty. Plaks also states, \"By Sung times several contemporary accounts inform us that there existed professional oral storytellers who specialized in the Three Kingdoms hero cycles.\" The earliest written work to combine these stories was a pinghua, Sanguozhi Pinghua (simplified Chinese: \u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u5e73\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u5e73\u8a71; pinyin: S\u0101ngu\u00f3zh\u00ec P\u00ednghu\u00e0; literally: 'Story of Records of the Three Kingdoms'), published sometime between 1321 and 1323.[5]\n\nExpansion of the history\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong,[6] a playwright who lived sometime between 1315 and 1400 (late Yuan to early Ming period) known for compiling historical plays in styles which were prevalent during the Yuan period.[7] It was first printed in 1522[7] as Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi (\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u7fa9/\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u4e49) in an edition which bore a perhaps spurious preface date 1494. The text may well have circulated before either date in handwritten manuscripts.[8]\n\nIn any case, whether an earlier or later date of composition, whether or not Luo Guanzhong was responsible, the author made use of available historical records, including the Records of the Three Kingdoms compiled by Chen Shou, which covered events from the Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184 to the unification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin dynasty in 280. The novel also includes material from Tang dynasty poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.[9]\n\nRecensions and standardised text\nSeveral versions of the expanded Sanguozhi are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi, is now held in the Shanghai Library in China, Tenri Central Library in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a recension by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang.\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty, Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to Sanguozhi Yanyi.[10] The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising Cao Cao's advisers and generals were removed.[11] Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.[12]\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been\" (\u8bdd\u8bf4\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u52bf\uff0e\u5206\u4e45\u5fc5\u5408\uff0c\u5408\u4e45\u5fc5\u5206),[13] long understood to be Luo's introduction and cyclical philosophy, were actually added by the Maos in their substantially revised edition of 1679.[14] None of the earlier editions contained this phrase. In addition, Mao also added Yang Shen's The Immortals by the River as the famous introductory poem (which began with \"The gushing waters of the Yangzi River pour and disappear into the East\") (\u6eda\u6eda\u957f\u6c5f\u4e1c\u901d\u6c34) to the novel.[15] The earlier editions, moreover, spend less time on the process of division, which they found painful, and far more time on the process of reunification and the struggles of the heroes who sacrificed for it.[16]\n\nPlot\nOne of the greatest achievements of Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the extreme complexity of its stories and characters. The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n\nThree Heroes of Three Kingdoms, silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\nIn the final years of the Eastern Han dynasty, treacherous eunuchs and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of Emperor Ling, the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out under the leadership of Zhang Jiao.\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general He Jin. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young Emperor Shao on the throne and took control of the central government. The Ten Attendants, a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the Prince of Chenliu, disappeared from the palace.\n\nDong Zhuo's tyranny\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord Dong Zhuo, who seized control of the imperial capital, Luoyang, under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu (Emperor Xian), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by Cao Cao, whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under Yuan Shao's leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of Sishui Pass and Hulao Pass, so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to Chang'an. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son L\u00fc Bu in a dispute over the maiden Diaochan as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister Wang Yun.\n\nConflict among the various warlords and nobles\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. Sun Jian found the Imperial Seal in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan were at war in the north while Sun Jian and Liu Biao were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei, who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in Xu and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as L\u00fc Bu, Yuan Shu and Zhang Xiu in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of Cao Wei in the future.\n\nSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the Battle of Xiangyang against Liu Biao. His eldest son, Sun Ce, delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising pretender, Yuan Shu, in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of Jiangdong (Wu), on which the state of Eastern Wu was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of Yu Ji, a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, Sun Quan, his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as Lu Su to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\nLiu Bei's ambition\n\nLiu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times, a Ming dynasty painting by Dai Jin (1388\u20131462).\nLiu Bei and his oath brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the Oath of the Peach Garden and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the Yellow Turban Rebellion and participating in the campaign against Dong Zhuo. After Liu Bei succeeded Tao Qian as the governor of Xu Province, he offered shelter to L\u00fc Bu, who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the Battle of Xiapi. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, Dong Cheng, and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and executed along with their families.\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in Runan, where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to Jing Province, where he found shelter under the governor, Liu Biao.\n\nBattle of Guandu\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye.\n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\nBattle of Changban\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of Xinye, where Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed Imperial Chancellor by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan.\n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan.\n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\nBattle of Red Cliffs\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\n\n\nTraditional site of the Red Cliffs.\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern Jing Province after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, Cao Ren. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, Lady Sun. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\nLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's Longzhong Plan, Liu Bei led his forces westward into Yi Province and seized control of the territories from the governor, Liu Zhang. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of Shu Han later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a vassal king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the Yangtze River, including the battles of Hefei and Ruxu, but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\nDeath of Guan Yu\n\nShadow puppets in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking Cao Ren at the Battle of Fancheng, Sun Quan sent his general L\u00fc Meng to launch a stealth invasion on Jing Province. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\nBattle of Yiling\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling by Sun Quan's general, Lu Xun. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's Stone Sentinel Maze.\n\n\nAn artist's impression of Zhuge Liang.\nLiu Bei died in Baidicheng from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, Liu Shan, proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\n\nZhuge Liang's campaigns\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general Meng Da, the Nanman and Qiang tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent Deng Zhi to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led a southern campaign against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, Meng Huo.\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on five military expeditions to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general Sima Yi.\n\nEnd of the Three Kingdoms\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after Cao Rui's death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, Sima Shi and Sima Zhao.\n\nIn Shu, Jiang Wei inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another nine campaigns against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor Liu Shan also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually conquered by Wei forces. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of Zhong Hui, a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei emperor, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the Jin dynasty to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents Zhuge Ke and Sun Chen consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, Sun Hao, turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually conquered by the Jin dynasty. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nHistorical accuracy\nSee also: List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms. Other major influences include Liu Yiqing's A New Account of the Tales of the World (Shishuo Xinyu), published in 430,[17] and the Sanguozhi Pinghua, a chronological collection of eighty fictional sketches starting with the peach garden oath and ending with Zhuge Liang's death.[18]\n\nSome 50 or 60 Yuan and early Ming plays about the Three Kingdoms are known to have existed, and their material is almost entirely fictional, based on thin threads of actual history. The novel is thus a return to greater emphasis on history, compared to these dramas.[19] The novel also shifted towards better acknowledgement of southern China's historical importance, while still portraying some prejudice against the south.[20] The Qing dynasty historian Zhang Xuecheng famously wrote that the novel was \"seven-parts fact and three-parts fiction.\"[10][21] The fictional parts are culled from different sources, including unofficial histories, folk stories, the Sanguozhi Pinghua, and also the author's own imagination. Nonetheless, the description of the social conditions and the logic that the characters use is accurate to the Three Kingdoms period, creating \"believable\" situations and characters, even if they are not historically accurate.[22]\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms, like the dramas and folk stories of its day, features Liu Bei and his associates as the protagonists; hence the depiction of the people in Shu Han was glorified. The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.[citation needed]\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\nLiterary analysis\n\nA depiction of Pang De at the Battle of Fancheng, from a Qing dynasty edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the Brewitt-Taylor translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".[21] to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of Confucian political thought and the harsh realism of Legalism, as a related theme.[21] Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.[1]\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been\", added by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang in their recension,[23][13] epitomise the tragic theme of the novel. One recent critic notes that the novel takes political and moral stands and lets the reader know which of the characters are heroes and which villains, yet the heroes are forced to make a tragic choice between equal values, not merely between good and evil. The heroes know that the end of the empire is ordained by this cosmic cycle of division and unity, yet their choices are moral, based on loyalty, not political.[24]\n\nPlaks states the novel deals with the \"cyclical theories of dynastic decline,\" and relates the \"breakdown of order\" at the end of the Han dynasty to \"the improper exercise of imperial authority, the destabilization influence of special-interest groups (eunuchs, imperial clansmen), the problem of factional and individual idealism carried to the point of civil strife-all of which eventually surface in the body of the narrative.\" He goes on to say, the \"overlapping claims to legitimacy and multiple spheres of power,\" give the novel a \"sense of epic greatness\" with its \"combination of grandeur and futility.\"[5]:385,403,495\n\nCultural impact\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

Pujing made his first appearance during Guan's arduous journey of crossing five passes and slaying six generals, in which he warned Guan of an assassination plot. As the novel was written in the Ming dynasty, more than 1,000 years after the era, these stories showed that Buddhism had long been a significant ingredient of the mainstream culture and may not be historically accurate.[clarification needed] Luo Guanzhong preserved these descriptions from earlier versions of the novel to support his portrait of Guan as a faithful man of virtue. Guan has since then been respectfully addressed as \"Lord Guan\" or Guan Gong.\n\nStrategies used in battles\nCreate Something from Nothing: A strategy to make an audience believe of something\u2019s existence, when it in fact does not exist.

The first known translation was performed in 1907 by John G. Steele and consisted of a single chapter excerpt that was distributed in China to students learning English at Presbyterian missionary schools.[6] Z. Q. Parker published a 1925 translation containing four episodes from the novel including the events of the Battle of Red Cliffs, while Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang published excerpts in 1981, including chapters 43\u201350.[6] A complete and faithful translation of the novel was published in two volumes in 1925 by Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor, a long time official of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service.[6] The translation was well written, but lacked any supplementary materials such as maps or character lists that would aid Western readers; a 1959 reprint was published that included maps and an introduction by Roy Andrew Miller to assist foreign readers.[6]\n\nIn 1976, Moss Roberts published an abridged translation containing one fourth of the novel including maps and more than 40 woodblock illustrations from three Chinese versions of the novel.[6] Roberts' abridgement is reader-friendly, being written for use in colleges and to be read by the general public.[6] After decades of work, Roberts published a full translation in 1991 complete with an afterword, eleven maps, a list of characters, titles, terms, and offices, and almost 100 pages of notes from Mao Zonggang's commentaries and other scholarly sources.[6] Roberts' complete translation remains faithful to the original; it is reliable yet still matches the tone and style of the classic text.[6] Yang Ye, a professor in Chinese Literature at the UC Riverside, wrote in Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English (1998) that Roberts' translation \"supersedes Brewitt-Taylor's translation and will no doubt remain the definitive English version for many years to come\".[6] Roberts' translation was republished in 1995 by the Foreign Languages Press without the illustrations.[35]\n\nIn 2014, Tuttle published a new, three-volume translation of the novel, translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Ronald C.

It is set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.\n\nThe story \u2013 part historical, part legend, and part mythical \u2013 romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.[1] The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in East Asia,[2] and its literary influence in the region has been compared to that of the works of Shakespeare on English literature.[3] It is arguably the most widely read historical novel in late imperial and modern China.[4]\n\n\nContents\n1\tOverview\n1.1\tExpansion of the history\n1.2\tRecensions and standardised text\n2\tPlot\n2.1\tYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\n2.2\tDong Zhuo's tyranny\n2.3\tConflict among the various warlords and nobles\n2.4\tSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\n2.5\tLiu Bei's ambition\n2.6\tBattle of Guandu\n2.7\tBattle of Changban\n2.8\tBattle of Red Cliffs\n2.9\tLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\n2.10\tDeath of Guan Yu\n2.11\tBattle of Yiling\n2.12\tZhuge Liang's campaigns\n2.13\tEnd of the Three Kingdoms\n3\tHistorical accuracy\n4\tLiterary analysis\n5\tCultural impact\n5.1\tBuddhist aspects\n5.2\tStrategies used in battles\n6\tTranslations\n6.1\tEnglish translations\n6.2\tAdaptations\n7\tSee also\n8\tCitations\n9\tReferences and further reading\n10\tExternal links\nOverview\nAccording to Andrew H. Plaks, stories from the heroes of the Three Kingdoms was the basis of entertainment dating back to the Sui and Tang dynasty. Plaks also states, \"By Sung times several contemporary accounts inform us that there existed professional oral storytellers who specialized in the Three Kingdoms hero cycles.\" The earliest written work to combine these stories was a pinghua, Sanguozhi Pinghua (simplified Chinese: \u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u5e73\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u5e73\u8a71; pinyin: S\u0101ngu\u00f3zh\u00ec P\u00ednghu\u00e0; literally: 'Story of Records of the Three Kingdoms'), published sometime between 1321 and 1323.[5]\n\nExpansion of the history\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong,[6] a playwright who lived sometime between 1315 and 1400 (late Yuan to early Ming period) known for compiling historical plays in styles which were prevalent during the Yuan period.[7] It was first printed in 1522[7] as Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi (\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u7fa9/\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u901a\u4fd7\u6f14\u4e49) in an edition which bore a perhaps spurious preface date 1494. The text may well have circulated before either date in handwritten manuscripts.[8]\n\nIn any case, whether an earlier or later date of composition, whether or not Luo Guanzhong was responsible, the author made use of available historical records, including the Records of the Three Kingdoms compiled by Chen Shou, which covered events from the Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184 to the unification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin dynasty in 280. The novel also includes material from Tang dynasty poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.[9]\n\nRecensions and standardised text\nSeveral versions of the expanded Sanguozhi are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi, is now held in the Shanghai Library in China, Tenri Central Library in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a recension by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang.\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty, Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to Sanguozhi Yanyi.[10] The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising Cao Cao's advisers and generals were removed.[11] Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.[12]\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been\" (\u8bdd\u8bf4\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u52bf\uff0e\u5206\u4e45\u5fc5\u5408\uff0c\u5408\u4e45\u5fc5\u5206),[13] long understood to be Luo's introduction and cyclical philosophy, were actually added by the Maos in their substantially revised edition of 1679.[14] None of the earlier editions contained this phrase. In addition, Mao also added Yang Shen's The Immortals by the River as the famous introductory poem (which began with \"The gushing waters of the Yangzi River pour and disappear into the East\") (\u6eda\u6eda\u957f\u6c5f\u4e1c\u901d\u6c34) to the novel.[15] The earlier editions, moreover, spend less time on the process of division, which they found painful, and far more time on the process of reunification and the struggles of the heroes who sacrificed for it.[16]\n\nPlot\nOne of the greatest achievements of Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the extreme complexity of its stories and characters. The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n\nThree Heroes of Three Kingdoms, silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nYellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants\nIn the final years of the Eastern Han dynasty, treacherous eunuchs and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of Emperor Ling, the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out under the leadership of Zhang Jiao.\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general He Jin. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young Emperor Shao on the throne and took control of the central government. The Ten Attendants, a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the Prince of Chenliu, disappeared from the palace.\n\nDong Zhuo's tyranny\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord Dong Zhuo, who seized control of the imperial capital, Luoyang, under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu (Emperor Xian), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by Cao Cao, whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under Yuan Shao's leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of Sishui Pass and Hulao Pass, so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to Chang'an. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son L\u00fc Bu in a dispute over the maiden Diaochan as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister Wang Yun.\n\nConflict among the various warlords and nobles\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. Sun Jian found the Imperial Seal in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan were at war in the north while Sun Jian and Liu Biao were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei, who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in Xu and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as L\u00fc Bu, Yuan Shu and Zhang Xiu in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of Cao Wei in the future.\n\nSun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the Battle of Xiangyang against Liu Biao. His eldest son, Sun Ce, delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising pretender, Yuan Shu, in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of Jiangdong (Wu), on which the state of Eastern Wu was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of Yu Ji, a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, Sun Quan, his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as Lu Su to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\nLiu Bei's ambition\n\nLiu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times, a Ming dynasty painting by Dai Jin (1388\u20131462).\nLiu Bei and his oath brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the Oath of the Peach Garden and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the Yellow Turban Rebellion and participating in the campaign against Dong Zhuo. After Liu Bei succeeded Tao Qian as the governor of Xu Province, he offered shelter to L\u00fc Bu, who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the Battle of Xiapi. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, Dong Cheng, and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and executed along with their families.\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in Runan, where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to Jing Province, where he found shelter under the governor, Liu Biao.\n\nBattle of Guandu\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye.\n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\nBattle of Changban\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of Xinye, where Liu Bei visited Zhuge Liang thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed Imperial Chancellor by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan.\n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan.\n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\nBattle of Red Cliffs\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\n\n\nTraditional site of the Red Cliffs.\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern Jing Province after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, Cao Ren. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, Lady Sun. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\nLiu Bei's takeover of Yi Province\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's Longzhong Plan, Liu Bei led his forces westward into Yi Province and seized control of the territories from the governor, Liu Zhang. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of Shu Han later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a vassal king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the Yangtze River, including the battles of Hefei and Ruxu, but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\nDeath of Guan Yu\n\nShadow puppets in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking Cao Ren at the Battle of Fancheng, Sun Quan sent his general L\u00fc Meng to launch a stealth invasion on Jing Province. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\nBattle of Yiling\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling by Sun Quan's general, Lu Xun. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's Stone Sentinel Maze.\n\n\nAn artist's impression of Zhuge Liang.\nLiu Bei died in Baidicheng from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, Liu Shan, proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\n\nZhuge Liang's campaigns\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general Meng Da, the Nanman and Qiang tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent Deng Zhi to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led a southern campaign against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, Meng Huo.\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on five military expeditions to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general Sima Yi.\n\nEnd of the Three Kingdoms\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after Cao Rui's death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, Sima Shi and Sima Zhao.\n\nIn Shu, Jiang Wei inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another nine campaigns against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor Liu Shan also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually conquered by Wei forces. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of Zhong Hui, a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei emperor, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the Jin dynasty to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents Zhuge Ke and Sun Chen consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, Sun Hao, turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually conquered by the Jin dynasty. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nHistorical accuracy\nSee also: List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms. Other major influences include Liu Yiqing's A New Account of the Tales of the World (Shishuo Xinyu), published in 430,[17] and the Sanguozhi Pinghua, a chronological collection of eighty fictional sketches starting with the peach garden oath and ending with Zhuge Liang's death.[18]\n\nSome 50 or 60 Yuan and early Ming plays about the Three Kingdoms are known to have existed, and their material is almost entirely fictional, based on thin threads of actual history. The novel is thus a return to greater emphasis on history, compared to these dramas.[19] The novel also shifted towards better acknowledgement of southern China's historical importance, while still portraying some prejudice against the south.[20] The Qing dynasty historian Zhang Xuecheng famously wrote that the novel was \"seven-parts fact and three-parts fiction.\"[10][21] The fictional parts are culled from different sources, including unofficial histories, folk stories, the Sanguozhi Pinghua, and also the author's own imagination. Nonetheless, the description of the social conditions and the logic that the characters use is accurate to the Three Kingdoms period, creating \"believable\" situations and characters, even if they are not historically accurate.[22]\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms, like the dramas and folk stories of its day, features Liu Bei and his associates as the protagonists; hence the depiction of the people in Shu Han was glorified. The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.[citation needed]\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\nLiterary analysis\n\nA depiction of Pang De at the Battle of Fancheng, from a Qing dynasty edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the Brewitt-Taylor translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".[21] to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of Confucian political thought and the harsh realism of Legalism, as a related theme.[21] Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.[1]\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

Pujing made his first appearance during Guan's arduous journey of crossing five passes and slaying six generals, in which he warned Guan of an assassination plot. As the novel was written in the Ming dynasty, more than 1,000 years after the era, these stories showed that Buddhism had long been a significant ingredient of the mainstream culture and may not be historically accurate.[clarification needed] Luo Guanzhong preserved these descriptions from earlier versions of the novel to support his portrait of Guan as a faithful man of virtue. Guan has since then been respectfully addressed as \"Lord Guan\" or Guan Gong.\n\nStrategies used in battles\nCreate Something from Nothing: A strategy to make an audience believe of something\u2019s existence, when it in fact does not exist.

This trick can work in three ways: firstly, the ruler can become so entranced with the feminine allure that he neglects all else. Secondly, the men will start competing for the females\u2019 attention, which will cause friction and rifts, and hinders cooperation and eradicates morale. And lastly, other women motivated by jealousy will begin to plot, only worsening the entire situation. Also known as the \u201cHoney Trap\u201d. (Ch. 55\u201356)\n\nEmpty City: When the enemy is superior in numbers and you are expecting to be attacked at any moment, drop all pretenses of seeming like you\u2019re preparing something militarily and act calm, so the enemy will think twice and will think you\u2019re setting a trap or an ambush. It is best used sparingly, and only if one has the military aptitude to do so. It\u2019s also best used if one\u2019s enemy is an over-thinker.

The first known translation was performed in 1907 by John G. Steele and consisted of a single chapter excerpt that was distributed in China to students learning English at Presbyterian missionary schools.[6] Z. Q. Parker published a 1925 translation containing four episodes from the novel including the events of the Battle of Red Cliffs, while Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang published excerpts in 1981, including chapters 43\u201350.[6] A complete and faithful translation of the novel was published in two volumes in 1925 by Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor, a long time official of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service.[6] The translation was well written, but lacked any supplementary materials such as maps or character lists that would aid Western readers; a 1959 reprint was published that included maps and an introduction by Roy Andrew Miller to assist foreign readers.[6]\n\nIn 1976, Moss Roberts published an abridged translation containing one fourth of the novel including maps and more than 40 woodblock illustrations from three Chinese versions of the novel.[6] Roberts' abridgement is reader-friendly, being written for use in colleges and to be read by the general public.[6] After decades of work, Roberts published a full translation in 1991 complete with an afterword, eleven maps, a list of characters, titles, terms, and offices, and almost 100 pages of notes from Mao Zonggang's commentaries and other scholarly sources.[6] Roberts' complete translation remains faithful to the original; it is reliable yet still matches the tone and style of the classic text.[6] Yang Ye, a professor in Chinese Literature at the UC Riverside, wrote in Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English (1998) that Roberts' translation \"supersedes Brewitt-Taylor's translation and will no doubt remain the definitive English version for many years to come\".[6] Roberts' translation was republished in 1995 by the Foreign Languages Press without the illustrations.[35]\n\nIn 2014, Tuttle published a new, three-volume translation of the novel, translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Ronald C. Iverson (ISBN 978-0804843935). According to its publisher, this translation is an unabridged \"dynamic translation\" intended to be more readable than past English translations of the novel.[36]\n\nAdaptations\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of media adaptations of Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nThe story of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms has been retold in numerous forms including television series, manga and video games.\n\nSee also\nLists of people of the Three Kingdoms, list of historical people significant to the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280)\nList of fictional people of the Three Kingdoms, list of fictional people of the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280)\nList of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms\nTimeline of the Three Kingdoms period\nMilitary history of the Three Kingdoms\nEnd of the Han dynasty\nCitations\n Roberts 1991, pg. 940\n Kim, Hyung-eun (11 July 2008). \"(Review) Historical China film lives up to expectations\".

However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent [[Deng Zhi]] to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led [[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign|a southern campaign]] against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, [[Meng Huo]].\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|five military expeditions]] to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general [[Sima Yi]].\n\n===End of the Three Kingdoms===\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after [[Cao Rui]]'s death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, [[Sima Shi]] and [[Sima Zhao]].\n\nIn Shu, [[Jiang Wei]] inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another [[Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions|nine campaigns]] against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor [[Liu Shan]] also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|conquered by Wei forces]]. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of [[Zhong Hui]], a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]], forced the last Wei emperor, [[Cao Huan]], to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents [[Zhuge Ke]] and [[Sun Chen]] consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, [[Sun Hao]], turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquered by the Jin dynasty]]. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n{{See also|List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}\n\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''. Other major influences include Liu Yiqing's ''[[A New Account of the Tales of the World]]'' (''Shishuo Xinyu''), published in 430,<ref name=\"roberts981\">Roberts 1991, pg. 981</ref> and the ''Sanguozhi Pinghua'', a chronological collection of eighty fictional sketches starting with the peach garden oath and ending with Zhuge Liang's death.<ref name=\"roberts954\">Roberts 1991, pg. 954</ref>\n\nSome 50 or 60 Yuan and early Ming plays about the Three Kingdoms are known to have existed, and their material is almost entirely fictional, based on thin threads of actual history. The novel is thus a return to greater emphasis on history, compared to these dramas.<ref name=\"roberts958 9\">Roberts 1991, pp. 958\u20139</ref> The novel also shifted towards better acknowledgement of southern China's historical importance, while still portraying some prejudice against the south.<ref name=\"roberts959 83\">Roberts 1991, pp. 959, 983</ref> The Qing dynasty historian [[Zhang Xuecheng]] famously wrote that the novel was \"seven-parts fact and three-parts fiction.\"<ref name=\"roberts980\">Roberts 1991, pg. 980</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal| last = Moody Jr.| first = Peter R.| date = April 1975| title = The Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Popular Chinese Thought| journal = The Review of Politics| volume = 37| issue = 2| pages = 178\u2013179| doi = 10.1017/s0034670500023238| pmid = }}</ref> The fictional parts are culled from different sources, including unofficial histories, folk stories, the ''Sanguozhi Pinghua'', and also the author's own imagination. Nonetheless, the description of the social conditions and the logic that the characters use is accurate to the Three Kingdoms period, creating \"believable\" situations and characters, even if they are not historically accurate.<ref name=\"guan14\">Luo 2006, pg. 14</ref>\n\n''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', like the dramas and folk stories of its day, features Liu Bei and his associates as the protagonists; hence the depiction of the people in Shu Han was glorified. The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\n==Literary analysis==\n[[File:Pang De Portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|A depiction of [[Pang De]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], from a [[Qing dynasty]] edition of the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.]]\n\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the [[Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor|Brewitt-Taylor]] translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".<ref name=\":1\" /> to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] political thought and the harsh realism of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], as a related theme.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.<ref name=\"roberts940\" />\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

Pujing made his first appearance during Guan's arduous journey of crossing five passes and slaying six generals, in which he warned Guan of an assassination plot. As the novel was written in the [[Ming dynasty]], more than 1,000 years after the era, these stories showed that Buddhism had long been a significant ingredient of the mainstream culture and may not be historically accurate.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} [[Luo Guanzhong]] preserved these descriptions from earlier versions of the novel to support his portrait of Guan as a faithful man of virtue.

On the flip side, it can be used to convince others that nothing exists, when something does exist. (Ch. 36)\n\n'''Beauty Trap''': Send the enemy beautiful women to cause disorder at his site. This trick can work in three ways: firstly, the ruler can become so entranced with the feminine allure that he neglects all else. Secondly, the men will start competing for the females\u2019 attention, which will cause friction and rifts, and hinders cooperation and eradicates morale. And lastly, other women motivated by jealousy will begin to plot, only worsening the entire situation. Also known as the \u201cHoney Trap\u201d. (Ch. 55\u201356)\n\n'''[[Empty Fort Strategy|Empty City]]''': When the enemy is superior in numbers and you are expecting to be attacked at any moment, drop all pretenses of seeming like you\u2019re preparing something militarily and act calm, so the enemy will think twice and will think you\u2019re setting a trap or an ambush. It is best used sparingly, and only if one has the military aptitude to do so. It\u2019s also best used if one\u2019s enemy is an over-thinker.

Plaks also states, \"By [[Sung dynasty|Sung times]] several contemporary accounts inform us that there existed professional [[Oral storytelling|oral storytellers]] who specialized in the Three Kingdoms hero cycles.\"  The earliest written work to combine these stories was a [[Pinghua (storytelling)|pinghua]], ''Sanguozhi Pinghua'' ({{zh|t=\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u5e73\u8a71|s=\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u5e73\u8bdd|p=S\u0101ngu\u00f3zh\u00ec P\u00ednghu\u00e0|l=Story of ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''}}), published sometime between 1321 and 1323.<ref name=\"Plaks\">{{cite book |last1=Plaks |first1=Andrew |title=The Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel: Ssu ta ch'i-shu |date=1987 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=9780691628202 |pages=368\u2013369}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion of the history===\n''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is traditionally attributed to [[Luo Guanzhong]],<ref name=\"taylor1998\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1uXah12nHgC&pg=PA1221|accessdate=2011-09-22|year=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=1-884964-36-2|pages=1221\u20131222}}</ref> a playwright who lived sometime between 1315 and 1400 (late Yuan to early Ming period) known for compiling historical plays in styles which were prevalent during the Yuan period.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book| title = Romance of the Three Kingdoms| last = Lo| first = Kuan-chung| authorlink =Luo Guanzhong| publisher = Tuttle| others = C.H.

The novel also includes material from [[Tang dynasty]] poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.<ref>Roberts, pp. 946\u201353.</ref>\n\n===Recensions and standardised text===\nSeveral versions of the expanded ''Sanguozhi'' are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the ''Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi'', is now held in the [[Shanghai Library]] in China, [[Tenri Central Library]] in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a [[recension]] by Mao Lun and his son [[Mao Zonggang]].\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in the [[Qing dynasty]], Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to ''Sanguozhi Yanyi''.<ref name=\"roberts980\" /> The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising [[Cao Cao]]'s advisers and generals were removed.<ref name=\"roberts965\">Roberts 1991, pg. 965</ref> Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.<ref name=\"roberts967 71\">Roberts 1991, pp. 967\u2013971</ref>\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"[[Tianxia|The empire]], long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

In addition, Mao also added [[Yang Shen]]'s ''[http://www.vincentpoon.com/the-immortals-by-the-river-----------------.html The Immortals by the River]'' as the famous introductory poem (which began with \"The gushing waters of the Yangzi River pour and disappear into the East\") (\u6eda\u6eda\u957f\u6c5f\u4e1c\u901d\u6c34) to the novel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vincentpoon.com/the-immortals-by-the-river-----------------.html|title=The Immortals by the River (\u694a\u614e \u81e8\u6c5f\u4ed9) \u6eda\u6eda\u957f\u6c5f\u4e1c\u901d\u6c34|website=Vincent's Calligraphy|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref> The earlier editions, moreover, spend less time on the process of division, which they found painful, and far more time on the process of reunification and the struggles of the heroes who sacrificed for it.<ref>Bojun Shen, translated by Kimberly Basio, \"Studies of Three Kingdoms in the New Century,\" in Besio and Tong, eds., ''Three Kingdoms and Chinese Culture'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=yhogHgTrzyEC&q=The+empire+long+divided+must+unite#v=snippet&q=The%20empire%20long%20divided%20must%20unite&f=false p. 154]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOne of the greatest achievements of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is the extreme complexity of its stories and characters. The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n[[File:Three Brothers (Bei, Yu, Fei).jpg|thumb|200px|''Three Heroes of Three Kingdoms'', silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.]]\n\n===Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants===\nIn the [[End of the Han dynasty|final years]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]], treacherous [[eunuch]]s and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out under the leadership of [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]].\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general [[He Jin]]. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young [[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]] on the throne and took control of the central government. The [[Ten Attendants]], a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the [[Emperor Xian of Han|Prince of Chenliu]], disappeared from the palace.\n\n===Dong Zhuo's tyranny===\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]], who seized control of the imperial capital, [[Luoyang]], under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu ([[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]]), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by [[Cao Cao]], whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under [[Yuan Shao]]'s leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of [[Battle of Sishui Pass|Sishui Pass]] and [[Battle of Hulao Pass|Hulao Pass]], so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to [[Chang'an]]. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son [[L\u00fc Bu]] in a dispute over the maiden [[Diaochan]] as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]].\n\n===Conflict among the various warlords and nobles===\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. [[Sun Jian]] found the [[Imperial Seal of China|Imperial Seal]] in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and [[Gongsun Zan]] were at war in the north while Sun Jian and [[Liu Biao]] were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and [[Liu Bei]], who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in [[Xuchang|Xu]] and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as [[L\u00fc Bu]], [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the [[Battle of Guandu]]. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of [[Cao Wei]] in the future.\n\n===Sun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong===\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the [[Battle of Xiangyang (191)|Battle of Xiangyang]] against Liu Biao. His eldest son, [[Sun Ce]], delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising [[pretender]], [[Yuan Shu]], in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] ([[Wu (region)|Wu]]), on which the state of [[Eastern Wu]] was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of [[Gan Ji|Yu Ji]], a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, [[Sun Quan]], his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from [[Zhou Yu]], [[Zhang Zhao]] and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as [[Lu Su]] to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\n===Liu Bei's ambition===\n[[File:Dai Jin-Looking Three Times at the Thatched Hut.jpg|thumb|200px|Liu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from ''Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times'', a [[Ming dynasty]] painting by [[Dai Jin]] (1388\u20131462).]]\n\n[[Liu Bei]] and his oath brothers [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]] swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and participating in the [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. After Liu Bei succeeded [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] as the governor of [[Xu Province]], he offered shelter to [[L\u00fc Bu]], who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the [[Battle of Xiapi]]. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and [[Nine familial exterminations|executed along with their families]].\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from [[Che Zhou]], the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in [[Runan Commandery|Runan]], where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to [[Jing Province]], where he found shelter under the governor, [[Liu Biao]].\n\n===Battle of Guandu===\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye. \n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\n===Battle of Changban===\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of [[Xinye County|Xinye]], where Liu Bei visited [[Zhuge Liang]] thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed [[Chancellor (China)|Imperial Chancellor]] by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan. \n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan. \n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\n===Battle of Red Cliffs===\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n\n[[File:Chibi.jpg|thumb|200px|Traditional site of the Red Cliffs.]]\n\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern [[Jing Province]] after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, [[Cao Ren]]. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, [[Lady Sun]]. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\n===Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province===\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's [[Longzhong Plan]], Liu Bei led his forces westward into [[Yi Province]] and [[Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province|seized control of the territories]] from the governor, [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]]. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of [[Shu Han]] later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the [[Hanzhong Campaign]] and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a [[vassal]] king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the [[Yangtze River]], including the battles of [[Battle of Xiaoyao Ford|Hefei]] and [[Battle of Ruxukou (217)|Ruxu]], but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\n===Death of Guan Yu===\n[[File:Chengdu 2007 360.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shadow puppet]]s in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]].]]\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking [[Cao Ren]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], Sun Quan sent his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] to launch [[L\u00fc Meng's invasion of Jing Province|a stealth invasion on Jing Province]]. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, [[Cao Pi]], forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of [[Cao Wei]] to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of [[Shu Han]] as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\n===Battle of Yiling===\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the [[Battle of Xiaoting|Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling]] by Sun Quan's general, [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]]. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's [[Stone Sentinel Maze]].\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's impression of [[Zhuge Liang]].]]\n\nLiu Bei died in [[Baidicheng]] from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, [[Liu Shan]], proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\n\n===Zhuge Liang's campaigns===\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general [[Meng Da]], the [[Nanman]] and [[Qiang people|Qiang]] tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent [[Deng Zhi]] to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led [[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign|a southern campaign]] against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, [[Meng Huo]].\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|five military expeditions]] to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general [[Sima Yi]].\n\n===End of the Three Kingdoms===\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after [[Cao Rui]]'s death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, [[Sima Shi]] and [[Sima Zhao]].\n\nIn Shu, [[Jiang Wei]] inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another [[Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions|nine campaigns]] against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor [[Liu Shan]] also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|conquered by Wei forces]]. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of [[Zhong Hui]], a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]], forced the last Wei emperor, [[Cao Huan]], to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents [[Zhuge Ke]] and [[Sun Chen]] consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, [[Sun Hao]], turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquered by the Jin dynasty]]. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n{{See also|List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}\n\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''. Other major influences include Liu Yiqing's ''[[A New Account of the Tales of the World]]'' (''Shishuo Xinyu''), published in 430,<ref name=\"roberts981\">Roberts 1991, pg. 981</ref> and the ''Sanguozhi Pinghua'', a chronological collection of eighty fictional sketches starting with the peach garden oath and ending with Zhuge Liang's death.<ref name=\"roberts954\">Roberts 1991, pg. 954</ref>\n\nSome 50 or 60 Yuan and early Ming plays about the Three Kingdoms are known to have existed, and their material is almost entirely fictional, based on thin threads of actual history.

The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\n==Literary analysis==\n[[File:Pang De Portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|A depiction of [[Pang De]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], from a [[Qing dynasty]] edition of the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.]]\n\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the [[Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor|Brewitt-Taylor]] translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".<ref name=\":1\" /> to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] political thought and the harsh realism of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], as a related theme.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.<ref name=\"roberts940\" />\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

One recent critic notes that the novel takes political and moral stands and lets the reader know which of the characters are heroes and which villains, yet the heroes are forced to make a tragic choice between equal values, not merely between good and evil.

Pujing made his first appearance during Guan's arduous journey of crossing five passes and slaying six generals, in which he warned Guan of an assassination plot. As the novel was written in the [[Ming dynasty]], more than 1,000 years after the era, these stories showed that Buddhism had long been a significant ingredient of the mainstream culture and may not be historically accurate.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} [[Luo Guanzhong]] preserved these descriptions from earlier versions of the novel to support his portrait of Guan as a faithful man of virtue.

On the flip side, it can be used to convince others that nothing exists, when something does exist. (Ch. 36)\n\n'''Beauty Trap''': Send the enemy beautiful women to cause disorder at his site. This trick can work in three ways: firstly, the ruler can become so entranced with the feminine allure that he neglects all else. Secondly, the men will start competing for the females\u2019 attention, which will cause friction and rifts, and hinders cooperation and eradicates morale. And lastly, other women motivated by jealousy will begin to plot, only worsening the entire situation. Also known as the \u201cHoney Trap\u201d. (Ch. 55\u201356)\n\n'''[[Empty Fort Strategy|Empty City]]''': When the enemy is superior in numbers and you are expecting to be attacked at any moment, drop all pretenses of seeming like you\u2019re preparing something militarily and act calm, so the enemy will think twice and will think you\u2019re setting a trap or an ambush. It is best used sparingly, and only if one has the military aptitude to do so. It\u2019s also best used if one\u2019s enemy is an over-thinker.
