On 26 October 1385 he was appointed joint [[Governor of Carlisle]] with [[Thomas de Clifford, 6th Baron de Clifford|Sir Thomas Clifford]], and on 27 March 1386 was appointed, together with Clifford, joint [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden]] of the [[Scottish Marches|West March]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=544}}; {{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=275}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|p=506}}.</ref>\n\nNeville inherited the title at the age of 24 after his father's death on 17 October 1388, and was summoned to Parliament from 6 December 1389 to 30 November 1396 by writs directed to ''Radulpho de Nevyll de Raby''. On 25 October 1388 he was appointed, with others, to survey the fortifications on the Scottish border, and on 24 May 1389 was made keeper for life of the royal forests north of the [[River Trent|Trent]].

His first wife, Margaret Stafford, had died on 9 June 1396, and Neville's second marriage to Joan Beaufort before 29 November 1396 made him the son-in-law of King Richard's uncle, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]. Thus, when King Richard banished John of Gaunt's eldest son and heir, Henry Bolingbroke, on 16 September 1398, and confiscated Bolingbroke's estates after John of Gaunt's death on 3 February 1399, Westmorland was moved to support his brother-in-law.  Bolingbroke landed with a small force at [[Ravenspur]] in July 1399. Westmorland and the [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] were in the deputation at the [[Tower of London|Tower]] which received King Richard's abdication, and Westmorland bore the small sceptre called the \"virge\" at Bolingbroke's coronation as [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] on 13 October 1399.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|pp=545\u20136}}; {{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=276}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=246}}; {{Harvnb|Tuck|2009}}.</ref>\n\nFor his support of the new King, Westmorland was rewarded with a lifetime appointment as [[Earl Marshal]] on 30 September 1399 (although he resigned the office in 1412), a lifetime grant of the [[Honour of Richmond|honour]] of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] on 20 October (although the grant was not accompanied by a grant of the title [[Earl of Richmond]]), and several wardships.<ref name=\"Cokayne 1959 546\">{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=546}}; {{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=276}}; {{Harvnb|Tuck|2009}}.</ref> Before 4 December he was appointed to the King's council.  In March 1401, Westmorland was one of the commissioners who conducted negotiations for a marriage between the King's eldest daughter, [[Blanche of England]], and [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis]], son of [[Rupert, King of Germany|Rupert, King of the Romans]], and in 1403 was made a [[Knight of the Garter]], taking the place left vacant by the death of [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York]].<ref name=\"Cokayne 1959 546\"/>\n\nAccording to Tuck, Westmorland had little influence on the Scottish borders in the first years of Henry IV's reign, where the wardenships of the marches were monopolised by the Percys, leading to a growing rivalry between the two families. However, in 1403 the Percys, spurred on by various grievances, took up arms against the King, and suffered defeat at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] on 21 July 1403. [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland's]] son, Henry Percy (\"Hotspur\"), was slain at Shrewsbury, and Northumberland's brother, the [[Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]], was beheaded two days later. After Shrewsbury, King Henry ordered Westmorland to raise troops and prevent Northumberland's army, which was still in the north, from advancing south. On 6 August 1403,as a reward for his service in driving Northumberland back to [[Warkworth Castle]], Westmorland was granted the wardenship of the [[Scottish Marches|West March]] which Northumberland had held since 1399, the wardenship of the East March, formerly held by Hotspur, being granted to the King's 14-year-old son, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]].<ref name=\"Cokayne 1959 546\"/>\n\nTwo years later Northumberland, joined by [[Thomas Bardolf, 5th Baron Bardolf|Lord Bardolf]], again took up arms against the King. It had been Northumberland's plan to capture the earl by surprise at the outset, and in early May 1405, with 400 men, Northumberland made a surprise attack at the castle of [[Witton-le-Wear]], where he had been staying.  The attempt failed, as Westmorland had already fled. The earl speedily gathered an army, defeated a force of Percy allies at [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]], and then marched towards York with Henry IV's son, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]], to confront a force of some 8000 men gathered on [[Shipton, North Yorkshire|Shipton]] Moor under the leadership of [[Richard Scrope (cleric)|Archbishop Richard Scrope]], [[Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk]], and Scrope's nephew, Sir William Plumpton. Outnumbered by Scrope's forces, Westmorland resorted to trickery,<ref>According to contemporary writers, Westmorland tricked Scrope into surrendering; however the later [[Thomas of Otterbourne|Otterbourne]] chronicler states that Scrope and his allies surrendered voluntarily (see Tait, 1894, p. 277).</ref> and led Scrope and his allies to believe that their demands would be accepted and their personal safety guaranteed. Once Scrope's army had been disbanded on 29 May, Scrope, Mowbray and Plumpton were arrested, summarily condemned to death for treason, and beheaded outside the walls of York on 8 June 1405. Although Westmorland handed Scrope and his allies over to the King at [[Pontefract Castle|Pontefract]], he played no role in their hasty and irregular trial and execution, having been sent north by the King on 4 June to seize Northumberland's castles. It is unclear whether Northumberland had initially planned to rebel openly in concert with Scrope, but in the event he gave Scrope no support, and fled to Scotland after his failed attempt to capture Westmorland. His estates were subsequently forfeited to the crown, and Ralph, earl of Westmorland, as a reward for his quelling of the 1405 rebellion without significant bloodshed, received a large grant of former Percy lands in [[Cumberland]] and [[Northumberland]] in June 1405.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=546}}; {{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=277}}; {{Harvnb|Tuck|2009}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Henry IV Westmorland was mainly engaged in the defence of the northern border in his capacity as [[Warden of the Marches|Warden of the West March]] (1403\u20131414). In 1415 he decisively defeated an invading Scottish army at the [[Battle of Yeavering]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=552}} Westmorland played no part in [[Henry V of England|King Henry V's]] French campaigns, and Tuck notes that his relationship with Henry V was not close, perhaps partly because of the involvement of Westmorland's son-in-law, [[Thomas Grey (1384-1415)|Sir Thomas Grey]] of Heaton, in the [[Southampton Plot]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tuck|2009}}.</ref> After Henry V's death, Westmorland was a member of the [[Regency (government)|Council of Regency]] during the minority of [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]].<ref name=\"Tait 1894 278\">{{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=278}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to Tait, Westmorland was \"no inconsiderable builder\", citing his rebuilding of [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] on a scale so magnificent that [[John Leland (antiquary)|Leland]] saw \"no house in the north so like a princely lodging\", his doubling of the entrance gateway of [[Raby Castle]] and the corresponding tower, and possibly his responsibility for the \"tall and striking tower\" of Richmond parish church.

On 14 November 1381 he and his cousin, [[Henry Percy (Hotspur)|Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy]], were commissioned to preside over a duel between an Englishman and a Scot, and on 1 December 1383 he and his father were commissioned to receive from the Scots 24,000 marks for the ransom of [[David II of Scotland|King David]]. On 26 October 1385 he was appointed joint [[Governor of Carlisle]] with [[Thomas de Clifford, 6th Baron de Clifford|Sir Thomas Clifford]], and on 27 March 1386 was appointed, together with Clifford, joint [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden]] of the [[Scottish Marches|West March]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=544}}; {{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=275}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|p=506}}.</ref>\n\nNeville inherited the title at the age of 24 after his father's death on 17 October 1388, and was summoned to Parliament from 6 December 1389 to 30 November 1396 by writs directed to ''Radulpho de Nevyll de Raby''. On 25 October 1388 he was appointed, with others, to survey the fortifications on the Scottish border, and on 24 May 1389 was made keeper for life of the royal forests north of the [[River Trent|Trent]]. In 1393 and 1394 he was employed in peace negotiations with Scotland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=545}}; {{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=275}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=246}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1397 Neville supported King Richard's proceedings against Thomas of Woodstock and the [[Lords Appellant]], and by way of reward was created [[Earl of Westmorland]] on 29 September of that year.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=552}} However his loyalty to the King was tested shortly thereafter. His first wife, Margaret Stafford, had died on 9 June 1396, and Neville's second marriage to Joan Beaufort before 29 November 1396 made him the son-in-law of King Richard's uncle, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]. Thus, when King Richard banished John of Gaunt's eldest son and heir, Henry Bolingbroke, on 16 September 1398, and confiscated Bolingbroke's estates after John of Gaunt's death on 3 February 1399, Westmorland was moved to support his brother-in-law.  Bolingbroke landed with a small force at [[Ravenspur]] in July 1399. Westmorland and the [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] were in the deputation at the [[Tower of London|Tower]] which received King Richard's abdication, and Westmorland bore the small sceptre called the \"virge\" at Bolingbroke's coronation as [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] on 13 October 1399.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|pp=545\u20136}}; {{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=276}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=246}}; {{Harvnb|Tuck|2009}}.</ref>\n\nFor his support of the new King, Westmorland was rewarded with a lifetime appointment as [[Earl Marshal]] on 30 September 1399 (although he resigned the office in 1412), a lifetime grant of the [[Honour of Richmond|honour]] of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] on 20 October (although the grant was not accompanied by a grant of the title [[Earl of Richmond]]), and several wardships.<ref name=\"Cokayne 1959 546\">{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=546}}; {{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=276}}; {{Harvnb|Tuck|2009}}.</ref> Before 4 December he was appointed to the King's council.  In March 1401, Westmorland was one of the commissioners who conducted negotiations for a marriage between the King's eldest daughter, [[Blanche of England]], and [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis]], son of [[Rupert, King of Germany|Rupert, King of the Romans]], and in 1403 was made a [[Knight of the Garter]], taking the place left vacant by the death of [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York]].<ref name=\"Cokayne 1959 546\"/>\n\nAccording to Tuck, Westmorland had little influence on the Scottish borders in the first years of Henry IV's reign, where the wardenships of the marches were monopolised by the Percys, leading to a growing rivalry between the two families. However, in 1403 the Percys, spurred on by various grievances, took up arms against the King, and suffered defeat at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] on 21 July 1403. [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland's]] son, Henry Percy (\"Hotspur\"), was slain at Shrewsbury, and Northumberland's brother, the [[Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]], was beheaded two days later. After Shrewsbury, King Henry ordered Westmorland to raise troops and prevent Northumberland's army, which was still in the north, from advancing south. On 6 August 1403,as a reward for his service in driving Northumberland back to [[Warkworth Castle]], Westmorland was granted the wardenship of the [[Scottish Marches|West March]] which Northumberland had held since 1399, the wardenship of the East March, formerly held by Hotspur, being granted to the King's 14-year-old son, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]].<ref name=\"Cokayne 1959 546\"/>\n\nTwo years later Northumberland, joined by [[Thomas Bardolf, 5th Baron Bardolf|Lord Bardolf]], again took up arms against the King. It had been Northumberland's plan to capture the earl by surprise at the outset, and in early May 1405, with 400 men, Northumberland made a surprise attack at the castle of [[Witton-le-Wear]], where he had been staying.  The attempt failed, as Westmorland had already fled. The earl speedily gathered an army, defeated a force of Percy allies at [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]], and then marched towards York with Henry IV's son, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]], to confront a force of some 8000 men gathered on [[Shipton, North Yorkshire|Shipton]] Moor under the leadership of [[Richard Scrope (cleric)|Archbishop Richard Scrope]], [[Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk]], and Scrope's nephew, Sir William Plumpton. Outnumbered by Scrope's forces, Westmorland resorted to trickery,<ref>According to contemporary writers, Westmorland tricked Scrope into surrendering; however the later [[Thomas of Otterbourne|Otterbourne]] chronicler states that Scrope and his allies surrendered voluntarily (see Tait, 1894, p. 277).</ref> and led Scrope and his allies to believe that their demands would be accepted and their personal safety guaranteed. Once Scrope's army had been disbanded on 29 May, Scrope, Mowbray and Plumpton were arrested, summarily condemned to death for treason, and beheaded outside the walls of York on 8 June 1405. Although Westmorland handed Scrope and his allies over to the King at [[Pontefract Castle|Pontefract]], he played no role in their hasty and irregular trial and execution, having been sent north by the King on 4 June to seize Northumberland's castles. It is unclear whether Northumberland had initially planned to rebel openly in concert with Scrope, but in the event he gave Scrope no support, and fled to Scotland after his failed attempt to capture Westmorland. His estates were subsequently forfeited to the crown, and Ralph, earl of Westmorland, as a reward for his quelling of the 1405 rebellion without significant bloodshed, received a large grant of former Percy lands in [[Cumberland]] and [[Northumberland]] in June 1405.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1959|p=546}}; {{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=277}}; {{Harvnb|Tuck|2009}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Henry IV Westmorland was mainly engaged in the defence of the northern border in his capacity as [[Warden of the Marches|Warden of the West March]] (1403\u20131414). In 1415 he decisively defeated an invading Scottish army at the [[Battle of Yeavering]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=552}} Westmorland played no part in [[Henry V of England|King Henry V's]] French campaigns, and Tuck notes that his relationship with Henry V was not close, perhaps partly because of the involvement of Westmorland's son-in-law, [[Thomas Grey (1384-1415)|Sir Thomas Grey]] of Heaton, in the [[Southampton Plot]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tuck|2009}}.</ref> After Henry V's death, Westmorland was a member of the [[Regency (government)|Council of Regency]] during the minority of [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]].<ref name=\"Tait 1894 278\">{{Harvnb|Tait|1894|p=278}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to Tait, Westmorland was \"no inconsiderable builder\", citing his rebuilding of [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] on a scale so magnificent that [[John Leland (antiquary)|Leland]] saw \"no house in the north so like a princely lodging\", his doubling of the entrance gateway of [[Raby Castle]] and the corresponding tower, and possibly his responsibility for the \"tall and striking tower\" of Richmond parish church. On 1 November 1410 Westmorland was granted licence to found a college for a master, six clerks, six \"decayed gentlemen\" and others at [[Staindrop]], towards the completion of which he left a bequest in his will.<ref name=\"Tait 1894 278\"/> He was probably responsible for the building of [[Penrith castle]] in Cumberland c.&nbsp;1412\u201313.<ref>Perriam, D.R., 'William Strickland's Tower in Penrith: Penrith Castle or Hutton Hall?'
