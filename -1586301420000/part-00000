During a night of gambling in the basement-level gambling room, five Chinese men were killed [[execution-style]] by three [[Vietnam]]ese men. A sixth victim was seriously injured but survived.\n\nTwo of the perpetrators, Nam The Tham and Siny Van Tran, were convicted of murder in 2005 after a decade-long international manhunt led to their 2001 [[extradition]] from China to the United States via [[Hong Kong]]. Both Tran and Tham are serving life sentences in prison while the third suspect, Hung Tien has not yet been found as of 2017.\n\nWhile no motive has been officially established, initial police reports and later FBI investigations indicated that the [[Ping On]] gang and one of the victims were vying for power in Boston Chinatown.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"font-size:85%;float:right;width:36em;\"\n|+People at the social club, Jan 11\u201312, 1991\n|-style=\"font-size:110%;\"\n!

It was the successor to the company's high-end [[Voodoo2]] line and was based heavily upon the older [[Voodoo Banshee]] product. Voodoo3 was announced at [[COMDEX]] '98 and arrived on store shelves in early 1999.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-16-1998/0000803667&EDATE= 3Dfx Interactive Blasts COMDEX with Voodoo3 Debut And Four Voodoo Banshee PC-OEM Announcements], 3dfx Press Release, November 16, 1998.</ref> The Voodoo3 line was the first product manufactured by the combined [[STB Systems]] and 3dfx.<ref>Brown, Peter. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_2259_45/ai_54249305 3Dfx Takes Chance on Boards - Voodoo3 2000, Voodoo3 3000, and Voodoo3 3500 - Product Announcement], Electronic News, March 1, 1999.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nThe 'Avenger' graphics core was originally conceived immediately after Banshee. Due to  mis-management by 3dfx, this caused the next-generation 'Rampage' project to suffer delays which would prove to be fatal to the entire company.\n\nAvenger was pushed to the forefront as it offered a quicker time to market than the already delayed Rampage. Avenger was no more than the Banshee core with a second [[texture mapping unit]] (TMU) added - the same TMU which Banshee lost compared to [[Voodoo2]]. Avenger was thus merely a Voodoo2 with an integrated 128-bit 2D video accelerator and twice the clock speed.\n\n==Architecture and performance==\n[[Image:Voodoo3-2000AGP.jpg|thumb|3dfx Voodoo3 2000 AGP]]\n[[Image:Voodoo3-2000PCI.jpg|thumb|3dfx Voodoo3 2000 PCI]]\n[[Image:Voodoo3-3000AGP.jpg|thumb|3dfx Voodoo3 3000 AGP]]\n\nMuch was made of Voodoo3 (christened 'Avenger') and its [[High color|16-bit color]] rendering limitation. This was in fact quite complex, as Voodoo3 operated to full [[24-bit color|32-bit]] precision (8 bits per channel, 16.7M colours) in its texture mappers and pixel pipeline as opposed to previous products from 3dfx and other vendors, which had only worked in 16-bit precision.\n\nTo save framebuffer space, the Voodoo3's rendering output was dithered to 16 bit. This offered better quality than running in pure 16-bit mode.  However, a controversy arose over what happened next.\n\nThe Voodoo3's [[RAMDAC]], which took the rendered frame from the framebuffer and generated the display image, performed a 2x2 box or 4x1 line filter on the dithered image to almost reconstruct the original [[24-bit color]] render. 3dfx claimed this to be '22-bit' equivalent quality.<ref>Beets, Kristof. [http://www.beyond3d.com/content/articles/59/ 3dfx '22Bit Colour' Explored], Beyond3D, May 7, 1999.</ref>  As such, Voodoo3's [[framebuffer]] was not representative of the final output, and therefore, screenshots did not accurately portray Voodoo3's display quality which was actually much closer to the 24-bit outputs of NVIDIA's [[RIVA TNT2]] and ATI's [[ATI Rage|Rage 128]].\n\nThe internal organisation of Avenger was not complex. Pre-setup notably featured a guardband clipper (eventually part of hardware transformation and lighting) but the pixel pipeline was a conventional single-issue, dual-texture design almost identical to that featured on Voodoo2, but capable of working on 32-bit image data as opposed to Voodoo2's pure 16-bit output. Avenger's other remarkable features included the 128-bit [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI accelerator]] debuted in Banshee. This 2D engine led the Voodoo3 to be considered one of the more high-performance video cards of its generation.<ref>Fastsite.

The clock rates were 143 [[Hertz|MHz]], 166&nbsp;MHz and 183&nbsp;MHz respectively. While this gave the 3000 and 3500 a notable theoretical advantage in multi-textured fillrate over its main rival the 125&nbsp;MHz TNT2, the TNT2 had nearly twice the single-textured fillrate of the Voodoo3. In addition, the Voodoo3 consisted of one multi-texturing pipeline, the TNT series consisted of twin single texturing pipelines.<ref>[http://www.beyond3d.com/misc/chipcomp/ Beyond3D 3D Chip Tables] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118025659/http://www.beyond3d.com/misc/chipcomp/ |date=2006-01-18 }}, Beyond3D.Com, accessed August 30, 2006.</ref> As a result, Voodoo3 was disadvantaged in games not using multiple texturing. The 2000 and 3000 boards generally differed in their support for TV output; the 3500 boards also carried a TV tuner and provided a wide range of video inputs and outputs.\n\nAt the time modern multi-texturing games such as ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' and ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' were considered Voodoo3's performance territory, as Voodoo3's primary competition upon release was the dated RIVA TNT.<ref name=AnandVoodoo3 /> NVIDIA's RIVA TNT2 arrived shortly thereafter and the two traded places frequently in benchmark results.<ref>Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=940 NVIDIA Riva TNT2], Anandtech, April 27, 1999.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Voodoo3 was a replacement for the Voodoo2, it was often beaten by Voodoo2 SLI cards in direct comparisons.<ref>Pabst, Thomas.[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/preview-3dfx-voodoo3,100-7.html], Tom's Hardware, February 22, 1999.</ref>\n\nVoodoo3 remained performance competitive throughout its life, eventually being comprehensively outclassed by NVIDIA's [[GeForce 256]] and ATI's [[Radeon R100|Radeon]]. 3dfx created the ill-fated [[Voodoo 5]] to counter.\n\n==3dfx Velocity==\n3dfx released a line of business / value-oriented cards based on the Voodoo3 Avenger chipset. With the purchase of STB Systems, 3dfx had acquired several popular brand names. The Velocity brand had appealed to OEM system builders for years, with boards such as the [[S3 Graphics]] [[S3 ViRGE|ViRGE VX]]-based ''STB Velocity 3D'' and [[NVIDIA]] [[RIVA 128]]-based ''Velocity 128'' being used in many OEM systems from companies such as [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]]. The 3dfx Velocity boards came with only 8 MiB of RAM, compared to 16 MiB on a regular Voodoo3. In addition, one of the texture management units came disabled as well, making the board more like a Banshee. Enthusiasts discovered that it was possible to enable the disabled TMU with a simple registry alteration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/401/3|title=Exploring the Velocity|accessdate=2018-07-26}}</ref> The board's clock speed was set at 143&nbsp;MHz, exactly the same as a Voodoo3 2000.<ref>Andrawes, Mike.

It was the successor to the company's high-end [[Voodoo2]] line and was based heavily upon the older [[Voodoo Banshee]] product. Voodoo3 was announced at [[COMDEX]] '98 and arrived on store shelves in 1999.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-16-1998/0000803667&EDATE= 3Dfx Interactive Blasts COMDEX with Voodoo3 Debut And Four Voodoo Banshee PC-OEM Announcements], 3dfx Press Release, November 16, 1998.</ref> The Voodoo3 line was the first product manufactured by the combined [[STB Systems]] and 3dfx.<ref>Brown, Peter.

Due to  mis-management by 3dfx, this caused the next-generation 'Rampage' project to suffer delays which would prove to be fatal to the entire company.\n\nAvenger was pushed to the forefront as it offered a quicker time to market than the already delayed Rampage. Avenger was no more than the Banshee core with a second [[texture mapping unit]] (TMU) added - the same TMU which Banshee lost compared to [[Voodoo2]]. Avenger was thus merely a Voodoo2 with an integrated 128-bit 2D video accelerator and twice the clock speed.\n\n==Architecture and performance==\n[[Image:Voodoo3-2000AGP.jpg|thumb|3dfx Voodoo3 2000 AGP]]\n[[Image:Voodoo3-2000PCI.jpg|thumb|3dfx Voodoo3 2000 PCI]]\n[[Image:Voodoo3-3000AGP.jpg|thumb|3dfx Voodoo3 3000 AGP]]\n\nMuch was made of Voodoo3 (christened 'Avenger') and its [[High color|16-bit color]] rendering limitation. This was in fact quite complex, as Voodoo3 operated to full [[24-bit color|32-bit]] precision (8 bits per channel, 16.7M colours) in its texture mappers and pixel pipeline as opposed to previous products from 3dfx and other vendors, which had only worked in 16-bit precision.\n\nTo save framebuffer space, the Voodoo3's rendering output was dithered to 16 bit. This offered better quality than running in pure 16-bit mode.  However, a controversy arose over what happened next.\n\nThe Voodoo3's [[RAMDAC]], which took the rendered frame from the framebuffer and generated the display image, performed a 2x2 box or 4x1 line filter on the dithered image to almost reconstruct the original [[24-bit color]] render. 3dfx claimed this to be '22-bit' equivalent quality.<ref>Beets, Kristof. [http://www.beyond3d.com/content/articles/59/ 3dfx '22Bit Colour' Explored], Beyond3D, May 7, 1999.</ref>  As such, Voodoo3's [[framebuffer]] was not representative of the final output, and therefore, screenshots did not accurately portray Voodoo3's display quality which was actually much closer to the 24-bit outputs of NVIDIA's [[RIVA TNT2]] and ATI's [[ATI Rage|Rage 128]].\n\nThe internal organisation of Avenger was not complex. Pre-setup notably featured a guardband clipper (eventually part of hardware transformation and lighting) but the pixel pipeline was a conventional single-issue, dual-texture design almost identical to that featured on Voodoo2, but capable of working on 32-bit image data as opposed to Voodoo2's pure 16-bit output. Avenger's other remarkable features included the 128-bit [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI accelerator]] debuted in Banshee. This 2D engine led the Voodoo3 to be considered one of the more high-performance video cards of its generation.<ref>Fastsite.

The clock rates were 143 [[Hertz|MHz]], 166&nbsp;MHz and 183&nbsp;MHz respectively. While this gave the 3000 and 3500 a notable theoretical advantage in multi-textured fillrate over its main rival the 125&nbsp;MHz TNT2, the TNT2 had nearly twice the single-textured fillrate of the Voodoo3. In addition, the Voodoo3 consisted of one multi-texturing pipeline, the TNT series consisted of twin single texturing pipelines.<ref>[http://www.beyond3d.com/misc/chipcomp/ Beyond3D 3D Chip Tables] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118025659/http://www.beyond3d.com/misc/chipcomp/ |date=2006-01-18 }}, Beyond3D.Com, accessed August 30, 2006.</ref> As a result, Voodoo3 was disadvantaged in games not using multiple texturing. The 2000 and 3000 boards generally differed in their support for TV output; the 3500 boards also carried a TV tuner and provided a wide range of video inputs and outputs.\n\nAt the time modern multi-texturing games such as ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' and ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' were considered Voodoo3's performance territory, as Voodoo3's primary competition upon release was the dated RIVA TNT.<ref name=AnandVoodoo3 /> NVIDIA's RIVA TNT2 arrived shortly thereafter and the two traded places frequently in benchmark results.<ref>Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=940 NVIDIA Riva TNT2], Anandtech, April 27, 1999.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Voodoo3 was a replacement for the Voodoo2, it was often beaten by Voodoo2 SLI cards in direct comparisons.<ref>Pabst, Thomas.[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/preview-3dfx-voodoo3,100-7.html], Tom's Hardware, February 22, 1999.</ref>\n\nVoodoo3 remained performance competitive throughout its life, eventually being comprehensively outclassed by NVIDIA's [[GeForce 256]] and ATI's [[Radeon R100|Radeon]]. 3dfx created the ill-fated [[Voodoo 5]] to counter.\n\n==3dfx Velocity==\n3dfx released a line of business / value-oriented cards based on the Voodoo3 Avenger chipset. With the purchase of STB Systems, 3dfx had acquired several popular brand names. The Velocity brand had appealed to OEM system builders for years, with boards such as the [[S3 Graphics]] [[S3 ViRGE|ViRGE VX]]-based ''STB Velocity 3D'' and [[NVIDIA]] [[RIVA 128]]-based ''Velocity 128'' being used in many OEM systems from companies such as [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]]. The 3dfx Velocity boards came with only 8 MiB of RAM, compared to 16 MiB on a regular Voodoo3. In addition, one of the texture management units came disabled as well, making the board more like a Banshee. Enthusiasts discovered that it was possible to enable the disabled TMU with a simple registry alteration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/401/3|title=Exploring the Velocity|accessdate=2018-07-26}}</ref> The board's clock speed was set at 143&nbsp;MHz, exactly the same as a Voodoo3 2000.<ref>Andrawes, Mike.
