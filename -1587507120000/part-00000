The Mountaineers had their first home game of the season the following week in a win against [[2014 Campbell Fighting Camels football team|Campbell]]. App State would lose its next four contests. After a 1\u20135 start, the Mountaineers rallied and won the final six games of their [[2014 Appalachian State Mountaineers football team|2014 season]].

The relations between the president and the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The power struggle reached its [[constitutional crisis|crisis]] on 21 September 1993, when President Yeltsin aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]] and its [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]]), although the constitution did not give the president the power to do so. Yeltsin justified his orders by the results of the [[1993 Russian government referendum|referendum of April 1993]]. In response, the parliament declared the president's decision null and void, impeached Yeltsin and proclaimed vice president [[Aleksandr Rutskoy]] to be acting president.\n\nOn 3 October, demonstrators removed police cordons around the parliament and, urged by their leaders, took over the Mayor's offices and tried to storm the [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] television centre. The army, which had initially declared its neutrality, stormed the Supreme Soviet building in the early morning hours of 4 October by Yeltsin's order, and arrested the leaders of the resistance. At the climax of the crisis, Russia was thought by some to be \"on the brink\" of [[civil war]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3161002.stm |title=Remembering Russia's civil siege |accessdate=2003-03-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/04/putin-continuum-tsars-russia |title=Putin is part of a continuum that stretches back to the tsars  |accessdate=2017-04-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe ten-day conflict became the deadliest single event of street fighting in [[Moscow]]'s [[History of Moscow|history]] since the [[Russian Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Afgantsy: the Russians in Afghanistan 1979\u201389|first=Rodric|last=Braithwaite|publisher=Profile Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84668-054-0|page=312}}</ref> According to government estimates, 187 people were killed and 437 wounded.\n\n==Origins==\n===Intensifying executive-legislative power struggle===\nThe [[Soviet Union]] broke up on 26 December 1991.

In 1992 the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin's overall goals.\n\nThe president was concerned about the terms of the constitutional amendments passed in late 1991, which meant that his special powers of decree were set to expire by the end of 1992 (Yeltsin expanded the powers of the presidency beyond normal constitutional limits in carrying out the reform program). Yeltsin, awaiting implementation of his [[privatization]] program, demanded that parliament reinstate his decree powers (only parliament had the authority to replace or amend the constitution). But in the Russian Congress of People's Deputies and in the Supreme Soviet, the deputies refused to adopt a new constitution that would enshrine the scope of presidential powers demanded by Yeltsin into law.\n\n====Seventh Congress of People's Deputies====\n[[File:Russian Congressional Fractions 1992.png|thumb|right|Congressional Factions in December 1992]]\n\nDuring its December session, the parliament clashed with Yeltsin on a number of issues, and the conflict came to a head on 9 December when the parliament refused to confirm [[Yegor Gaidar]], the widely unpopular architect of Russia's \"[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]\" market liberalisations, as prime minister. The parliament refused to nominate Gaidar, demanding modifications of the economic program and directed the Central Bank, which was under the parliament's control, to continue issuing credits to enterprises to keep them from shutting down.<ref>The Central Bank's efforts got in the way of pro-Yeltsin, Western-oriented leaders were seeking to carry out a decisive neoliberal economic transformation of Russia. They undermined the regime of fiscal austerity that the Yeltsin government was attempting to pursue. See, e.g., Thomas F. Remington, ''Politics in Russia'' (New York: Addison-Wesley Educational Publishers Inc., 2002), p. 50.</ref>\n\nIn an angry speech the next day on 10 December, Yeltsin accused the Congress of blocking the government's reforms and suggested the people decide on a [[referendum]], \"which course do the citizens of Russia support? The course of the President, a course of transformations, or the course of the Congress, the Supreme Soviet and its Chairman, a course towards folding up reforms, and ultimately towards the deepening of the crisis.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9POldxUqhMC&pg=PA784 |script-title=ru:\u0418\u0437 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438: \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u044b, \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b, \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b (1990\u20131993 \u0433\u0433.) \u0432 6 \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445 |first=\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0413 |last=\u0420\u0443\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Russia |year=2008 |isbn=978-5-466-00354-3 |page=784| accessdate=5 August 2010<!--DASHBot-->|language=ru}}</ref> Parliament responded by voting to take control of the parliamentary army.\n\nOn 12 December, Yeltsin and parliament speaker Khasbulatov agreed on a compromise that included the following provisions: (1) a national referendum on framing a new Russian constitution to be held in April 1993; (2) most of Yeltsin's emergency powers were extended until the referendum; (3) the parliament asserted its right to nominate and vote on its own choices for prime minister; and (4) the parliament asserted its right to reject the president's choices to head the Defense, Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Security ministries. Yeltsin nominated [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] to be prime minister on 14 December, and the parliament confirmed him.\n\nYeltsin's December 1992 compromise with the seventh Congress of the People's Deputies temporarily backfired. Early 1993 saw increasing tension between Yeltsin and the parliament over the language of the referendum and power sharing. In a series of collisions over policy, the congress whittled away the president's extraordinary powers, which it had granted him in late-1991. The legislature, marshaled by Speaker [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], began to sense that it could block and even defeat the president. The tactic that it adopted was gradually to erode presidential control over the government. In response, the president called a referendum on a constitution for 11 April.\n\n====Eighth congress====\nThe eighth Congress of People's Deputies opened on 10 March 1993 with a strong attack on the president by Khasbulatov, who accused Yeltsin of acting unconstitutionally. In mid-March, an emergency session of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to amend the constitution, strip Yeltsin of many of his powers, and cancel the scheduled April referendum, again opening the door to legislation that would shift the balance of power away from the president. The president stalked out of the congress. [[Vladimir Shumeyko]], first deputy prime minister, declared that the referendum would go ahead, but on 25 April.\n\nThe parliament was gradually expanding its influence over the government. On 16 March, the president signed a decree that conferred Cabinet rank on [[Viktor Gerashchenko]], chairman of the central bank, and three other officials; this was in accordance with the decision of the eighth congress that these officials should be members of the government. The congress' ruling, however, had made it clear that as ministers they would continue to be subordinate to parliament.

The legislature's version of the referendum asked whether citizens had confidence in Yeltsin, approved of his reforms, and supported early presidential and legislative elections. The parliament voted that in order to win, the president would need to obtain 50 percent of the whole electorate, rather than 50 percent of those actually voting, to avoid an early presidential election.\n\nThis time, the Constitutional Court supported Yeltsin and ruled that the president required only a simple majority on two issues: confidence in him, and economic and social policy; he would need the support of half the electorate in order to call new parliamentary and presidential elections.\n\nOn 25 April, a majority of voters expressed confidence in the president and called for new legislative elections. Yeltsin termed the results a mandate for him to continue in power. Before the referendum, Yeltsin had promised to resign, if the electorate failed to express confidence in his policies.<ref>\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430. 1993. 1 \u0430\u043f\u0440.

Of course, the two main drafts contained contrary views of legislative-executive relations.\n\nSome 700 representatives at the conference ultimately adopted a draft constitution on July&nbsp;12 that envisaged a bicameral legislature and the dissolution of the congress. But because the convention's draft of the constitution would dissolve the congress, there was little likelihood that the congress would vote itself out of existence.

Rutskoy, elected on the same ticket as Yeltsin in 1991, was the president's automatic successor. A presidential spokesman said that he had been suspended because of \"accusations of corruption.\" On September&nbsp;3, the Supreme Soviet rejected Yeltsin's suspension of Rutskoy and referred the question to the Constitutional Court.\n\nTwo weeks later Yeltsin declared that he would agree to call early presidential elections provided that the parliament also called elections. The parliament ignored him. On September&nbsp;18, Yeltsin then named Yegor Gaidar, who had been forced out of office by parliamentary opposition in 1992, a deputy prime minister and a deputy premier for economic affairs. This appointment was unacceptable to the Supreme Soviet, which emphatically rejected it.\n\n==Siege and assault==\n[[File:Supreme Soviet of Russia meeting (1993).png|right|thumb|Supreme Soviet session, September&nbsp;21, 1993]]\n\nOn September&nbsp;21, Yeltsin declared the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]] dissolved; this act was in contradiction with a number of articles of the [[Russian Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]] (as amended 1989\u20131993), such as, Article 121<sup>6</sup><ref group=note>The Congress enabled this formerly-suspended amendment after it had failed to impeach Yeltsin after his declaration of a 'Special Rule' in March 1993</ref> which stated that:\n\n{{quote|The powers of the President of Russian Federation cannot be used to change the national and state organization of the Russian Federation, to dissolve or to interfere with the functioning of any elected organs of state power. In this case, his powers cease immediately.}}\n\nIn his television appearance to the citizens of Russia, President Yeltsin argued for the decree nr 1400 as follows:\n<blockquote>Already more than a year attempts were made to reach a compromise with the corps of deputies, with the Supreme Soviet. Russians know well that how many steps were taken by my side during the last congresses and between them. [\u2026] The last days destroyed once and for all the hopes for a resurrection of at least some constructive cooperation. The majority of the Supreme Soviet goes directly against the will of the Russian people. A course is taken in favour of the weakening of the president and ultimately his removal from office, of the disorganization of the work of the government; during the last months, dozens of antipopular decisions have been prepared and passed. [...] Lots of these are deliberately planned to worsen the situation in Russia. The more flagrant ones are the so-called economic policies of the Supreme Soviet, its decisions on the budget, privatization, there are many others that deepen the crisis, cause colossal damage to the country. All attempts of the government undertaken to at least somewhat alleviate the economic situation meet incomprehension. There is hardly a day when the cabinet of ministers is not harassed, its hands are not being tied. And this happens in a situation of a deepest economic crisis. The Supreme Soviet has stopped taking into account the decrees of the president, his amendments of the legislative projects, even his constitutional veto rights. Constitutional reform has practically been pared down. The process of creating rule of law in Russia has essentially been disorganized. To the contrary, what is going on is a deliberate reduction of the legal basis of the young Russian state that is even without this weak. The legislative work became a weapon of political struggle. Laws, that Russia urgently needs, are not being passed for years.[...]\n \nFor a long time already, most of the sessions of the Supreme Soviet take place with the infringements of the elementary procedures and order... A cleansing of committees and commissions is taking place. Everyone who does not show up personal loyalty to its leader is being mercilessly expelled from the Supreme Soviet, from its presidium. [...] This is all a bitter evidence of the fact that the Supreme Soviet as a state institution is currently in a state of decay [...]. The power in the Supreme Soviet has been captured by a group of persons who have turned it into an HQ of the intransigent opposition. [...] The only way how to overcome the paralysis of the state authority in the Russian Federation is its fundamental renewal on the basis of the principles of popular power and constitutionality. The constitution currently in force does not allow to do this. The constitution in force also does not provide for a procedure of passing a new constitution, that would provide for a worthy exit from the crisis of state power. I as the guarantor of the security of our state have to propose an exit from this deadlock, have to break this vicious circle.\n</blockquote>\n\nAt the same time, Yeltsin repeated his announcement of a constitutional referendum, and new legislative elections for December. He also repudiated the Constitution of 1978, declaring that it had been replaced with one that gave him extraordinary executive powers. (According to the new plan, the lower house would have 450 deputies and be called the [[State Duma]], the name of the Russian legislature before the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917. The [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], which would bring together representatives from the 89 subdivisions of the Russian Federation, would assume the role of an upper house.)\n\nYeltsin claimed that by dissolving the Russian parliament in September 1993 he was clearing the tracks for a rapid transition to a functioning market economy. With this pledge, he received strong backing from the leading powers of the West. Yeltsin enjoyed a strong relationship with the Western powers, particularly the [[United States]], but the relationship made him unpopular with some Russians. In Russia, the Yeltsin side had control over television, where hardly any pro-parliament views were expressed during the September\u2013October crisis.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/changingchannels00mick |url-access=registration |title=Changing channels: television and the struggle for power in Russia |first=Ellen P |last=Mickiewicz |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8223-2463-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/changingchannels00mick/page/126 126]| accessdate=July 12, 2009<!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n===Parliament purports to impeach Yeltsin as president===\nRutskoy called Yeltsin's move a step toward a ''[[coup d'etat]]''. The next day, the Constitutional Court held that Yeltsin had violated the constitution and could be impeached. During an all-night session, chaired by Khasbulatov, parliament declared the president's decree null and void. Rutskoy was proclaimed president and took the oath on the constitution. He dismissed Yeltsin and the key ministers [[Pavel Grachev]] (defense), [[Nikolay Golushko]] (security), and [[Viktor Yerin]] (interior). Russia now had two presidents and two ministers of defense, security, and interior. It was [[dual power]] in earnest. Although [[Gennady Zyuganov]] and other top leaders of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] did not participate in the events, individual members of communist organizations actively supported the parliament.\n\nOn September&nbsp;23, the Congress of People's deputies convened. Though only 638 deputies were present (the quorum was 689), Congress purported to impeach Yeltsin.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Economies in Transition |first=Ian |last=Jeffries |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-415-13684-6 |page=113}}</ref>\n\nOn September&nbsp;24, an undaunted Yeltsin announced presidential elections for June 1994.

Tens of thousands of Russians marched in the streets of Moscow seeking to bolster the parliamentary cause. The demonstrators were protesting against the deteriorating living conditions. Since 1989, the [[gross domestic product|GDP]] had been declining, [[Political corruption|corruption]] was rampant, [[violent crime]] was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing and [[life expectancy]] falling. Yeltsin was also increasingly getting the blame.<ref group=note>It is still hotly debated among Western economists, social scientists, and policy-makers as to whether or not the IMF-, World Bank-, and U.S. Treasury Department-backed reform policies adopted in Russia, often called \"shock therapy,\" were responsible for Russia's poor record of economic performance in the 1990s. Under the Western-backed economic program adopted by Yeltsin, the Russian government took several radical measures at once that were supposed to stabilize the economy by bringing state spending and revenues into balance and by letting market demand determine the prices and supply of goods. Under the reforms, the government let most prices float, raised taxes, and cut back sharply on spending in industry and construction. These policies caused widespread hardship as many state enterprises found themselves without orders or financing. The rationale of the program was to squeeze the built-in inflationary pressure out of the economy so that producers would begin making sensible decisions about production, pricing and investment instead of chronically overusing resources, as in the Soviet era. By letting the market rather than central planners determine prices, product mixes, output levels, and the like, the reformers intended to create an incentive structure in the economy where efficiency and risk would be rewarded and waste and carelessness were punished. Removing the causes of [[chronic inflation]], the reform's architects argued, was a precondition for all other reforms: Hyperinflation would wreck both democracy and economic progress, they argued; only by stabilizing the state budget could the government proceed to restructure the economy. A similar reform program had been adopted in Poland in January 1990, with generally favorable results. However, Western critics of Yeltsin's reform, most notably [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Marshall Goldman]] (who would have favored a more \"gradual\" transition to market capitalism) consider policies adopted in Poland ill-suited for Russia, given that the impact of communism on the Polish economy and political culture was far less indelible.

This support for Yeltsin's actions declined in later years.

[[Valery Zorkin]], chairman of the Constitutional Court, was forced to resign. The chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions was also sacked. The anti-Yeltsin TV broadcast [[600 Seconds]] of [[Alexander Nevzorov]] was ultimately closed down.\n\nYeltsin decreed, on October&nbsp;12, that both houses of parliament would be elected in December. On October&nbsp;15, he ordered that a popular referendum be held in December on a new constitution. Rutskoy and Khasbulatov were charged on October&nbsp;15 with \"organizing mass disorders\" and imprisoned. On 23 February 1994 the State Duma amnestied all individuals involved in the events of September\u2013October 1993.  They were later released in 1994 when Yeltsin's position was sufficiently secure.

The new basic law would concentrate sweeping powers in the hands of the president. The bicameral legislature, to sit for only two years, was restricted in crucial areas. The president could choose the prime minister even if the parliament objected and could appoint the military leadership without parliamentary approval. He would head and appoint the members of a new, more powerful security council. If a vote of no confidence in the government was passed, the president would be enabled to keep it in office for three months and could dissolve the parliament if it repeated the vote. The president could veto any bill passed by a simple majority in the lower house, after which a two-thirds majority would be required for the legislation to be passed. The president could not be impeached for contravening the constitution. The central bank would become independent, but the president would need the approval of the State Duma to appoint the bank's governor, who would thereafter be independent of the parliament. At the time, most political observers regarded the draft constitution as shaped by and for Yeltsin and perhaps unlikely to survive him.\n\n===End of the first constitutional period===\n{{See also|1993 Russian constitutional referendum}}\n\nOn December&nbsp;12, Yeltsin managed to push through his new constitution, creating a strong presidency and giving the president sweeping powers to issue decrees.\n\nHowever, the parliament elected on the same day (with a turnout of about 53%) delivered a stunning rebuke to his neoliberal economic program. Candidates identified with Yeltsin's economic policies were overwhelmed by a huge protest vote, the bulk of which was divided between the Communists (who mostly drew their support from industrial workers, out-of-work bureaucrats, some professionals, and pensioners) and the ultra-nationalists (who drew their support from disaffected elements of the lower [[middle classes]]). Unexpectedly, the most surprising insurgent group proved to be the ultranationalist [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|Liberal Democratic Party]] led by [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]]. It gained 23% of the vote while the Gaidar led '[[democratic Choice of Russia|Russia's Choice]]' received 15.5% and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 12.4%. LDPR leader, [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], alarmed many observers abroad with his neo-[[fascism|fascist]], [[chauvinism|chauvinist]] declarations.\n\nNevertheless, the referendum marked the end of the constitutional period defined by the [[Russian Constitution of 1978|constitution]] adopted by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] in 1978, which was [[Russian Constitution of 1978#List of amendments|amended many times]] while [[Russia]] was a part of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Soviet Union]]. Although Russia would emerge as a dual presidential-parliamentary system in theory, substantial power would rest in the president's hands. Russia now has a [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] who heads a cabinet and directs the administration, but the system is an example of presidentialism with the cover of a presidential prime minister, not an effective semipresidential constitutional model. (The premier, for example, is appointed, and in effect freely dismissed, by the president.)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Russia|Politics|1990s}}\n* [[History of post-Soviet Russia]]\n* [[Politics of Russia|Politics of post-Soviet Russia]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | title= Prospects for Constitutionalism in Post-Communist Countries | first= Levent | last= G\u00f6nen\u00e7 | year= 2002 | publisher= Kluwer Law International | isbn= 90-411-1836-5 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VVwC9J6EPSwC&pg=PA161 | ref= harv}}\n* {{cite book | title= A Guide to the Economies in Transition | first= Ian | last= Jeffries | year= 1996 | publisher= Routledge | isbn= 0-415-13684-9 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac5CUNQPXT8C&pg=PA110 | ref= harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=War Junkie: One Man's Addiction to the Worst Places on Earth |first=Jon |last=Steele |publisher=Corgi Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-552-14984-6}}\n*Lehrke, Jesse Paul (2013). \"The Transition to National Armies in the Former Soviet Republics, 1988\u20132005.\" Oxfordshire, UK: Routledge.

The relations between the president and the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The power struggle reached its [[constitutional crisis|crisis]] on 21 September 1993, when President Yeltsin aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]] and its [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]]), although the constitution did not give the president the power to do so. Yeltsin justified his orders by the results of the [[1993 Russian government referendum|referendum of April 1993]]. In response, the parliament declared the president's decision null and void, impeached Yeltsin and proclaimed vice president [[Aleksandr Rutskoy]] to be acting president.\n\nOn 3 October, demonstrators removed police cordons around the parliament and, urged by their leaders, took over the Mayor's offices and tried to storm the [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] television centre. The army, which had initially declared its neutrality, stormed the Supreme Soviet building in the early morning hours of 4 October by Yeltsin's order, and arrested the leaders of the resistance. At the climax of the crisis, Russia was thought by some to be \"on the brink\" of [[civil war]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3161002.stm |title=Remembering Russia's civil siege |accessdate=2003-03-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/04/putin-continuum-tsars-russia |title=Putin is part of a continuum that stretches back to the tsars  |accessdate=2017-04-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe ten-day conflict became the deadliest single event of street fighting in [[Moscow]]'s [[History of Moscow|history]] since the [[Russian Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Afgantsy: the Russians in Afghanistan 1979\u201389|first=Rodric|last=Braithwaite|publisher=Profile Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84668-054-0|page=312}}</ref> According to government estimates, 187 people were killed and 437 wounded.\n\n==Origins==\n===Intensifying executive-legislative power struggle===\nThe [[Soviet Union]] broke up on 26 December 1991.

In 1992 the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin's overall goals.\n\nThe president was concerned about the terms of the constitutional amendments passed in late 1991, which meant that his special powers of decree were set to expire by the end of 1992 (Yeltsin expanded the powers of the presidency beyond normal constitutional limits in carrying out the reform program). Yeltsin, awaiting implementation of his [[privatization]] program, demanded that parliament reinstate his decree powers (only parliament had the authority to replace or amend the constitution). But in the Russian Congress of People's Deputies and in the Supreme Soviet, the deputies refused to adopt a new constitution that would enshrine the scope of presidential powers demanded by Yeltsin into law.\n\n====Seventh Congress of People's Deputies====\n[[File:Russian Congressional Fractions 1992.png|thumb|right|Congressional Factions in December 1992]]\n\nDuring its December session, the parliament clashed with Yeltsin on a number of issues, and the conflict came to a head on 9 December when the parliament refused to confirm [[Yegor Gaidar]], the widely unpopular architect of Russia's \"[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]\" market liberalisations, as prime minister. The parliament refused to nominate Gaidar, demanding modifications of the economic program and directed the Central Bank, which was under the parliament's control, to continue issuing credits to enterprises to keep them from shutting down.<ref>The Central Bank's efforts got in the way of pro-Yeltsin, Western-oriented leaders were seeking to carry out a decisive neoliberal economic transformation of Russia. They undermined the regime of fiscal austerity that the Yeltsin government was attempting to pursue. See, e.g., Thomas F. Remington, ''Politics in Russia'' (New York: Addison-Wesley Educational Publishers Inc., 2002), p. 50.</ref>\n\nIn an angry speech the next day on 10 December, Yeltsin accused the Congress of blocking the government's reforms and suggested the people decide on a [[referendum]], \"which course do the citizens of Russia support? The course of the President, a course of transformations, or the course of the Congress, the Supreme Soviet and its Chairman, a course towards folding up reforms, and ultimately towards the deepening of the crisis.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9POldxUqhMC&pg=PA784 |script-title=ru:\u0418\u0437 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438: \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u044b, \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b, \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b (1990\u20131993 \u0433\u0433.) \u0432 6 \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445 |first=\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0413 |last=\u0420\u0443\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Russia |year=2008 |isbn=978-5-466-00354-3 |page=784| accessdate=5 August 2010<!--DASHBot-->|language=ru}}</ref> Parliament responded by voting to take control of the parliamentary army.\n\nOn 12 December, Yeltsin and parliament speaker Khasbulatov agreed on a compromise that included the following provisions: (1) a national referendum on framing a new Russian constitution to be held in April 1993; (2) most of Yeltsin's emergency powers were extended until the referendum; (3) the parliament asserted its right to nominate and vote on its own choices for prime minister; and (4) the parliament asserted its right to reject the president's choices to head the Defense, Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Security ministries. Yeltsin nominated [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] to be prime minister on 14 December, and the parliament confirmed him.\n\nYeltsin's December 1992 compromise with the seventh Congress of the People's Deputies temporarily backfired. Early 1993 saw increasing tension between Yeltsin and the parliament over the language of the referendum and power sharing. In a series of collisions over policy, the congress whittled away the president's extraordinary powers, which it had granted him in late-1991. The legislature, marshaled by Speaker [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], began to sense that it could block and even defeat the president. The tactic that it adopted was gradually to erode presidential control over the government. In response, the president called a referendum on a constitution for 11 April.\n\n====Eighth congress====\nThe eighth Congress of People's Deputies opened on 10 March 1993 with a strong attack on the president by Khasbulatov, who accused Yeltsin of acting unconstitutionally. In mid-March, an emergency session of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to amend the constitution, strip Yeltsin of many of his powers, and cancel the scheduled April referendum, again opening the door to legislation that would shift the balance of power away from the president. The president stalked out of the congress. [[Vladimir Shumeyko]], first deputy prime minister, declared that the referendum would go ahead, but on 25 April.\n\nThe parliament was gradually expanding its influence over the government. On 16 March, the president signed a decree that conferred Cabinet rank on [[Viktor Gerashchenko]], chairman of the central bank, and three other officials; this was in accordance with the decision of the eighth congress that these officials should be members of the government. The congress' ruling, however, had made it clear that as ministers they would continue to be subordinate to parliament.

The legislature's version of the referendum asked whether citizens had confidence in Yeltsin, approved of his reforms, and supported early presidential and legislative elections. The parliament voted that in order to win, the president would need to obtain 50 percent of the whole electorate, rather than 50 percent of those actually voting, to avoid an early presidential election.\n\nThis time, the Constitutional Court supported Yeltsin and ruled that the president required only a simple majority on two issues: confidence in him, and economic and social policy; he would need the support of half the electorate in order to call new parliamentary and presidential elections.\n\nOn 25 April, a majority of voters expressed confidence in the president and called for new legislative elections. Yeltsin termed the results a mandate for him to continue in power. Before the referendum, Yeltsin had promised to resign, if the electorate failed to express confidence in his policies.<ref>\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430. 1993. 1 \u0430\u043f\u0440.

Of course, the two main drafts contained contrary views of legislative-executive relations.\n\nSome 700 representatives at the conference ultimately adopted a draft constitution on July&nbsp;12 that envisaged a bicameral legislature and the dissolution of the congress. But because the convention's draft of the constitution would dissolve the congress, there was little likelihood that the congress would vote itself out of existence.

Rutskoy, elected on the same ticket as Yeltsin in 1991, was the president's automatic successor. A presidential spokesman said that he had been suspended because of \"accusations of corruption.\" On September&nbsp;3, the Supreme Soviet rejected Yeltsin's suspension of Rutskoy and referred the question to the Constitutional Court.\n\nTwo weeks later Yeltsin declared that he would agree to call early presidential elections provided that the parliament also called elections. The parliament ignored him. On September&nbsp;18, Yeltsin then named Yegor Gaidar, who had been forced out of office by parliamentary opposition in 1992, a deputy prime minister and a deputy premier for economic affairs. This appointment was unacceptable to the Supreme Soviet, which emphatically rejected it.\n\n==Siege and assault==\n[[File:Supreme Soviet of Russia meeting (1993).png|right|thumb|Supreme Soviet session, September&nbsp;21, 1993]]\n\nOn September&nbsp;21, Yeltsin declared the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]] dissolved; this act was in contradiction with a number of articles of the [[Russian Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]] (as amended 1989\u20131993), such as, Article 121<sup>6</sup><ref group=note>The Congress enabled this formerly-suspended amendment after it had failed to impeach Yeltsin after his declaration of a 'Special Rule' in March 1993</ref> which stated that:\n\n{{quote|The powers of the President of Russian Federation cannot be used to change the national and state organization of the Russian Federation, to dissolve or to interfere with the functioning of any elected organs of state power. In this case, his powers cease immediately.}}\n\nIn his television appearance to the citizens of Russia, President Yeltsin argued for the decree nr 1400 as follows:\n<blockquote>Already more than a year attempts were made to reach a compromise with the corps of deputies, with the Supreme Soviet. Russians know well that how many steps were taken by my side during the last congresses and between them. [\u2026] The last days destroyed once and for all the hopes for a resurrection of at least some constructive cooperation. The majority of the Supreme Soviet goes directly against the will of the Russian people. A course is taken in favour of the weakening of the president and ultimately his removal from office, of the disorganization of the work of the government; during the last months, dozens of antipopular decisions have been prepared and passed. [...] Lots of these are deliberately planned to worsen the situation in Russia. The more flagrant ones are the so-called economic policies of the Supreme Soviet, its decisions on the budget, privatization, there are many others that deepen the crisis, cause colossal damage to the country. All attempts of the government undertaken to at least somewhat alleviate the economic situation meet incomprehension. There is hardly a day when the cabinet of ministers is not harassed, its hands are not being tied. And this happens in a situation of a deepest economic crisis. The Supreme Soviet has stopped taking into account the decrees of the president, his amendments of the legislative projects, even his constitutional veto rights. Constitutional reform has practically been pared down. The process of creating rule of law in Russia has essentially been disorganized. To the contrary, what is going on is a deliberate reduction of the legal basis of the young Russian state that is even without this weak. The legislative work became a weapon of political struggle. Laws, that Russia urgently needs, are not being passed for years.[...]\n \nFor a long time already, most of the sessions of the Supreme Soviet take place with the infringements of the elementary procedures and order... A cleansing of committees and commissions is taking place. Everyone who does not show up personal loyalty to its leader is being mercilessly expelled from the Supreme Soviet, from its presidium. [...] This is all a bitter evidence of the fact that the Supreme Soviet as a state institution is currently in a state of decay [...]. The power in the Supreme Soviet has been captured by a group of persons who have turned it into an HQ of the intransigent opposition. [...] The only way how to overcome the paralysis of the state authority in the Russian Federation is its fundamental renewal on the basis of the principles of popular power and constitutionality. The constitution currently in force does not allow to do this. The constitution in force also does not provide for a procedure of passing a new constitution, that would provide for a worthy exit from the crisis of state power. I as the guarantor of the security of our state have to propose an exit from this deadlock, have to break this vicious circle.\n</blockquote>\n\nAt the same time, Yeltsin repeated his announcement of a constitutional referendum, and new legislative elections for December. He also repudiated the Constitution of 1978, declaring that it had been replaced with one that gave him extraordinary executive powers. (According to the new plan, the lower house would have 450 deputies and be called the [[State Duma]], the name of the Russian legislature before the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917. The [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], which would bring together representatives from the 89 subdivisions of the Russian Federation, would assume the role of an upper house.)\n\nYeltsin claimed that by dissolving the Russian parliament in September 1993 he was clearing the tracks for a rapid transition to a functioning market economy. With this pledge, he received strong backing from the leading powers of the West. Yeltsin enjoyed a strong relationship with the Western powers, particularly the [[United States]], but the relationship made him unpopular with some Russians. In Russia, the Yeltsin side had control over television, where hardly any pro-parliament views were expressed during the September\u2013October crisis.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/changingchannels00mick |url-access=registration |title=Changing channels: television and the struggle for power in Russia |first=Ellen P |last=Mickiewicz |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8223-2463-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/changingchannels00mick/page/126 126]| accessdate=July 12, 2009<!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n===Parliament purports to impeach Yeltsin as president===\nRutskoy called Yeltsin's move a step toward a ''[[coup d'etat]]''. The next day, the Constitutional Court held that Yeltsin had violated the constitution and could be impeached. During an all-night session, chaired by Khasbulatov, parliament declared the president's decree null and void. Rutskoy was proclaimed president and took the oath on the constitution. He dismissed Yeltsin and the key ministers [[Pavel Grachev]] (defense), [[Nikolay Golushko]] (security), and [[Viktor Yerin]] (interior). Russia now had two presidents and two ministers of defense, security, and interior. It was [[dual power]] in earnest. Although [[Gennady Zyuganov]] and other top leaders of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] did not participate in the events, individual members of communist organizations actively supported the parliament.\n\nOn September&nbsp;23, the Congress of People's deputies convened. Though only 638 deputies were present (the quorum was 689), Congress purported to impeach Yeltsin.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Economies in Transition |first=Ian |last=Jeffries |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-415-13684-6 |page=113}}</ref>\n\nOn September&nbsp;24, an undaunted Yeltsin announced presidential elections for June 1994.

Tens of thousands of Russians marched in the streets of Moscow seeking to bolster the parliamentary cause. The demonstrators were protesting against the deteriorating living conditions. Since 1989, the [[gross domestic product|GDP]] had been declining, [[Political corruption|corruption]] was rampant, [[violent crime]] was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing and [[life expectancy]] falling. Yeltsin was also increasingly getting the blame.<ref group=note>It is still hotly debated among Western economists, social scientists, and policy-makers as to whether or not the IMF-, World Bank-, and U.S. Treasury Department-backed reform policies adopted in Russia, often called \"shock therapy,\" were responsible for Russia's poor record of economic performance in the 1990s. Under the Western-backed economic program adopted by Yeltsin, the Russian government took several radical measures at once that were supposed to stabilize the economy by bringing state spending and revenues into balance and by letting market demand determine the prices and supply of goods. Under the reforms, the government let most prices float, raised taxes, and cut back sharply on spending in industry and construction. These policies caused widespread hardship as many state enterprises found themselves without orders or financing. The rationale of the program was to squeeze the built-in inflationary pressure out of the economy so that producers would begin making sensible decisions about production, pricing and investment instead of chronically overusing resources, as in the Soviet era. By letting the market rather than central planners determine prices, product mixes, output levels, and the like, the reformers intended to create an incentive structure in the economy where efficiency and risk would be rewarded and waste and carelessness were punished. Removing the causes of [[chronic inflation]], the reform's architects argued, was a precondition for all other reforms: Hyperinflation would wreck both democracy and economic progress, they argued; only by stabilizing the state budget could the government proceed to restructure the economy. A similar reform program had been adopted in Poland in January 1990, with generally favorable results. However, Western critics of Yeltsin's reform, most notably [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Marshall Goldman]] (who would have favored a more \"gradual\" transition to market capitalism) consider policies adopted in Poland ill-suited for Russia, given that the impact of communism on the Polish economy and political culture was far less indelible.

After all, many officers and especially rank-and-file soldiers had little sympathy for Yeltsin.

On October&nbsp;15, he ordered that a popular referendum be held in December on a new constitution. Rutskoy and Khasbulatov were charged on October&nbsp;15 with \"organizing mass disorders\" and imprisoned. On 23 February 1994 the State Duma amnestied all individuals involved in the events of September\u2013October 1993.  They were later released in 1994 when Yeltsin's position was sufficiently secure.

The new basic law would concentrate sweeping powers in the hands of the president. The bicameral legislature, to sit for only two years, was restricted in crucial areas. The president could choose the prime minister even if the parliament objected and could appoint the military leadership without parliamentary approval. He would head and appoint the members of a new, more powerful security council. If a vote of no confidence in the government was passed, the president would be enabled to keep it in office for three months and could dissolve the parliament if it repeated the vote. The president could veto any bill passed by a simple majority in the lower house, after which a two-thirds majority would be required for the legislation to be passed. The president could not be impeached for contravening the constitution. The central bank would become independent, but the president would need the approval of the State Duma to appoint the bank's governor, who would thereafter be independent of the parliament. At the time, most political observers regarded the draft constitution as shaped by and for Yeltsin and perhaps unlikely to survive him.\n\n===End of the first constitutional period===\n{{See also|1993 Russian constitutional referendum}}\n\nOn December&nbsp;12, Yeltsin managed to push through his new constitution, creating a strong presidency and giving the president sweeping powers to issue decrees.\n\nHowever, the parliament elected on the same day (with a turnout of about 53%) delivered a stunning rebuke to his neoliberal economic program. Candidates identified with Yeltsin's economic policies were overwhelmed by a huge protest vote, the bulk of which was divided between the Communists (who mostly drew their support from industrial workers, out-of-work bureaucrats, some professionals, and pensioners) and the ultra-nationalists (who drew their support from disaffected elements of the lower [[middle classes]]). Unexpectedly, the most surprising insurgent group proved to be the ultranationalist [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|Liberal Democratic Party]] led by [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]]. It gained 23% of the vote while the Gaidar led '[[democratic Choice of Russia|Russia's Choice]]' received 15.5% and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 12.4%. LDPR leader, [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], alarmed many observers abroad with his neo-[[fascism|fascist]], [[chauvinism|chauvinist]] declarations.\n\nNevertheless, the referendum marked the end of the constitutional period defined by the [[Russian Constitution of 1978|constitution]] adopted by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] in 1978, which was [[Russian Constitution of 1978#List of amendments|amended many times]] while [[Russia]] was a part of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Soviet Union]]. Although Russia would emerge as a dual presidential-parliamentary system in theory, substantial power would rest in the president's hands. Russia now has a [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] who heads a cabinet and directs the administration, but the system is an example of presidentialism with the cover of a presidential prime minister, not an effective semipresidential constitutional model. (The premier, for example, is appointed, and in effect freely dismissed, by the president.)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Russia|Politics|1990s}}\n* [[History of post-Soviet Russia]]\n* [[Politics of Russia|Politics of post-Soviet Russia]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | title= Prospects for Constitutionalism in Post-Communist Countries | first= Levent | last= G\u00f6nen\u00e7 | year= 2002 | publisher= Kluwer Law International | isbn= 90-411-1836-5 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VVwC9J6EPSwC&pg=PA161 | ref= harv}}\n* {{cite book | title= A Guide to the Economies in Transition | first= Ian | last= Jeffries | year= 1996 | publisher= Routledge | isbn= 0-415-13684-9 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac5CUNQPXT8C&pg=PA110 | ref= harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=War Junkie: One Man's Addiction to the Worst Places on Earth |first=Jon |last=Steele |publisher=Corgi Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-552-14984-6}}\n*Lehrke, Jesse Paul (2013). \"The Transition to National Armies in the Former Soviet Republics, 1988\u20132005.\" Oxfordshire, UK: Routledge.

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Oerbke lies on the A7 [[autobahn]] east of [[Bad Fallingbostel]] and is the seat of administration for the [[Osterheide]] area.\n\n== History ==\nThe farming village of Oerbke was first mentioned in the surviving records in 1256 and, by 1438, there were 8 farmsteads reported in the area as well as 4 individual houses (''Kotstellen'').

Until 1935 the village had been a purely agricultural settlement for centuries.\n\nDuring the [[Third Reich]] the German armed forces, the [[Wehrmacht]] established a prisoner-of-war camp in Oerbke in which up to 30,000 soldiers from the [[Red Army]] were housed.

{"title_page": "Mold control and prevention in libraries", "text_new": "[[File:Schimmelschaden in historischer Akte2.JPG|thumb|An example of mold damage]]\n'''Mold prevention''' is a conservation activity that is performed in libraries to protect books and\nother materials from deterioration caused by mold growth. [[Mold (fungus)|Mold]] prevention consists of\ndifferent methods, such as chemical treatments, careful environmental control, and manual\ncleaning. Preservationists use one or a combination of these methods to combat mold spores in library collections.\n\nDue to the resilient nature of mold and its potential for damage to library collections, mold prevention has become an important activity among [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] librarians. Although mold is naturally present in both indoor and outdoor environments, under the right circumstances it can become active after being in a dormant state. Mold growth responds to increased moisture, high humidity, and warm temperatures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Kathleen |title=MOLD BASICS |url=https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/2901/2901-7019/2901-7019_pdf.pdf |website=Virginia Cooperative Extension |publisher=Virginia Tech |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> Library collections are particularily vulnerable to mold since mold thrives off of organic, cellulose-based materials such as paper, wood, and textiles made of natural fibers. Changes in the moisture in the atmosphere can lead to mold growth and irreparable damage to library collections.<ref>Baker, Whitney. \"Preservation Perspectives: Mold in the Stacks: A Universal Problem. ''Kentucky Libraries.'' 65(3)(Summer 2001):20-22.</ref>\n\n== Mold ==\nMold is a generic term for a specific type of fungi. Mildew may also refer to types of mold. Since there are so many species of mold, their appearance varies in color and growth habit [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper].  In general, active mold has a musty odor and appears fuzzy, slimy, or damp.  Inactive mold looks dry and powdery <ref>{{cite web |url=https://library.albany.edu/libdru/files/MOLD%20IN%20THE%20LIBRARY%202013.pdf|title=Mold in the Library: Prevention and Response |last=Brown |first=Karen E.K. |publisher=University Libraries, University at Albany |date=November 13, 2013 |website=University Libraries University at Albany State University of New York |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.\n\nMold propagates via spores, which are always present in the environment.  Mold spores can be transferred to an object by mechanical instruments or air circulation.  When spores attach to another organism, and the environment is favorable, they begin to [[germinate]].  Mold produce [[mycelium]] which growth pattern resembles cobwebs.  Mycelium allows the mold to obtain food and nutrients through the host.  Inevitably, the mycelium produces spore sacs and release new spores into the air <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper|title=EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: 3.8 Emergency Salvage of Moldy Books and Paper|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center(NEDCC)|website=NEDCC website |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  Eventually the spores land on new material, and the reproductive cycle begins again.  \n\nIdentifying mold can be a challenge, because some species resemble dust, dirt, or spiderwebs.  In addition, staining caused by mold can be confused with water damage.  Ultraviolet light and magnification are two tools to aid in identifying mold on library collections <ref>{{cite web |url=https://library.albany.edu/libdru/files/MOLD%20IN%20THE%20LIBRARY%202013.pdf |title=Mold in the Library: Prevention and Response |last=Brown |first=Karen E.K. |publisher=University Libraries, University at Albany |date=November 13, 2013 |website=University Libraries University at Albany State University of New York |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  \n\nPoor air circulation, moisture, high temperatures, and environmental humidity are the main causes of mold outbreaks in library collections.  When the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and the relative humidity is above 55 percent, mold begins to develop <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html|title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |last=Nyberg |first=Sarah |publisher=Solinet Preservation Leaflets |date=November 1987 |website=Conservation OnLine (CoOL) |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  Collections kept in basements or  environments with uncontrolled temperature and humidity are most likely to be impacted by a mold outbreak [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper].\n\nMold is a dangerous library pest because of the damage it causes to the collections.  Mold thrives off of paper and books; these objects provide the fungi a source of nutrition, namely the sugar and starches present in the cellulose materials <ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Kathleen |title=Mold Basics |url=https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/2901/2901-7019/2901-7019_pdf.pdf |website=Virginia Cooperative Extension |publisher=Virginia Tech |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>.  Mold feeds on cloth, leather, glues, adhesives, cellulose starch and starches in the sizing.\nFrequently, mold is noticed on the bindings long before it begins on the text blocks .  By feeding on books, mold can cause the paper to become thin, soft, or spongy.  Images and decorative elements can be completely destroyed or, at the very least, become stained.  \n\n== Impact on Materials ==\nWhen a book or paper becomes moldy, the fungi will digest its food source, paper and cloth (such as book covers and bindings), in order to survive. This process stains and destroys books, papers, and other library collections over time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.airsystems-inc.com/air-purification-news/air-quality/mold-in-libraries-causes-significant-indoor-air-quality-problems/|title=Mold In Libraries Causes Significant Indoor Air Quality Problems|website=Extract All|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> During their growth mold and mildew produce citric, gluconic, oxalic, or other [[organic acids]] that can damage paper, leather, cloth, etc. They also at times produce color bodies, leading to staining which is difficult to remove.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minitex.umn.edu/Storage/Preservation/Mold/|title=Mold : Preservation Resources : Minnesota Library Storage (MLAC) : Products & Services : Minitex|website=www.minitex.umn.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> Mold will continually grow until it uses up its food source, which means a library collection could be totally consumed. Unless every mold spore is treated, the issue will just return. Mold's enduring nature makes treatment difficult and prevention all the more necessary.\n\n==Prevention==\n[[File:CCAHAStaff drying.jpg|thumb|Conservation staff drying mold-damaged materials]]\nThe only way to control mold is by altering conditions conducive to its growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/content/mold|title=Mold {{!}} Library Preservation and Conservation Tutorial|website=chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The generally accepted threshold for mold growth is about 15% moisture content because the predominant cause of mold is excess water. Excess water can come from liquid water, as a result of leaks, or water vapor, as a result of high relative humidity due to improper storage, faulty humidifiers, or HVAC malfunctions. While most research shows that fungal growth is most prevalent in conditions in which relative humidity is above 60%, humidity levels below this threshold alone will not prevent mold growth, given the fact that favorable germination environments vary from species to species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.illinois.edu/staff/preservation/services/damage-response/|title=Mold, Pest, and Water Damage Response \u2013 Staff Website \u2013 U of I Library|website=www.library.illinois.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> \n\n=== Environmental Controls ===\nMany libraries monitor a building's atmosphere through the use of [[HVAC]] systems. These built in\nventilation systems help to combat mold growth that occurs as a result of [[relative humidity]]\nlevels greater than 65% and temperature greater than 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit, as well poor air circulation <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nyberg |first1=Sandra |title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref>. Proper use and monitoring of HVAC systems can help to prevent mold problems before they occur. Air ventilation removes existing mold spores from the air and keeps the atmosphere relatively dry and cool. Effective HVAC systems have a good system design and the ability to provide environmental control over entire building areas. Proper maintenance of equipment also lowers the chances that issues will arise due to system outages .<ref>Brown, Dors R. \"Collection Disaster: Mold in the Stacks.\" ''College & Research Libraries News.'' 64(5) (2003):304-306.</ref>  At 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit and 50% relative humidity, the equilibrium moisture content of the environment would be 9.2%, low enough to prevent mold growth.  However, proper air flow and air exchange is required to effectively disrupt the boundary layers of air around room contents, which can have high water vapor levels within the surrounding dry air and promote mold amplification.\n\n===Manual solutions===\n\nManual methods such as [[HEPA]] filtered vacuuming serves as a backup to eliminating mold via environmental control. HEPA vacuums possess air filters that do not allow mold to be spread into the air again. Installing drying fans, wiping dry books and surrounding furniture, as well as air ducts and shelves will also help to prevent further infestations. In extreme cases, some books and items are discarded to protect the rest of the collection from being affected. These preservation activities are provided by available library staff or hired contractors.<ref>Alleman, Steve. \"Coping with an Outbreak of Mold.\" ''LLA Bulletin.'' 61(4) (Spring 1999):217-220.</ref>\n\n=== Storage ===\n\nProper storage practices can be effective in preventing mold growth. Storing materials away from exterior walls and damp areas like basements can reduce the risk of mold growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/managing_a_mold_invasion.pdf|title=Managing a Mold Invasion {{!}} |website=museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/managing_a_mold_invasion.pdf|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> In addition, the use of [[desiccants]] can control humidity inside enclosed containers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/content/mold|title=Mold {{!}} Library Preservation and Conservation Tutorial|website=chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\n==Safe Handling==\nProper handling of affected or damaged materials prevents mold from spreading. Because mold spores are released into the air, it is recommended to wear an [[NIOSH]]-rated respirator before coming into contact with affected materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/what-we-do/forums/collections-care-guidelines-resources/ive-got-mold-my-files|title=I've got mold in my files|last=Stauderman|first=Sarah|date=2013-02-21|website=Smithsonian Institution Archives|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> [[Nitrile glove]]<nowiki/>s should be worn to protect the skin from contact with mold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pdx.edu/news/the-proper-handling-of-rare-books-manuscripts/|title=Gloves or No Gloves?

Materials must always be treated on a surface that can be cleaned with bleach or on neutral, disposable materials such as unprinted [[newsprint]].\n\n=== Potential Health Concerns ===\nMold is harmful to materials, and may cause [[Mold health issues|mold health issues]] in humans. When a library collection experiences a mold outbreak, actions need to be taken to ensure preservation of materials and the good health of the people involved. Mold is more hazardous to those who have allergies or suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma <ref>{{cite web |title=Mold 101: Effects on Human Health |url=https://www.poison.org/articles/2011-oct/mold-101-effects-on-human-health |website=Poison Control: National Capital Poison Center |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>.  Some mold species can irritate other parts of the body through prolonged exposure. In some cases, protective clothing is necessary when handling mold found on library collections.\n\n==Monitoring==\n\nMold spores are always present in the environment and when conditions are favorable, mold will occur <ref>{{cite web |last1=Livingston |first1=Preston |title=Mold Prevention and Remediation in a Library Environment |url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-3762178701/mold-prevention-and-remediation-in-a-library-environment |website=Questia |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> . Regular monitoring of the collection through visual inspection and environmental controls is essential to prevent an outbreak.  \n\nMold leaves a visual indication of its presence. Though mold can be any color, gray and black spots coupled with a musty odor can indicate the presence of mold<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minitex.umn.edu/Storage/Preservation/Mold/|title=Mold : Preservation Resources : Minnesota Library Storage (MLAC) : Products & Services : Minitex|website=www.minitex.umn.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> . Books with these indicators can be isolated and treatment steps can be implemented. Books in the surrounding area can be monitored in case of further infestation. Presence of water or condensation and dust are other factors to look out for that can encourage mold growth. Regular cleaning and inspections will help monitor for mold growth. \n\nThe control and regular monitoring of temperature and humidity levels is vital to prevent mold growth. Guidelines suggest that temperatures be maintained between 65\u00b0-70\u00b0 Fahrenheit and relative humidity between 45%-65%.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nyberg |first1=Sandra |title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> HVAC systems can be utilized and monitored to ensure these levels are maintained. Temperature and humidity values can be systematically measured and recorded to document conditions, to alert of severe fluctuations, and to indicate the functionality of the climate control systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ogden |first1=Sherelyn |title=2.1 Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation |url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation |website=Northeast Document Conservation Center |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> The systems themselves should be regularly checked for accuracy and functionality.\n\n==Treatments for Mold Damage==\n\n=== Chemical Treatments ===\nPreservation librarians use a number of different chemicals to prevent the growth of mold spores. Chemical compounds such as [[ethylene oxide]], [[thymol]], and [[2-Phenylphenol|orthophenyl phenol]] are regularly used.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"The Use of Chlorine Dioxide as a Mold Treatment and its Effect on Paper Acidity: a case study.\" ''The Journal of Academic Librarianship.'' 28(6) (2002): 400-405.</ref>\n[[Chlorine dioxide]] is a chemical that is growing in popularity due its safety level for library employees and patrons. These chemicals act as effective sporicides in a variety of library settings. They are applied on books and surrounding shelves by manual wiping or using chlorine packets that release the chemicals in gaseous form into the air.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"Chlorine Dioxide: a treatment for mold in libraries.\" ''Archival Products.'' 10(3) (2003)</ref>\n\nChemical treatments are often used in enclosed storage areas with little air circulation. They are also used to deal with emergency situations involving mold outbreaks caused by pipe leaks in buildings. In 2000, the [[University of Oklahoma]] Libraries conducted an evaluation of the effects of chlorine packets on mold growth. Paper items that had been exposed to the substance showed lower overall [[pH]] levels than items that had not been treated. Although long-term effects of chemical treatments on paper [[Print permanence|permanence]] and other library materials have not been documented, libraries use this newer method of controlling mold in the stacks.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"The Use of Chlorine Dioxide as a Mold Treatment and Its Effect on Paper Acidity: a case study.\" ''The Journal of Academic Librariansip.'' 28(6) (2002): 400-405.</ref>\n\n===Freeze Drying and UV Light===\n\n[[Freeze drying]] or [[ultraviolet light]] exposure are other ways to inhibit mold growth, although they do not kill mold spores permanently. Eliminating mold through these methods is challenging due to paper degradation caused by light exposure over time. There are also some mold species that have preferences for colder temperatures. Freezing and UV exposure are used as a temporary means to stop mold from spreading throughout library collections.<ref>Baker, Whitney. \"Preservation Perspectives: Mold in the Stacks: A Universal Problem.\" ''Kentucky Libraries.'' 65(3) (Summer 2001): 20-22.</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n\n*[[Mold growth, assessment, and remediation]]\n*[[Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.epa.gov/mold/index.html Molds and Moisture] \u2013 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n*http://www2.lib.udel.edu/Preservation/mold.htm\n*http://preserve.harvard.edu/guidelines/_mold.contamination.pdf\n*http://www.loc.gov/preserv/emerg/dry.html\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mold Prevention}}\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi and humans]]\n[[Category:Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n[[Category:Archival science]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Schimmelschaden in historischer Akte2.JPG|thumb|An example of mold damage]]\n'''Mold prevention''' is a conservation activity that is performed in libraries to protect books and\nother materials from deterioration caused by mold growth. [[Mold (fungus)|Mold]] prevention consists of\ndifferent methods, such as chemical treatments, careful environmental control, and manual\ncleaning. Preservationists use one or a combination of these methods to combat mold spores in library collections.\n\nDue to the resilient nature of mold and its potential for damage to library collections, mold prevention has become an important activity among [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] librarians. Although mold is naturally present in both indoor and outdoor environments, under the right circumstances it can become active after being in a dormant state. Mold growth responds to increased moisture, high humidity, and warm temperatures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Kathleen |title=MOLD BASICS |url=https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/2901/2901-7019/2901-7019_pdf.pdf |website=Virginia Cooperative Extension |publisher=Virginia Tech |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> Library collections are particularily vulnerable to mold since mold thrives off of organic, cellulose-based materials such as paper, wood, and textiles made of natural fibers. Changes in the moisture in the atmosphere can lead to mold growth and irreparable damage to library collections.<ref>Baker, Whitney. \"Preservation Perspectives: Mold in the Stacks: A Universal Problem. ''Kentucky Libraries.'' 65(3)(Summer 2001):20-22.</ref>\n\n== Mold ==\nMold is a generic term for a specific type of fungi. Mildew may also refer to types of mold. Since there are so many species of mold, their appearance varies in color and growth habit [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper].  In general, active mold has a musty odor and appears fuzzy, slimy, or damp.  Inactive mold looks dry and powdery <ref>{{cite web |url=https://library.albany.edu/libdru/files/MOLD%20IN%20THE%20LIBRARY%202013.pdf|title=Mold in the Library: Prevention and Response |last=Brown |first=Karen E.K. |publisher=University Libraries, University at Albany |date=November 13, 2013 |website=University Libraries University at Albany State University of New York |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.\n\nMold propagates via spores, which are always present in the environment.  Mold spores can be transferred to an object by mechanical instruments or air circulation.  When spores attach to another organism, and the environment is favorable, they begin to [[germinate]].  Mold produce [[mycelium]] which growth pattern resembles cobwebs.  Mycelium allows the mold to obtain food and nutrients through the host.  Inevitably, the mycelium produces spore sacs and release new spores into the air <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.8-emergency-salvage-of-moldy-books-and-paper|title=EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: 3.8 Emergency Salvage of Moldy Books and Paper|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center(NEDCC)|website=NEDCC website |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  Eventually the spores land on new material, and the reproductive cycle begins again.  \n\nIdentifying mold can be a challenge, because some species resemble dust, dirt, or spiderwebs.  In addition, staining caused by mold can be confused with water damage.  Ultraviolet light and magnification are two tools to aid in identifying mold on library collections <ref>{{cite web |url=https://library.albany.edu/libdru/files/MOLD%20IN%20THE%20LIBRARY%202013.pdf |title=Mold in the Library: Prevention and Response |last=Brown |first=Karen E.K. |publisher=University Libraries, University at Albany |date=November 13, 2013 |website=University Libraries University at Albany State University of New York |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.  \n\nPoor air circulation, moisture, high temperatures, and environmental humidity are the main causes of mold outbreaks in library collections.  When the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and the relative humidity is above 55 percent, mold begins to develop <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html|title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |last=Nyberg |first=Sarah |publisher=Solinet Preservation Leaflets |date=November 1987 |website=Conservation OnLine (CoOL) |access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>.

Mold thrives off of paper and books; these objects provide the fungi a source of nutrition, namely the sugar and starches present in the cellulose materials <ref>{{cite web |last1=Parrott |first1=Kathleen |title=Mold Basics |url=https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/2901/2901-7019/2901-7019_pdf.pdf |website=Virginia Cooperative Extension |publisher=Virginia Tech |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>.  Mold feeds on cloth, leather, glues, adhesives, cellulose starch and starches in the sizing.\nFrequently, mold is noticed on the bindings long before it begins on the text blocks .  By feeding on books, mold can cause the paper to become thin, soft, or spongy.  Images and decorative elements can be completely destroyed or, at the very least, become stained.  \n\n== Impact on Materials ==\nWhen a book or paper becomes moldy, the fungi will digest its food source, paper and cloth (such as book covers and bindings), in order to survive. This process stains and destroys books, papers, and other library collections over time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.airsystems-inc.com/air-purification-news/air-quality/mold-in-libraries-causes-significant-indoor-air-quality-problems/|title=Mold In Libraries Causes Significant Indoor Air Quality Problems|website=Extract All|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> During their growth mold and mildew produce citric, gluconic, oxalic, or other [[organic acids]] that can damage paper, leather, cloth, etc. They also at times produce color bodies, leading to staining which is difficult to remove.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minitex.umn.edu/Storage/Preservation/Mold/|title=Mold : Preservation Resources : Minnesota Library Storage (MLAC) : Products & Services : Minitex|website=www.minitex.umn.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> Mold will continually grow until it uses up its food source, which means a library collection could be totally consumed. Unless every mold spore is treated, the issue will just return. Mold's enduring nature makes treatment difficult and prevention all the more necessary.\n\n==Prevention==\n[[File:CCAHAStaff drying.jpg|thumb|Conservation staff drying mold-damaged materials]]\nThe only way to control mold is by altering conditions conducive to its growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/content/mold|title=Mold {{!}} Library Preservation and Conservation Tutorial|website=chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The generally accepted threshold for mold growth is about 15% moisture content because the predominant cause of mold is excess water. Excess water can come from liquid water, as a result of leaks, or water vapor, as a result of high relative humidity due to improper storage, faulty humidifiers, or HVAC malfunctions. While most research shows that fungal growth is most prevalent in conditions in which relative humidity is above 60%, humidity levels below this threshold alone will not prevent mold growth, given the fact that favorable germination environments vary from species to species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.illinois.edu/staff/preservation/services/damage-response/|title=Mold, Pest, and Water Damage Response \u2013 Staff Website \u2013 U of I Library|website=www.library.illinois.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> \n\n=== Environmental Controls ===\nMany libraries monitor a building's atmosphere through the use of [[HVAC]] systems. These built in\nventilation systems help to combat mold growth that occurs as a result of [[relative humidity]]\nlevels greater than 65% and temperature greater than 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit, as well poor air circulation <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nyberg |first1=Sandra |title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref>. Proper use and monitoring of HVAC systems can help to prevent mold problems before they occur. Air ventilation removes existing mold spores from the air and keeps the atmosphere relatively dry and cool. Effective HVAC systems have a good system design and the ability to provide environmental control over entire building areas. Proper maintenance of equipment also lowers the chances that issues will arise due to system outages .<ref>Brown, Dors R. \"Collection Disaster: Mold in the Stacks.\" ''College & Research Libraries News.'' 64(5) (2003):304-306.</ref>  At 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit and 50% relative humidity, the equilibrium moisture content of the environment would be 9.2%, low enough to prevent mold growth.  However, proper air flow and air exchange is required to effectively disrupt the boundary layers of air around room contents, which can have high water vapor levels within the surrounding dry air and promote mold amplification.\n\n===Manual solutions===\n\nManual methods such as [[HEPA]] filtered vacuuming serves as a backup to eliminating mold via environmental control. HEPA vacuums possess air filters that do not allow mold to be spread into the air again. Installing drying fans, wiping dry books and surrounding furniture, as well as air ducts and shelves will also help to prevent further infestations. In extreme cases, some books and items are discarded to protect the rest of the collection from being affected. These preservation activities are provided by available library staff or hired contractors.<ref>Alleman, Steve. \"Coping with an Outbreak of Mold.\" ''LLA Bulletin.'' 61(4) (Spring 1999):217-220.</ref>\n\n=== Storage ===\n\nProper storage practices can be effective in preventing mold growth. Storing materials away from exterior walls and damp areas like basements can reduce the risk of mold growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/managing_a_mold_invasion.pdf|title=Managing a Mold Invasion {{!}} |website=museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/managing_a_mold_invasion.pdf|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> In addition, the use of [[desiccants]] can control humidity inside enclosed containers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/content/mold|title=Mold {{!}} Library Preservation and Conservation Tutorial|website=chinapreservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\n==Safe Handling==\nProper handling of affected or damaged materials prevents mold from spreading. Because mold spores are released into the air, it is recommended to wear an [[NIOSH]]-rated respirator before coming into contact with affected materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/what-we-do/forums/collections-care-guidelines-resources/ive-got-mold-my-files|title=I've got mold in my files|last=Stauderman|first=Sarah|date=2013-02-21|website=Smithsonian Institution Archives|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> [[Nitrile glove]]<nowiki/>s should be worn to protect the skin from contact with mold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pdx.edu/news/the-proper-handling-of-rare-books-manuscripts/|title=Gloves or No Gloves?

Materials must always be treated on a surface that can be cleaned with bleach or on neutral, disposable materials such as unprinted [[newsprint]].\n\n=== Potential Health Concerns ===\nMold is harmful to materials, and may cause [[Mold health issues|mold health issues]] in humans. When a library collection experiences a mold outbreak, actions need to be taken to ensure preservation of materials and the good health of the people involved. Mold is more hazardous to those who have allergies or suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma <ref>{{cite web |title=Mold 101: Effects on Human Health |url=https://www.poison.org/articles/2011-oct/mold-101-effects-on-human-health |website=Poison Control: National Capital Poison Center |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>.  Some mold species can irritate other parts of the body through prolonged exposure. In some cases, protective clothing is necessary when handling mold found on library collections.\n\n==Monitoring==\n\nMold spores are always present in the environment and when conditions are favorable, mold will occur <ref>{{cite web |last1=Livingston |first1=Preston |title=Mold Prevention and Remediation in a Library Environment |url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-3762178701/mold-prevention-and-remediation-in-a-library-environment |website=Questia |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> . Regular monitoring of the collection through visual inspection and environmental controls is essential to prevent an outbreak.  \n\nMold leaves a visual indication of its presence. Though mold can be any color, gray and black spots coupled with a musty odor can indicate the presence of mold<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minitex.umn.edu/Storage/Preservation/Mold/|title=Mold : Preservation Resources : Minnesota Library Storage (MLAC) : Products & Services : Minitex|website=www.minitex.umn.edu|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> . Books with these indicators can be isolated and treatment steps can be implemented. Books in the surrounding area can be monitored in case of further infestation. Presence of water or condensation and dust are other factors to look out for that can encourage mold growth. Regular cleaning and inspections will help monitor for mold growth. \n\nThe control and regular monitoring of temperature and humidity levels is vital to prevent mold growth. Guidelines suggest that temperatures be maintained between 65\u00b0-70\u00b0 Fahrenheit and relative humidity between 45%-65%.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nyberg |first1=Sandra |title=Invasion of the Giant Mold Spore |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/nyberg/spore.html |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> HVAC systems can be utilized and monitored to ensure these levels are maintained. Temperature and humidity values can be systematically measured and recorded to document conditions, to alert of severe fluctuations, and to indicate the functionality of the climate control systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ogden |first1=Sherelyn |title=2.1 Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation |url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation |website=Northeast Document Conservation Center |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> The systems themselves should be regularly checked for accuracy and functionality.\n\n==Treatments for Mold Damage==\n\n=== Chemical Treatments ===\nPreservation librarians use a number of different chemicals to prevent the growth of mold spores. Chemical compounds such as [[ethylene oxide]], [[thymol]], and [[2-Phenylphenol|orthophenyl phenol]] are regularly used.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"The Use of Chlorine Dioxide as a Mold Treatment and its Effect on Paper Acidity: a case study.\" ''The Journal of Academic Librarianship.'' 28(6) (2002): 400-405.</ref>\n[[Chlorine dioxide]] is a chemical that is growing in popularity due its safety level for library employees and patrons. These chemicals act as effective sporicides in a variety of library settings. They are applied on books and surrounding shelves by manual wiping or using chlorine packets that release the chemicals in gaseous form into the air.<ref>Southwell, Kristina L. \"Chlorine Dioxide: a treatment for mold in libraries.\" ''Archival Products.'' 10(3) (2003)</ref>\n\nChemical treatments are often used in enclosed storage areas with little air circulation. They are also used to deal with emergency situations involving mold outbreaks caused by pipe leaks in buildings. In 2000, the [[University of Oklahoma]] Libraries conducted an evaluation of the effects of chlorine packets on mold growth. Paper items that had been exposed to the substance showed lower overall [[pH]] levels than items that had not been treated.

Hesemann further stated that Pacelli also directly intervened with the [[World Zionist Organization]] representative [[Nachum Sokolov]], and used his influence to arrange for Mr. Sokolov to meet directly with the Benedict XV in 1917 to discuss a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In 1926, Pacelli also encouraged Catholics in Germany to join the Committee Pro Palestina, which supported Jewish settlements in Palestine.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=77136&cat=15 Newly Discovered Documents Prove Pope Pius XII was a Friend to the Jewish People Before, During and After WWII]</ref>\n\n== 1938 Eucharistic conference ==\nAn International Eucharistic Conference took place in Budapest in Hungary during 1938. Cardinal Pacelli used the opportunity to denounce \"the lugubrious array of the militant godless, shaking the clenched fist of anti-Christ.\" He added, in words that have been misinterpreted: \"Where now are Herod and Pilate, Nero and Diocletian, and Julian the Apostate, and all the persecutors of the First Century? St. Ambrose replies: \u2018The Christians who have been massacred have won the victory; the vanquished were their persecutors.'\"<ref>Time Magazine, \"Religion: Eucharist in Budapest,\" June 6, 1938.</ref>\n\nAccording to a contemporary translation into Hungarian of a second quote from Pacelli's discourse, which was originally delivered in French, Pacelli also stated: \"As opposed to the foes of Jesus, who cried out to his face, 'Crucify him!' we sing him hymns of our loyalty and our love. We act in this fashion, not out of bitterness, not out of a sense of superiority, not out of arrogance toward those whose lips curse him and whose hearts reject him even today.\"<ref>\"Pius XII and the Distorting Ellipsis,\" by Ronald J.

Pius called [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] on March 11, repeatedly protesting against the treatment of Jews. In his 1940 encyclical ''Summi Pontificatus'', Pius rejected anti-semitism, stating that in the Catholic Church there is \"neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision.\"<ref>Dalin, 2005, p. 73</ref> In the summer of 1942, Pius explained to his college of Cardinals the reasons for the great gulf that existed between Jews and Christians at the theological level: \"Jerusalem has responded to His call and to His grace with the same rigid blindness and stubborn ingratitude that has led it along the path of guilt to the murder of God.''\"'' Historian Guido Knopp describes these comments of Pius as being \"incomprehensible\" at a time when \"Jerusalem was being murdered by the million\".<ref>''\"Hitler's Holocaust''\", Guido Knopp, Sutton,2000, p. 250, {{ISBN|0-7509-2700-3}}</ref> Revising a previous opinion of his, [[Michael Phayer]] asserted that Pius did speak out against the holocaust in his 1942 Christmas message.\n\n==Biblical issues==\nThe encyclical, ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', published in September 1943<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 297.</ref>  emphasized the role of the Bible. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the [[Bible]] in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Noting improvements in [[archaeology]], the encyclical reversed [[Pope Leo XIII|Pope Leo XIII's]] encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient [[Jewish]] history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate [[biblical studies]] for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in [[sermon]]s and religious instruction.<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 305.</ref>\n\n==Relations with Israel==\n{{Main|Holy See\u2013Israel relations|Holy See \u2013 Palestinian relations}}\n''[[In multiplicibus curis]]'' is a peace encyclical of Pope Pius XII focusing on the war in Palestine. It was given at Castel Gandolfo, near Rome, October 24, 1948, the tenth year of his Pontificate.\n\nWhen war was declared, the Pope maintained the attitude of impartiality but also looked for possibilities for justice and peace in Palestine and for the respect and protection of the Holy Places. Pope Pius organized charities for the refugees and victims of the war, fully recognizing that this would not be sufficient.\n\nPius also made a proposal for [[Jerusalem]] to become an international city, either under the [[United Nations]] or a related organization. The idea first appeared in the 1949 encyclical ''[[Redemptoris nostri cruciatus]]''. It was later re-proposed during the papacies of [[John XXIII]], [[Paul VI]] and [[John Paul II]].\n\n==Friendly relationship with Guido Mendes==\nIn 1958, Dr. Guido Mendes wrote an article in the [[Jerusalem Post]] explaining how he had been friends with Pope Pacelli since his youth. He said that the Pope had discussed Jewish theology and participated in a Sabbath with important members of the Roman Jewish community. They exchanged ideals and future prospects, with Pacelli later expressing enthusiasm for the new State of Israel.<ref>[TORNIELLI, Andrea. Pio XII, Un Uomo Sul Trono di Pietro, 2007, pp. 661]</ref>\n\n==Conversion of rabbi Israel Zolli==\n{{main|Conversion of Jews to Catholicism during the Holocaust}}\nAccording to biographer Judith Cabaud, in 1944, while conducting a Yom Kippur service, the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Rome]], [[Israel Zolli]] experienced a mystical vision about Jesus Christ. Shortly after the end of World War II, [[Rabbi]] Zolli and his second wife (his first wife had died years before) were received into the Roman Catholic Church. \n\nZolli then went to the Gregorian University. He was baptized by Mgr. Luigi Traglia in the presence of Father Dezza, also known as Paolo Cardinal Dezza. Israel Zolli was named Eugenio Maria Zolli in honor of Pope Pius XII, who was born Eugenio Pacelli.\n\n==Council of Christians and Jews==\nThe [[Council of Christians and Jews]] is a [[voluntary organisation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and is composed of Christians and Jews working together to counter [[anti-semitism]] and other forms of intolerance in Britain. In late 1954, and reflecting the theology of the era, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] instructed the head of [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|English Catholics]] to resign from the council due to its perceived [[indifferentism]], with Catholics not returning until the reforms introduced by the [[Second Vatican Council]].<ref>{{cite web| title=History | website = Council of Christians and Jews |accessdate = 15 June 2009 |url=http://www.ccj.org.uk/history.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090709092929/http://www.ccj.org.uk/history.html |archivedate=9 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Good Friday Prayer for the Jews==\nKneeling had always accompanied the other petitions in the [[Holy Week]] liturgy. In 1955, [[Pope Pius XII]] re-instituted kneeling for this petition (the prayer for the Jews). \n\nThe English translation of the prayer read: \n:Let us pray also for the faithless Jews: that almighty God may remove the veil from their hearts; so that they too may acknowledge Jesus Christ our Lord. Let us pray. Let us kneel. [''pause for silent prayer''] Arise. Almighty and eternal God, who dost not exclude from thy mercy even Jewish faithlessness: hear our prayers, which we offer for the blindness of that people; that acknowledging the light of thy Truth, which is Christ, they may be delivered from their darkness.

Other issues involve Pius's Jewish friendships and his attitude towards the new state of Israel.\n\n==1917 intervention in Palestine==\n{{Main|Pope Benedict XV and Judaism}}\nDocuments discovered in the Vatican archives by [[Michael Hesemann]] indicate that Archbishop Pacelli intervened in 1917, through the German government, to assure the Jews of Palestine that they would be protected from any harm from the Ottoman Turks. Hesemann further stated that Pacelli also directly intervened with the [[World Zionist Organization]] representative [[Nachum Sokolov]], and used his influence to arrange for Mr. Sokolov to meet directly with the Benedict XV in 1917 to discuss a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In 1926, Pacelli also encouraged Catholics in Germany to join the Committee Pro Palestina, which supported Jewish settlements in Palestine.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=77136&cat=15 Newly Discovered Documents Prove Pope Pius XII was a Friend to the Jewish People Before, During and After WWII]</ref>\n\n== 1938 Eucharistic conference ==\nAn International Eucharistic Conference took place in Budapest in Hungary during 1938. Cardinal Pacelli used the opportunity to denounce \"the lugubrious array of the militant godless, shaking the clenched fist of anti-Christ.\" He added, in words that have been misinterpreted: \"Where now are Herod and Pilate, Nero and Diocletian, and Julian the Apostate, and all the persecutors of the First Century? St. Ambrose replies: \u2018The Christians who have been massacred have won the victory; the vanquished were their persecutors.'\"<ref>Time Magazine, \"Religion: Eucharist in Budapest,\" June 6, 1938.</ref>\n\nAccording to a contemporary translation into Hungarian of a second quote from Pacelli's discourse, which was originally delivered in French, Pacelli also stated: \"As opposed to the foes of Jesus, who cried out to his face, 'Crucify him!' we sing him hymns of our loyalty and our love. We act in this fashion, not out of bitterness, not out of a sense of superiority, not out of arrogance toward those whose lips curse him and whose hearts reject him even today.\"<ref>\"Pius XII and the Distorting Ellipsis,\" by Ronald J.

This claim is disputed by those who have access to the original and complete French text, such as Fr. Peter Gumpel, law professor Ronald J. Rychlak, and historian William Doino, Jr., who state that the context indicates that it was an attack on the mass political movements of the day, and was particularly applicable to fascism.<ref>Rychlak and Doino</ref>\n\n==Attitude during the Holocaust==\n{{Main|Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust}}\n{{Further|Pope Pius XII and the Roman razzia}}\n[[Cardinal Secretary of State]] Luigi Maglione received a request from [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog|Isaac Herzog]] in the Spring of 1940 to intercede on behalf of [[Lithuanian Jews]] about to be deported to Germany. Pius called [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] on March 11, repeatedly protesting against the treatment of Jews. In his 1940 encyclical ''Summi Pontificatus'', Pius rejected anti-semitism, stating that in the Catholic Church there is \"neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision.\"<ref>Dalin, 2005, p. 73</ref> In the summer of 1942, Pius explained to his college of Cardinals the reasons for the great gulf that existed between Jews and Christians at the theological level: \"''Jerusalem has responded to His call and to His grace with the same rigid blindness and stubborn ingratitude that has led it along the path of guilt to the murder of God.\"'' Historian Guido Knopp describes these comments of Pius as being \"''incomprehensible''\" at a time when \"''Jerusalem was being murdered by the million''\".<ref>''\"Hitler's Holocaust''\", Guido Knopp, Sutton,2000, p. 250, {{ISBN|0-7509-2700-3}}</ref> In revising his previous opinion [[Michael Phayer]] asserts that Pius did speak out against the holocaust in his 1942 Christmas message.\n\n==Biblical issues==\nThe encyclical, ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', published in September 1943<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 297.</ref>  emphasized the role of the Bible. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the [[Bible]] in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Noting improvements in [[archaeology]], the encyclical reversed [[Pope Leo XIII|Pope Leo XIII's]] encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient [[Jewish]] history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate [[biblical studies]] for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in [[sermon]]s and religious instruction.<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 305.</ref>\n\n==Relations with Israel==\n{{Main|Holy See\u2013Israel relations|Holy See \u2013 Palestinian relations}}\n''[[In multiplicibus curis]]'' is a peace encyclical of Pope Pius XII focusing on the war in Palestine. It was given at Castel Gandolfo, near Rome, October 24, 1948, the tenth year of his Pontificate.\n\nWhen war was declared, the Pope maintained the attitude of impartiality but also looked for possibilities for justice and peace in Palestine and for the respect and protection of the Holy Places. Pope Pius organized charities for the refugees and victims of the war, fully recognizing that this would not be sufficient.\n\nPius also made a proposal for [[Jerusalem]] to become an international city, either under the [[United Nations]] or a related organization. The idea first appeared in the 1949 encyclical ''[[Redemptoris nostri cruciatus]]''. It was later re-proposed during the papacies of [[John XXIII]], [[Paul VI]] and [[John Paul II]].\n\n==Friendly relationship with Guido Mendes==\nIn 1958, Dr. Guido Mendes wrote an article in the [[Jerusalem Post]] explaining how he had been friends with Pope Pacelli since his youth. He said that the Pope had discussed Jewish theology and participated in a Sabbath with important members of the Roman Jewish community. They exchanged ideals and future prospects, with Pacelli later expressing enthusiasm for the new State of Israel.<ref>[TORNIELLI, Andrea. Pio XII, Un Uomo Sul Trono di Pietro, 2007, pp. 661]</ref>\n\n==Conversion of rabbi Israel Zolli==\n{{main|Conversion of Jews to Catholicism during the Holocaust}}\nAccording to biographer Judith Cabaud, in 1944, while conducting a Yom Kippur service, the [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Rome]], [[Israel Zolli]] experienced a mystical vision about Jesus Christ. Shortly after the end of World War II, [[Rabbi]] Zolli and his second wife (his first wife had died years before) were received into the Roman Catholic Church. \n\nZolli then went to the Gregorian University. He was baptized by Mgr. Luigi Traglia in the presence of Father Dezza, also known as Paolo Cardinal Dezza. Israel Zolli was named Eugenio Maria Zolli in honor of Pope Pius XII, who was born Eugenio Pacelli.\n\n==Council of Christians and Jews==\nThe [[Council of Christians and Jews]] is a [[voluntary organisation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and is composed of Christians and Jews working together to counter [[anti-semitism]] and other forms of intolerance in Britain. In late 1954, and reflecting the theology of the era, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] instructed the head of [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|English Catholics]] to resign from the council due to its perceived [[indifferentism]], with Catholics not returning until the reforms introduced by the [[Second Vatican Council]].<ref>{{cite web| title=History | website = Council of Christians and Jews |accessdate = 15 June 2009 |url=http://www.ccj.org.uk/history.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090709092929/http://www.ccj.org.uk/history.html |archivedate=9 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Good Friday Prayer for the Jews==\nKneeling had always accompanied the other petitions in the [[Holy Week]] liturgy. In 1955, [[Pope Pius XII]] re-instituted kneeling for this petition (the prayer for the Jews). \n\nThe English translation of the prayer read: \n:Let us pray also for the faithless Jews: that almighty God may remove the veil from their hearts; so that they too may acknowledge Jesus Christ our Lord. Let us pray. Let us kneel. [''pause for silent prayer''] Arise. Almighty and eternal God, who dost not exclude from thy mercy even Jewish faithlessness: hear our prayers, which we offer for the blindness of that people; that acknowledging the light of thy Truth, which is Christ, they may be delivered from their darkness. Through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n==Jewish orphans controversy==\n{{Main|Jewish orphans controversy}}\nIn 2005, ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' published a document dated 20 November 1946 on the subject of Jewish children baptized in war-time France.

In single-textured games NV10 could put out 4 pixels per cycle, while a two-textured scenario would limit this to two multitextured pixels per cycle, as the chip still had only one TMU per pipeline, just as TNT2.<ref>https://www.anandtech.com/show/391/2</ref> In terms of rendering features, GeForce 256 also added support for Cube Environment Mapping<ref>https://www.anandtech.com/show/391/6</ref> and Dot Product (Dot3) Bump Mapping.<ref>http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/high,294-11.html</ref>\n\nThe integration of the transform and lighting hardware into the GPU itself set the GeForce 256 apart from older 3D accelerators that relied on the CPU to perform these calculations (also known as software transform and lighting). This reduction of 3D graphics solution complexity brought the cost of such hardware to a new low and made it accessible to cheap consumer graphics cards instead of being limited to the previous expensive professionally oriented niche designed for [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). NV10's T&L engine also allowed Nvidia to enter the CAD market with dedicated cards for the first time, with a product called [[Nvidia Quadro|Quadro]]. The Quadro line uses the same silicon chips as the GeForce cards, but has different driver support and certifications tailored to the unique requirements of CAD applications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nvidia.com/page/workstation.html |title=Nvidia Workstation Products |publisher=Nvidia.com |accessdate=October 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Product comparisons==\nCompared to previous high-end 3D game accelerators, such as [[Voodoo3|3dfx Voodoo3 3500]] and [[RIVA TNT2|Nvidia RIVA TNT2 Ultra]], GeForce provided up to a 50% or greater improvement in frame rate in some game titles (ones specifically written to take advantage of the hardware T&L) when coupled with a very low budget CPU. The later release and widespread adoption of GeForce 2 MX/4 MX cards with the same featureset meant unusually long support for the GeForce 256, until approximately 2006, in games such as [[Star Wars: Empire at War]] or [[Half-Life 2]], the latter of which featured a Direct3D 7 path, targeting the fixed-function pipeline of these GPUs.\n\nWithout broad application support at the time, critics pointed out that the T&L technology had little real-world value. Initially, it was only somewhat beneficial in certain situations in a few OpenGL-based 3D [[first-person shooter]] titles, most notably ''[[Quake III Arena]]''. Benchmarks using low budget CPUs like the Celeron 300A would give favourable results for the GeForce 256, but benchmarks done with some CPUs such as the Pentium II 300 would give better results with some older graphics cards like the [[Voodoo2|3dfx Voodoo 2]]. [[3dfx]] and other competing graphics card companies pointed out that a fast CPU could more than make up for the lack of a T&L unit. Software support for hardware T&L was not commonplace until several years after the release of the first Geforce. Early drivers were buggy and slow, while 3dfx cards enjoyed efficient, high speed, mature [[Glide API]] and/or [[MiniGL]] support for the majority of games.

It offered a notably large leap in 3D [[PC gaming]] performance and was the first fully [[Microsoft Direct3D|Direct3D 7]]-compliant 3D accelerator.\n\nThe chip was manufactured by [[TSMC]] using its [[250 nanometer|220&nbsp;nm]] [[CMOS]] [[semiconductor device fabrication|process]].<ref name=\"techspot\">{{cite web |last1=Singer |first1=Graham |title=History of the Modern Graphics Processor, Part 2 |url=https://www.techspot.com/article/653-history-of-the-gpu-part-2/ |website=TechSpot |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref> There are two versions of the GeForce 256, the SDR version released in August 1999 and the DDR version released in December 1999, each with a different type of [[SDRAM]] memory.

In single-textured games NV10 could put out 4 pixels per cycle, while a two-textured scenario would limit this to two multitextured pixels per cycle, as the chip still had only one TMU per pipeline, just as TNT2.<ref>https://www.anandtech.com/show/391/2</ref> In terms of rendering features, GeForce 256 also added support for Cube Environment Mapping<ref>https://www.anandtech.com/show/391/6</ref> and Dot Product (Dot3) Bump Mapping.<ref>http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/high,294-11.html</ref>\n\nThe integration of the transform and lighting hardware into the GPU itself set the GeForce 256 apart from older 3D accelerators that relied on the CPU to perform these calculations (also known as software transform and lighting). This reduction of 3D graphics solution complexity brought the cost of such hardware to a new low and made it accessible to cheap consumer graphics cards instead of being limited to the previous expensive professionally oriented niche designed for [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). NV10's T&L engine also allowed Nvidia to enter the CAD market with dedicated cards for the first time, with a product called [[Nvidia Quadro|Quadro]]. The Quadro line uses the same silicon chips as the GeForce cards, but has different driver support and certifications tailored to the unique requirements of CAD applications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nvidia.com/page/workstation.html |title=Nvidia Workstation Products |publisher=Nvidia.com |accessdate=October 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Product comparisons==\nCompared to previous high-end 3D game accelerators, such as [[Voodoo3|3dfx Voodoo3 3500]] and [[RIVA TNT2|Nvidia RIVA TNT2 Ultra]], GeForce provided up to a 50% or greater improvement in frame rate in some game titles (ones specifically written to take advantage of the hardware T&L) when coupled with a very low budget CPU. The later release and widespread adoption of GeForce 2 MX/4 MX cards with the same featureset meant unusually long support for the GeForce 256, until approximately 2006, in games such as [[Star Wars: Empire at War]] or [[Half-Life 2]], the latter of which featured a Direct3D 7 path, targeting the fixed-function pipeline of these GPUs.\n\nWithout broad application support at the time, critics pointed out that the T&L technology had little real-world value. Initially, it was only somewhat beneficial in certain situations in a few OpenGL-based 3D [[first-person shooter]] titles, most notably ''[[Quake III Arena]]''. Benchmarks using low budget CPUs like the Celeron 300A would give favourable results for the GeForce 256, but benchmarks done with some CPUs such as the Pentium II 300 would give better results with some older graphics cards like the [[Voodoo2|3dfx Voodoo 2]]. [[3dfx]] and other competing graphics card companies pointed out that a fast CPU could more than make up for the lack of a T&L unit. Software support for hardware T&L was not commonplace until several years after the release of the first Geforce. Early drivers were buggy and slow, while 3dfx cards enjoyed efficient, high speed, mature [[Glide API]] and/or [[MiniGL]] support for the majority of games. Only after the GeForce 256 was replaced by the [[GeForce 2 Series|GeForce 2]], and ATI's T&L-equipped [[Radeon R100|Radeon]] was also on the market, did hardware T&L become a widely utilized feature in games.\n\nThe GeForce 256 was also quite expensive for the time and it didn't offer tangible advantages over competitors' products outside of 3D acceleration. For example, its GUI and video playback acceleration were not significantly better than that offered by competition or even older Nvidia products. Additionally, some GeForce cards were plagued with poor analog signal circuitry that caused display output to be blurry.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nAs CPUs became faster, the GeForce 256 demonstrated that the disadvantage of hardware T&L is that, if a CPU is fast enough, it can perform T&L functions faster than the GPU, thus making the GPU a hindrance to rendering performance.
