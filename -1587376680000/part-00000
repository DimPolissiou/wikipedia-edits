Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield\". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different\u2014they change or transmute values.<ref>Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.</ref> Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessity. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.<ref name=\"Shane\">Shane, S. A. (2003). ''A general theory of entrepreneurship: the individual-opportunity nexus''. Northampton, Massachusetts: E. Elgar.</ref>\n\nThe entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful [[innovation]]. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of creative destruction\" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.\n\nThe exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}</ref>\n* Developing a [[business plan]]\n* Hiring the [[human resources]]\n* Acquiring financial and material resources\n* Providing leadership\n* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure\n* [[Risk aversion]]\n\nEconomist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883\u20131950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as \"[[creative destruction]]\" \u2013 launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches.

This institution was introduced in 1908 after a period of so-called freedom of trade (''Gewerbefreiheit'', introduced in 1871) in the [[German Reich]]. However, proof of competence was not required to start a business. In 1935 and in 1953, greater proof of competence was reintroduced (''Gro\u00dfer Bef\u00e4higungsnachweis Kuhlenbeck''), which required craftspeople to obtain a Meister apprentice-training certificate before being permitted to set up a new business.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00181-013-0773-7|title = Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: A natural experiment in German craftsmanship| journal=Empirical Economics| volume=47| issue=3| pages=1067\u20131101|year = 2013|last1 = Rostam-Afschar|first1 = Davud}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other [[Austrian school|Austrian economists]] such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. While the loan from French of the word \"entrepreneur\" dates to the 1850, the term \"entrepreneurship\" was coined around the 1920s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is willing and able to convert a new idea or [[invention]] into a successful innovation.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1976\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6eM6YrMj46sC}}|year=1976|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10762-4}}</ref> Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of [[creative destruction]]\" to replace in whole or in part inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new [[business model]]s, thus creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term [[economic growth]].

An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.\n\nFor Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].\n\nFor Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production\u2013possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1934\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.<ref name=\"Landstrom2007\">{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}</ref> Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for \"entrepreneurs\" as an economic activity creator.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner\u2014or they have a small number of employees\u2014and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s.

Classic cases include Jewish merchants and tradespeople in large U.S. cities in the 19th and early 20th centuries as well as Chinese and Japanese small business owners (restaurants, farmers, shop owners) on the West Coast.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Out Of Print : Ethnic Enterprise in America: Business and Welfare Among Chinese, Japanese, and Blacks : Ivan Light - University of California Press|url = http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|website = www.ucpress.edu|access-date = 2016-01-16|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161020162025/http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|archivedate = 2016-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 2010s, ethnic entrepreneurship has been studied in the case of Cuban business owners in Miami, Indian motel owners of the U.S. and Chinese business owners in [[Chinatown]]s across the United States. While entrepreneurship offers these groups many opportunities for economic advancement, self-employment and business ownership in the United States remain unevenly distributed along racial/ethnic lines.<ref name=\"Chaudhary 318\u2013354\">{{Cite journal|title = Racialized Incorporation: The Effects of Race and Generational Status on Self-Employment and Industry-Sector Prestige in the United States|journal = International Migration Review|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1747-7379|pages = 318\u2013354|volume = 49|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/imre.12087|first = Ali R.|last = Chaudhary}}</ref> Despite numerous success stories of Asian entrepreneurs, a recent statistical analysis of U.S. census data shows that whites are more likely than Asians, African-Americans and Latinos to be self-employed in high prestige, lucrative industries.<ref name=\"Chaudhary 318\u2013354\"/>\n\n=== Institutional ===\nThe American-born British economist [[Edith Penrose]] has highlighted the collective nature of entrepreneurship. She mentions that in modern organizations, human resources need to be combined to better capture and create business opportunities.<ref>Penrose, Edith T. (1959). The Theory of the Growth of the Firm. New York: John Wiley.</ref> The sociologist [[Paul DiMaggio]] (1988:14) has expanded this view to say that \"new institutions arise when organized actors with sufficient resources [institutional entrepreneurs] see in them an opportunity to realize interests that they value highly\".<ref>DiMaggio, P. 1988 'Interest and agency in institutional theory'.

In their book ''[https://www.ubcpress.ca/the-business-of-culture The Business of Culture]'' (2015), Rea and Volland identify three types of cultural entrepreneur: \"cultural personalities\", defined as \"individuals who buil[d] their own personal brand of creativity as a cultural authority and leverage it to create and sustain various cultural enterprises\"; \"tycoons\", defined as \"entrepreneurs who buil[d] substantial clout in the cultural sphere by forging synergies between their industrial, cultural, political, and philanthropic interests\"; and \"collective enterprises\", organizations which may engage in cultural production for profit or not-for-profit purposes.<ref>Christopher Rea and Nicolai Volland, \"The Business of Culture\" (UBC Press, 2015), pp. 4-7.

At times, profit-making [[social enterprise]]s may be established to support the social or cultural goals of the organization but not as an end in itself. For example, an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the [[homelessness|homeless]] may operate a [[restaurant]], both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless people.\n\n===Nascent===\nA nascent [[entrepreneur]] is someone in the process of establishing a business venture.<ref>Reynolds, P. D. and White, S. (1997). The Entrepreneurial Process. Westport, CT: Quorum Books.</ref> In this observation, the nascent entrepreneur can be seen as pursuing an [[Business opportunity|opportunity]], i.e. a possibility to introduce new services or products, serve new markets, or develop more efficient production methods in a profitable manner.<ref>Casson, M., 1982.

In this sense, over time, the nascent venture can move towards being discontinued or towards emerging successfully as an operating entity.\n\nThe distinction between the novice, serial and portfolio entrepreneurs is an example of behavior-based categorization.<ref>Ucbasaran, D., Westhead, P. and Wright, M., 2009.

Such research will help separate entrepreneurial action into its basic sub-activities and elucidate the inter- relationships between activities, between an activity (or sequence of activities) and an individual's motivation to form an opportunity belief, and between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the knowledge needed to form an opportunity belief. With this research, scholars will be able to begin constructing a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action.\n\nScholars interested in nascent entrepreneurship tend to focus less on the single act of opportunity exploitation and more on the series of actions in new venture emergence,<ref name=\"Delmar, F 2004\"/><ref>Kim, P.H., Longest, K.C. and Lippmann, S., 2015.

B. 2007\"/> Indeed, nascent entrepreneurs undertake numerous [[entrepreneurial]] activities, including actions that make their businesses more concrete to themselves and others. For instance, nascent entrepreneurs often look for and purchase facilities and equipment; seek and obtain financial backing, form [[legal entities]], organize teams; and dedicate all their time and energy to their business<ref>Carter, N.M., Gartner, W.B. and Reynolds, P.D., 1996. Exploring start-up event sequences. Journal of business venturing, 11(3), pp.151-166.</ref>\n\n=== Project-based ===\nProject entrepreneurs are individuals who are engaged in the repeated assembly or creation of temporary organizations.<ref name=\"Ferriani2009\">Ferriani, S., Cattani, G., C. Baden-Fuller (2009) \"The Relational Antecedents of Project-Entrepreneurship: Network Centrality, Team Composition, and Project Performance\", Research Policy, 2009, 38 (10): 1545\u20131558.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlM1NabFZra1RiUDg/edit?usp=sharing]</ref> These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends. Industries where project-based enterprises are widespread include: [[sound recording]], [[film production]], [[software development]], television production, [[new media]] and construction.<ref name=\"Faulkner1987\">{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkner | first1 = R.

A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model or team for a subsequent project.\n\nProject entrepreneurs are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks typical of the entrepreneurial process.<ref name=\"DeFillippi2004\">DeFillippi, R., & Spring, S. 2004 Project entrepreneurs for project-based enterprises: Extension or complement to project management competencies? Projects and Profits, 4(2): 50-57.</ref> Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize the creation of a new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.\n\n=== Millennial ===\nThe term \"millennial entrepreneur\" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media\u2014the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as [[Generation Y]], these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications. There have been many breakthrough businesses that have come from millennial entrepreneurs such as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who created [[Facebook]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/the-richest-millennial-entrepreneurs-in-america.htm.html|title=The 10 Richest Millennial Entrepreneurs in America|date=December 12, 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=June 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Despite the expectation of millennial success, there have been recent studies that have proven this to not be the case.  The comparison between millennials who are self-employed and those who are not self-employed shows that the latter is higher. The reason for this is because they have grown up in a different generation and attitude than their elders. Some of the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs are the economy, debt from schooling and the challenges of regulatory compliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Millenial_IB.pdf|title=The Missing Millennial Entrepreneurs|last=Wilmouth|first=Daniel|website=U.S. Small Business Administration|access-date=June 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Other ===\nSteve Bank who is a tutor of Berkeley, Columbia, and Stanford in the United States.

The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:\n* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)\n* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)\n* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)\n\n[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]\nEntrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Z\u00fcrich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Mart\u00ednez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|pmid=24478664|pmc=3897871}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Coachability\" and advice taking ===\nThe ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161\u2013176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}</ref> At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival).

Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.\n\nMichelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only \"runs\" it.\n\n== Resources and financing ==\n\n=== Entrepreneurial resources ===\nAn entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities. Economic value creating both tangible and intangible sources are considered as entrepreneurial resources.

One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to \"bootstrap\" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company.

Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield\". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different\u2014they change or transmute values.<ref>Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.</ref> Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessity. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.<ref name=\"Shane\">Shane, S. A. (2003). ''A general theory of entrepreneurship: the individual-opportunity nexus''. Northampton, Massachusetts: E. Elgar.</ref>\n\nThe entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful [[innovation]]. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of creative destruction\" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.\n\nThe exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}</ref>\n* Developing a [[business plan]]\n* Hiring the [[human resources]]\n* Acquiring financial and material resources\n* Providing leadership\n* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure\n* [[Risk aversion]]\n\nEconomist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883\u20131950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as \"[[creative destruction]]\" \u2013 launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches.

This institution was introduced in 1908 after a period of so-called freedom of trade (''Gewerbefreiheit'', introduced in 1871) in the [[German Reich]]. However, proof of competence was not required to start a business. In 1935 and in 1953, greater proof of competence was reintroduced (''Gro\u00dfer Bef\u00e4higungsnachweis Kuhlenbeck''), which required craftspeople to obtain a Meister apprentice-training certificate before being permitted to set up a new business.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00181-013-0773-7|title = Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: A natural experiment in German craftsmanship| journal=Empirical Economics| volume=47| issue=3| pages=1067\u20131101|year = 2013|last1 = Rostam-Afschar|first1 = Davud}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other [[Austrian school|Austrian economists]] such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. While the loan from French of the word \"entrepreneur\" dates to the 1850, the term \"entrepreneurship\" was coined around the 1920s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is willing and able to convert a new idea or [[invention]] into a successful innovation.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1976\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6eM6YrMj46sC}}|year=1976|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10762-4}}</ref> Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of [[creative destruction]]\" to replace in whole or in part inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new [[business model]]s, thus creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term [[economic growth]]. The idea that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in [[endogenous growth theory]]{{clarify|date=October 2013}} and as such continues to be debated in academic economics. An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.\n\nFor Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].\n\nFor Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production\u2013possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1934\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.<ref name=\"Landstrom2007\">{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}</ref> Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for \"entrepreneurs\" as an economic activity creator.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business, not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner\u2014or they have a small number of employees\u2014and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s. In this way, the term \"entrepreneur\" may be more closely associated with the term \"[[Startup company|startup]]\".

Such research will help separate entrepreneurial action into its basic sub-activities and elucidate the inter- relationships between activities, between an activity (or sequence of activities) and an individual's motivation to form an opportunity belief, and between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the knowledge needed to form an opportunity belief. With this research, scholars will be able to begin constructing a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action.\n\nScholars interested in nascent entrepreneurship tend to focus less on the single act of opportunity exploitation and more on the series of actions in new venture emergence,<ref name=\"Delmar, F 2004\"/><ref>Kim, P.H., Longest, K.C. and Lippmann, S., 2015.

For instance, nascent entrepreneurs often look for and purchase facilities and equipment; seek and obtain financial backing, form [[legal entities]], organize teams; and dedicate all their time and energy to their business<ref>Carter, N.M., Gartner, W.B. and Reynolds, P.D., 1996.

Baden-Fuller (2009) \"The Relational Antecedents of Project-Entrepreneurship: Network Centrality, Team Composition, and Project Performance\", Research Policy, 2009, 38 (10): 1545\u20131558.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlM1NabFZra1RiUDg/edit?usp=sharing]</ref> These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends. Industries where project-based enterprises are widespread include: [[sound recording]], [[film production]], [[software development]], television production, [[new media]] and construction.<ref name=\"Faulkner1987\">{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkner | first1 = R.

A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model or team for a subsequent project.\n\nProject entrepreneurs are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks typical of the entrepreneurial process.<ref name=\"DeFillippi2004\">DeFillippi, R., & Spring, S. 2004 Project entrepreneurs for project-based enterprises: Extension or complement to project management competencies? Projects and Profits, 4(2): 50-57.</ref> Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize the creation of a new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.\n\n=== Millennial ===\nThe term \"millennial entrepreneur\" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media\u2014the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as [[Generation Y]], these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications. There have been many breakthrough businesses that have come from millennial entrepreneurs such as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who created [[Facebook]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/the-richest-millennial-entrepreneurs-in-america.htm.html|title=The 10 Richest Millennial Entrepreneurs in America|date=December 12, 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=June 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Despite the expectation of millennial success, there have been recent studies that have proven this to not be the case.  The comparison between millennials who are self-employed and those who are not self-employed shows that the latter is higher.

The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:\n* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)\n* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)\n* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)\n\n[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]\nEntrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Z\u00fcrich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Mart\u00ednez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|pmid=24478664|pmc=3897871}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Coachability\" and advice taking ===\nThe ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161\u2013176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}</ref> At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival). This research also shows that older and larger founding teams, presumably those with more subject expertise, are less coachable than younger and smaller founding teams.\n\n===Strategies===\nStrategies that entrepreneurs may use include:\n* [[Innovation]] of new products, services or processes<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news|last1=Qureshi|first1=Hamid|title=Decoding Right Strategies for Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/decoding-right-strategies-for-entrepreneurship/195820.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|work=Greater Kashmir|date=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n* Continuous process improvement (CPI)<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Exploration of new business models\n* Use of technology<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Use of [[business intelligence]]\n* Use of economical strategics\n* Development of future products and services<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Optimized talent management<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Designing individual/opportunity nexus ===\nAccording to Shane and Venkataraman, entrepreneurship comprises both \"enterprising individuals\" and \"entrepreneurial opportunities\", so researchers should study the nature of the individuals who identify opportunities when others do not, the opportunities themselves and the nexus between individuals and opportunities.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2000.2791611 | journal=Academy of Management Review | date=2000 | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=217\u2013226 | first=S. | last=Shane| title=The Promise of Entrepreneurship as a Field of Research }}</ref> On the other hand, Reynolds et al.<ref>Reynolds PD, Hay M, Bygrave WD et al.

''Academy of Management Review.''</ref> Words like \"leadership\" and \"entrepreneurship\" do not always translate well into other cultures and languages. For example, in North America a leader is often thought of as charismatic, but German culture frowns on such charisma due to the charisma of [[Nazi Party | Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] (1889-1945).

Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.\n\nMichelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only \"runs\" it.\n\n== Resources and financing ==\n\n=== Entrepreneurial resources ===\nAn entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities. Economic value creating both tangible and intangible sources are considered as entrepreneurial resources. Their economic value is generating activities or services through mobilization by entrepreneurs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Organizing Entrepreneurship|author1=Anna Grandori |author2=Laura Gaillard Giordani |publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-57037-4|location=|pages=}}</ref> Entrepreneurial resources can be divided into two fundamental categories: tangible and intangible resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach|author1=Charles W.

One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to \"bootstrap\" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-valuation sale of the company or IPO to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.\n\nOne consensus definition of bootstrapping sees it as \"a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ebbena|first1=Jay|last2=Johnson|first2=Alec|title=Bootstrapping in small firms: An empirical analysis of change over time|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|publicationdate=November 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=851\u2013865|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.007|quote=Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001 and Harrison and Mason, 1997).|year=2006}}</ref> The majority of businesses require less than $10,000 to launch,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} which means that personal savings are most often used to start.

After completing his early education at Naz High School, Shah's family married young Shah to a relative. Shah then proceeded to Karachi for higher education.\n\nIn Karachi, Shah enrolled at [[Karachi University]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]]. Later, he received a [[Bachelor of Laws]] from [[S. M. Law College]].\n\nDuring the course of his studies at [[Sindh Muslim Law College]], Shah benefited from the company and guidance of his then professor, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], building a bond that would last for the duration of his professor's life.<ref>SM Law College Honour Roll {{cite web |url=http://www.smlawcollege.edu.pk/rollofhonour.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805201309/http://www.smlawcollege.edu.pk/rollofhonour.php |archive-date=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nShah entered politics on being elected the Chairman of Khairpur's district council under Field Marshal [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]]\u2019s system of Basic Democracy in the 1960s.<ref name=\"cmsindh.gov.pk\"/> His close association with Bhutto led to his joining [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]\u2019s PPP shortly after PPP\u2019s creation in 1967.\n\nHe contested general elections of 1970 with a PPP-ticket from Khairpur Mirs and defeated his opponents, Comrade Syed Baqir Ali Shah (provincial president of [[National Awami Party (Wali)]] and Council Member of Communist Party of Pakistan) and Syed Ghous Ali Shah. Recognizing young Shah's capability, Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] appointed Qaim Ali Shah to his small cabinet as the Federal Minister for Industries and Kashmir Affairs.\n\nAfter General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]]'s coup d'\u00e9tat in July 1977, Shah was arrested along with Bhutto and other cabinet ministers. Unlike other PPP bigwigs such as [[Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi]], Ghulam Mustafa Khar, Makhdoom Khaliq-uz-Zaman, Mir Hazar Khan Bijarani, who either left the party or became inactive, Qaim Ali Shah remained loyal to the party.<ref name=\"archives.dawn.com\">Dawn Profile http://archives.dawn.com/2008/04/08/local12.htm</ref> During the eleven years of Gen. Zia-ul-Haq\u2019s rule, Shah, and members of his family suffered imprisonment, torture, virtual poverty (as accounts and lands were seized), and constant fear. Most notably, Shah\u2019s politically active nephew, Syed Parvez Ali Shah Jillani attained \u2018Prisoner of Conscience\u2019 status in Amnesty International's 1985 report for enduring six years of torture in General Zia's torture cells.

His landslide victory in the 1988 elections from his constituency, Khairpur Mirs, paved way for his appointment as the 17th Chief Minister of Sindh on 2 December 1988.\n\nSubsequently, Shah was elected as a Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA), Sindh in 1990, 1993, 2002 and 2008. He lost the only election of his career in 1997 when the PPP was nearly routed from parliament. Later, he made a bid for a senate seat, and won his first and only senate term in late 1997.<ref>http://www.senate.gov.pk/en/profile.php?uid=347</ref>\n\nHe won seven out of eight general elections he contested, becoming a MPA six times, and Member of National Assembly (MNA) and senator once.

After completing his early education at Naz High School, Shah's family married young Shah to a relative. Shah then proceeded to Karachi for higher education.\n\nIn Karachi, Shah enrolled at [[Karachi University]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]]. Later, he received a [[Bachelor of Laws]] from [[S. M. Law College]].\n\nDuring the course of his studies at [[Sindh Muslim Law College]], Shah benefited from the company and guidance of his then professor, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], building a bond that would last for the duration of his professor's life.<ref>SM Law College Honour Roll {{cite web |url=http://www.smlawcollege.edu.pk/rollofhonour.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805201309/http://www.smlawcollege.edu.pk/rollofhonour.php |archive-date=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nShah entered politics on being elected the Chairman of Khairpur's district council under Field Marshal [[Ayub Khan]]\u2019s system of Basic Democracy in the 1960s.<ref name=\"cmsindh.gov.pk\"/> His close association with Bhutto led to his joining [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]\u2019s PPP shortly after PPP\u2019s creation in 1967.\n\nHe contested general elections of 1970 with a PPP-ticket from Khairpur Mirs and defeated his opponents, Comrade Syed Baqir Ali Shah (provincial president of [[National Awami Party (Wali)]] and Council Member of Communist Party of Pakistan) and Syed Ghous Ali Shah. Recognizing young Shah's capability, Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] appointed Qaim Ali Shah to his small cabinet as the Federal Minister for Industries and Kashmir Affairs.\n\nAfter General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]]'s coup d'\u00e9tat in July 1977, Shah was arrested along with Bhutto and other cabinet ministers. Unlike other PPP bigwigs such as [[Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi]], Ghulam Mustafa Khar, Makhdoom Khaliq-uz-Zaman, Mir Hazar Khan Bijarani, who either left the party or became inactive, Qaim Ali Shah remained loyal to the party.<ref name=\"archives.dawn.com\">Dawn Profile http://archives.dawn.com/2008/04/08/local12.htm</ref> During the eleven years of Gen. Zia-ul-Haq\u2019s rule, Shah, and members of his family suffered imprisonment, torture, virtual poverty (as accounts and lands were seized), and constant fear. Most notably, Shah\u2019s politically active nephew, Syed Parvez Ali Shah Jillani attained \u2018Prisoner of Conscience\u2019 status in Amnesty International's 1985 report for enduring six years of torture in General Zia's torture cells.

His landslide victory in the 1988 elections from his constituency, Khairpur Mirs, paved way for his appointment as the 17th Chief Minister of Sindh on 2 December 1988.\n\nSubsequently, Shah was elected as a Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA), Sindh in 1990, 1993, 2002 and 2008. He lost the only election of his career in 1997 when the PPP was nearly routed from parliament. Later, he made a bid for a senate seat, and won his first and only senate term in late 1997.<ref>http://www.senate.gov.pk/en/profile.php?uid=347</ref>\n\nHe won seven out of eight general elections he contested, becoming a MPA six times, and Member of National Assembly (MNA) and senator once.

[[Sonia Gandhi]], party chief of the [[Indian National Congress]] and her son Rahul Gandhi, party general secretary did not agree to this.\n\nSix months after his father's death, he began an ''odarpu yatra'' (condolence tour) as promised earlier to go and meet the families of those alleged to have either committed suicide or suffered ill health on the news of his father's death. The Congress party's central leadership directed him to call off his ''odarpu yatra'', an order which he defied leading to a fallout between the high command and himself.

The favours are mainly land, mining leases and licences for new industries. Jagan, Member of Parliament from Kadapa and late chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy's son, was arrested by the investigating agency on 27 May in connection with a disproportionate assets case. A CBI special court in Hyderabad on 28 May remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days.

{"title_page": "South African cuisine", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{Culture of South Africa}}\n[[Image:Potjiekos2.jpg|thumb|[[Potjiekos]], literally translated \"small pot food\", is a [[stew]] prepared outdoors in a traditional round, [[cast iron]], three-legged pot. This one is being cooked on a barbecue.]]\n[[File:LocationSouthAfrica.svg|thumb|Location of South Africa]]\n'''South African cuisine''' includes both cookery practiced by [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous people]] of Africa such as the [[Sotho language|Sotho]]- and [[Nguni languages|Nguni]]-speaking people, and different styles of cookery that emerged from several waves of colonisation and immigration introduced during the colonial period. The colonial influences include that of white European people of mostly [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[German people|German]], [[French people|French]] and [[British people|British]] descent and their Indo-Asian [[Slavery|slaves]] or servants. The latter includes the cuisine of the \"[[Cape Malay]]\" people, which has many characteristics of [[Indonesia]].\n\n==Indigenous cookery==\nIn the precolonial period, indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of foods including fruits, nuts, bulbs, leaves and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of wild game. The introduction of domestic cattle and grain crops by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] speakers who arrived in the southern regions from central Africa since 10,000 BC and the spread of cattle keeping to [[Khoisan]] groups enabled products and the availability of fresh meat on demand. The pre-colonial diet consisted primarily of cooked grains, especially [[sorghum]] and [[millet]], fermented milk (somewhat like yogurt) and roasted or stewed meat. At some point, maize replaced sorghum as the primary grain, and there is some dispute as to whether maize, a Central American crop, arrived with European settlers (notably the Portuguese) or spread through Africa before white settlement via Africans returning from the Americas during the era of the slave trade. People also kept sheep and goats, and communities often organised vast hunts for the abundant game, but the beef was considered the absolutely most important and high-status meat. The ribs of any cattle that were slaughtered in many communities were so prized that they were offered to the chief of the village.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\nIn many ways, the daily food of South African families can be traced to the indigenous foods that their ancestors ate. A typical meal in a Bantu-speaking, South African household is a stiff, fluffy porridge of maize meal (called \"pap,\" and very similar to American grits) with a flavorful stewed meat gravy. Traditional rural families (and many urban ones) often ferment their pap for a few days \u2013 especially if it is sorghum instead of maize \u2013 which gives it a tangy flavour. The Sotho-Tswana call this fermented pap, \"ting.\"{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\nThe vegetable is often some sort of pumpkin, varieties of which are indigenous to South Africa, although now many people eat pumpkins that originated in other countries. Rice and [[bean]]s are also very popular even though they are not indigenous. Another common vegetable dish, which arrived in South Africa with its many Irish immigrants, but which has been adopted by South Africans, is shredded cabbage and white potatoes cooked with butter.\n\nFor many South Africans meat is the center of any meal. The Khoisan ate roasted meat, and they also dried meat for later use. The influence of their diet is reflected in the common Southern African love of barbecue (generally called in South Africa by its Afrikaans name, a \"braai\") and biltong (dried preserved meat). As in the past, when men kept cattle as their prized possession in the rural areas, South Africans have a preference for beef. Today, South Africans enjoy not only beef, but mutton, goat, chicken and other meats as a centerpiece of a meal. On weekends, many South African families have a \"braai,\" and the meal usually consists of \"pap and vleis\", which is maize meal and grilled meat. Eating meat even has a ritual significance in both traditional and modern South African culture. In [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu]] culture, for weddings, initiations, the arrival of family members after a long trip and other special occasions, families will buy a live animal and slaughter it at home, and then prepare a large meal for the community or neighbourhood. Participants often say that spilling the blood of the animal on the ground pleases the ancestors who invisibly gather around the carcass. On holiday weekends, entrepreneurs will set up pens of live animals along the main roads of townships\u2014mostly sheep and goats\u2014for families to purchase, slaughter, cook and eat.  Beef being the most prized meat, for weddings, affluent families often purchase a live steer for slaughter at home. Vegetarianism is generally met with puzzlement among Black South Africans, although most meals are served with vegetables such as pumpkin, beans and cabbage.\n\n==Non-indigenous cookery==\n[[Image:Droewors.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A piece of [[dro\u00ebwors]], a dried sausage]]\nDuring the pioneering days of the 17th century, new foods such as [[biltong]], ''[[dro\u00ebwors]]'' (dried sausage) and [[rusk]]s evolved locally out of necessity.\n\n===Cape Dutch and Cape Malay===\nA very distinctive regional style of South African cooking is often referred to as \"[[Cape Dutch]]\". This cuisine is characterised by the use of spices such as [[nutmeg]], [[allspice]] and [[chili pepper]]s. The Cape Dutch cookery style owes at least as much to the cookery of the [[Slavery|slaves]] brought by the [[Dutch East India Company]] to the Cape from [[Bengal]], [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Malaysia]] as it does to the European styles of cookery imported by settlers from the [[Netherlands]], and this is reflected in the use of eastern spices and the names given to many of these dishes.\n\nThe [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay]] influence has brought spicy [[curry|curries]], [[sambal]]s, pickled fish, and variety of fish [[stew]]s.\n\n[[Bobotie]] is a South African dish that has Cape Malay origins. It consists of spiced [[ground meat|minced meat]] baked with an egg-based topping. Of the many dishes common to South Africa, bobotie is perhaps closest to being the national dish, because it isn't commonly found in any other country.  The recipe originates from the [[Dutch East India Company]] colonies in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], with the name derived from the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''bobotok''. It is also made with curry powder leaving it with a slight \"tang\". It is often served with [[sambal]], a hint of its origins from the [[Malay Archipelago]].\n\nSouth African [[yellow rice]], a sweet dish made with [[raisin]]s, [[cinnammon]] and [[sugar]], also has its origins in Cape Malay cookery, often being referred to as Cape Malay yellow rice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grouprecipes.com/68703/cape-malay-yellow-rice.html|title=Cape Malay Yellow Rice Recipe|website=Group Recipes|accessdate=29 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===French cuisine===\n\nFrench Huguenot refugees from persecution, brought wines as well as their traditional recipes from France.\n\n===Indian cookery===\n[[Image:Quarter Mutton Bunny Chow.jpg|thumb|right|An example of [[bunny chow]] served in [[Durban]], originated in the [[Indian South Africans|Indian South African]] community.<ref name=FromCurries>{{cite book |title=From Curries to Kebabs: Recipes from the Indian Spice Trail |page=184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yAgfQ6uxhRgC&pg=184#v=onepage&q&f=false |author=Jaffrey, Madhur |date=2003 |accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>]]\n[[Curry|Curried]] dishes are popular with lemon juice in South Africa among people of all ethnic origins; many dishes came to the country with the thousands of [[Indians in South Africa|Indian]] labourers brought to South Africa in the nineteenth century. The Indians have introduced a different line of culinary practices, including a variety of curries, [[sweet]]s, [[chutney]]s, fried snacks such as [[samosa]], and other savoury foods. [[Bunny chow]], a dish from [[Durban]] (which has a large Indian community) consisting of a hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with curry, has adapted into mainstream South African cuisine and has become quite popular.\n\n==Beverages==\n{{main|Beer in South Africa}}\n{{see also|South African wine}}\n\n[[Image:Mageu (carton and glass).JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Mageu]] is a traditional South African non-alcoholic drink, popular among many of the [[Nguni people]], made from [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[maize|mealie]] [[porridge|pap]]. Home production is still widely practised, but the drink is also available at many supermarkets.]]\nBeer has been an important beverage in South Africa for hundreds of years among indigenous people long before colonisation and the arrival of Europeans with their own beer drinking traditions. Traditional beer was brewed from local grains, especially sorghum. Beer was so prized that it became central to many ceremonies, like betrothals and weddings, in which one family ceremoniously offered beer to the other family.  Unlike European beer, South African traditional beer was unfiltered and cloudy and had a low alcohol content. Around the turn of the centuries, when white owned industry began studying malnutrition among urban workers, it was discovered that traditional beer provided crucial vitamins sometimes not available in the grain heavy traditional diet and even less available in urban industrial slums.\n\nWhen South Africa's mines were developed and black South Africans began to urbanise, women moved to the city also, and began to brew beer for the predominantly male labour force \u2013 a labour force that was mostly either single or who had left their wives back in the rural areas under the migrant labour system. That tradition of urban women making beer for the labour force persists in South Africa to the extent that informal bars and taverns (''[[shebeen]]s'') are typically owned by women (shebeen queens).  Today, most urban dwellers buy beer manufactured by industrial breweries that make beer that is like beer one would buy in Europe and America, but rural people and recent immigrants to the city still enjoy the cloudy, unfiltered traditional beer.\n\nCompared to an American, Korean or western European diet, milk and milk products are very prominent in the traditional Black South African diet.  As cows were considered extremely desirable domestic animals in precolonial times, milk was abundant. In the absence of refrigeration, various kinds of soured milk, somewhat like yogurt, were a dietary mainstay. A visitor to any African village in the 1800s would have been offered a large calabash of cool fermented milk as a greeting. Because milk cows allowed women to wean their children early and become fertile more quickly, local cultures had a number of sayings connecting cattle, milk and population growth, such as the Sotho-Tswana saying, \"cattle beget children.\"  Today, in the dairy section of South Africa's supermarkets, one will find a variety of kinds of milk, sour milk, sour cream, and other modern versions of traditional milk products.\n\n==Restaurants and fast food outlets==\nSouth Africa can be said to have a significant \"eating out\" culture. While there are some restaurants that specialise in traditional South African dishes or modern interpretations thereof, restaurants featuring other cuisines such as [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[West African cuisine|West African]], [[Congolese cuisine|Congolese]], and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] can be found in all of the major cities and many of the larger towns.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} There are also many home-grown chain restaurants, such as [[Spur (restaurant chain)|Spur]] and [[Dulce Cafe]].\n\nThere is also a proliferation of fast food restaurants in South Africa.

This one is being cooked on a barbecue.]]\n[[File:LocationSouthAfrica.svg|thumb|Location of South Africa]]\n'''South African cuisine''' includes both cookery practiced by [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous people]] of Africa such as the [[Sotho language|Sotho]]- and [[Nguni languages|Nguni]]-speaking people, and different styles of cookery that emerged from several waves of colonisation and immigration introduced during the colonial period. The colonial influences include that of white European people of mostly [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[German people|German]], [[French people|French]] and [[British people|British]] descent and their Indo-Asian [[Slavery|slaves]] or servants. The latter includes the cuisine of the \"[[Cape Malay]]\" people, which has many characteristics of [[Indonesia]].\n\n==Indigenous cookery==\nIn the precolonial period, indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of foods including fruits, nuts, bulbs, leaves and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of wild game. The introduction of domestic cattle and grain crops by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] speakers who arrived in the southern regions from central Africa since 10,000 BC and the spread of cattle keeping to [[Khoisan]] groups enabled products and the availability of fresh meat on demand. The pre-colonial diet consisted primarily of cooked grains, especially [[sorghum]] and [[millet]], fermented milk (somewhat like yogurt) and roasted or stewed meat. At some point, maize replaced sorghum as the primary grain, and there is some dispute as to whether maize, a Central American crop, arrived with European settlers (notably the Portuguese) or spread through Africa before white settlement via Africans returning from the Americas during the era of the slave trade. People also kept sheep and goats, and communities often organised vast hunts for the abundant game, but the beef was considered the absolutely most important and high-status meat. The ribs of any cattle that were slaughtered in many communities were so prized that they were offered to the chief of the village.{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\nIn many ways, the daily food of South African families can be traced to the indigenous foods that their ancestors ate. A typical meal in a Bantu-speaking, South African household is a stiff, fluffy porridge of maize meal (called \"pap,\" and very similar to American grits) with a flavorful stewed meat gravy. Traditional rural families (and many urban ones) often ferment their pap for a few days \u2013 especially if it is sorghum instead of maize \u2013 which gives it a tangy flavour. The Sotho-Tswana call this fermented pap, \"ting.\"{{citation needed| date= October 2017}}\n\nThe vegetable is often some sort of pumpkin, varieties of which are indigenous to South Africa, although now many people eat pumpkins that originated in other countries. Rice and [[bean]]s are also very popular even though they are not indigenous. Another common vegetable dish, which arrived in South Africa with its many Irish immigrants, but which has been adopted by South Africans, is shredded cabbage and white potatoes cooked with butter.\n\nFor many South Africans meat is the center of any meal. The Khoisan ate roasted meat, and they also dried meat for later use. The influence of their diet is reflected in the common Southern African love of barbecue (generally called in South Africa by its Afrikaans name, a \"braai\") and biltong (dried preserved meat). As in the past, when men kept cattle as their prized possession in the rural areas, South Africans have a preference for beef. Today, South Africans enjoy not only beef, but mutton, goat, chicken and other meats as a centerpiece of a meal. On weekends, many South African families have a \"braai,\" and the meal usually consists of \"pap and vleis\", which is maize meal and grilled meat. Eating meat even has a ritual significance in both traditional and modern South African culture. In [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu]] culture, for weddings, initiations, the arrival of family members after a long trip and other special occasions, families will buy a live animal and slaughter it at home, and then prepare a large meal for the community or neighbourhood. Participants often say that spilling the blood of the animal on the ground pleases the ancestors who invisibly gather around the carcass. On holiday weekends, entrepreneurs will set up pens of live animals along the main roads of townships\u2014mostly sheep and goats\u2014for families to purchase, slaughter, cook and eat.  Beef being the most prized meat, for weddings, affluent families often purchase a live steer for slaughter at home. Vegetarianism is generally met with puzzlement among Black South Africans, although most meals are served with vegetables such as pumpkin, beans and cabbage.\n\n==Non-indigenous cookery==\n[[Image:Droewors.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A piece of [[dro\u00ebwors]], a dried sausage]]\nDuring the pioneering days of the 17th century, new foods such as [[biltong]], ''[[dro\u00ebwors]]'' (dried sausage) and [[rusk]]s evolved locally out of necessity.\n\n===Cape Dutch and Cape Malay===\nA very distinctive regional style of South African cooking is often referred to as \"[[Cape Dutch]]\". This cuisine is characterised by the use of spices such as [[nutmeg]], [[allspice]] and [[chili pepper]]s. The Cape Dutch cookery style owes at least as much to the cookery of the [[Slavery|slaves]] brought by the [[Dutch East India Company]] to the Cape from [[Bengal]], [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Malaysia]] as it does to the European styles of cookery imported by settlers from the [[Netherlands]], and this is reflected in the use of eastern spices and the names given to many of these dishes.\n\nThe [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay]] influence has brought spicy [[curry|curries]], [[sambal]]s, pickled fish, and variety of fish [[stew]]s.\n\n[[Bobotie]] is a South African dish that has Cape Malay origins. It consists of spiced [[ground meat|minced meat]] baked with an egg-based topping. Of the many dishes common to South Africa, bobotie is perhaps closest to being the national dish, because it isn't commonly found in any other country.  The recipe originates from the [[Dutch East India Company]] colonies in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], with the name derived from the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''bobotok''. It is also made with curry powder leaving it with a slight \"tang\". It is often served with [[sambal]], a hint of its origins from the [[Malay Archipelago]].\n\nSouth African [[yellow rice]], a sweet dish made with [[raisin]]s, [[cinnammon]] and [[sugar]], also has its origins in Cape Malay cookery, often being referred to as Cape Malay yellow rice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grouprecipes.com/68703/cape-malay-yellow-rice.html|title=Cape Malay Yellow Rice Recipe|website=Group Recipes|accessdate=29 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===French cuisine===\n\nFrench Huguenot refugees from persecution, brought wines as well as their traditional recipes from France.\n\n===Indian cookery===\n[[Image:Quarter Mutton Bunny Chow.jpg|thumb|right|An example of [[bunny chow]] served in [[Durban]], originated in the [[Indian South Africans|Indian South African]] community.<ref name=FromCurries>{{cite book |title=From Curries to Kebabs: Recipes from the Indian Spice Trail |page=184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yAgfQ6uxhRgC&pg=184#v=onepage&q&f=false |author=Jaffrey, Madhur |date=2003 |accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>]]\n[[Curry|Curried]] dishes are popular with lemon juice in South Africa among people of all ethnic origins; many dishes came to the country with the thousands of [[Indians in South Africa|Indian]] labourers brought to South Africa in the nineteenth century. The Indians have introduced a different line of culinary practices, including a variety of curries, [[sweet]]s, [[chutney]]s, fried snacks such as [[samosa]], and other savoury foods. [[Bunny chow]], a dish from [[Durban]] (which has a large Indian community) consisting of a hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with curry, has adapted into mainstream South African cuisine and has become quite popular.\n\n==Beverages==\n{{main|Beer in South Africa}}\n{{see also|South African wine}}\n\n[[Image:Mageu (carton and glass).JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Mageu]] is a traditional South African non-alcoholic drink, popular among many of the [[Nguni people]], made from [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[maize|mealie]] [[porridge|pap]]. Home production is still widely practised, but the drink is also available at many supermarkets.]]\nBeer has been an important beverage in South Africa for hundreds of years among indigenous people long before colonisation and the arrival of Europeans with their own beer drinking traditions. Traditional beer was brewed from local grains, especially sorghum. Beer was so prized that it became central to many ceremonies, like betrothals and weddings, in which one family ceremoniously offered beer to the other family.  Unlike European beer, South African traditional beer was unfiltered and cloudy and had a low alcohol content. Around the turn of the centuries, when white owned industry began studying malnutrition among urban workers, it was discovered that traditional beer provided crucial vitamins sometimes not available in the grain heavy traditional diet and even less available in urban industrial slums.\n\nWhen South Africa's mines were developed and Black South Africans began to urbanise, women moved to the city also, and began to brew beer for the predominantly male labour force \u2013 a labour force that was mostly either single or who had left their wives back in the rural areas under the migrant labour system. That tradition of urban women making beer for the labour force persists in South Africa to the extent that informal bars and taverns (''[[shebeen]]s'') are typically owned by women (shebeen queens).  Today, most urban dwellers buy beer manufactured by industrial breweries that make beer that is like beer one would buy in Europe and America, but rural people and recent immigrants to the city still enjoy the cloudy, unfiltered traditional beer.\n\nCompared to an American, Korean or western European diet, milk and milk products are very prominent in the traditional Black South African diet.  As cows were considered extremely desirable domestic animals in precolonial times, milk was abundant. In the absence of refrigeration, various kinds of soured milk, somewhat like yogurt, were a dietary mainstay. A visitor to any African village in the 1800s would have been offered a large calabash of cool fermented milk as a greeting. Because milk cows allowed women to wean their children early and become fertile more quickly, local cultures had a number of sayings connecting cattle, milk and population growth, such as the Sotho-Tswana saying, \"cattle beget children.\"  Today, in the dairy section of South Africa's supermarkets, one will find a variety of kinds of milk, sour milk, sour cream, and other modern versions of traditional milk products.\n\n==Restaurants and fast food outlets==\nSouth Africa can be said to have a significant \"eating out\" culture. While there are some restaurants that specialise in traditional South African dishes or modern interpretations thereof, restaurants featuring other cuisines such as [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[West African cuisine|West African]], [[Congolese cuisine|Congolese]], and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] can be found in all of the major cities and many of the larger towns.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} There are also many home-grown chain restaurants, such as [[Spur (restaurant chain)|Spur]] and [[Dulce Cafe]].\n\nThere is also a proliferation of fast food restaurants in South Africa. While some international players such as [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] and [[McDonald's]] are active in the country, they face stiff competition from local chains such as [[Nando's]], Galito's, [[Steers]], [[Chicken Licken (restaurant)|Chicken Licken]], Barcelos, and King Pie.

On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=17th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1925}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Trophy Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] who defeated [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] in the final.\n\nIn the lower grades [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=17th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1925}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Trophy Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] who defeated [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] in the final.\n\nIn the lower grades [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches. They played against the New Zealand team twice and the touring Queensland side who they drew with 18 all. The Auckland side claimed the Northern Union Challenege Cup off the holders, South Auckland and they retained it against the same opponents in a later match. In addition the Auckland Provincial team played Queensland but were soundly beaten 54-14.\n\n===Death of Bill Stormont and inauguration of the Stormont Shield===\nOn June 4 [[William Stormont]] (known better as Bill Stormont) died, succumbing to rheumatic heart disease. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths - Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1925-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.5\n| accessdate = 2019-11-10}}</ref> Stormont had played for the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] senior team from 1920 to 1924 scoring 24 tries and kicking 31 goals.

He had been ill for quite some time and had not played for Marist since the end of the 1924 season. The funeral was on the Sunday leaving his parents residence in Epsom and progressing to Purewa Cemetery where he was buried. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths-Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19037\n| date = 1925-06-06\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250606.2.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The match between Marist and [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] on Saturday was originally postponed but was never played. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.126\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The matches at [[Carlaw Park]] saw one minutes silence before kickoff.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

He completed his schooling from Nattika where he did his diploma in Business Management and Administration. After the studies he left India in 1973 to [[Abu Dhabi]], where his paternal uncle, M K Abdullah, the chairman and the founder of the LuLu Group of companies, was doing business. He developed the import and wholesale distribution of the group and ventured in to the supermarket business by launching Lulu Hypermarket. He started his first Lulu Hypermarket in the 1990s, a time when the UAE's retail sector witnessed a major change, with the traditional groceries and supermarkets yielding place to large neighborhood stores and hypermarkets. While the entry of Continent (now Carrefour) in 1995 changed the face of retail business in [[Dubai]], Yusuff Ali took charge of Abu Dhabi's retail sector by rolling out LuLu Hypermarket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentid=20130130151153 |title=LuLu named fastest growing retailer by audit firm Deloitte |publisher=Saudi Gazette.com |access-date=2013-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/hrh-crown-prince-leads-bahrain-business-333960 |title=HRH the Crown Prince leads Bahrain business delegation to India |publisher=AMEinfo.com |access-date=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==LuLu Group International==\nLuLu Group International commenced its operations as a family business venture. After joining the business, Yusuff Ali diversified the business to include import and distribution of frozen products from [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. The products were available not only in Abu Dhabi, but also in other [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|Emirates]]. The business was soon expanded to include both food and non-food categories. The group also started cold storages, meat and food processing plants, large-scale import and distribution to hotel groups, catering companies, and shipping services. By the 1980s, the group had a sizable share of the wholesale and retail food market in the UAE.\n\nThe group has grown into an international group with operations spread over three continents. The group's flagship retail chain of LuLu Hypermarkets and Supermarkets is currently rated as one of the major players in the [[Middle East]] retail sector with more than 100 stores in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. Apart from the hypermarkets, supermarkets and department stores, the group also owns several shopping malls, namely,  [[Khalidiyah Mall]], Al Raha Mall, [[Al Wahda Mall]], [[Mushriff Mall]], Madinat Zayed Mall, Mazyad Mall, Ramli Mall, RAK Mall, Al Foah Mall, Al Khor Mall, Riyadh Avenue Mall in [[Saudi Arabia]] and Oman Avenues Mall spread across the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] states. [[LuLu International Shopping Mall]] in [[Kochi]], Kerala was opened on 10 March 2013. It is the group's first retail venture in India, and currently the largest shopping mall in India. A bigger mall is currently under construction in [[Trivandrum]], and once opened is expected to be India's second largest shopping mall. The Group has a vast organizational structure of over 40,000 employees, representing 37 different nationalities, out of which more than 25,000 are [[Indian people|Indians]]. Retail business is the mainstay of the Group with operations in major [[Middle East]]ern and [[Africa]]n countries like UAE, [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Kuwait]], [[Yemen]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]] and [[Kenya]], having Retail Sourcing and manufacturing bases located in Far East, [[India]], [[Africa]] and [[Guangzhou]] in [[China]].

He completed his schooling from Nattika where he did his diploma in Business Management and Administration. After the studies he left India in 1973 to [[Abu Dhabi]], where his paternal uncle, M K Abdullah, the chairman and the founder of the LuLu Group of companies, was doing business. He developed the import and wholesale distribution of the group and ventured in to the supermarket business by launching Lulu Hypermarket. He started his first Lulu Hypermarket in the 1990s, a time when the UAE's retail sector witnessed a major change, with the traditional groceries and supermarkets yielding place to large neighborhood stores and hypermarkets. While the entry of Continent (now Carrefour) in 1995 changed the face of retail business in [[Dubai]], Yusuff Ali took charge of Abu Dhabi's retail sector by rolling out LuLu Hypermarket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentid=20130130151153 |title=LuLu named fastest growing retailer by audit firm Deloitte |publisher=Saudi Gazette.com |access-date=2013-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/hrh-crown-prince-leads-bahrain-business-333960 |title=HRH the Crown Prince leads Bahrain business delegation to India |publisher=AMEinfo.com |access-date=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==LuLu Group International==\nLuLu Group International commenced its operations as a family business venture. After joining the business, Yusuff Ali diversified the business to include import and distribution of frozen products from [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. The products were available not only in Abu Dhabi, but also in other [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|Emirates]]. The business was soon expanded to include both food and non-food categories. The group also started cold storages, meat and food processing plants, large-scale import and distribution to hotel groups, catering companies, and shipping services. By the 1980s, the group had a sizable share of the wholesale and retail food market in the UAE.\n\nThe group has grown into an international group with operations spread over three continents. The group's flagship retail chain of LuLu Hypermarkets and Supermarkets is currently rated as one of the major players in the [[Middle East]] retail sector with more than 100 stores in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. Apart from the hypermarkets, supermarkets and department stores, the group also owns several shopping malls, namely,  [[Khalidiyah Mall]], Al Raha Mall, [[Al Wahda Mall]], [[Mushriff Mall]], Madinat Zayed Mall, Mazyad Mall, Ramli Mall, RAK Mall, Al Foah Mall, Al Khor Mall, Riyadh Avenue Mall in [[Saudi Arabia]] and Oman Avenues Mall spread across the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] states. [[LuLu International Shopping Mall]] in [[Kochi]], Kerala was opened on 10 March 2013. It is the group's first retail venture in India, and currently the largest shopping mall in India. A bigger mall is currently under construction in [[Trivandrum]], and once opened is expected to be India's second largest shopping mall. The Group has a vast organizational structure of over 40,000 employees, representing 37 different nationalities, out of which more than 25,000 are [[Indian people|Indians]]. Retail business is the mainstay of the Group with operations in major [[Middle East]]ern and [[Africa]]n countries like UAE, [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Kuwait]], [[Yemen]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]] and [[Kenya]], having Retail Sourcing and manufacturing bases located in Far East, [[India]], [[Africa]] and [[Guangzhou]] in [[China]].
