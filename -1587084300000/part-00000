Many famous scientists, including [[Albert Einstein]], have contributed articles to it. It is the candiens rule the world oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the United States (though it only became monthly in 1921). My name is Mulhouse I am a little too happy with my new job I am so sorry to you be sure to get back on your way back to work I can come get your dog I am going\n\n==History==\n''Scientific American'' was founded by inventor and publisher [[Rufus Porter (inventor)|Rufus M.

Throughout its early years, much emphasis was placed on reports of what was going on at the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]. It also reported on a broad range of inventions including [[perpetual motion]] machines, an 1860 device for buoying vessels by [[Abraham Lincoln]], and the [[universal joint]] which now can be found in nearly every automobile manufactured. Current issues include a \"this date in history\" section, featuring excerpts from articles originally published 50, 100, and 150 years earlier. Topics include humorous incidents, wrong-headed theories, and noteworthy advances in the history of science and technology.\n\nPorter sold the publication to [[Alfred Ely Beach]] and [[Orson Desaix Munn]] a mere ten months after founding it. Until 1948, it remained owned by Munn & Company.<ref name=\"scientificamerican1\"/> Under Munn's grandson, Orson Desaix Munn III, it had evolved into something of a \"workbench\" publication, similar to the twentieth-century incarnation of ''[[Popular Science (magazine)|Popular Science]]''.\n\nIn the years after World War II, the magazine fell into decline. In 1948, three partners who were planning on starting a new popular science magazine, to be called ''The Sciences'', purchased the assets of the old ''Scientific American'' instead and put its name on the designs they had created for their new magazine. Thus the partners{{mdash}}publisher [[Gerard Piel]], editor [[Dennis Flanagan]], and general manager Donald H. Miller, Jr.{{mdash}}essentially created a new magazine.<ref>Lewenstein, B. V. (1989).

In 1986, it was sold to the [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]] group of Germany, which has owned it since.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, ''Scientific American'' was put under the control of [[Nature Publishing Group]], a division of Holtzbrinck.<ref name=\"FOLIO\">{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Fell |title=Scientific American Editor, President to Step Down; 5 Percent of Staff Cut|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2009/scientific-american-editor-president-step-down-5-percent-staff-cut|publisher=FOLIO |accessdate=2009-04-26|date=2009-04-23 }}</ref>\n\nDonald Miller died in December 1998,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E4D9173FF934A15751C1A96E958260| title=Donald H.

On April 13, 2020, [[Laura Helmuth]] assumed the role of [[Editor-in-chief]].\n\n==International editions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n''Scientific American'' published its first foreign edition in 1890, the Spanish-language ''La America Cientifica''. Publication was suspended in 1905, and another 63 years would pass before another foreign-language edition appeared: In 1968, an Italian edition, ''[[Le Scienze]]'', was launched, and a Japanese edition, ''{{ill|Nikkei Science|ja|\u65e5\u7d4c\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9}}'', followed three years later. A new Spanish edition, ''Investigaci\u00f3n y Ciencia'' was launched in Spain in 1976, followed by a French edition, ''{{ill|Pour la Science|fr|display=yes}}'', in France in 1977, and a German edition, ''{{ill|Spektrum der Wissenschaft|de|display=yes}}'', in Germany in 1978. A Russian edition ''V Mire Nauki'' was launched in the Soviet Union in 1983, and continues in the present-day Russian [[Federation]]. ''Kexue'' (\u79d1\u5b66, \"Science\" in Chinese), a simplified Chinese edition launched in 1979, was the first Western magazine published in the [[People's Republic of China]]. Founded in [[Chongqing]], the simplified Chinese magazine was transferred to [[Beijing]] in 2001. Later in 2005, a newer edition, ''Global Science'' (\u73af\u7403\u79d1\u5b66), was published instead of ''Kexue'', which shut down due to financial problems. A traditional Chinese edition, known as ''{{ill|Scientist (magazine)|zh|\u79d1\u5b66\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba|lt=Scientist}}'', was introduced to [[Taiwan]] in 2002. The Hungarian edition ''Tudom\u00e1ny'' existed between 1984 and 1992. In 1986, an Arabic edition, ''{{ill|Oloom Magazine|ar|\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645}}'', was published<!--where?-->. In 2002, a Portuguese edition was launched in Brazil.\n\nToday, ''Scientific American'' publishes 18 foreign-language editions around the globe: Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, [[Simplified Chinese]], [[Traditional Chinese]], Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian (discontinued after 15 issues), Polish, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.\n\nFrom 1902 to 1911, ''Scientific American'' supervised the publication of the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', which during some of that period was known as ''The Americana''.\n\n==First issue==\n{{Wikisource|Scientific American/Series 1/Volume 1/Issue 1|''Scientific American'' issue 1}}\n[[File:Scientific American - Series 1 - Volume 001 - Issue 01.pdf|thumb|PDF of first issue: ''Scientific American'' Vol. 1, No. 01 published August 28, 1845]][[File:SciAmer.gif|thumb|200px|Cover of the September 1848 issue]]\n\nIt originally styled itself \"The Advocate of Industry and Enterprise\" and \"Journal of Mechanical and other Improvements\". On the front page of the first issue was the engraving of \"Improved Rail-Road Cars\". The masthead had a commentary as follows:\n\n{{quote|''Scientific American'' published every Thursday morning at No. 11 Spruce Street, New York, No. 16 State Street, Boston, and No. 2l Arcade Philadelphia, (The principal office being in New York) by Rufus Porter. Each number will be furnished with from two to five original Engravings, many of them elegant, and illustrative of New Inventions, Scientific Principles, and Curious Works; and will contain, in high addition to the most interesting news of passing events, general notices of progress of Mechanical and other Scientific Improvements; American and Foreign. Improvements and Inventions; Catalogues of American Patents; Scientific Essays, illustrative of the principles of the sciences of Mechanics, Chemistry, and Architecture: useful information and instruction in various Arts and Trades; Curious Philosophical Experiments; Miscellaneous Intelligence, Music and Poetry. This paper is especially entitled to the patronage of Mechanics and Manufactures, being the only paper in America, devoted to the interest of those classes; but is particularly useful to farmers, as it will not only appraise them of improvements in agriculture implements, But instruct them in various mechanical trades, and guard them against impositions. As a family newspaper, it will convey more useful intelligence to children and young people, than five times its cost in school instruction. Another important argument in favor of this paper, is that it will be worth two dollars at the end of the year when the volume is complete, (Old volumes of the ''New York Mechanic'', being now worth double the original cost, in cash.) Terms: The ''Scientific American'' will be furnished to subscribers at $2.00 per annum, - one dollar in advance, and the balance in six months. Five copies will be sent to one address six months for four dollars in advance. Any person procuring two or more subscribers, will be entitled to a commission of 25 cents each.}}\n\nThe commentary under the illustration gives the flavor of its style at the time:\n{{quote|There is perhaps no mechanical subject, in which improvement has advanced so rapidly, within the last ten years, as that of railroad passenger cars. Let any person contrast the awkward and uncouth cars of '35 with the superbly splendid long cars now running on several of the eastern roads, and he will find it difficult to convey to a third party, a correct idea of the vast extent of improvement. Some of the most elegant cars of this class, and which are of a capacity to accommodate from sixty to eighty passengers, and run with a steadiness hardly equaled by a steamboat in still water, are manufactured by Davenport & Bridges, at their establishment in Cambridgeport, Mass. The manufacturers have recently introduced a variety of excellent improvements in the construction of trucks, springs, and connections, which are calculated to avoid atmospheric resistance, secure safety and convenience, and contribute ease and comfort to passengers, while flying at the rate of 30 or 40 miles per hour.}}\n\nAlso in the first issue is commentary on Signor Muzio Muzzi's proposed device for aerial navigation.\n\n==Editors==\n* [[Rufus Porter (inventor)|Rufus M.

Many famous scientists, including [[Albert Einstein]], have contributed articles to it. It is the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the United States (though it only became monthly in 1921).\n\n==History==\n''Scientific American'' was founded by inventor and publisher [[Rufus Porter (inventor)|Rufus M.

Throughout its early years, much emphasis was placed on reports of what was going on at the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]. It also reported on a broad range of inventions including [[perpetual motion]] machines, an 1860 device for buoying vessels by [[Abraham Lincoln]], and the [[universal joint]] which now can be found in nearly every automobile manufactured. Current issues include a \"this date in history\" section, featuring excerpts from articles originally published 50, 100, and 150 years earlier. Topics include humorous incidents, wrong-headed theories, and noteworthy advances in the history of science and technology.\n\nPorter sold the publication to [[Alfred Ely Beach]] and [[Orson Desaix Munn]] a mere ten months after founding it. Until 1948, it remained owned by Munn & Company.<ref name=\"scientificamerican1\"/> Under Munn's grandson, Orson Desaix Munn III, it had evolved into something of a \"workbench\" publication, similar to the twentieth-century incarnation of ''[[Popular Science (magazine)|Popular Science]]''.\n\nIn the years after World War II, the magazine fell into decline. In 1948, three partners who were planning on starting a new popular science magazine, to be called ''The Sciences'', purchased the assets of the old ''Scientific American'' instead and put its name on the designs they had created for their new magazine. Thus the partners{{mdash}}publisher [[Gerard Piel]], editor [[Dennis Flanagan]], and general manager Donald H. Miller, Jr.{{mdash}}essentially created a new magazine.<ref>Lewenstein, B. V. (1989).

On April 13, 2020, [[Laura Helmuth]] assumed the role of [[Editor-in-chief]].\n\n==International editions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n''Scientific American'' published its first foreign edition in 1890, the Spanish-language ''La America Cientifica''. Publication was suspended in 1905, and another 63 years would pass before another foreign-language edition appeared: In 1968, an Italian edition, ''[[Le Scienze]]'', was launched, and a Japanese edition, ''{{ill|Nikkei Science|ja|\u65e5\u7d4c\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9}}'', followed three years later. A new Spanish edition, ''Investigaci\u00f3n y Ciencia'' was launched in Spain in 1976, followed by a French edition, ''{{ill|Pour la Science|fr|display=yes}}'', in France in 1977, and a German edition, ''{{ill|Spektrum der Wissenschaft|de|display=yes}}'', in Germany in 1978. A Russian edition ''V Mire Nauki'' was launched in the Soviet Union in 1983, and continues in the present-day Russian [[Federation]]. ''Kexue'' (\u79d1\u5b66, \"Science\" in Chinese), a simplified Chinese edition launched in 1979, was the first Western magazine published in the [[People's Republic of China]]. Founded in [[Chongqing]], the simplified Chinese magazine was transferred to [[Beijing]] in 2001. Later in 2005, a newer edition, ''Global Science'' (\u73af\u7403\u79d1\u5b66), was published instead of ''Kexue'', which shut down due to financial problems. A traditional Chinese edition, known as ''{{ill|Scientist (magazine)|zh|\u79d1\u5b66\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba|lt=Scientist}}'', was introduced to [[Taiwan]] in 2002. The Hungarian edition ''Tudom\u00e1ny'' existed between 1984 and 1992. In 1986, an Arabic edition, ''{{ill|Oloom Magazine|ar|\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645}}'', was published<!--where?-->. In 2002, a Portuguese edition was launched in Brazil.\n\nToday, ''Scientific American'' publishes 18 foreign-language editions around the globe: Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, [[Simplified Chinese]], [[Traditional Chinese]], Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian (discontinued after 15 issues), Polish, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.\n\nFrom 1902 to 1911, ''Scientific American'' supervised the publication of the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', which during some of that period was known as ''The Americana''.\n\n==First issue==\n{{Wikisource|Scientific American/Series 1/Volume 1/Issue 1|''Scientific American'' issue 1}}\n[[File:Scientific American - Series 1 - Volume 001 - Issue 01.pdf|thumb|PDF of first issue: ''Scientific American'' Vol. 1, No. 01 published August 28, 1845]][[File:SciAmer.gif|thumb|200px|Cover of the September 1848 issue]]\n\nIt originally styled itself \"The Advocate of Industry and Enterprise\" and \"Journal of Mechanical and other Improvements\". On the front page of the first issue was the engraving of \"Improved Rail-Road Cars\". The masthead had a commentary as follows:\n\n{{quote|''Scientific American'' published every Thursday morning at No. 11 Spruce Street, New York, No. 16 State Street, Boston, and No. 2l Arcade Philadelphia, (The principal office being in New York) by Rufus Porter. Each number will be furnished with from two to five original Engravings, many of them elegant, and illustrative of New Inventions, Scientific Principles, and Curious Works; and will contain, in high addition to the most interesting news of passing events, general notices of progress of Mechanical and other Scientific Improvements; American and Foreign. Improvements and Inventions; Catalogues of American Patents; Scientific Essays, illustrative of the principles of the sciences of Mechanics, Chemistry, and Architecture: useful information and instruction in various Arts and Trades; Curious Philosophical Experiments; Miscellaneous Intelligence, Music and Poetry. This paper is especially entitled to the patronage of Mechanics and Manufactures, being the only paper in America, devoted to the interest of those classes; but is particularly useful to farmers, as it will not only appraise them of improvements in agriculture implements, But instruct them in various mechanical trades, and guard them against impositions. As a family newspaper, it will convey more useful intelligence to children and young people, than five times its cost in school instruction. Another important argument in favor of this paper, is that it will be worth two dollars at the end of the year when the volume is complete, (Old volumes of the ''New York Mechanic'', being now worth double the original cost, in cash.) Terms: The ''Scientific American'' will be furnished to subscribers at $2.00 per annum, - one dollar in advance, and the balance in six months. Five copies will be sent to one address six months for four dollars in advance. Any person procuring two or more subscribers, will be entitled to a commission of 25 cents each.}}\n\nThe commentary under the illustration gives the flavor of its style at the time:\n{{quote|There is perhaps no mechanical subject, in which improvement has advanced so rapidly, within the last ten years, as that of railroad passenger cars. Let any person contrast the awkward and uncouth cars of '35 with the superbly splendid long cars now running on several of the eastern roads, and he will find it difficult to convey to a third party, a correct idea of the vast extent of improvement.

Retrieved on 2009-09-07.</ref> Islam first arrived on the southern edges of the region in the 8th century from Arabs.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Islam]] was brought to the area of Kazakhstan during the 8th century when the [[Arab]]s arrived in Central Asia.  Islam initially took hold in the southern portions of [[Turkestan]] and thereafter gradually spread northward.<ref>Atabaki, Touraj. ''Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora'', pg. 24</ref> Islam also took root due to zealous subjugation from [[Samanid]] rulers, notably in areas surrounding [[Taraz]]<ref>Ibn Athir, volume 8, pg. 396</ref> where a significant number of indigenous people converted to Islam.  Additionally, in the late 14th century, the [[Golden Horde]] propagated Islam amongst [[Tatars]] and other Central Asian tribes.  During the 18th century, Russian influence rapidly increased toward the region.  Led by [[Catherine the Great|Empress Catherine]], the Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing [[Islam]] to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the region to preach to the Kazakhs whom the Russians viewed as \"savages\", ignorant of morals and ethics.<ref>Khodarkovsky, Michael. ''Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making of a Colonial Empire, 1500-1800'', pg. 39.</ref><ref name=EncycSex572>Ember, Carol R. and Melvin Ember. ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender: Men and Women in the World's Cultures'', pg. 572</ref>\n\nRussian policy gradually changed toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of [[collective consciousness]].<ref name=Hunter14>Hunter, Shireen. \"Islam in Russia: The Politics of Identity and Security\", pg. 14</ref> Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly elite [[Russia]]n military institutions.<ref name=Hunter14 /> In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring religious fervor by espousing [[pan-Turkism]], though many were persecuted as a result.<ref>Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 304</ref>  During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, [[Muslim]] institutions survived only in areas where Kazakhs significantly outnumbered non-Muslims due to everyday Muslim practices.<ref>Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 340</ref>  In an attempt to conform Kazakhs into [[Communist]] ideologies, gender relations and other aspects of the Kazakh culture were key targets of social change.<ref name=EncycSex572 />\n\nIn more recent times, Kazakhs have gradually employed determined effort in revitalizing Islamic religious institutions after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].  While not strongly fundamentalist, Kazakhs continue to identify with their Islamic faith,<ref>Page, Kogan. ''Asia and Pacific Review 2003/04'', pg. 99</ref> and even more devotedly in the countryside.  Those who claim descent from the original [[Muslim]] warriors and missionaries of the 8th century command substantial respect in their communities.<ref>Atabaki, Touraj. ''Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora''.</ref>  Kazakh political figures have also stressed the need to sponsor Islamic awareness.  For example, the Kazakh Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Marat Tazhin]], recently emphasized that Kazakhstan attaches importance to the use of \"positive potential Islam, learning of its history, culture and heritage.\"<ref>[http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&id=154837 inform.kz | 154837<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020120928/http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&id=154837 |date=2007-10-20 }}</ref>\n\n[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities attempted to encourage a controlled form of Islam under the [[Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan]] as a unifying force in the Central Asian societies, while at the same time prohibiting true religious freedom. Since independence, religious activity has increased significantly.

The 1995 [[constitution]] forbids organizations that seek to stimulate racial, political, or religious discord, and imposes strict governmental control on foreign religious organizations. As did its predecessor, the 1995 constitution stipulates that Kazakhstan is a secular state; thus, Kazakhstan is the only Central Asian state whose constitution does not assign a special status to Islam. Though, Kazakhstan joined the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] in the same year. This position was based on the Nazarbayev government's foreign policy as much as on domestic considerations. Aware of the potential for investment from the Muslim countries of the Middle East, Nazarbayev visited Iran, [[Turkey]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]; at the same time, he preferred to cast Kazakhstan as a bridge between the Muslim East and the Christian West. For example, he initially accepted only observer status in the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] (ECO), all of whose member nations are predominantly Muslim.

''Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora'', pg. 24</ref> Islam also took root due to zealous subjugation from [[Samanid]] rulers, notably in areas surrounding [[Taraz]]<ref>Ibn Athir, volume 8, pg. 396</ref> where a significant number of indigenous people converted to Islam.  Additionally, in the late 14th century, the [[Golden Horde]] propagated Islam amongst [[Tatars]] and other Central Asian tribes.  During the 18th century, Russian influence rapidly increased toward the region.  Led by [[Catherine the Great|Empress Catherine]], the Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing [[Islam]] to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the region to preach to the Kazakhs whom the Russians viewed as \"savages\", ignorant of morals and ethics.<ref>Khodarkovsky, Michael.

''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 304</ref>  During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, [[Muslim]] institutions survived only in areas where Kazakhs significantly outnumbered non-Muslims due to everyday Muslim practices.<ref>Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 340</ref>  In an attempt to conform Kazakhs into [[Communist]] ideologies, gender relations and other aspects of the Kazakh culture were key targets of social change.<ref name=EncycSex572 />\n\nIn more recent times, Kazakhs have gradually employed determined effort in revitalizing Islamic religious institutions after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].  While not strongly fundamentalist, Kazakhs continue to identify with their Islamic faith,<ref>Page, Kogan. ''Asia and Pacific Review 2003/04'', pg. 99</ref> and even more devotedly in the countryside.
