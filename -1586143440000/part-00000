When Brahmapal refuses to pay up to 2&nbsp;million for Fauji's sisters wedding, Fauji breaks their ties and leaves him. At the same time, Brahmapal befriends a polite teacher named Satbir ([[Vivek Oberoi]]) who also happens to be in a relationship with Brahmapal's daughter Suman ([[Charmy Kaur]]).\n\nThinking that Brahmapal has replaced him with Satbir, Fauji becomes furious and joins forces with Rashid ([[Ravi Kishan]]), a politician and Brahampal's enemy. Rashid deliberately turns Fauji against Satbir, making him think that he wants him dead. When Fauji tries to attack Satbir, an elderly village spokesman is shot, leading Satbir to fight back against him. But before Satbir is able to do anything about it, Satbir's older brother Karamvir ([[Chandrachur Singh]]) is kidnapped, and soon killed by Fauji. Seeking revenge, Satbir turns to the crime world to finish off his brother's murderer. With riots taking place all over, the police department shifts a crazy, tough, feared and solid officer, Thakur Pritam Singh ([[Sanjay Dutt]]) to enter the city bring a stop to this gang-war. However, Pritam Singh ends up making it all worse.\n\nPritam Singh initially visits Fauji and Rashid and later on, invites Satbir to the Police Station. Having gauged their attitudes, Pritam Singh decides to side with Satbir in the war against Fauji and Rashid. With elections approaching, both parties eventually decide to contest with Rashid and Satbir's brother contesting. Rashid wins the election seeing which Fauji goes on a killing spree beginning his attack starting from Satbir's house and accidentally ends up killing Satbir's now wife Suman. Enraged at this act of Fauji, Satbir's brother kidnaps his girlfriend \u2013 an act that is looked down upon by Satbir. Before she could be returned safely, Fauji invades the place and kills Satbir's brother prompting a furious Satbir to go on a revenge spree.\n\nIn the meanwhile, a tape is discovered which not only reveals that Rashid and Faqira have secretly made a deal with Pritam Singh to murder Fauji, thereby betraying him, but also shows Faqira confessing to having ordered the attack on Fauji's house at the start of the movie which is what triggered the whole gang-war in the first place. Furious at this betrayal, Fauji kills Faqira and then heads out to kill Rashid. Pritam Singh also joins in, apparently fulfilling his promise to kill Fauji for Rashid but ends up killing Rashid instead. This results in an action-packed finale that sees Satbir killing Fauji and being arrested by Pritam Singh.

Track and field is categorized under the umbrella [[sport of athletics]], which also includes [[road running]], [[cross country running]], and [[racewalking]]. Track and Field is a slow paced sport.\n\nThe foot racing events, which include [[sprint (running)|sprints]], [[Middle-distance running|middle-]] and [[Long-distance running|long-distance events]], racewalking and [[hurdling]], are won by the [[athlete]] who completes it in the least time. The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height. Regular jumping events include [[long jump]], [[triple jump]], [[high jump]] and [[pole vault]], while the most common throwing events are [[shot put]], [[javelin throw|javelin]], [[discus throw|discus]] and [[hammer throw|hammer]]. There are also \"combined events\" or \"multi events\", such as the [[athletics pentathlon|pentathlon]] consisting of five events, [[heptathlon]] consisting of seven events, and [[decathlon]] consisting of ten events. In these, athletes participate in a combination of track and field events. Most track and field events are [[individual sport]]s with a single victor; the most prominent team events are [[relay race]]s, which typically feature teams of four. Events are almost exclusively divided by gender, although both the men's and women's competitions are usually held at the same venue. If a race has too many people to run all at once, preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants.\n\nTrack and field is one of the oldest sports. In ancient times, it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] in Greece.

The majority of athletes tend to specialise in just one event (or event type) with the aim of perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over a specified distances and\u2014in the case of the [[hurdling]] and [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] events\u2014obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also [[relay race]]s in which teams of athletes run and pass on a [[baton (running)|baton]] to their team member at the end of a certain distance.\n\nThere are two types of field events: jumps and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The performances of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the [[pole vault]].\n\nThe throwing events involve hurling an implement (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on the distance that the object is thrown. Combined events involve the same group of athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete and/or teams with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.\n\n{{track and field event box}}\n\n===Running===\n\n====Sprints====\n{{Main|Sprint (running)}}\n[[File:100m women Golden League 2007 in Zurich.jpg|thumb|The finish of a women's 100&nbsp;m race]]\nRaces over short distances, or [[sprint (running)|sprint]]s, are among the oldest running competitions.

Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's [[decathlon]] (ten events) and the [[women's heptathlon]] (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the [[men's heptathlon]] and the [[women's pentathlon]]. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the [[decathlon scoring table]].\n\nThe [[Ancient Olympic pentathlon]] (comprising [[long jump]], javelin, discus, the ''[[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]]'' race and [[amateur wrestling|wrestling]]) was a precursor to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the [[athletics at the 1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]] ([[Intercalated Games]]). A men's all-around was held at the [[Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's all-around|1904 Summer Olympics]], contested between five American and two British athletes.\n\n{{Combined events box}}\n\n==Stadiums==\n<!-- {{main|Track and field stadium}} As of May 2010, this redirects to [[Stadium]] -->\n[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|The [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] was one of the first modern track and field stadiums]]\n\n===Outdoor===\n\nThe term ''track and field'' is intertwined with the [[stadium]]s that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a track and field stadium are the outer oval-shaped [[running track]] and an area of [[lawn|turf]] within this track\u2014the [[Playing field|field]]. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] measured 333.33&nbsp;metres at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]], while at the [[1904 Olympics]] the distance was a third of a [[mile]] (536.45&nbsp;m) at [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400&nbsp;m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened [[cinder]]s were popular in the early 20th century but [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] tracks became standard in the late 1960s. [[3M]]'s [[Tartan track]] (an [[all-weather running track]] of [[polyurethane]]) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|US Olympic Trials]] and the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are [[multi-purpose stadium]]s, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of [[football]].\n\n[[File:Piste athl\u00e9tisme-en.svg|thumb|left|A typical layout of an outdoor track and field stadium]]\n\nThe field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events. The [[long jump]] and [[triple jump]] areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a [[sandpit]] at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board\u2014typically a small strip of [[wood]] with a [[plasticine]] marker attached\u2014which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The [[pole vault]] area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned [[landing mat]]s. The [[high jump]] is a stripped-down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.\n\nThe four throwing events generally all begin on one side of the stadium. The [[javelin throw]] typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the [[Straight (racing)|straights]] of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a [[Circular sector|sector]] shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The [[discus throw]] and [[hammer throw]] contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The [[shot put]] features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a [[Circular sector|sector]]. Some stadia also have a [[water jump]] area on one side of the field specifically for [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] races.\n\n===Indoor===\n[[File:Aspire dome Doha.jpg|thumb|The [[Aspire Dome]] during the [[2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships|2010 World Indoor Championships]]]]\n\nBasic indoor venues may be adapted [[gym]]nasiums, which can easily accommodate high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the [[IAAF World Indoor Championships|World Indoor Championships]]) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area is surrounded by a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the [[60 metres]] and [[60 metres hurdles]] events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.\n\nAnother common adaptation in the United States is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) that fits into a common [[basketball court]]-sized arena. This was quite popular when races were held at imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the [[Millrose Games]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], and the [[Sunkist Invitational]] formerly held in the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/14/sports/sp-8235 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=John | last=Ortega | date=14 February 1999 | title=Bussey of Taft Comes Up Big on Inside Track}}</ref>\n\nAll four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run alongside the central 60&nbsp;m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. [[Shot put]] and [[weight throw]] are the only throwing events held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area is similar to the outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/45/31/20091001092345_httppostedfile_CompRules-2009-Eng_16838.pdf Competition Rules 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605005950/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/45/31/20091001092345_httppostedfile_CompRules-2009-Eng_16838.pdf |date=2011-06-05 }}.

The most recent complete set of rules is the 2009 rules that relate only to competitions in 2009.<ref name=RuleBook1>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/04/95/59/20090303014358_httppostedfile_CompetitionRules2009_printed_8986.pdf Incorporating changes approved by the IAAF Council throughout 2008- p5, 2009 Rule book].</ref> Key rules of track events are those regarding starting, running and finishing.\n\n====Starting====\n[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|Men assuming the starting position for a sprint race]]\nThe start of a race is marked by a white line 5&nbsp;cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish.<ref>IAAF Rule 162.1, from Chapter 5, 'Technical rules', Section III on 'Track events'.</ref>\nStarting blocks may be used for all races up to and including 400 m (including the first leg of the [[4 \u00d7 100 m relay|4 \u00d7 100 m]] and [[4 \u00d7 400 m]]) and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane.<ref>IAAF Rule 161</ref>\n\nAll races must be started by the report of the [[starter's gun]] or approved starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 161.2\">IAAF Rule 161.2</ref> An athlete may not touch either the start line or the ground in front of it with their hands or feet when on their marks.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 161.3\">IAAF Rule 161.3</ref>\n\nFor sprint races up to 400&nbsp;m, the starter gives two commands: \"on your marks\" to instruct athletes to approach the start line, followed by \"set\" to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent. The commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions, or in English or French in international competitions. Once all athletes are set in their starting position, the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated. If the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed, the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 161.3\"/>\n\nThere are different types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at the outer edge of the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800&nbsp;m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\nAn athlete, after assuming a final set position, may not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgment of the starter or recallers, he does so any earlier, it is considered a [[false start]]. It is deemed a false start if, in the judgment of the starter an athlete fails to comply with the commands \"on your marks\" or \"set\" as appropriate after a reasonable time; or an athlete after the command \"on your marks\" disturbs other athletes in the race through sound or otherwise. If the runner is in the \"set\" position and moves, then the runner is also disqualified.<ref>IAAF Rule 161.6</ref> {{As of|2010}}, any athlete making a false start is disqualified.<ref>IAAF Rule 161.7</ref>\n\nIn International elite competition, electronically tethered starting blocks sense the reaction time of the athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 161.2\"/>\n\n====Running the race====\n[[File:Oscar Pistorius, the first round of the 400m at the London 2012 Olympic Games.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Oscar Pistorius]], running in the first round of the 400&nbsp;m at the 2012 Olympics]]\n\nFor sprinting events (bar the 4 \u00d7 400&nbsp;m relay and the indoor 400&nbsp;metres), each athlete must run the race within their allocated lane from start to finish. If an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, the beginning of the 800&nbsp;m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 163.2\">IAAF Rule 163.2</ref><ref name=\"IAAF Rule 163.3\">IAAF Rule 163.3</ref>\n\nAny athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete, in a way that impedes his progress, should be disqualified from that event. However, if an athlete is pushed or forced by another person to run outside his lane, and if no material advantage is gained, the athlete should not be disqualified.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 163.2\"/><ref name=\"IAAF Rule 163.3\"/>\n\n====The finish====\nThe finish of a race is marked by a white line 5&nbsp;cm wide.<ref>IAAF Rule 164.1</ref> The finishing position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line.<ref>IAAF Rule 164.3</ref> [[Fully automatic timing]] systems (photo timing) are becoming more and more common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a sprint record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\nWith the accuracy of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides that there has been a tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\n===Field rules===\nIn general, most field events allow a competitor to take their attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the greatest distance.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\n==== Vertical Jumps ====\nVertical jumps (high jump and pole vault) set a bar at a particular height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, which can be used to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\n==== Horizontal Jumps ====\nHorizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) and all throws must be initiated behind a line. In the case of horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt\u2014it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line on the edge of sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set\u2014so the competitor in first place at the end of the third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\n==Equipment==\nMen and women have different weights for their throwing implements \u2013 men's javelin is 800 grams compared to 600 for women, men's weight throw is 35 pounds compared to 20 for women, men's discus is 2 kilograms to women's 1, men's shot put is 16 pounds compared to 8 pounds for women, and men's hammer throw is also 16 pounds to the women's 8. Additionally, men's high hurdles are at height of 42 inches compared to women's hurdles which are 33 inches. For the intermediate hurdles (400 meter hurdles), the men's hurdle height is 36 inches compared to 30 inches for women.\n\n==Organizations==\nThe international governance of track and field falls under the jurisdiction of athletics organisations. The [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] is the global [[sport governing body|governing body]] for track and field, and athletics as a whole. The governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including [[USA Track & Field]] and the [[Philippine Amateur Track & Field Association]], but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies.<ref>[http://www.usatf.org/about/ About USATF].

The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its [[world championship]] event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 \u2013 the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics]]. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the [[marathon]] and [[racewalking]] competitions.

Doing so can not only serve as a way of determining the winner in an event, but it can also be used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's performances are recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent\u2014beginning with [[national records in athletics|national records]], then continental records, up to the global or [[world record]] level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.\n\n[[File:100m men WR.svg|thumb|left|A graph of the world record progression in the men's 100&nbsp;metres]]\n\nThe IAAF ratifies track and field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first published a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes were made in the late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if [[fully automatic electronic timing]] was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in track and field, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/96/20100113075829_httppostedfile_IAAFConstitution-01.11.09-Eng-Website_17812.pdf IAAF Constitution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705013805/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/96/20100113075829_httppostedfile_IAAFConstitution-01.11.09-Eng-Website_17812.pdf|date=5 July 2010|df=dmy-all}} (pp. 79\u201380).

For example, the [[List of Olympic records in athletics|Olympic records]] represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions.\n\n==Doping==\n{{further|Doping in sport|List of doping cases in athletics}}\n[[File:Marion Jones 12.jpg|thumb|[[Marion Jones]], after admitting to doping, lost her Olympic medals, was banned from the sport, and spent six months in jail.]]\nTrack and field athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain substances by governing bodies for the sport, from the national to the international level.

All these forms of racing tend to record finishing times, have strictly defined start and finish points, and are generally individual in nature. Middle- and long-distance runners usually participate in cross country and road events, in addition to the track. Track racewalkers are most typically road specialists as well. It is unusual for track and field athletes outside of these two groups to compete in cross country or road events.\n\nVarieties of [[strength athletics]], such as the [[World's Strongest Man]] and [[highland games]], often incorporate forms of footracing carrying heavy objects as well as throwing events such as the [[caber toss]] and [[keg toss]], which bear similarities to track and field throwing events.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of track and field stadiums by capacity]]\n*[[Cross country running]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Athletics}}\n*[http://www.iaaf.org/ International Association of Athletics Federations website]\n*[http://www.usatf.org/ USA Track & Field website]\n*[http://trackandfield.about.com/ Track and field] at About.com\n*[http://www.athletic.net/ Results & Statistics] for Collegiate, High School, Middle School, and Club teams\n*[http://www.mastersathletics.net/ Masters T&F World Rankings]\n\n{{Athletics events}}\n{{Racing}}\n\n[[Category:Track and field|*]]\n[[Category:Individual sports]]\n[[Category:Athletics by type]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Track & Field|the video game|Track & Field (video game)}}\n{{short description|Sport involving running, jumping and throwing disciplines}}\n{{Good article}}\n{{Infobox sport\n|name       = Track and field\n|image      = Track_and_field_stadium.jpg\n|caption    = Part of a track and field stadium \n|nickname   = Track\n|team       = Yes\n|mgender    = No\n|category   = Sport\n|olympic    = Yes\n}}\n\n'''Track and field''' is a [[sport]] which includes [[Competition#Sports|athletic contests]] established on the skills of [[running]], [[jumping]], and [[throwing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/track-and-field|title=Track and Field|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> The name is derived from where the sport takes place, a [[running track]] and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events. Track and field is categorized under the umbrella [[sport of athletics]], which also includes [[road running]], [[cross country running]], and [[racewalking]].\n\nThe foot racing events, which include [[sprint (running)|sprints]], [[Middle-distance running|middle-]] and [[Long-distance running|long-distance events]], racewalking and [[hurdling]], are won by the [[athlete]] who completes it in the least time. The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height. Regular jumping events include [[long jump]], [[triple jump]], [[high jump]] and [[pole vault]], while the most common throwing events are [[shot put]], [[javelin throw|javelin]], [[discus throw|discus]] and [[hammer throw|hammer]]. There are also \"combined events\" or \"multi events\", such as the [[athletics pentathlon|pentathlon]] consisting of five events, [[heptathlon]] consisting of seven events, and [[decathlon]] consisting of ten events. In these, athletes participate in a combination of track and field events. Most track and field events are [[individual sport]]s with a single victor; the most prominent team events are [[relay race]]s, which typically feature teams of four. Events are almost exclusively divided by gender, although both the men's and women's competitions are usually held at the same venue. If a race has too many people to run all at once, preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants.\n\nTrack and field is one of the oldest sports. In ancient times, it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] in Greece. In modern times, the two most prestigious international track and field competitions are the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|athletics competition at the Olympic Games]] and the [[World Athletics Championships]]. The [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] is the [[sports governing body|international governing body]].\n\nRecords are kept of the best performances in specific events, at [[List of world records in athletics|world]] and [[National records in athletics|national]] levels, right down to a personal level. However, if athletes are deemed to have violated the event's rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased.\n\nIn North America, the term track and field may be used to refer to other athletics events, such as [[Cross country running|cross country]], the [[marathon]] and [[road running]], rather than strictly track-based events.<ref>Rosenbaum, Mike.

The majority of athletes tend to specialise in just one event (or event type) with the aim of perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over a specified distances and\u2014in the case of the [[hurdling]] and [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] events\u2014obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also [[relay race]]s in which teams of athletes run and pass on a [[baton (running)|baton]] to their team member at the end of a certain distance.\n\nThere are two types of field events: jumps and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The performances of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the [[pole vault]].\n\nThe throwing events involve hurling an implement (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on the distance that the object is thrown. Combined events involve the same group of athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete and/or teams with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.\n\n{{track and field event box}}\n\n===Running===\n\n====Sprints====\n{{Main|Sprint (running)}}\n[[File:100m women Golden League 2007 in Zurich.jpg|thumb|The finish of a women's 100&nbsp;m race]]\nRaces over short distances, or [[sprint (running)|sprint]]s, are among the oldest running competitions.

Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's [[decathlon]] (ten events) and the [[women's heptathlon]] (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the [[men's heptathlon]] and the [[women's pentathlon]]. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the [[decathlon scoring table]].\n\nThe [[Ancient Olympic pentathlon]] (comprising [[long jump]], javelin, discus, the ''[[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]]'' race and [[amateur wrestling|wrestling]]) was a precursor to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the [[athletics at the 1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]] ([[Intercalated Games]]). A men's all-around was held at the [[Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's all-around|1904 Summer Olympics]], contested between five American and two British athletes.\n\n{{Combined events box}}\n\n==Stadiums==\n<!-- {{main|Track and field stadium}} As of May 2010, this redirects to [[Stadium]] -->\n[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|The [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] was one of the first modern track and field stadiums]]\n\n===Outdoor===\n\nThe term ''track and field'' is intertwined with the [[stadium]]s that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a track and field stadium are the outer oval-shaped [[running track]] and an area of [[lawn|turf]] within this track\u2014the [[Playing field|field]]. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] measured 333.33&nbsp;metres at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]], while at the [[1904 Olympics]] the distance was a third of a [[mile]] (536.45&nbsp;m) at [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400&nbsp;m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened [[cinder]]s were popular in the early 20th century but [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] tracks became standard in the late 1960s. [[3M]]'s [[Tartan track]] (an [[all-weather running track]] of [[polyurethane]]) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|US Olympic Trials]] and the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are [[multi-purpose stadium]]s, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of [[football]].\n\n[[File:Piste athl\u00e9tisme-en.svg|thumb|left|A typical layout of an outdoor track and field stadium]]\n\nThe field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events. The [[long jump]] and [[triple jump]] areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a [[sandpit]] at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board\u2014typically a small strip of [[wood]] with a [[plasticine]] marker attached\u2014which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The [[pole vault]] area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned [[landing mat]]s. The [[high jump]] is a stripped-down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.\n\nThe four throwing events generally all begin on one side of the stadium. The [[javelin throw]] typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the [[Straight (racing)|straights]] of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a [[Circular sector|sector]] shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The [[discus throw]] and [[hammer throw]] contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The [[shot put]] features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a [[Circular sector|sector]]. Some stadia also have a [[water jump]] area on one side of the field specifically for [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] races.\n\n===Indoor===\n[[File:Aspire dome Doha.jpg|thumb|The [[Aspire Dome]] during the [[2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships|2010 World Indoor Championships]]]]\n\nBasic indoor venues may be adapted [[gym]]nasiums, which can easily accommodate high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the [[IAAF World Indoor Championships|World Indoor Championships]]) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area is surrounded by a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the [[60 metres]] and [[60 metres hurdles]] events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.\n\nAnother common adaptation in the United States is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) that fits into a common [[basketball court]]-sized arena. This was quite popular when races were held at imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the [[Millrose Games]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], and the [[Sunkist Invitational]] formerly held in the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/14/sports/sp-8235 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=John | last=Ortega | date=14 February 1999 | title=Bussey of Taft Comes Up Big on Inside Track}}</ref>\n\nAll four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run alongside the central 60&nbsp;m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. [[Shot put]] and [[weight throw]] are the only throwing events held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area is similar to the outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/45/31/20091001092345_httppostedfile_CompRules-2009-Eng_16838.pdf Competition Rules 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605005950/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/45/31/20091001092345_httppostedfile_CompRules-2009-Eng_16838.pdf |date=2011-06-05 }}.

The most recent complete set of rules is the 2009 rules that relate only to competitions in 2009.<ref name=RuleBook1>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/04/95/59/20090303014358_httppostedfile_CompetitionRules2009_printed_8986.pdf Incorporating changes approved by the IAAF Council throughout 2008- p5, 2009 Rule book].</ref> Key rules of track events are those regarding starting, running and finishing.\n\n====Starting====\n[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|Men assuming the starting position for a sprint race]]\nThe start of a race is marked by a white line 5&nbsp;cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish.<ref>IAAF Rule 162.1, from Chapter 5, 'Technical rules', Section III on 'Track events'.</ref>\nStarting blocks may be used for all races up to and including 400 m (including the first leg of the [[4 \u00d7 100 m relay|4 \u00d7 100 m]] and [[4 \u00d7 400 m]]) and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane.<ref>IAAF Rule 161</ref>\n\nAll races must be started by the report of the [[starter's gun]] or approved starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 161.2\">IAAF Rule 161.2</ref> An athlete may not touch either the start line or the ground in front of it with their hands or feet when on their marks.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 161.3\">IAAF Rule 161.3</ref>\n\nFor sprint races up to 400&nbsp;m, the starter gives two commands: \"on your marks\" to instruct athletes to approach the start line, followed by \"set\" to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent. The commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions, or in English or French in international competitions. Once all athletes are set in their starting position, the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated. If the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed, the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 161.3\"/>\n\nThere are different types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at the outer edge of the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800&nbsp;m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\nAn athlete, after assuming a final set position, may not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgment of the starter or recallers, he does so any earlier, it is considered a [[false start]]. It is deemed a false start if, in the judgment of the starter an athlete fails to comply with the commands \"on your marks\" or \"set\" as appropriate after a reasonable time; or an athlete after the command \"on your marks\" disturbs other athletes in the race through sound or otherwise. If the runner is in the \"set\" position and moves, then the runner is also disqualified.<ref>IAAF Rule 161.6</ref> {{As of|2010}}, any athlete making a false start is disqualified.<ref>IAAF Rule 161.7</ref>\n\nIn International elite competition, electronically tethered starting blocks sense the reaction time of the athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 161.2\"/>\n\n====Running the race====\n[[File:Oscar Pistorius, the first round of the 400m at the London 2012 Olympic Games.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Oscar Pistorius]], running in the first round of the 400&nbsp;m at the 2012 Olympics]]\n\nFor sprinting events (bar the 4 \u00d7 400&nbsp;m relay and the indoor 400&nbsp;metres), each athlete must run the race within their allocated lane from start to finish. If an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, the beginning of the 800&nbsp;m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 163.2\">IAAF Rule 163.2</ref><ref name=\"IAAF Rule 163.3\">IAAF Rule 163.3</ref>\n\nAny athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete, in a way that impedes his progress, should be disqualified from that event. However, if an athlete is pushed or forced by another person to run outside his lane, and if no material advantage is gained, the athlete should not be disqualified.<ref name=\"IAAF Rule 163.2\"/><ref name=\"IAAF Rule 163.3\"/>\n\n====The finish====\nThe finish of a race is marked by a white line 5&nbsp;cm wide.<ref>IAAF Rule 164.1</ref> The finishing position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line.<ref>IAAF Rule 164.3</ref> [[Fully automatic timing]] systems (photo timing) are becoming more and more common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a sprint record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\nWith the accuracy of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides that there has been a tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\n===Field rules===\nIn general, most field events allow a competitor to take their attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the greatest distance.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\n==== Vertical Jumps ====\nVertical jumps (high jump and pole vault) set a bar at a particular height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, which can be used to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\n==== Horizontal Jumps ====\nHorizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) and all throws must be initiated behind a line. In the case of horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt\u2014it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line on the edge of sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set\u2014so the competitor in first place at the end of the third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.<ref name=RuleBook1/>\n\n==Equipment==\nMen and women have different weights for their throwing implements \u2013 men's javelin is 800 grams compared to 600 for women, men's weight throw is 35 pounds compared to 20 for women, men's discus is 2 kilograms to women's 1, men's shot put is 16 pounds compared to 8 pounds for women, and men's hammer throw is also 16 pounds to the women's 8. Additionally, men's high hurdles are at height of 42 inches compared to women's hurdles which are 33 inches. For the intermediate hurdles (400 meter hurdles), the men's hurdle height is 36 inches compared to 30 inches for women.\n\n==Organizations==\nThe international governance of track and field falls under the jurisdiction of athletics organisations. The [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] is the global [[sport governing body|governing body]] for track and field, and athletics as a whole. The governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including [[USA Track & Field]] and the [[Philippine Amateur Track & Field Association]], but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies.<ref>[http://www.usatf.org/about/ About USATF].

Events such as the [[100 metres]] receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event.\n\nThe other two major international competition for track and field are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its [[world championship]] event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 \u2013 the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics]]. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the [[marathon]] and [[racewalking]] competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor track and field, the [[IAAF World Indoor Championships]] has been held every two years since 1985 and this is the only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.\n\n===Other championships===\n[[File:2006 European Championships in Athletics - Ullevi august 11th.jpg|thumb|The [[2006 European Athletics Championships]] at the [[Ullevi Stadium]]]]\nSimilar to the event programmes at the Olympics, Paralympics and World Championships, track and field forms a significant part of continental championships.

Doing so can not only serve as a way of determining the winner in an event, but it can also be used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's performances are recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent\u2014beginning with [[national records in athletics|national records]], then continental records, up to the global or [[world record]] level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.\n\n[[File:100m men WR.svg|thumb|left|A graph of the world record progression in the men's 100&nbsp;metres]]\n\nThe IAAF ratifies track and field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first published a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes were made in the late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if [[fully automatic electronic timing]] was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in track and field, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/96/20100113075829_httppostedfile_IAAFConstitution-01.11.09-Eng-Website_17812.pdf IAAF Constitution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705013805/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/96/20100113075829_httppostedfile_IAAFConstitution-01.11.09-Eng-Website_17812.pdf|date=5 July 2010|df=dmy-all}} (pp. 79\u201380).

For example, the [[List of Olympic records in athletics|Olympic records]] represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions.\n\n==Doping==\n{{further|Doping in sport|List of doping cases in athletics}}\n[[File:Marion Jones 12.jpg|thumb|[[Marion Jones]], after admitting to doping, lost her Olympic medals, was banned from the sport, and spent six months in jail.]]\nTrack and field athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain substances by governing bodies for the sport, from the national to the international level.

A device that is designed specifically for reading e-books is called an \"e-reader\", \"ebook device\", or \"eReader\".\n\n==History==\n\n===''The Readies'' (1930)===\nSome trace the concept of an e-reader, a device that would enable the user to view books on a screen, to a 1930 manifesto by [[Bob Brown (writer, poet, publisher)|Bob Brown]], written after watching his first \"[[talkie]]\" (movie with sound). He titled it ''The Readies'', playing off the idea of the \"talkie\".<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn6PQAAACAAJ | title = The Readies | first = Bob | last = Brown | accessdate = 2013-08-28 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129174227/https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn6PQAAACAAJ | archivedate = 2016-11-29 | isbn = 9780892630226 | year = 2009 }}.</ref> In his book, Brown says movies have outmaneuvered the book by creating the \"talki noes\" and, as a result, reading should find a new medium:\n{{quote|A simple reading machine which I can carry or move around, attach to any old electric light plug and read hundred-thousand-word novels in 10 minutes if I want to, and I want to.}}\n\nBrown's notion, however, was much more focused on reforming [[orthography]] and vocabulary, than on medium (\"It is time to pull out the stopper\" and begin \"a bloody revolution of the word.\"): introducing huge numbers of [[portmanteau]] symbols to replace normal words, and punctuation to simulate action  or movement; so it is not clear whether this fits into the history of \"e-books\" or not. Later e-readers never followed a model at all like Brown's; however, he correctly predicted the miniaturization and portability of e-readers. In an article, Jennifer Schuessler writes, \"The machine, Brown argued, would allow readers to adjust the type size, avoid paper cuts and save trees, all while hastening the day when words could be 'recorded directly on the palpitating ether.'\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Schuessler-t.html | work= The New York Times | first= Jennifer | last= Schuessler | title= The Godfather of the E-Reader | date= 2010-04-11 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170625093040/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Schuessler-t.html | archivedate= 2017-06-25 }}</ref> Brown believed that the e-reader (and his notions for changing text itself) would bring a completely new life to reading.

Different e-reader devices followed different formats, most of them accepting books in only one or a few formats, thereby fragmenting the e-book market even more. Due to the exclusiveness and limited readerships of e-books, the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling e-books.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMeanwhile, scholars formed the [[Text Encoding Initiative]], which developed consensus guidelines for encoding books and other materials of scholarly interest for a variety of analytic uses as well as reading, and countless literary and other works have been developed using the TEI approach. In the late 1990s, a consortium formed to develop the [[Open eBook]] format as a way for authors and publishers to provide a single source-document which many book-reading software and hardware platforms could handle. Several scholars from the TEI were closely involved in the early development of Open eBook [http://xml.coverpages.org/openEbook.html]. Focused on portability, Open eBook as defined required subsets of [[XHTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]; a set of multimedia formats (others could be used, but there must also be a fallback in one of the required formats), and an [[XML]] schema for a \"manifest\", to list the components of a given e-book, identify a table of contents, cover art, and so on.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This format led to the open format [[EPUB]].

A device that is designed specifically for reading e-books is called an \"e-reader\", \"ebook device\", or \"eReader\".\n\n==History==\n\n===''The Readies'' (1930)===\nSome trace the concept of an e-reader, a device that would enable the user to view books on a screen, to a 1930 manifesto by [[Bob Brown (writer, poet, publisher)|Bob Brown]], written after watching his first \"[[talkie]]\" (movie with sound). He titled it ''The Readies'', playing off the idea of the \"talkie\".<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn6PQAAACAAJ | title = The Readies | first = Bob | last = Brown | accessdate = 2013-08-28 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129174227/https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn6PQAAACAAJ | archivedate = 2016-11-29 | isbn = 9780892630226 | year = 2009 }}.</ref> In his book, Brown says movies have outmaneuvered the book by creating the \"talkies\" and, as a result, reading should find a new medium:\n{{quote|A simple reading machine which I can carry or move around, attach to any old electric light plug and read hundred-thousand-word novels in 10 minutes if I want to, and I want to.}}\n\nBrown's notion, however, was much more focused on reforming [[orthography]] and vocabulary, than on medium (\"It is time to pull out the stopper\" and begin \"a bloody revolution of the word.\"): introducing huge numbers of [[portmanteau]] symbols to replace normal words, and punctuation to simulate action  or movement; so it is not clear whether this fits into the history of \"e-books\" or not. Later e-readers never followed a model at all like Brown's; however, he correctly predicted the miniaturization and portability of e-readers. In an article, Jennifer Schuessler writes, \"The machine, Brown argued, would allow readers to adjust the type size, avoid paper cuts and save trees, all while hastening the day when words could be 'recorded directly on the palpitating ether.'\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Schuessler-t.html | work= The New York Times | first= Jennifer | last= Schuessler | title= The Godfather of the E-Reader | date= 2010-04-11 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170625093040/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/review/Schuessler-t.html | archivedate= 2017-06-25 }}</ref> Brown believed that the e-reader (and his notions for changing text itself) would bring a completely new life to reading.

Different e-reader devices followed different formats, most of them accepting books in only one or a few formats, thereby fragmenting the e-book market even more. Due to the exclusiveness and limited readerships of e-books, the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling e-books.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMeanwhile, scholars formed the [[Text Encoding Initiative]], which developed consensus guidelines for encoding books and other materials of scholarly interest for a variety of analytic uses as well as reading, and countless literary and other works have been developed using the TEI approach. In the late 1990s, a consortium formed to develop the [[Open eBook]] format as a way for authors and publishers to provide a single source-document which many book-reading software and hardware platforms could handle. Several scholars from the TEI were closely involved in the early development of Open eBook [http://xml.coverpages.org/openEbook.html]. Focused on portability, Open eBook as defined required subsets of [[XHTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]; a set of multimedia formats (others could be used, but there must also be a fallback in one of the required formats), and an [[XML]] schema for a \"manifest\", to list the components of a given e-book, identify a table of contents, cover art, and so on.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This format led to the open format [[EPUB]].

In this case, it is A's height and all ways of measuring height that will have changed. The problem with the notion of \"Cambridge change\" is its failure to acknowledge that B's or anything else's height is relational (relative to ways of measuring height). \"Height\" is thus not unary and thus is extrinsic, not intrinsic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Russellian change]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Concepts in logic]]\n\n\n{{philo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "A '''Cambridge change''' is a philosophical concept of change according to which an entity ''x'' has changed ''[[if and only if]]'' there is some [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] F that is true (not true) of ''x'' at a time ''t1'' but not true (true) of ''x'' at some later time ''t2''.\n\n==History==\nThe term ''Cambridge change'' was coined by [[Peter Geach]] in the late 1960s,<ref name=\"Geach\">Geach, P.T.

In this case, it is A's height and all ways of measuring height that will have changed. The problem with the notion of \"Cambridge change\" is its failure to acknowledge that B's or anything else's height is relational (relative to ways of measuring height). \"Height\" is thus not unary and thus is extrinsic, not intrinsic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Russellian change]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Concepts in logic]]\n\n\n{{philo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Erasmuse1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\" instead of  ' ' were used for italics in the second example, so I changed to ' ' .", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_change"}
