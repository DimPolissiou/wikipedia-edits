[[Gautama Buddha]], who founded Buddhism, was born to the [[Shakya]] clan just before [[Magadha]] (which lasted from 546\u2013324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name=\"Heehs_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the [[Kushan Empire]] and such kingdoms as [[Magadha]] and [[Kosala]].\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under [[Sankaracharya]], the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and [[ahimsa]], etc. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the [[Bhakti]] tradition, Vaishnavism and the [[Baul]]s of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] period.\n\n=== Bhakti Movement ===\nDuring the 14th\u201317th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the [[Bhakti movement|'' Bhakti'' movement]] swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]]{{dubious|date=April 2020}} of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism in India}}\n[[File:Darshani_Deori_27_September_2018.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], the holiest Sikh [[Gurdwara]]]]\n[[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] (1469\u20131539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]].

Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population. Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]]. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of [[Gujarat]], Karnataka, [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], and [[Rajasthan]].<ref name=web123/>\n\n[[Sikhism]] began in fifteenth-century [[North India]] with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] and nine successive human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]].

Hindus worldwide recognise several Indian holy cities, including [[Allahabad]] (officially known as Prayagraj), [[Haridwar]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ujjain]], [[Rameshwaram]] and [[Vrindavan]]. Notable temple cities include [[Puri]], which hosts a major [[Jagannath]] temple and [[Rath Yatra]] celebration; [[Tirumala - Tirupati]], home to the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]; and [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]], home to the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple.\n\n[[Badrinath]], [[Puri]], [[Dwarka]] and [[Rameswaram]] compose the main pilgrimage circuit of ''[[Char Dham]]'' (''four abodes'') hosting the four holiest [[Hindu]] temples:  [[Badrinath Temple]], [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]], [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarkadheesh Temple]] and [[Ramanathaswamy Temple]] respectively. The [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]] compose the smaller ''[[Chota Char Dham]]'' (''mini four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. The [[Kumbh Mela]] (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. The [[Swamithope pathi|Thalaimaippathi]] at [[Swamithope]] is the leading pilgrim center for the [[Ayyavazhi]]s.\n\nAmongst the [[Buddhist pilgrimage#The Eight Great Places|Eight Great Places]] of Buddhism, seven are in India. [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinagar]] are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. [[Sanchi]] hosts a Buddhist [[stupa]] erected by the emperor [[Ashoka]]. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where [[Buddhism]] remains a major presence. These include the [[Rumtek Monastery]], [[Enchey Monastery]] and [[Pemayangtse Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], the [[Tawang Monastery]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the [[Kye Monastery]] and [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Spiti]], the [[Ghum Monastery]] in [[Darjeeling]],  and [[Durpin Dara]] Monastery in Kalimpong, the [[Thikse Monastery]] in [[Leh]], the [[Namgyal Monastery]] in [[Dharamsala|Dharamshala]], among many others.\n\nFor Muslims, the ''Dargah Shareef'' of Khwaza [[Moinuddin Chishti]] in [[Ajmer]] is a major pilgrimage site. Other Islamic pilgrimages include those to the Tomb of Sheikh [[Salim Chishti]] in [[Fatehpur Sikri]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in Delhi, and to [[Haji Ali Dargah]] in Mumbai. [[Dilwara Temples]] in [[Mount Abu]], [[Palitana]], [[Pawapuri|Pavapuri]], [[Girnar]] and [[Shravanabelagola]] are notable pilgrimage sites ([[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]) in Jainism.\n\nThe [[Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] is the most sacred [[gurdwara]] of Sikhism, while the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed House of Worship#Delhi, India|Lotus Temple]] in Delhi is a prominent house of worship of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith.\n\nRelatively new pilgrimage sites include the [[samadhi]] of [[Meher Baba]] in [[Meherabad]], which is visited by his followers from around the world <ref>[http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf \"In His Service: A Newsletter From Meherabad\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073059/http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}.

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include ''Gudivada'', ''Padalapalli'', ''Pantham'', and ''[[Kashyap]]''.<ref name=\"reference\"/>\n\n== Religion and politics ==\n{{Main|Indian Mujahideen|Jamaat-e-Islami Hind|List of organizations banned by the Government of India}}\n{{See also|Status of religious freedom in India}}\n\n[[File: Takht Shri Hazoor Sahib Gurudwara Nanded.JPG|right|250px|thumb|[[Takht Sri Hazur Sahib]], [[Nanded]], built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated in 1708, the inner chamber is still called ''Angitha Sahib''.]]\n\n=== Politics ===\nReligious politics, particularly that expressed by the [[Hindutva]] movement, has strongly influenced [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the last quarter of the 20th century.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|1987|pp=45\u201346}}.</ref>\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], which followed [[Operation Blue Star]] by the [[Indian Army]]; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the [[Khalistan movement|Sikh partisans]] inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest [[Gurdwara]].

[[Gautama Buddha]], who founded Buddhism, was born to the [[Shakya]] clan just before [[Magadha]] (which lasted from 546\u2013324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name=\"Heehs_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the [[Kushan Empire]] and such kingdoms as [[Magadha]] and [[Kosala]].\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under [[Sankaracharya]], the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and [[ahimsa]], etc. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the [[Bhakti]] tradition, Vaishnavism and the [[Baul]]s of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] period.\n\n=== Bhakti Movement ===\nDuring the 14th\u201317th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the [[Bhakti movement|'' Bhakti'' movement]] swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]]{{dubious|date=April 2020}} of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities.

Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population. Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]].

Hindus worldwide recognise several Indian holy cities, including [[Allahabad]] (officially known as Prayagraj), [[Haridwar]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ujjain]], [[Rameshwaram]] and [[Vrindavan]]. Notable temple cities include [[Puri]], which hosts a major [[Jagannath]] temple and [[Rath Yatra]] celebration; [[Tirumala - Tirupati]], home to the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]; and [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]], home to the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple.\n\n[[Badrinath]], [[Puri]], [[Dwarka]] and [[Rameswaram]] compose the main pilgrimage circuit of ''[[Char Dham]]'' (''four abodes'') hosting the four holiest [[Hindu]] temples:  [[Badrinath Temple]], [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]], [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarkadheesh Temple]] and [[Ramanathaswamy Temple]] respectively. The [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]] compose the smaller ''[[Chota Char Dham]]'' (''mini four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. The [[Kumbh Mela]] (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. The [[Swamithope pathi|Thalaimaippathi]] at [[Swamithope]] is the leading pilgrim center for the [[Ayyavazhi]]s.\n\nAmongst the [[Buddhist pilgrimage#The Eight Great Places|Eight Great Places]] of Buddhism, seven are in India. [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinagar]] are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. [[Sanchi]] hosts a Buddhist [[stupa]] erected by the emperor [[Ashoka]]. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where [[Buddhism]] remains a major presence. These include the [[Rumtek Monastery]], [[Enchey Monastery]] and [[Pemayangtse Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], the [[Tawang Monastery]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the [[Kye Monastery]] and [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Spiti]], the [[Ghum Monastery]] in [[Darjeeling]],  and [[Durpin Dara]] Monastery in Kalimpong, the [[Thikse Monastery]] in [[Leh]], the [[Namgyal Monastery]] in [[Dharamsala|Dharamshala]], among many others.\n\nFor Muslims, the ''Dargah Shareef'' of Khwaza [[Moinuddin Chishti]] in [[Ajmer]] is a major pilgrimage site. Other Islamic pilgrimages include those to the Tomb of Sheikh [[Salim Chishti]] in [[Fatehpur Sikri]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in Delhi, and to [[Haji Ali Dargah]] in Mumbai. [[Dilwara Temples]] in [[Mount Abu]], [[Palitana]], [[Pawapuri|Pavapuri]], [[Girnar]] and [[Shravanabelagola]] are notable pilgrimage sites ([[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]) in Jainism.\n\nThe [[Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] is the most sacred [[gurdwara]] of Sikhism, while the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed House of Worship#Delhi, India|Lotus Temple]] in Delhi is a prominent house of worship of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith.\n\nRelatively new pilgrimage sites include the [[samadhi]] of [[Meher Baba]] in [[Meherabad]], which is visited by his followers from around the world <ref>[http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf \"In His Service: A Newsletter From Meherabad\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073059/http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}.

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include ''Gudivada'', ''Padalapalli'', ''Pantham'', and ''[[Kashyap]]''.<ref name=\"reference\"/>\n\n== Religion and politics ==\n{{Main|Indian Mujahideen|Jamaat-e-Islami Hind|List of organizations banned by the Government of India}}\n{{See also|Status of religious freedom in India}}\n\n[[File: Takht Shri Hazoor Sahib Gurudwara Nanded.JPG|right|250px|thumb|[[Takht Sri Hazur Sahib]], [[Nanded]], built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated in 1708, the inner chamber is still called ''Angitha Sahib''.]]\n\n=== Politics ===\nReligious politics, particularly that expressed by the [[Hindutva]] movement, has strongly influenced [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the last quarter of the 20th century.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|1987|pp=45\u201346}}.</ref>\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], which followed [[Operation Blue Star]] by the [[Indian Army]]; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the [[Khalistan movement|Sikh partisans]] inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest [[Gurdwara]].

Bourdain was a 1978 graduate of [[The Culinary Institute of America]] and a veteran of a number of professional kitchens in his long career, which included many years spent as executive chef at [[Brasserie Les Halles]] in Manhattan. He first became known for his bestselling book ''[[Kitchen Confidential (book)|Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly]]'' (2000). \n\nHis first food and world-travel television show ''[[A Cook's Tour (TV series)|A Cook's Tour]]'' ran for 35 episodes on the [[Food Network]] in 2002 and 2003. In 2005, he began hosting the [[Travel Channel]]'s culinary and cultural adventure programs ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]]'' (2005\u20132012) and ''[[The Layover (TV series)|The Layover]]'' (2011\u20132013). In 2013, he began a three-season run as a judge on ''[[The Taste]]'', and concurrently switched his travelogue programming to [[CNN]] to host ''[[Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown]]''. Though best known for his culinary writings and television presentations, along with several books on food and cooking and travel adventures, Bourdain also wrote both fiction and historical nonfiction. On June 8, 2018,  Bourdain died by [[suicide]] while on location in France for ''Parts Unknown''.\n\n==Early life==\nAnthony Bourdain was born on June 25, 1956 in [[New York City]], and was the older of two sons of<ref name=\"Current Biography\">{{cite book|last1=Rolls|first1=Albert|editor1-last=Thompson|editor1-first=Clifford|title=Current Biography Yearbook 2006|date=2006|publisher=H.

Car\u00eame is often considered one of the first internationally renowned [[celebrity chef]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nAbandoned by his parents in Paris in 1794 at the height of the [[French Revolution]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Connell |first=Brendan |year=2012 |title=Lives of Notorious Cooks |publisher=Chomu Press |isbn=978-1907681202 }}</ref> he worked as a kitchen boy at a cheap Parisian [[chophouse]] in exchange for room and board. In 1798, he was formally apprenticed to Sylvain Bailly, a famous ''[[Pastry chef|p\u00e2tissier]]'' with a shop near the [[Palais-Royal]]. The post-revolutionary Palais-Royal was a high profile, fashionable neighborhood filled with vibrant life and bustling crowds.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Ian |title=Cooking for Kings, the Life of Antonin Car\u00e8me, the First Celebrity Chef |publisher=Walker & Company |year=2003 |pages=35\u201336 |isbn=978-0802714367 }}</ref> Bailly recognized his talent and ambition. By the time he was prepared to leave Bailly, he could stipulate that he should be free to leave his new employer when a better offer came along. Car\u00eame opened his own shop, the ''P\u00e2tisserie de la rue de la Paix'', which he maintained until 1813.\n\nCar\u00eame gained fame in Paris for his ''[[pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es]]'', elaborate constructions used as centerpieces, which Bailly had displayed in the p\u00e2tisserie window. He made these confections, which were sometimes several feet high, entirely out of foodstuffs such as sugar, marzipan, and pastry. He modeled them on temples, pyramids, and ancient ruins, taking ideas from architectural history books which he studied at the nearby [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], thanks to the enlightened attitude of his first employer Bailly.<ref>Kelly (2004), Chapter 2.</ref> He is credited with the inventions of ''gros nougats''<ref>One of the pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es at the dinner served to the Prince Regent and the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, 18 January 1817 ([http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/n-s/princeregent3a.html Channel 4 reportage]) was \"Un gros nougat \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\"; the [[Royal Pavilion]] in sugar was also featured.</ref> and ''grosses meringues'', ''croquantes'', made of almonds and honey, and ''[[Sally Lunn bun#Origins|solilemmes]]''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Bernier |title=Antonin Car\u00eame (1783\u20131833): La sensualit\u00e9 en Europe |location=Paris |publisher=B.

While working on his confections at many private kitchens, he quickly extended his culinary skills to main courses.\n\nNapoleon was famously indifferent to food, but he understood the importance of social relations in the world of diplomacy. In 1804, he gave money to [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] to purchase [[Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay]], a large estate outside Paris. The ch\u00e2teau was intended to act as a kind of diplomatic gathering place. When Talleyrand moved there, he took Car\u00eame with him.\n\nCar\u00eame was set a test by Talleyrand: to create a whole year\u2019s worth of menus, without repetition, and using only seasonal produce. Car\u00eame passed the test and completed his training in Talleyrand's kitchens. After the fall of Napoleon, Car\u00eame went to London for a time and served as ''chef de cuisine'' to the [[Prince Regent]], later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. Returning to the continent, he accepted the invitation of Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to come to St. Petersburg, but stayed so briefly that he prepared not even a single meal for the Tsar. Upon returning to Paris, he became chef to banker [[James Mayer Rothschild]].<ref>[http://www.soupsong.com/rcareme.html Lady Morgan English fish soup (Creation of the great French Chef Marie Antoine Careme, 1784\u20131833)]</ref>\n\nCar\u00eame died in his Paris house on the Rue Neuve Saint Roche at the age of 48, due perhaps to many years inhaling the toxic fumes of the coal burning stoves over which he cooked.<ref>Kelly, p. 79, 206</ref> He is remembered as the founder of the concept of ''[[haute cuisine]]'' and is interred in the [[Montmartre Cemetery]] in [[Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1948 | title=CAREME Marie Antoine dit Antonin (1784-1833) | access-date=2015-02-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201005314/http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1948 | archive-date=2018-12-01 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nIn his first major position, Car\u00eame worked as ''chef de cuisine'' to Talleyrand, who encouraged Car\u00eame in the development of a new refined food style using herbs, fresh vegetables, and simplified sauces with few ingredients. Talleyrand became a famous host during the [[Congress of Vienna]]\u2014 by the time the congress disbanded, not only the map of Europe but also the culinary tastes of its upper classes had been thoroughly revised.\n\nCar\u00eame's impact on culinary matters ranged from trivial to theoretical. He is credited with creating the standard chef's hat, the ''[[Toque (French)#Culinary use|toque]]'', he devised new sauces and dishes, and he published a classification of all sauces into groups based on four [[mother sauces]].<ref name=\"Car\u00eame1854\">{{cite book|last=Car\u00eame|first=Marie Antonin|year=1854|title=L'art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle|volume=3|publisher=Au Depot de librairie|location=Paris|language=French|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0543991261|page=1|accessdate=7 December 2013}}</ref> He is also frequently credited with replacing the practice of ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' (serving all dishes at once) with ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' (serving each dish in the order printed on the menu) after he returned from service in the Russian court,<ref>\"...Service \u00e0 la russe [,] the style Car\u00eame helped to import from Russia...\": Kelly, p. 13</ref> but others say he was a diehard supporter of ''service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise''.<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Car\u00eame made a final stand for the elaborate ''service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise'', arguing for its superiority with his elaborate ''pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es'' |first=John |last=Fischer |title=Table Service |journal=Gastronomica |year=2001 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=90\u201391 |doi=10.1525/gfc.2001.1.3.90 }}</ref>\n\n==Works by Car\u00eame==\nCar\u00eame wrote several books on cookery,  above all the encyclopedic ''L'Art de la Cuisine Fran\u00e7aise'' (5 vols, 1833\u201334, of which he had completed three before his death), which included, aside from hundreds of recipes, plans for menus and opulent table settings, a history of French cookery, and instructions for organizing kitchens.\n\n* ''Le P\u00e2tissier royal parisien, ou Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et pratique de la p\u00e2tisserie moderne, suivi d'observations utiles au progr\u00e8s de cet art, et d'une revue critique des grands bals de 18\n* ''Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais, ou Parall\u00e8le de la cuisine ancienne et moderne, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 sous rapport de l'ordonnance des menus selon les quatre saisons.''

Car\u00eame is often considered one of the first internationally renowned [[celebrity chef]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nAbandoned by his parents in Paris in 1794 at the height of the [[French Revolution]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Connell |first=Brendan |year=2012 |title=Lives of Notorious Cooks |publisher=Chomu Press |isbn=978-1907681202 }}</ref> he worked as a kitchen boy at a cheap Parisian [[chophouse]] in exchange for room and board. In 1798, he was formally apprenticed to Sylvain Bailly, a famous ''[[Pastry chef|p\u00e2tissier]]'' with a shop near the [[Palais-Royal]]. The post-revolutionary Palais-Royal was a high profile, fashionable neighborhood filled with vibrant life and bustling crowds.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Ian |title=Cooking for Kings, the Life of Antonin Car\u00e8me, the First Celebrity Chef |publisher=Walker & Company |year=2003 |pages=35\u201336 |isbn=978-0802714367 }}</ref> Bailly recognized his talent and ambition. By the time he was prepared to leave Bailly, he could stipulate that he should be free to leave his new employer when a better offer came along. Car\u00eame opened his own shop, the ''P\u00e2tisserie de la rue de la Paix'', which he maintained until 1813.\n\nCar\u00eame gained fame in Paris for his ''[[pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es]]'', elaborate constructions used as centerpieces, which Bailly had displayed in the p\u00e2tisserie window. He made these confections, which were sometimes several feet high, entirely out of foodstuffs such as sugar, marzipan, and pastry. He modeled them on temples, pyramids, and ancient ruins, taking ideas from architectural history books which he studied at the nearby [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], thanks to the enlightened attitude of his first employer Bailly.<ref>Kelly (2004), Chapter 2.</ref> He is credited with the inventions of ''gros nougats''<ref>One of the pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es at the dinner served to the Prince Regent and the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, 18 January 1817 ([http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/n-s/princeregent3a.html Channel 4 reportage]) was \"Un gros nougat \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\"; the [[Royal Pavilion]] in sugar was also featured.</ref> and ''grosses meringues'', ''croquantes'', made of almonds and honey, and ''[[Sally Lunn bun#Origins|solilemmes]]''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Bernier |title=Antonin Car\u00eame (1783\u20131833): La sensualit\u00e9 en Europe |location=Paris |publisher=B.

While working on his confections at many private kitchens, he quickly extended his culinary skills to main courses.\n\nNapoleon was famously indifferent to food, but he understood the importance of social relations in the world of diplomacy. In 1804, he gave money to [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] to purchase [[Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay]], a large estate outside Paris. The ch\u00e2teau was intended to act as a kind of diplomatic gathering place. When Talleyrand moved there, he took Car\u00eame with him.\n\nCar\u00eame was set a test by Talleyrand: to create a whole year\u2019s worth of menus, without repetition, and using only seasonal produce. Car\u00eame passed the test and completed his training in Talleyrand's kitchens. After the fall of Napoleon, Car\u00eame went to London for a time and served as ''chef de cuisine'' to the [[Prince Regent]], later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. Returning to the continent, he accepted the invitation of Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to come to St. Petersburg, but stayed so briefly that he prepared not even a single meal for the Tsar. Upon returning to Paris, he became chef to banker [[James Mayer Rothschild]].<ref>[http://www.soupsong.com/rcareme.html Lady Morgan English fish soup (Creation of the great French Chef Marie Antoine Careme, 1784\u20131833)]</ref>\n\nCar\u00eame died in his Paris house on the Rue Neuve Saint Roche at the age of 48, due perhaps to many years inhaling the toxic fumes of the coal burning stoves over which he cooked.<ref>Kelly, p. 79, 206</ref> He is remembered as the founder of the concept of [[haute cuisine]] and is interred in the [[Montmartre Cemetery]] in [[Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1948 | title=CAREME Marie Antoine dit Antonin (1784-1833) | access-date=2015-02-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201005314/http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1948 | archive-date=2018-12-01 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nIn his first major position, Car\u00eame worked as ''chef de cuisine'' to Talleyrand, who encouraged Car\u00eame in the development of a new refined food style using herbs, fresh vegetables, and simplified sauces with few ingredients. Talleyrand became a famous host during the [[Congress of Vienna]]\u2014 by the time the congress disbanded, not only the map of Europe but also the culinary tastes of its upper classes had been thoroughly revised.\n\nCar\u00eame's impact on culinary matters ranged from trivial to theoretical. He is credited with creating the standard chef's hat, the ''[[Toque (French)#Culinary use|toque]]'', he devised new sauces and dishes, and he published a classification of all sauces into groups based on four [[mother sauces]].<ref name=\"Car\u00eame1854\">{{cite book|last=Car\u00eame|first=Marie Antonin|year=1854|title=L'art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle|volume=3|publisher=Au Depot de librairie|location=Paris|language=French|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0543991261|page=1|accessdate=7 December 2013}}</ref> He is also frequently credited with replacing the practice of ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' (serving all dishes at once) with ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' (serving each dish in the order printed on the menu) after he returned from service in the Russian court,<ref>\"...Service \u00e0 la russe [,] the style Car\u00eame helped to import from Russia...\": Kelly, p. 13</ref> but others say he was a diehard supporter of ''service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise''.<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Car\u00eame made a final stand for the elaborate ''service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise'', arguing for its superiority with his elaborate ''pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es'' |first=John |last=Fischer |title=Table Service |journal=Gastronomica |year=2001 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=90\u201391 |doi=10.1525/gfc.2001.1.3.90 }}</ref>\n\n==Works by Car\u00eame==\nCar\u00eame wrote several books on cookery,  above all the encyclopedic ''L'Art de la Cuisine Fran\u00e7aise'' (5 vols, 1833\u201334, of which he had completed three before his death), which included, aside from hundreds of recipes, plans for menus and opulent table settings, a history of French cookery, and instructions for organizing kitchens.\n\n* ''Le P\u00e2tissier royal parisien, ou Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et pratique de la p\u00e2tisserie moderne, suivi d'observations utiles au progr\u00e8s de cet art, et d'une revue critique des grands bals de 18\n* ''Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais, ou Parall\u00e8le de la cuisine ancienne et moderne, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 sous rapport de l'ordonnance des menus selon les quatre saisons.''

While this saved a tremendous amount of time, for 17 years the ''Wind Waker'' speedrun time was still significantly held back by there being no known way to skip a barrier that separated an area accessible very early in the game from the final dungeon.  However, on July 5, 2019, a way to skip the barrier was finally found using an actor unloading glitch, which involves filling up the game's [[dynamic memory]] to the point that actors fail to load, including the barrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wind Waker - Barrier Skip|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtc-RojbdyQ}}</ref>\n\nIn the months following this major discovery, the Any% record fell by over 2 and a half hours.

However, on July 5, 2019, a way to skip the barrier was finally found using an actor unloading glitch, which involves filling up the game's [[dynamic memory]] to the point that actors fail to load, including the barrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wind Waker - Barrier Skip|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtc-RojbdyQ}}</ref>\n\nIn the months following this major discovery, the Any% record fell by over 2 and a half hours.

Many devices have been developed, usually modeled on the [[cochlear implant]] or bionic ear devices, a type of [[Neuroprosthetics|neural prosthesis]] in use since the mid-1980s.

For retinal prostheses, which are the most prevalent visual prosthetic under development (due to ease of access to the retina among other considerations), patients with vision loss due to degeneration of [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] ([[retinitis pigmentosa]], [[choroideremia]], geographic atrophy macular degeneration) are the best candidate for treatment.

Images are projected onto healthy areas of the central retina, outside the degenerated [[macula]], and is enlarged to reduce the effect the blind spot has on central vision. 2.2x or 2.7x magnification strengths make it possible to see or discern the central vision object of interest while the other eye is used for peripheral vision because the eye that has the implant will have limited peripheral vision as a side effect. Unlike a telescope which would be hand-held, the implant moves with the eye which is the main advantage. Patients using the device may however still need glasses for optimal vision and for close work. Before surgery, patients should first try out a hand-held telescope to see if they would benefit from image enlargement. One of the main drawbacks is that it cannot be used for patients who have had [[cataract surgery]] as the [[intraocular lens]] would obstruct insertion of the telescope.

As natural [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are far more efficient than [[photodiode]]s, visible light is not powerful enough to stimulate the MPDA. Therefore, an external power supply is used to enhance the stimulation current. The German team commenced in vivo experiments in 2000, when evoked cortical potentials were measured from Yucat\u00e1n micropigs and rabbits. At 14 months post implantation, the implant and retina surrounding it were examined and there were no noticeable changes to anatomical integrity. The implants were successful in producing evoked cortical potentials in half of the animals tested. The thresholds identified in this study were similar to those required in epiretinal stimulation.

BVA was a consortium of some of Australia's leading universities and research institutes, and funded by the Australian Research Council from 2010, it ceased operations on 31 December 2016. The members of the consortium consisted of [[Bionics Institute]], [[University of New South Wales|UNSW Sydney]], Data 61 [[CSIRO|CSRIO]], Center for Eye Research Australia (CERA), and [[University of Melbourne|The University of Melbourne]]. There were many more partners as well. The Australian Federal Government awarded a $42 million ARC grant to Bionic Vision Australia to develop bionic vision technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bionicvision.org.au/|title=About BVA|website=Bionicvision|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nWhile the BVA consortium was still together, the team was led by Professor Anthony Burkitt, and they were developing two retinal prostheses. One known as The Wide-View device, that combined novel technologies with materials that had been successfully used in other clinical implants. This approach incorporated a microchip with 98 stimulating electrodes and aimed to provide increased mobility for patients to help them move safely in their environment. This implant would be placed in the suprachoroidal space. Researchers expected the first patient tests to begin with this device in 2013, it is currently unknown whether full trials were conducted, but at least one woman named Dianne Ashworth was implanted with the device, and was able to read letters and numbers using it.,<ref>{{Citation|title=Dianne Ashworth 12 months on, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQEZiAuJ_AE|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> she later went on to write a book titled \"I Spy With My Bionic Eye\", about her life, vision loss, and being the first person to be implanted with the BVA, Bioinc Eye device.\n\nBVA was also concurrently developing the High-Acuity device, which incorporated a number of new technologies to bring together a microchip and an implant with 1024 electrodes. The device aimed to provide functional central vision to assist with tasks such as face recognition and reading large print. This high-acuity implant would be inserted epiretinally. Patient tests were planned for this device in 2014 once preclinical testing had been completed, it is unknown whether these trials ever took place.\n\nPatients with [[retinitis pigmentosa]] were to be the first to participate in the studies, followed by age-related macular degeneration.  Each prototype consisted of a camera, attached to a pair of glasses which sent the signal to the implanted microchip, where it was converted into electrical impulses to stimulate the remaining healthy neurons in the retina. This information was then passed on to the optic nerve and the vision processing centres of the brain.\n\nOn January 2, 2019, BVT released positive results from a set of trials on four Australians using a new version of the device. Older versions of the device were only designed to be used temporarily, but the new design allowed the technology to be used constantly, and for the first time outside the lab, even to be taken home. More implants are to be administered throughout 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=Channel 9 BVT|url=https://www.facebook.com/BionicVisionTechnologies/videos/1541714469305476/|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fact sheets dated March, 2019, on BVT's website, they expect the device to obtain market approval in 3 to 5 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bionicvis.com/fact-sheets/|title=Fact Sheets {{!}} Bionic Vision Technologies|website=bionicvis.com|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\n===Dobelle Eye===\n{{Main|William H.

Images are projected onto healthy areas of the central retina, outside the degenerated [[macula]], and is enlarged to reduce the effect the blind spot has on central vision. 2.2x or 2.7x magnification strengths make it possible to see or discern the central vision object of interest while the other eye is used for peripheral vision because the eye that has the implant will have limited peripheral vision as a side effect. Unlike a telescope which would be hand-held, the implant moves with the eye which is the main advantage. Patients using the device may however still need glasses for optimal vision and for close work. Before surgery, patients should first try out a hand-held telescope to see if they would benefit from image enlargement. One of the main drawbacks is that it cannot be used for patients who have had [[cataract surgery]] as the [[intraocular lens]] would obstruct insertion of the telescope. It also requires a large incision in the [[cornea]] to insert.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lipshitz|first=Isaac|title=Implantable Telescope Technology|url=http://www.centrasight.com/centrasight_technology|publisher=VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nA [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane systematic review]] seeking to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the implantable miniature telescope for patients with late or advanced age-related macular degeneration found only one ongoing study evaluating the OriLens intraocular telescope, with results expected in 2020.<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{cite journal | author=Gupta A, Lam J, Custis P, Munz S, Fong D, Koster M | title=Implantable miniature telescope (IMT) for vision loss due to end-stage age-related macular degeneration | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume= 5| issue=5 | pages=CD011140 | date=2018 | pmid=29847689 | pmc=6022289 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011140.pub2}}</ref>\n\n===T\u00fcbingen MPDA Project Alpha IMS===\nA Southern German team led by the University Eye Hospital in T\u00fcbingen, was formed in 1995 by Eberhart Zrenner to develop a subretinal prosthesis.\nThe chip is located behind the [[retina]] and utilizes microphotodiode arrays (MPDA) which collect incident light and transform it into electrical current stimulating the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s.\nAs natural [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are far more efficient than [[photodiode]]s, visible light is not powerful enough to stimulate the MPDA. Therefore, an external power supply is used to enhance the stimulation current. The German team commenced in vivo experiments in 2000, when evoked cortical potentials were measured from Yucat\u00e1n micropigs and rabbits. At 14 months post implantation, the implant and retina surrounding it were examined and there were no noticeable changes to anatomical integrity. The implants were successful in producing evoked cortical potentials in half of the animals tested.

This approach incorporated a microchip with 98 stimulating electrodes and aimed to provide increased mobility for patients to help them move safely in their environment. This implant would be placed in the suprachoroidal space. Researchers expected the first patient tests to begin with this device in 2013, it is currently unknown whether full trials were conducted, but at least one woman named Dianne Ashworth was implanted with the device, and was able to read letters and numbers using it.,<ref>{{Citation|title=Dianne Ashworth 12 months on, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQEZiAuJ_AE|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> she later went on to write a book titled \"I Spy With My Bionic Eye\", about her life, vision loss, and being the first person to be implanted with the BVA, Bioinc Eye device.\n\nBVA was also concurrently developing the High-Acuity device, which incorporated a number of new technologies to bring together a microchip and an implant with 1024 electrodes. The device aimed to provide functional central vision to assist with tasks such as face recognition and reading large print. This high-acuity implant would be inserted epiretinally. Patient tests were planned for this device in 2014 once preclinical testing had been completed, it is unknown whether these trials ever took place.\n\nPatients with [[retinitis pigmentosa]] were to be the first to participate in the studies, followed by age-related macular degeneration.  Each prototype consisted of a camera, attached to a pair of glasses which sent the signal to the implanted microchip, where it was converted into electrical impulses to stimulate the remaining healthy neurons in the retina. This information was then passed on to the optic nerve and the vision processing centres of the brain.\n\nOn January 2, 2019, BVT released positive results from a set of trials on four Australians using a new version of the device. Older versions of the device were only designed to be used temporarily, but the new design allowed the technology to be used constantly, and for the first time outside the lab, even to be taken home. More implants are to be administered throughout 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=Channel 9 BVT|url=https://www.facebook.com/BionicVisionTechnologies/videos/1541714469305476/|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fact sheets dated March, 2019, on BVT's website, they expect the device to obtain market approval in 3 to 5 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bionicvis.com/fact-sheets/|title=Fact Sheets {{!}} Bionic Vision Technologies|website=bionicvis.com|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\n===Dobelle Eye===\n{{Main|William H. Dobelle}}\n\nSimilar in function to the Harvard/MIT device, except the stimulator chip sits in the [[primary visual cortex]], rather than on the retina. Many subjects have been implanted with a high success rate and limited negative effects.

This work was in 2012.}}\nThe Laboratory of Neural Prosthetics at Illinois Institute Of Technology (IIT), Chicago, is developing a visual prosthetic using intracortical electrode arrays. While similar in principle to the Dobelle system, the use of intracortical electrodes allow for greatly increased spatial resolution in the stimulation signals (more electrodes per unit area). In addition, a wireless telemetry system  is being developed<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rush|first=Alexander|author2=PR Troyk |title=A Power and Data Link for a Wireless-Implanted Neural Recording System|journal=Transactions on Biomedical Engineering|date=November 2012|volume=59|issue=11|pages=3255\u201362|pmid=22922687|doi=10.1109/tbme.2012.2214385}}</ref> to eliminate the need for transcranial wires. Arrays of activated iridium oxide film (AIROF)-coated electrodes will be implanted in the visual cortex, located on the occipital lobe of the brain. External hardware will capture images, process them, and generate instructions which will then be transmitted to implanted circuitry via a telemetry link. The circuitry will decode the instructions and stimulate the electrodes, in turn stimulating the visual cortex. The group is developing a wearable external image capture and processing system to accompany the implanted circuitry.
