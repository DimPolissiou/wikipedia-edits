She is named in honor of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the 26th [[President of the United States]]. She is the [[USS\u00a0Roosevelt|fourth ship named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt]], three bearing his full name and a fourth with just his [[SS Roosevelt (1905)|last name]]. Another three U.S. Navy ships have \"Roosevelt\" in their names in honor of members of the [[Roosevelt family]]. This carrier's radio [[call sign]] is \"Rough Rider\", the nickname of President Roosevelt's [[Rough Riders|volunteer cavalry unit]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. She was launched in 1984, and saw her first action during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n==Background==\nInitially, President [[Gerald Ford]] cancelled the order for CVN-71 in 1976 and substituted two [[Aircraft Carrier (Medium)|CVV-type medium-sized, conventional-powered carrier]]s that were expected to operate [[V/STOL]] aircraft. The existing T-CBL design formed the basis for the new CVV, serving as a replacement for the aging {{sclass-|Midway|aircraft carrier|0}} carriers, while capable of operating all existing conventional carrier aircraft. This capability to operate conventional aircraft proved important as the [[Rockwell XFV-12|hoped-for supersonic V/STOL fighters]] did not come to fruition at the time.

She was launched in 1984, and saw her first action during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n==Background==\nInitially, President [[Gerald Ford]] cancelled the order for CVN-71 in 1976 and substituted two [[Aircraft Carrier (Medium)|CVV-type medium-sized, conventional-powered carrier]]s that were expected to operate [[V/STOL]] aircraft. The existing T-CBL design formed the basis for the new CVV, serving as a replacement for the aging {{sclass-|Midway|aircraft carrier|0}} carriers, while capable of operating all existing conventional carrier aircraft. This capability to operate conventional aircraft proved important as the [[Rockwell XFV-12|hoped-for supersonic V/STOL fighters]] did not come to fruition at the time. In any case, construction of the proposed CVV medium-sized carrier never took place.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: An Illustrated Design History |last=Friedman |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Friedman |year=1983 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn=978-0-87021-739-5 |pages=323\u2013324; 329\u2013333 |url=http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022162107/http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |archive-date=22 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=NANcvvJUL79>{{cite web |title=CVV |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |work=Naval Aviations News |publisher=[[Naval History & Heritage Command]] |location=[[Washington Navy Yard]] |page=8 |format=PDF |date=July 1979 |accessdate=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816080321/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |archivedate=16 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuthorization for CVN-71 was further delayed when President [[Jimmy Carter]] [[Veto#United States|vetoed]] the 1979 Fiscal Year Department of Defense authorization bill because of the inclusion of this ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarrier in the Navy's shipbuilding program.<ref name=NANcvvJUL79/><ref name=Polmar>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events, Volume 2 |last=Polmar |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |location=[[Dulles, Virginia]] |isbn=978-1-57488-663-4 |page=364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331175731/https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |archive-date=31 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result of the [[Iran hostage crisis]] which required the increased deployment of U.S. aircraft [[carrier battle group]]s to the [[Indian Ocean]], President Carter reversed his stand on ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarriers, and CVN-71 was subsequently authorized under the 1980 Fiscal Year authorization bill for the U.S. Department of Defense.<ref name=Polmar/>\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Theodore Roosevelt'' was the first aircraft carrier to be assembled using modular construction, wherein large modules are independently constructed in \"lay-down\" areas, prior to being hoisted into place and welded together.
