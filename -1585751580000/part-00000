It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.\n\nTwo of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]]. As such, Mendoza is one of the nine Great Wine Capitals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |title=The Great Wine Capitals |access-date=2019-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807002916/http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |archive-date=2019-08-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the city is an emerging [[enotourism]] destination and base for exploring the region's hundreds of wineries located along the [[Argentina Wine Route]].\n\n== History ==\nOn March 2, 1561, [[Pedro del Castillo]] founded the city and named it ''Ciudad de Mendoza del Nuevo Valle de La Rioja'' after the governor of [[Chile]], Don [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |title=welcomeargentina.com: Land of the good wine |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018111852/http://welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |archive-date=2007-10-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Before the 1560s the area was populated by tribes known as the [[Huarpe]]s and [[Puelche]]s. The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.[[File:Traza de la segunda fundaci\u00f3n de Mendoza, 1562.jpg|left|thumb|Print of the second foundation of Mendoza, 1562]]It is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Mart\u00edn and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles \u2013 The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people.

It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports. In the winter, [[ski]]ers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.\n\nTwo of the main industries of the Mendoza area are [[olive oil]] production and [[Argentine wine]]. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in [[South America]]. As such, Mendoza is one of the nine Great Wine Capitals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |title=The Great Wine Capitals |access-date=2019-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807002916/http://www.greatwinecapitals.com/ |archive-date=2019-08-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the city is an emerging [[enotourism]] destination and base for exploring the region's hundreds of wineries located along the [[Argentina Wine Route]].\n\n== History ==\nOn March 2, 1561, [[Pedro del Castillo]] founded the city and named it ''Ciudad de Mendoza del Nuevo Valle de La Rioja'' after the governor of [[Chile]], Don [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |title=welcomeargentina.com: Land of the good wine |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018111852/http://welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/history.html |archive-date=2007-10-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Before the 1560s the area was populated by tribes known as the [[Huarpe]]s and [[Puelche]]s. The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.[[File:Traza de la segunda fundaci\u00f3n de Mendoza, 1562.jpg|left|thumb|Print of the second foundation of Mendoza, 1562]]It is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Mart\u00edn and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of [[Chilean Independence|Chile]] and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |title=Morris Charles \u2013 The Hannibal of the Andes and the Freedom of Chile |access-date=2007-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610043606/http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=morris&book=samerican&story=hannibal |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMendoza suffered [[1861 Mendoza earthquake|a severe earthquake]] in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people.

The series premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on January 2, 2019, and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]].\n\nThe series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|after]] [[Super Bowl LIV]] on February 2, 2020.\n\n==History==\n''The Masked Singer'' is based on the South Korean show ''[[King of Mask Singer]]''. Executive producer [[donald trump\n''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text'''''''''Bold text''''''Bold text'''''''''''''''''''''''' Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant. While an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing on a television, he observed that the other patrons \"were all just staring at this TV watching this crazy kangaroo in like a [[Artificial leather|pleather]] outfit singing, and we didn't even finish dinner.\" Plestis and his daughter began to research the series, and he later secured the rights to produce an American adaptation, which he sold to Fox.\n\nDue to Plestis' relationship with the studio, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]] of ''The Masked Singer'' was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s parent [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]). For the second season, production transitioned to a new in-house studio under the Fox network, Fox Alternative Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1019279/the-secrets-of-the-masked-singer-everything-we-ve-learned-about-tv-s-most-mysterious-show|title=The Secrets of The Masked Singer: Everything We've Learned About TV's Most Mysterious Show|date=February 27, 2019|website=E!

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, and the panelists and audience vote for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask and reveal their identity.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Natalie |title=The Masked Singer Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl |url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/ |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show, referred to as the \"clue package\" by the panelists. Such clues may feature cryptic allusions to what the celebrity is known for, or may be more direct references to public but somewhat obscure knowledge of the celebrity. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' distorted voices.

2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This ambition was evident in many of the season's costumes. Tree was experimental; Toybina and her team challenged themselves to question \"what fabric can do\" by creating something new and different. Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's triple tail coat was [[samurai]]-like and had its mask [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to than stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design, and rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design and created a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while the Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and included a top hat made of foam. In the case of the Egg, the costume was requested by a contestant. The end result, which was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]],\" incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina says.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, Toybina had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask so as to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume in order to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears.

series, part of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise, featuring celebrities in head-to-toe costumes and face masks which conceal their identities from other contestants, panelists, and an audience. The series premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on January 2, 2019, and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]].\n\nThe series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|after]] [[Super Bowl LIV]] on February 2, 2020.\n\n==History==\n''The Masked Singer'' is based on the South Korean show ''[[King of Mask Singer]]''. Executive producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant. While an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing on a television, he observed that the other patrons \"were all just staring at this TV watching this crazy kangaroo in like a [[Artificial leather|pleather]] outfit singing, and we didn't even finish dinner.\" Plestis and his daughter began to research the series, and he later secured the rights to produce an American adaptation, which he sold to Fox.\n\nDue to Plestis' relationship with the studio, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]] of ''The Masked Singer'' was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s parent [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]). For the second season, production transitioned to a new in-house studio under the Fox network, Fox Alternative Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1019279/the-secrets-of-the-masked-singer-everything-we-ve-learned-about-tv-s-most-mysterious-show|title=The Secrets of The Masked Singer: Everything We've Learned About TV's Most Mysterious Show|date=February 27, 2019|website=E!

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, and the panelists and audience vote for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask and reveal their identity.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Natalie |title=The Masked Singer Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl |url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/ |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show, referred to as the \"clue package\" by the panelists. Such clues may feature cryptic allusions to what the celebrity is known for, or may be more direct references to public but somewhat obscure knowledge of the celebrity. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' distorted voices. The panelists are given time to speculate the identity of the singer after the performance, including the opportunity to ask questions or gain additional clues offered by the host.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\"/>\n\n===Panelists and host===\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 420\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = Robin Thicke 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Robin Thicke]]\n| image2   = Jenny McCarthy at E3 2006.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Jenny McCarthy]]\n| image3   = Ken Jeong March 2015.jpg\n| caption3 = [[Ken Jeong]]\n| image4   = Nicole Scherzinger 2012.jpg\n| caption4 = [[Nicole Scherzinger]]\n| image5   = Nick Cannon by David Shankbone.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Nick Cannon]] \n}}\n\nFollowing the announcement of the series, it was confirmed by Fox that the judging panel would consist of singer-songwriter [[Robin Thicke]], television personality [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], actor and comedian [[Ken Jeong]], and recording artist [[Nicole Scherzinger]].

2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This ambition was evident in many of the season's costumes. Tree was experimental; Toybina and her team challenged themselves to question \"what fabric can do\" by creating something new and different. Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's triple tail coat was [[samurai]]-like and had its mask [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to than stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design, and rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design and created a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while the Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and included a top hat made of foam. In the case of the Egg, the costume was requested by a contestant. The end result, which was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]],\" incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina says.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, Toybina had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask so as to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume in order to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears. Contrary to popular belief, Toybina insists the costume was not made to resemble asparagus, rather, it was born out of pure creativity.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/>\n\nThe third season featured eighteen new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons.

The novel is notable for featuring Poirot's efficient secretary, Miss Felicity Lemon, who had previously only appeared in the Poirot short stories.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nAn outbreak of apparent [[kleptomania]] at a student hostel arouses Hercule Poirot's interest when he sees the bizarre list of stolen and vandalised items. These include a [[stethoscope]], some lightbulbs, some old flannel trousers, a box of chocolates, a slashed rucksack, some [[Boric acid|boracic powder]] and a diamond ring later found in a bowl of a soup \u2013 he congratulates the warden, Mrs Hubbard, on a 'unique and beautiful problem'. Poirot's solution of the petty thefts is unsubtle but effective: once he has threatened to call in the police, Celia Austin quickly confesses to the pettier incidents. She denies, however, the following: stealing Nigel Chapman's green ink and using it to deface Elizabeth Johnston's work; taking the stethoscope, the light bulbs and boracic powder; and cutting up and concealing a rucksack. She committed the lesser thefts to attract the attention of Colin McNabb, a psychology student who then becomes engaged to her. She makes restitution for the crimes and reconciles with her victims. The more important incidents remain unsolved. Celia is discovered dead the following morning from an overdose of morphine. It does not take investigators long to see that her death is murder.\n\nInspector Sharpe solves the mystery of the stolen stethoscope during his interviews with the inhabitants of the hostel. Nigel Chapman admits to having stolen the stethoscope to pose as a doctor and steal some morphine tartrate from the hospital dispensary as part of a bet to acquire three deadly poisons (the other two being [[digitalin]] and [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]]). He claims the poisons were carefully disposed of, but cannot be sure that the morphine was not stolen from him while it was in his possession. Poirot turns his attention to the reappearance of the diamond ring, and confronts Valerie Hobhouse, in whose soup the ring was found. It seems that the diamond had been replaced with a [[zircon]] and that only Valerie could place it in the dish of soup; Poirot accuses her of having stolen the diamond. She admits to having done so, saying that she needed the money to pay off gambling debts. She also admits to having planted in Celia Austin's mind the idea of the thefts.\n\nMrs Nicoletis is behaving very nervously. She is killed by drinking poisoned brandy. Poirot focuses his attention now on the cutting up of the rucksack. By careful study of the rucksack's design, he identifies an unusual corrugated base, and suggests to the police that the rucksack is part of an international smuggling operation. The rucksacks were sold to innocent students, and then used to transport drugs and gems. Mrs Nicoletis had been bankrolling the organisation, but was not the brain behind it. When the police visited Hickory Road on an unconnected issue, the murderer had cut up the rucksack to avoid its being found and removed light bulbs to avoid being recognised.\n\nPatricia Lane comes to Nigel and admits that she has taken the morphine from the bottle in his drawer and substituted for it [[Sodium bicarbonate|bicarbonate of soda]]. Now the bottle of bicarbonate of soda has been taken from her own drawer. While they are searching for this bottle she mentions that she is intending to write to his father to reconcile the two. Nigel tells her that the reason for his estrangement from his father is that he discovered that his father had poisoned his mother with Medinal, a trade name for [[barbitone|barbitone sodium]]. This is why he changed his name and carries two passports. Nigel goes to Inspector Sharpe and tells him about the missing morphine, but while he is there, Patricia telephones to say that she has discovered something further. By the time that Nigel and Sharpe get to the house, she is dead, killed by a blow to the head. Akibombo comes to Sharpe and says that he had taken Patricia's bicarbonate to ease a stomach complaint; when he took a teaspoonful of the bicarbonate, however, he had stomach pains and later discovered that the white powder was in fact the boracic powder. By the time Patricia had substituted the bicarbonate, the morphine had already been substituted by the stolen boracic powder. Poirot's suspicions about Valerie Hobhouse's role in the smuggling operation are proved correct by a police raid on her beauty shop.\n\nThe murderer is Nigel Chapman, who was known to have the morphine in his possession. He killed Celia because she knew about his dual identity and also knew that Valerie travelled abroad on a false passport. He killed Mrs Nicoletis because she was sure to give the smuggling operation away under pressure, and killed Patricia because she was likely to draw his father's attention to the recent events, as she was on the verge of writing a letter to him in the hope of reconciling him with his son before his death. When Poirot outlines to Nigel's father's solicitor the case against Nigel, the solicitor provides final proof. Nigel's mother had been poisoned, not by his father, but by Nigel. When the father discovered this ({{Proper name|Medinal}} is a poison slow to act, and the mother told her husband), he forced him to write a confession and left it with his solicitor together with a letter explaining that it should be presented to the authorities in case of any further wrongdoing by Nigel. Valerie placed the call to the police station, which had apparently come from Patricia, to establish an alibi for Nigel who had already bludgeoned Patricia. The green ink was a double-bluff intended to divert suspicion away from him. Valerie is willing to incriminate Nigel fully because Mrs Nicoletis was actually her mother.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Hercule Poirot]], the Belgian detective\n* Inspector Sharpe, the investigating officer\n* Miss Felicity Lemon, Poirot's secretary\n* Mrs Christina Nicoletis, the part-Greek, [[dipsomaniac]] owner of the student hostel at Hickory Road\n* Mrs Hubbard, Miss Lemon's sister and the warden of Hickory Road\n* George, Poirot's valet\n* Ahmed Ali, an Egyptian student residing at Hickory Road\n* Akibombo, a West African student residing at Hickory Road\n* Celia Austin, a resident in full-time employment at Hickory Road, [[pharmacist|chemist]] in the [[hospital pharmacy|dispensary]] at St Catherines Hospital.\n* Leonard \"Len\" Bateson, a student residing at Hickory Road, studying medicine and surgery\n* Nigel Chapman, a student residing at Hickory Road, he has a diploma in [[Bronze Age]] and [[medieval]] history as well as Italian, and studies at the [[University of London]]\n* Sally Finch, an American student residing at Hickory Road under the [[Fulbright Program]], specializing in poetry\n* Ren\u00e9 Halle, a French student residing at Hickory Road, studying [[English literature]]\n* Val\u00e8rie Hobhouse, a resident at Hickory Road in full-time employment as co-owner of Sabrina Fair, a beauty parlour\n* Elizabeth Johnston, a Jamaican student residing at Hickory Road, studying [[jurisprudence]]\n* Chandra Lal, an Indian student residing at Hickory Road studying [[political science]]\n* Patricia Lane, a student residing at Hickory Road with a diploma in [[archaeology]]\n* Genevi\u00e8ve Maricaud, a French student residing at Hickory Road studying [[English literature]]\n* Colin McNabb, a student residing at Hickory Road, doing post-graduate studies in [[psychiatry]]\n* Gopal Ram, an Indian student residing at Hickory Road studying [[political science]]\n* Jean Tomlinson, a resident at Hickory Road in full-time employment doing [[physical therapy]] at St Catherine's Hospital\n* Maria, the Italian cook at Hickory Road\n* Geronimo, Maria's husband, also a cook\n\n==Explanation of the novel's title==\nThe title is taken, as are other of Christie's titles, from a [[nursery rhyme]]: ''[[Hickory Dickory Dock]]''. This is nevertheless one of her most tenuous links to the original nursery rhyme, consisting of little more than the name of a road.\n\n==Literary significance and reception==\n[[Philip John Stead]]'s review in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of 23 December 1955 began: \"Poirot's return to the happy hunting grounds of detective fiction is something of an event. He is called upon to solve the mystery of a series of apparently trivial thefts at a student's hostel but soon finds himself partnering the police in investigating murder. Mrs. Christie rapidly establishes her favourite atmosphere by her skilful mixture of cheerfulness and suspense.\" After summarising the plot he concluded, \"The amount of mischief going on in the hostel imposes some strain on the reader's patience as well as on Poirot's ingenuity; the author has been a little too liberal with the red herrings. Yet the thumb-nail sketches of the characters are as good as ever and in spite of the over-elaborate nature of the puzzle there is plenty of entertainment.\"<ref>''The Times Literary Supplement'', 23 December 1955 (p. 773)</ref>\n\n[[Robert Barnard]]: \"A significant falling-off in standards in this mid-'fifties story. A highly perfunctory going-through-the-paces: the rhyme has no meaning within the story; the plot (drugs smuggled in imported haversacks) is unlikely in the extreme; and the attempt to widen the range of character types (Africans, Indians, students of Freud etc.) is far from successful. [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s diary records that it 'began well' but deteriorated 'a third of the way through into twaddle' \u2013 a judgment which, unusually for him, erred on the side of charity.\"<ref>Barnard, Robert.

When Poirot comes to lecture to the students about his cases in the same chapter, he retells the story of ''[[The Labours of Hercules#\"The Nemean Lion\"|The Nemean Lion]]'', published in book form in ''[[The Labours of Hercules]]'' (1947). In chapter 5 Poirot also remembers Count Vera Rossakoff's \"exotic splendour...even in decay\", something that he has only observed in ''[[The Labours of Hercules#\"The Capture of Cerberus\"|The Capture of Cerberus]]'', also from ''The Labours of Hercules''. In Chapter 21, Poirot visits a solicitor by the name of Mr. Endicott to confirm his suspicions of Nigel Chapman. Endicott says to Poirot, \"...I'm deeply in your debt. You cleared up that nasty Abernethy business for me.\" This may be a reference to the events in ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (1953), though Abernethie is mistakenly spelt \"Abernethy\" and not \"Abernethie\" as it is in ''After the Funeral''. Furthermore, the catalyst to Poirot's direct involvement to the events in ''After the Funeral'' is a solicitor named Entwhistle, not Endicott\n\n===References to actual history, geography and current science===\nIn Chapter 11, Elizabeth Johnston refers to anti-Communist \u201c[[witch-hunt|witch hunts]]\u201d in America. The term was first used in its metaphorical sense in 1938, but its specific connection with [[McCarthyism]] dates from the first performance of [[Arthur Miller]]'s play, ''[[The Crucible]]'', in 1953. This implies that the setting of the novel is at most two years before its publication.\n\n==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==\nA television adaptation, starring [[David Suchet]] as Poirot; [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] as Inspector Japp; [[Pauline Moran]] as Miss Lemon; [[Damian Lewis]] as Leonard Bateson; [[Sarah Badel]] as Mrs Hubbard; [[Elinor Morriston]] as Valerie Hobhouse and [[Jonathan Firth]] as Nigel Chapman, was broadcast in 1995 in the series ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]''. In common with the rest of the series, the setting is moved back in time from the post-[[World War II]] period of Christie's original novel to the 1930s. This results in an anachronism: the American student Sally Finch is said to be on a Fulbright scholarship, though the [[Fulbright Program]] was not founded until after the Second World War.\n\nThis adaptation differed from Christie's novel in that Sharpe is replaced with the recurring character of Inspector Japp, and a number of the students from the novel are left out, most notably the characters including Akibombo, Elizabeth Johnston, and Lal, who are students but neither English nor American. Other aspects omitted from the TV adaptation include the [[Red herring (narrative)|red herring]] of the green ink, the change of the motive for the murder of Celia, the theft of the poison being the only thing taken and the person who takes it (McNabb) and the smuggling involving only diamonds, the inclusion of a Custom and Excise Officer conducting an undercover operation, and the relationship between Valerie and Mrs Nicoletis. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Publication history==\n* 1955, Collins Crime Club (London), 31 October 1955, Hardcover, 192 pp\n* 1955, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), November 1955, Hardcover, 241 pp\n* 1956, [[Pocket Books]] (New York), Paperback, 222 pp\n* 1958, Fontana Books (Imprint of [[HarperCollins]]), Paperback, 192 pp\n* 1967, [[Pan Books]], Paperback, 189 pp\n* 1987, Ulverscroft [[Large-print]] Edition, Hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7089-1637-6}}\n\nIn the UK the novel was first serialised in the weekly magazine ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull]]'' in six abridged instalments from 28 May (Volume 97, Number 2552) to 2 July 1955 (Volume 98, Number 2557) with illustrations by \"Fancett\".<ref>Holdings at the [[British Library]] (Newspapers \u2013 Colindale).

This results in an anachronism: the American student Sally Finch is said to be on a Fulbright scholarship, though the [[Fulbright Program]] was not founded until after the Second World War.\n\nThis adaptation differed from Christie's novel in that Sharpe is replaced with the recurring character of Inspector Japp, and a number of the students from the novel are left out, most notably the characters including Akibombo, Elizabeth Johnston, and Lal, who are students but neither English nor American. Other aspects omitted from the TV adaptation include the [[Red herring (narrative)|red herring]] of the green ink, the change of the motive for the murder of Celia, the theft of the poison being the only thing taken and the person who takes it (McNabb) and the smuggling involving only diamonds, the inclusion of a Custom and Excise Officer conducting an undercover operation, and the relationship between Valerie and Mrs Nicoletis. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Publication history==\n* 1955, Collins Crime Club (London), 31 October 1955, Hardcover, 192 pp\n* 1955, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), November 1955, Hardcover, 241 pp\n* 1956, [[Pocket Books]] (New York), Paperback, 222 pp\n* 1958, Fontana Books (Imprint of [[HarperCollins]]), Paperback, 192 pp\n* 1967, [[Pan Books]], Paperback, 189 pp\n* 1987, Ulverscroft [[Large-print]] Edition, Hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7089-1637-6}}\n\nIn the UK the novel was first serialised in the weekly magazine ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull]]'' in six abridged instalments from 28 May (Volume 97, Number 2552) to 2 July 1955 (Volume 98, Number 2557) with illustrations by \"Fancett\".<ref>Holdings at the [[British Library]] (Newspapers \u2013 Colindale).

He also named this son Mart\u00edn after his father, but this son had the aristocratic title of ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'', a marker that anyone holding it kept from cradle to grave.<ref>Discussion of the use of the title ''don'' and ''do\u00f1a'' in early Spanish America is found in [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], ''Spanish Peru: 1531-1560, A Social History,'' University of Wisconsin Press, 2nd edition, 1994, pp.39-46.</ref> In October of the same year his [[half-brother]] don Mart\u00edn was born, Mart\u00edn fell ill. According to letters between Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his cousin, Francisco de N\u00fa\u00f1ez, he was suffering from [[lamparones]], a disease that was called \"the king\u2019s evil\" because some thought that the king could cure it.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|71\u201372}} This is a form of [[tuberculosis]] known as \"scrofula\"; however, not many people commonly suffer from it. In the spring of 1540, Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain for the last time; this was the first time that Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, son of Malinche, and don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s met. In 1541, Cort\u00e9s was knighted into the Order of Santiago, and fought to gain [[Algiers]] for Charles V.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|83}} In April 1547, Cort\u00e9s fought in the [[Battle of Muhlberg]] in [[Germany]].<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|187}}\n\n==Death of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and adulthood in Spain==\nHern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s died in Castile, Spain on December 2, 1547. Although Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, son of Malinche, was his first-born son, his primary [[heir]] was his legitimate son, don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, who succeeded to the title of the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca.<ref name=Helps>[[Arthur Helps|Helps, Arthur]] (1871) ''The Life of Hernando Cortes'' p. 293 New York: G.P.

This was a battle that went on for several years. However, during the process of this battle, Spain passed the [[New Laws]] that said that every slave in New Spain was free.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|138\u2013145}}\n\n==Return to Mexico==\nIn September 1562, after a terrible voyage, Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s arrived into the port of San Francisco de Campeche.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|124}} At the end of January 1562, Cort\u00e9s and his two half brothers, the other Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s and Luis Cort\u00e9s, sailed toward Vera Cruz, the city their father had founded a mere 44&nbsp;years prior. By February, the Cort\u00e9s brothers had reached their parents' former home and the birthplace of Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, son of Malinche, [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]]. Being the heir of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s Zu\u00f1iga (the legitimate son, not the son of Malinche) was now the [[Marquis]] of the Valley of Oaxaca.\n\nIn 1566, news arrived to Mexico that the ''leyes de encomienda'' or [[encomienda]] laws that changed the ''encomienda'' system that said at the death of the ''encomendero'', all his properties would belong to the government and not the family of the deceased.<ref name=Simpson>Byrd Simpson, Lesley (1982) ''The Encomienda in New Spain: The Beginning of Spanish Mexico''. p. 199 Berkley: University of California Press</ref> In March 1566, Brothers Gil and Alonso de \u00c1vila held a party at their home in Mexico. This was the spot where what would become known as the \"marquis plot\" supposedly occurred.<ref name=Cortes/>{{rp|Ixx}} The brothers had dressed as Mexican [[chieftain]]s and paid homage to someone dressed as Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. To the Cort\u00e9s brothers and their friends, this was simply a [[Hoax|charade]]. However, the Spanish court in New Spain saw it as their attempt to overthrow them.\n\nThe [[Treasury|Real Hacienda]] denounced the acts to the [[Viceroy]] as a direct attack upon King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], and the conspirators were arrested. Amongst those arrested were Cort\u00e9s's three sons. Several members of the [[List of conspiracies (political)|conspiracy]] were [[capital punishment|executed]]. A few days later, the Viceroy [[Gast\u00f3n de Peralta, 3rd Marquis of Falces|Gast\u00f3n de Peralta]] intervened directly and released Cort\u00e9s's three sons.<ref>Pereyra, Carlos<!--Don't link to Argentine boxer of same name.--> (1956), ''Historia del pueblo mexicano'' vol.

He learned that his brothers, the \u00c1vila brothers, and eighteen other friends had been taken prisoner too. They were being charged with plotting to anoint the marqu\u00e9s, his brother don Mart\u00edn, as the king of New Spain.<ref name=Cortes/>{{rp|XIii}} He was brought before the [[judge]] on the day of his arrest, three days after having been questioned, he sent the judge a petition asking him to either charge him with something or let him go, but nothing happened. Six days later, he tried again, and once again, nothing happened. Finally, thirteen days later, he was charged with having known for ten or eleven months that his brother and other people in his close circle were charged with planning a [[rebellion]] and uprising against His Majesty. Alfonso de \u00c1vila and his brother were both publicly beheaded, and in September 1566, the first Cort\u00e9s brother, Luis, was sentenced to death by [[Decapitation|beheading]].<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|172\u2013179}}\n\nHowever, before this could happen, a new viceroy, the Marqu\u00e9s de Falces, arrived in Vera Cruz on November 15, 1567. He allowed both of Mart\u00edn\u2019s brothers to leave New Spain and for Luis to go serve time in a colony near [[Algeria]] while Martin was allowed to plead his case before the king. However, Mart\u00edn, Malinche's son, stayed in Mexico.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|189\u2013212}}\n\nOn January 7, 1568, Mart\u00edn was subjected to torture and was sentenced to indefinite exile in Spain. His torturer was reproached by King Philip II personally, sent back to Spain, and found dead in his room one day after having met with the king.<ref name=\"P2\">Pereyra, Carlos<!--Don't link to Argentine boxer of same name.--> (1956), ''Historia del pueblo mexicano'' vol.

They had two children: a daughter, Ana Cort\u00e9s, and a son, Fernando Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=Lanyon/>{{rp|114}} Details and dates of Mart\u00edn's family life do not exist. It is also not entirely clear when Mart\u00edn died. He died in Spain sometime before the turn of the seventeenth century; 1595 has been mentioned as a possible date. In 1574, the king offered condolences to the children of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and they were all exonerated of any wrongdoing.<ref name=\"Rodr\u00edguez\">[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez Rodr\u00edguez|Mart\u00ednez, Jos\u00e9 Luis]] (1992), ''Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s'', p. 360\u2013363, M\u00e9xico, ed.
