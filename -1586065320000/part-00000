The top of the boot stands up somewhat stiffly, and may be open at the top, which allows moisture to escape.\n\nThe design of the mukluk is used for the industrial manufacture of cold-weather boots, especially paired with a rugged contemporary sole. The key component of its success is its ability to breathe, that is, to allow air exchange.

The game featured a strong defensive effort by both teams in the first half and early in the third quarter, as they traded two field goals each, with Rams kicker [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] connecting on attempts from 24 and 22 yards in the first half. With the score tied at 6\u20136 midway through the third quarter, the Rams mounted a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 4-yard touchdown run by [[Todd Gurley]] to give them a 13\u20136 advantage.

On the next play from scrimmage, Goff scored on a quarterback sneak to end the day's scoring. Kupp had five receptions for 120 yards, both team highs, in his first game back at the Coliseum since suffering a torn ACL there 10 months earlier. Goff completed 19 of 28 passes for 283 yards and two scores with no interceptions, and Gurley had 63 yards on 16 carries with one touchdown. Defensively, safety [[Eric Weddle]] and linebacker [[Cory Littleton]] shared the team lead in tackles with five each, while linebacker [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]] and defensive end [[Michael Brockers]] each had a sack. Strong safety [[John Johnson (safety)|John Johnson]] added four tackles and an interception of Saints quarterback [[Drew Brees]], who left the game in the first quarter with a hand injury and did not return.

However, Goff threw three interceptions and then fumbled once with just over a minute remaining when he was sacked and stripped of the ball by Buccaneers linebacker [[Shaquil Barrett]], with defensive tackle [[Ndamukong Suh]] picking it up and running it 37 yards for the touchdown to seal the victory against his former team.

Los Angeles fell to 3\u20133, losing three games in a row for the first time in the [[Sean McVay]] era. Quarterback [[Jared Goff]], who two weeks earlier had passed for a career-high 517 yards in a loss to [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay]], was held to a career-low 78 passing yards and was sacked four times. Playing without [[Todd Gurley]], the Rams running game started fast on its opening drive, going 56 yards on seven plays (all runs) with wide receiver [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] scoring a touchdown from eight yards out to give Los Angeles an early 7\u20130 lead; however, Gurley's replacement, [[Malcolm Brown (American football)|Malcolm Brown]], who rushed five times for 40 yards on the opening drive, was held to four carries and one yard for the remainder of the game, and failed twice to score from the 1-yard line in a second-quarter goal-line stand. Rookie running back [[Darrell Henderson]] saw his first significant playing time of the season, carrying three times for 40 yards to set up that second-quarter scoring opportunity, but he failed to handle Goff's pitchout on the first play of the second half, and four plays later, the 49ers went ahead for good. The San Francisco defense held the Rams to only seven rushing yards on seven attempts after halftime, and gave up only one pass play of more than nine yards in the entire game. The Rams defense was led by linebacker [[Cory Littleton]], who had 14 tackles and a fumble recovery, and defensive tackle [[Aaron Donald]], who had two sacks of 49ers quarterback [[Jimmy Garoppolo]], including a forced fumble. The Rams held San Francisco's then-No. 1-ranked rushing offense to just 99 yards on 41 rushing plays. Cornerback [[Marcus Peters]] had four tackles and an interception in his final game with the Rams before being traded to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] two days later.\n\n====Week 7: at Atlanta Falcons====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Rams|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Seven: Los Angeles Rams at Atlanta Falcons&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=October 20\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT/10:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT\n|road='''Rams'''\n|R1=3|R2=10|R3=14|R4=10\n|home=Falcons\n|H1=3|H2=0|H3=0|H4=7\n|stadium=[[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], [[Atlanta, Georgia]]\n|attendance=71,856\n|weather=None (retractable roof closed)\n|referee=[[Ronald Torbert]]\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Sam Rosen (sportscaster)|Sam Rosen]], [[Charles Davis (sportscaster)|Charles Davis]] and [[Pam Oliver]]\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019102000/2019/REG7/rams@falcons Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57993/ATL_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*ATL \u2013 [[Matt Bryant]] 52-yard field goal, 11:23.

Goff completed 17 of 31 passes for 372 yards and two touchdowns (while also not committing a turnover or being sacked for the second straight game), while wide receiver [[Josh Reynolds (American football)|Josh Reynolds]] had three receptions for 73 yards, including a 31-yard touchdown, playing in relief of starter [[Brandin Cooks]], who suffered a concussion on the Rams' opening drive and did not return to the game.

The Rams turned over the ball twice in the third quarter before mounting an 11-play, 76-yard drive that ended with a 30-yard field goal by kicker [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] just before the end of the period. Early in the fourth quarter, the Rams pulled to within 14-12 when defensive tackle [[Aaron Donald]] (making his first appearance as a pro in Pittsburgh, where he played his high school and college football) sacked Rudolph in the end zone for a safety. But the Steelers were able to convert a field goal to increase their lead to 17-12 and the Rams' final drive ended with Goff throwing his second interception of the day with under 30 seconds remaining. Tight end [[Gerald Everett]] caught a team-high eight receptions for 68 yards and wide receiver [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] had seven receptions for 95 yards.

Wide receiver [[Brandin Cooks]] scored only his second touchdown of the season on the Rams' opening drive on a 10-yard pass from [[Jared Goff]], while [[Todd Gurley]] added another score on a 5-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second quarter. Gurley scored again on a 1-yard run midway through the second period, giving him 58 rushing touchdowns for his career, tying him with Hall of Fame predecessor [[Marshall Faulk]] for the most in Rams franchise history. With a 21-10 lead, the Rams seemed poised for an upset, but after the defense gave up a touchdown run to [[Raheem Mostert]], Goff threw an interception to 49er linebacker [[Fred Warner (American football)|Fred Warner]], who ran untouched 46 yards to put San Francisco in from 28-24 46 seconds before halftime. The Rams reclaimed the lead late in the third period as Goff connected with wide receiver [[Cooper Kupp]] for a 22-yard scoring pass. The 49ers answered with tight end [[George Kittle]]'s 7-yard touchdown pass from quarterback [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] midway through the fourth quarter to lead 31-28. [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]]'s 52-yard field goal tied the game at 31-31 with 2:30 remaining, but the 49ers would prevail as they twice converted on third-and-16 plays. Garoppolo, who was sacked six times, hit eight times and intercepted twice, made both clutch throws, the last one a 46-yard completion down the middle to wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] which set up kicker [[Robbie Gould]]'s successful 33-yard field goal as time ran out. Goff passed for 323 yards, but his pick six late in the second quarter proved costly. Wide receiver [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] had eight receptions for 117 yards, while tight end [[Tyler Higbee]] had nine catches for 104 yards, his fourth straight game over 100 yards. Defensively, Ram linebacker [[Dante Fowler]] had 2.5 sacks and [[Jalen Ramsey]] added an interception, but a blown coverage by rookie safety [[Taylor Rapp]] gave the 49ers their final scoring opportunity. With the loss, the Rams fell to 8\u20137 and were knocked out of the playoffs for the first time since [[2016 Los Angeles Rams season|2016]].

The game featured a strong defensive effort by both teams in the first half and early in the third quarter, as they traded two field goals each, with Rams kicker [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] connecting on attempts from 24 and 22 yards in the first half. With the score tied at 6\u20136 midway through the third quarter, the Rams mounted a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 4-yard touchdown run by [[Todd Gurley]] to give them a 13\u20136 advantage. After the Rams defense had back-to-back sacks to force a Saints punt, [[JoJo Natson]] returned the kick 32 yards to set the Rams up at the New Orleans 26. Three rushes for 16 yards by running back [[Malcolm Brown (American football)|Malcolm Brown]] put the Rams on the 2-yard line and quarterback [[Jared Goff]] connected with wide receiver [[Brandin Cooks]] for the score. Following a Saints field goal early in the fourth quarter, the Rams faced third-and-2 from their own 33 when Goff hit wide receiver [[Cooper Kupp]], who broke four tackles as he weaved through the Saints defense for a spectacular 66-yard catch-and-run before being brought down inches from the goal line. On the next play from scrimmage, Goff scored on a quarterback sneak to end the day's scoring. Kupp had five receptions for 120 yards, both team highs, in his first game back at the Coliseum since suffering a torn ACL there 10 months earlier. Goff completed 19 of 28 passes for 283 yards and two scores with no interceptions, and Gurley had 63 yards on 16 carries with one touchdown. Defensively, safety [[Eric Weddle]] and linebacker [[Cory Littleton]] shared the team lead in tackles with five each, while linebacker [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]] and defensive end [[Michael Brockers]] each had a sack. Strong safety [[John Johnson (safety)|John Johnson]] added four tackles and an interception of Saints quarterback [[Drew Brees]], who left the game in the first quarter with a hand injury and did not return. The Rams began their 38th and final season at the Coliseum, as they will move to [[SoFi Stadium]] in nearby [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] in 2020. The official name of the Rams' future stadium was announced earlier in the day on the [[Fox NFL Sunday]] pregame show.\n\n====Week 3: at Cleveland Browns====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Rams|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Three: Los Angeles Rams at Cleveland Browns&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 22\n|time=8:20&nbsp;p.m. EDT/5:20&nbsp;p.m. PDT\n|road='''Rams'''\n|R1=3|R2=0|R3=7|R4=10\n|home=Browns\n|H1=0|H2=6|H3=7|H4=0\n|stadium=[[FirstEnergy Stadium]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]]\n|attendance=67,895\n|weather=Mostly clear, {{convert|83|F|C}}\n|referee=[[Shawn Smith (American football)|Shawn Smith]]\n|TV=[[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]], [[Cris Collinsworth]], [[Michele Tafoya]] and [[Terry McAulay]]\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019092213/2019/REG3/rams@browns Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57946/CLE_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*LAR \u2013 [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] 53-yard field goal, 4:06.

In addition to his new team records for single game attempts and completions, which broke marks previously held by [[Marc Bulger]] (vs. [[2005 New York Giants|New York Giants]], [[2005 NFL season|2005]]), Goff's 517 passing yards tied with [[Tom Brady]] ([[2011 New England Patriots season|New England]] vs. [[2011 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]], [[2011 NFL Season|2011]]) for the eighth-highest single-game total in NFL records, and was exceeded only by [[Norm Van Brocklin]]'s league-record 554 yards against the [[1951 New York Yanks season|New York Yanks]] in [[1951 NFL season|1951]] for the highest total in team history. However, Goff threw three interceptions and then fumbled once with just over a minute remaining when he was sacked and stripped of the ball by Buccaneers linebacker [[Shaquil Barrett]], with defensive tackle [[Ndamukong Suh]] picking it up and running it 37 yards for the touchdown to seal the victory against his former team.

Tight end [[Gerald Everett]] had a career single-game best seven receptions for 136 yards, and caught three passes for 46 yards on the Rams' final drive to set up Zuerlein's fourth and final attempt of the day, which just missed the upright and denied L.A.'s bid for a third straight win at Seattle (and fourth in five years).

Los Angeles fell to 3\u20133, losing three games in a row for the first time in the [[Sean McVay]] era. Quarterback [[Jared Goff]], who two weeks earlier had passed for a career-high 517 yards in a loss to [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay]], was held to a career-low 78 passing yards and was sacked four times. Playing without [[Todd Gurley]], the Rams running game started fast on its opening drive, going 56 yards on seven plays (all runs) with wide receiver [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] scoring a touchdown from eight yards out to give Los Angeles an early 7\u20130 lead; however, Gurley's replacement, [[Malcolm Brown (American football)|Malcolm Brown]], who rushed five times for 40 yards on the opening drive, was held to four carries and one yard for the remainder of the game, and failed twice to score from the 1-yard line in a second-quarter goal-line stand. Rookie running back [[Darrell Henderson]] saw his first significant playing time of the season, carrying three times for 40 yards to set up that second-quarter scoring opportunity, but he failed to handle Goff's pitchout on the first play of the second half, and four plays later, the 49ers went ahead for good. The San Francisco defense held the Rams to only seven rushing yards on seven attempts after halftime, and gave up only one pass play of more than nine yards in the entire game.

While Pittsburgh was able to tie the score with a touchdown at the end of the first quarter, the Rams continued to struggle on offense in the first half, ending their first five offensive drives in [[Johnny Hekker]] punts. The sixth drive ended disastrously just after the two-minute warning, when quarterback [[Jared Goff]] was hit as he attempted to get rid of the ball, which was then picked up by Steelers cornerback [[Minkah Fitzpatrick]] who returned it 43 yards to put the Steelers ahead 14-7. The Rams turned over the ball twice in the third quarter before mounting an 11-play, 76-yard drive that ended with a 30-yard field goal by kicker [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] just before the end of the period. Early in the fourth quarter, the Rams pulled to within 14-12 when defensive tackle [[Aaron Donald]] (making his first appearance as a pro in Pittsburgh, where he played his high school and college football) sacked Rudolph in the end zone for a safety. But the Steelers were able to convert a field goal to increase their lead to 17-12 and the Rams' final drive ended with Goff throwing his second interception of the day with under 30 seconds remaining. Tight end [[Gerald Everett]] caught a team-high eight receptions for 68 yards and wide receiver [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] had seven receptions for 95 yards. Running back [[Todd Gurley]] ran for 72 yards on just 12 carries, but didn't carry the ball at all during the fourth quarter.

Gurley added 36 yards on three receptions, which tied both Kupp and [[Josh Reynolds (American football)|Josh Reynolds]] for the team lead on a quiet production day in which the Rams mustered only 283 total yards on offense.

Wide receiver [[Brandin Cooks]] scored only his second touchdown of the season on the Rams' opening drive on a 10-yard pass from [[Jared Goff]], while [[Todd Gurley]] added another score on a 5-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second quarter. Gurley scored again on a 1-yard run midway through the second period, giving him 58 rushing touchdowns for his career, tying him with Hall of Fame predecessor [[Marshall Faulk]] for the most in Rams franchise history. With a 21-10 lead, the Rams seemed poised for an upset, but after the defense gave up a touchdown run to [[Raheem Mostert]], Goff threw an interception to 49er linebacker [[Fred Warner (American football)|Fred Warner]], who ran untouched 46 yards to put San Francisco in from 28-24 46 seconds before halftime. The Rams reclaimed the lead late in the third period as Goff connected with wide receiver [[Cooper Kupp]] for a 22-yard scoring pass. The 49ers answered with tight end [[George Kittle]]'s 7-yard touchdown pass from quarterback [[Jimmy Garoppolo]] midway through the fourth quarter to lead 31-28. [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]]'s 52-yard field goal tied the game at 31-31 with 2:30 remaining, but the 49ers would prevail as they twice converted on third-and-16 plays. Garoppolo, who was sacked six times, hit eight times and intercepted twice, made both clutch throws, the last one a 46-yard completion down the middle to wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] which set up kicker [[Robbie Gould]]'s successful 33-yard field goal as time ran out. Goff passed for 323 yards, but his pick six late in the second quarter proved costly. Wide receiver [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] had eight receptions for 117 yards, while tight end [[Tyler Higbee]] had nine catches for 104 yards, his fourth straight game over 100 yards. Defensively, Ram linebacker [[Dante Fowler]] had 2.5 sacks and [[Jalen Ramsey]] added an interception, but a blown coverage by rookie safety [[Taylor Rapp]] gave the 49ers their final scoring opportunity. With the loss, the Rams fell to 8\u20137 and were knocked out of the playoffs for the first time since [[2016 Los Angeles Rams season|2016]].

Safety [[Eric Weddle]] had seven tackles to lead the Rams on defense. Safety [[Taylor Rapp]] and cornerback [[Darious Williams]] both had interceptions of Cardinals rookie quarterback [[Kyler Murray]], who also lost two fumbles (one recovered by Rapp, the other by linebacker [[Cory Littleton]]) as the Rams recorded their sixth straight win versus Arizona. With the victory the Rams finished 9-7, an identical record to the [[1979 Los Angeles Rams season|1979 season]], when the Rams last bade farewell to the Coliseum (losing their final game at home 29-14 to New Orleans).

Thus, if a Mosuo commoner female married a male serf, her daughter would be another commoner, while her son would have serf status.<ref name = \"Hua\"/>\n\nChuan-Kang Shih argued that matrilineality and \"walking marriage\" (''tisese'') is a primary institution of family, sex and reproduction, and marriage is secondary.<ref>Chuan-Kang Shih. \"Genesis of Marriage among the Moso and Empire-Building in Late Imperial China.\" In ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 60, no.2 (May 2001):381-412.</ref> As Shih argues, marriage, as different from ''tisese'', was introduced into Mosuo society through contact with other ethnic groups during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] empire-building process.\n\n===Adoption===\nIf there are no offspring of one sex, it is common for a child from another family to join an adoptive household.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\">{{citation | last = Blumenfield | first = Tami | url = http://web.pdx.edu/~tblu2/Na/myths.pdf | title = The Na of Southwest China: Debunking the Myths | year = 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025007/http://web.pdx.edu/~tblu2/Na/myths.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-20 }}.</ref> Such a child might come from a large family, or one too small to continue. Children raised in this sense are genealogically linked to their new households. They are treated as equal family members; in some instances, adopted females become the matriarchs of their adoptive families.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\"/>\n\n==Walking marriages==\n\nOne of the best known aspects of Mosuo culture is its practice of  \"walking marriage\" (\u8d70\u5a5a z\u01d2u h\u016bn in Chinese), although this practice remains poorly understood.<ref name=\":0\" /> Walking marriages are the most prominent form of marriage in Mosuo culture; however, it is not unheard of for women in Mosuo culture to marry outside of their culture, therefore participating in marriages other than walking marriages. In a walking marriage, both partners live under the roof of their respective extended families during the day; however, at night it is common for the man to visit and stay at the women's house (if given permission) until sunrise. Therefore, they do not technically live in the same household, but they are free to visit when granted permission.  Children of parents in a walking marriage are not raised by their father. The brothers of the mother (maternal uncles) in the marriage take on the responsibilities of the father since the father isn\u2019t typically around during the daytime. Due to the separation of the father and mother, it is crucial for the uncle(s) to play a large role in the development of the child.<ref name=\"Matrilineal Culture 2006\">\"Matriarchal/Matrilineal Culture.\" Matriarchal/Matrilineal Culture. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association, 2006. Web. 25 Oct. 2016.</ref>\n\nShih (2010) offers the most sophisticated anthropological account of Mosuo practices of sexual union. \"All on-going sexual relationships in Mosuo culture are called \"walking marriages.\" These bonds are \"based on mutual affection.\"<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" /> \"When a Mosuo woman or man expresses interest in a potential partner, it is the woman who may give the man permission to visit her. These visits are usually kept secret, with the man visiting the woman's house after dark, spending the night, and returning to his own home in the morning.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> After the birth of the child, the man has no moral, cultural, or legal obligation to take care of the child. However, the child will be raised with adequate care and attention. The overwhelming support from the woman's extended family, allows both the man and woman to engage in sexual relations with whomever they please. \n\n=== General practice ===\n\"The Mosuo have large extended families, and several generations (great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, etc.) live together in the same house. Everyone lives in communal quarters, and there are no private bedrooms or living areas, except for women between certain ages (see the section on \"coming of age\", below) who may have their own private rooms.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"While a pairing may be long-term, the man never lives with the woman's family, or vice versa. Mosuo men and women continue to live with and be responsible to their respective families. The couple do not share property. The father usually has little responsibility for his offspring.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> However, this does not mean that men can wipe their hands free of responsibilities and spend every night participating in shenanigans. After work, they are obligated to go home and help raise their nieces and nephews. The children rely on the collective effort of the extended family rather than that of the biological father.<ref name=\"Matrilineal Culture 2006\"/>\n\n\"A father may indicate an interest in the upbringing of his children by bringing gifts to the mother's family. This gives him status within the mother's family, while not actually making him part of the family.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Matrilineal society ===\nUnlike other cultures, women in the Mosuo society dominate the household and family. They are responsible for housework, agricultural duties, and taking care of children. In a walking marriage, the ancestral line is most important on the wife's side of the family and the children of the couple reside and belong to the wife's family household.<ref name=\":0\" /> Considering women are responsible for most domestic jobs, they have a larger role in the walking marriage and are viewed with more respect and importance in this society.<ref>Yuan, Lu. \"Land of the Walking Marriages.\" Natural History. Ed. Sam Mitchell. N.p.: n.p., n.d. 57-65. Print.</ref>\n\nHusbands in walking marriages have a much less involved role than wives. The husbands in these relationships are generally the figures who are in charge of all religious and political decisions for the family.<ref>Gong, Binglin, Huibin Yan, and Chun-Lei Yang. \"Gender Differences in the Dictator Experiment: Evidence from the Matrilineal Mosuo and the Patriarchal Yi.\" SSRN Electronic Journal (2010): 1-25. Web. 25 Oct. 2016.</ref> Regarding the family responsibilities, the father or husband in the family does not have nearly as many responsibilities regarding the family as the wife does. In fact, the male relatives of the mother's side of the family, such as uncles and cousins, are generally the \"father figure\" to the husband's children.<ref name=\"Mattison, Siobh\u00e1n M. 2014\">Mattison, Siobh\u00e1n M., Brooke Scelza, and Tami Blumenfield. \"Paternal Investment and the Positive Effects of Fathers among the Matrilineal Mosuo of Southwest China.\" American Anthropologist 116.3 (2014): 591-610. Web. 24 Oct. 2016.</ref> The mother's brothers occupy the central role in the household. Their roles include disciplining children, caring for them, and supporting the children financially.<ref name=\"Mattison, Siobh\u00e1n M. 2014\"/> Since the husband and wife live with their separate immediate families, they help take care of the families' children and issues regarding their household. Even though fathers are involved in their sister's children's lives, they are not necessarily involved in their biological children's life. In walking marriages, the involvement of a father in his child's life is optional.<ref name=\"Mattison, Siobh\u00e1n M. 2014\"/> If a father decides to be involved in the upbringing of his own biological child, he can bring gifts and help with work around the woman's household. This relationship can be performed regardless if the woman and man are still in the walking marriage and it gives the man a type of \"official status\" among the family without being fully involved.<ref>Gong, Binglin, Huibin Yan, and Chun-Lei Yang. \"Gender Differences in the Dictator Experiment: Evidence from the Matrilineal Mosuo and the Patriarchal Yi.\" SSRN Electronic Journal (2010): 1-25. Web. 25 Oct. 2016.\n</ref>\n\n=== Advantages to a walking marriage ===\nOther than the child receiving exceptional care and attention from the extended family, there are many inconspicuous advantages for participating in a walking marriage. For example: divorce is never an issue because the man and woman are not legally bound together, thus sharing very few of the same responsibilities. There are also never any disputes over who owns custody of the child since the child belongs to the mother's extended family and takes the mother's last name. In the case of a parent's death, the child still has a prodigious amount of care and affection from the extended family.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" />\n\n=== Myths and controversies ===\nOutsiders often believe the following myths:\n\n==== Mosuo women have many partners ====\n\"While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time. Anthropologists call this system \"[[serial monogamy]].\" Most Mosuo form long-term relationships and do not change partners frequently.<ref name=\"LLMCDA-Matrilineal\" /> Some of these pairings may even last a lifetime.\"\n\nBut, in other anthropologists' views, it is a more recent change, \"in the face of political campaigns and cultural integration with the [[Han Chinese]]\", and \"previous generations often continued with multiple partners even after a child was born. Some older Na report having upwards of 30, 40, even 50 partners throughout their lifetime\"<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" /> and despite these changes, \"notions of exclusivity are not entrenched, and the Na language has no word for 'jealousy'.\" <ref name=\"Blumenfield\" />\n\n==== Fathers of children are commonly not known ====\n\"The large majority of women know their children's fathers; it is actually a source of embarrassment if a mother cannot identify a child's father.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" /> But, \"unlike many cultures which castigate mothers and children without clear paternity, Na children induce no such censure\".<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" /> The father of a child born from a walking marriage will not see his child during the day, but rather at night time. The father doesn't play as large a role in the development of the child. \"At a child's birth, the father, his mother and sisters come to celebrate, and bring gifts. On [[Chinese New Year|New Year's Day]], a child visits the father to pay respect to him and his household. A father also participates in the coming-of-age ceremony. Though he does not have an everyday role, the father is nevertheless an important partner.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Customs==\n[[File:Mosuo girls.jpg|thumb|Mosuo Women]]\n\n===Coming of age===\nThe coming-of-age ceremony, which occurs at the age of thirteen, is one of the most important events in a Mosuo child's life. Before this ceremony, Mosuo children all dress the same and are restricted from certain aspects of Mosuo life, particularly those that involve religious rites. Also, a child who dies before this ceremony does not receive the traditional funeral. Once they come of age, girls are given their skirts, and boys are given their trousers (thus, it is called the \"skirt ceremony\" for girls, and the \"trouser ceremony\" for boys).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=Judith|title=Unhitching the Horse From the Carriage: Love and Marriage Among the Mosuo|journal=Utah Law Review|date=2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming of age, Mosuo females can get their own private bedroom, called a \"flowering room\"; and, once past [[puberty]], can begin to invite partners for \"walking marriages\".\n\n===Hearth===\nThis is the center of the household. It combines the worship of nature, ancestors, and spirits.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> Behind the hearth is a slab of stone (called ''guo zhuang'' in Chinese) and an ancestral altar where Mosuo household members leave a food offering. They do this before each meal, even when having tea.<ref name=\"Hua\"/>\n\n===Funeral===\nDeath is the domain of men,<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> who make all funeral arrangements. It is the only time men prepare food for family and guests. Usually, every family in the village will send at least one male to help with the preparations. Dabas and Lamas are invited to recite prayers for the deceased. Mosuo believe that if a spirit does not have assistance of a Daba, it will be lost.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> Without Lamas, a spirit will not be able to attain reincarnation.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> Caskets are small and square, with the deceased's body placed in the fetal position so that it can be reborn in the next life. During cremation, a decorated horse is led around the fire, which Mosuo believe will help carry the deceased's spirit away. Afterwards, friends and family gather to pay their last respects and wish the deceased an easy journey to their ancestral land.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/>\n\n===Dogs===\nWhile some Asian cultures practice the custom of eating dogs, this is strictly forbidden to the Mosuo.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> In Mosuo culture, a myth describes that long ago, dogs had life spans of 60 years while humans had life spans of thirteen years. Humans felt their life span was too short, so they traded it with the dogs in exchange for paying homage to them.<ref name=\"Hua\"/> Therefore, dogs are valued members of the family. They are never killed, and they most certainly are never eaten. During the initiation rites into adulthood, Mosuo adolescents pray before the family dogs.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/>\n\n==Religion==\nReligion is a major part of Mosuo life. It is made up of two coexisting beliefs: their own syncretic faith called [[Daba (religion)|Daba]] and the influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].\n\n===Daba===\nDaba has been a part of Mosuo culture for thousands of years, handed down through generations by word of mouth. It functions as a repository of most of the Mosuo culture and history. It is based on [[animism|animistic]] principles and involves ancestor worship and the worship of a mother goddess: \"The Mosuo are alone among their neighbors to have a guardian mother goddess rather than a patron warrior god\".<ref name = \"Mathieu 2003\">Mathieu, Christine. ''A History and Anthropological Study of the Ancient Kingdoms of the Sino-Tibetan Borderland \u2013 Naxi and Mosuo'', ''Mellen Studies in Anthropology'', Vol. 11, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe primary tasks of the priest (or [[shaman]]), also called ''daba'', are to perform exorcisms and assist deceased spirits.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> Priests drink alcohol until they go into a trance and can converse with these spirits. Since the Mosuo have no written language, there is no religious script, nor is there a temple. All Daba priests are male, and they live in their mother's house with their brothers and sisters. When not pursuing their religious duties, they engage in everyday tasks such as fishing and herding.<ref name=\"academia.edu\">On the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions Systems in Dabaism and Dongbaism and on the analysis of the two writing systems according to an innovative interpretation, cf. XU Duoduo. (2015). A Comparison of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions Between Dabaism and Dongbaism. ''Archaeoastronomy and Ancient Technologies'', 3, 2: 61-81 (Links: 1.

[http://aaatec.org/vol3n2.php Archaeoastronomy and Ancient Technologies]).</ref>\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, Daba plays a far smaller role in the lives of the Mosuo. The daba is mostly called on to perform traditional ceremonies at key events, such as naming a child, a child's coming-of-age ceremony, a funeral, or special events such as the Spring Festival. The daba is also called on to perform specific rites if someone is sick.\n\nA cultural crisis is emerging. Due to past Chinese government policies, which made being a Daba priest illegal (this policy has now ceased), there are very few remaining dabas, most of whom are old men. This leads some Mosuo to worry that Mosuo history and heritage may be lost when the current generation of Dabas are gone.\n\n===Buddhism===\nBuddhism has started to play a larger role in their culture in recent years. Today Tibetan-style Buddhism is the predominant religion, but it has been somewhat adapted to Mosuo society. Like the Buddhist population of Tibet, both lay and monastic Buddhists among the Mosuo eat meat. Mosuo [[lama]]s offer prayers of thanks and prayers for the dead,<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> offer basic religious and secular education to young children, and counsel adults. In families with more than one male child, one will most often be sent to be a monk.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\"/>\n\nThe Mosuo even have their own \"living Buddha\", a man said to be a reincarnation of one of the great Tibetan spiritual leaders. He usually lives in [[Lijiang, Yunnan|Lijiang]], but returns to the main Tibetan temple in Yongning for important spiritual holidays. Many Mosuo families will send at least one male to be trained as a monk, and in recent years, the number of such monks has increased quite significantly. The current Mosuo Living Buddha died of old age in April 2011. {{citation needed|reason=unsourced|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn most Mosuo homes, a statue of some Buddhist deity can be found above the cooking fire; the family will usually put a small portion of whatever they are cooking in the fire, as an offering to their deity. Tibetan Buddhist holidays and festivals are participated in by the entire Mosuo community.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Mosuo woman near Lugu Lake.jpg|thumb|Y\u00ed woman near Lugu Lake]]\nThe Mosuo are primarily farmers. Subsistence is mostly based on agriculture. Farmers work \"seven hours a day and seven months a year\".<ref>Hua, Cai. ''A Society without Fathers or Husbands: The Na of China'', p. 41. Asti Hustvedt, trans. New York: Zone Books, 2001.</ref> In the past, they cultivated [[oats]], [[buckwheat]], and [[flax]] exclusively.<ref name=\"Hua, Cai page 40\">Hua, Cai.

Since then, these farmers have also cultivated, among other things, corn, sunflowers, soybeans, potatoes and other vegetables such as pumpkins and beans. Potatoes were their main staple for a while until the mid-twentieth century when they began growing rice, which today makes up more than half of annual production.<ref name=\"Hua, Cai page 40\"/> In recent years, subsistence for some Mosuo has shifted dramatically from agriculture due to a thriving tourist industry<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Mattison|first1=Siobh\u00e1n M.|last2=Scelza|first2=Brooke|last3=Blumenfield|first3=Tami|title=Paternal Investment and the Positive Effects of Fathers among the Matrilineal Mosuo of Southwest China|journal=American Anthropologist|date=2014|volume=116|issue=3|pages=591\u2013610|doi=10.1111/aman.12125}}</ref>\n\nMosuo also keep a variety of livestock. Since the early twentieth century they have raised buffalo, cows, horses, and goats which originated from Han and Tibetan regions. However, their preferred stock is pigs. Pork plays several important roles in Mosuo society. It is fed to guests, is the obligatory offering at funerals, and used as payment or reimbursement. Hua (2001) insists that it is \"a kind of currency and... a symbol of wealth\".<ref>Hua, Cai. ''A Society without Fathers or Husbands: The Na of China'', p. 42. Asti Hustvedt, trans. New York: Zone Books, 2001.</ref>\n\nOnce a year, regions of Mosuo males gather for a livestock fair. They travel for miles on buses, horses, or foot to attend.<ref name=\"Kingdom\" /> Here men sell and trade livestock to supplement household incomes.\n\nThe Mosuo fish on [[Lake Lugu]] and also set land-based fish traps; however, they do not use motorboats, and catching fish in open water using their very primitive gear is not easy.\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Na language}}\nThe Mosuo speak [[Na language|Na]] (a.k.a. [[Narua language|Narua]]), a [[Naish languages|Naish language]] (closely related to [[Naxi language|Naxi)]], a member of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language family]]. Although there is no question that the language of the Mosuo and that of the Naxi are closely related, some Mosuo speakers resent the use of the language name Naxi, which is commonly used to refer to the dialect of the town of Lijiang and the surrounding villages. A more adequate name is Na, used in several linguistic publications.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Tone in Yongning Na : lexical tones and morphotonology|last=Michaud|first=Alexis|isbn=9783946234869|location=Berlin|pages=|oclc=992500105|date = 2017-04-26}}</ref> The name \"Narua\" is used in the Summer Institute of Linguistics' inventory of languages, Ethnologue.[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/nru] A collection of audio recordings is available online,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mosuo Voices: Recordings of Na (Mosuo) in the Pangloss Collection|url=http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/archivage/languages/Na_en.htm|publisher=CNRS/ADONIS|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref> and a trilingual glossary has also been posted online.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Michaud|first1=Alexis|title=Online Na-English-Chinese Dictionary (Version 1.0)|url=https://www.academia.edu/16148636|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref> Two book-length descriptions of the language are available<ref name=\":2\" />, <ref>{{Cite book|title=A descriptive grammar of Yongning Na (Mosuo)|last=Lidz|first=Liberty|publisher=University of Texas, Department of linguistics Ph.

Neither the Cultural Revolution nor trade between different cultures fundamentally changed Mosuo beliefs. But recently, Mosuo society has been rapidly changing.\n\n===Modernity===\nWith improved technology, there are better roads and transportation. Young Mosuo men and women use these modes to leave their villages and find employment in neighboring cities. Television has brought the ideas of the modern world and an image of a more affluent lifestyle. Also, men have begun to take jobs independent of the household and earn their own income.

Photographers, television crews, writers, and artists are drawn to their homes. This increased attention has also brought tourists. Tourism is primarily domestic and typically occurs as a part of organized tour groups to view a culture that seems \"exotic\".

In fact, it is not easy to categorize Mosuo culture within traditional Western definitions. They have aspects of a matriarchal culture: women are often the head of the house, inheritance is through the female line, and women make business decisions. However, unlike a matriarchy, the political power tends to be in the hands of males.<ref name=\"LLMCDA-Matrilineal\"/> For instance, a man named Ge Ze A Che is the political leader of Luoshui village.<ref>http://public.gettysburg.edu/~dperry/Class%20Readings%20Scanned%20Documents/Intro/Yuan.pdf</ref> However, according to an article by NPR, there was once a time when the political leaders of Mosuo villages were in fact female.<ref>https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/11/26/501012446/the-place-in-china-where-the-women-lead</ref> Anthropologists like Peggy Reeves Sanday determine societies like Mosuo are in fact matriarchies.<ref> Anthropologists like Peggy Reeves Sanday favored redefining and reintroducing the word matriarchy, especially in reference to modern matrilineal societies: \"matriarchies are not a mirror form of patriarchies but rather that a matriarchy \"emphasizes maternal meanings where 'maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women play a central role in these practices'\"\nPeggy Reeves Sanday, anthropologist, [http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100164210 Women at the Center: Life in a Modern Matriarchy], Cornell University Press, 2002.</ref> \nFurther, scholars have argued that while matrilineal arrangements are the normative pattern, domestic arrangements still vary geographically and by family circumstance.<ref name=\"tandfonline.com\"/>\n\n==Lifestyle==\n\n===Daily life===\nMosuo culture is primarily agrarian, with work based on farming tasks such as raising livestock (yak, water buffalo, sheep, goats, poultry) and growing crops, including grains and potatoes. The people are largely self-sufficient in diet, raising enough for their daily needs. Meat is an important part of their diet and, since they lack refrigeration, is preserved through salting or smoking. The Mosuo are renowned for their preserved pork, which may be kept for 10 years or more. They produce a local alcoholic beverage made from grain, called ''sulima'', which is similar to strong wine. Sulima is drunk regularly and usually offered to guests and at ceremonies and festivals.<ref name = LLMCDA-daily>Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association (2006).

However, increased interaction with the outside world brings greater use of a cash-based trade system. Average incomes are low (US$150\u2013200 per year), causing financial restrictions when cash is needed for activities such as education or travel. Electricity has been introduced in most Mosuo communities, but some villages still lack electric power.<ref name = LLMCDA-daily/>\n\nMosuo homes consist of four rectangular structures arranged in a square, around a central courtyard. The first floor houses livestock, including water buffalo, horses, geese, and poultry. The main cooking, eating and visiting areas are also on the first floor. The second floor is commonly used for storage and for the bedrooms.<ref name = LLMCDA-daily/>\n\n===Role of women===\n{{main article|Mosuo women}}\nAs soon as a Mosuo girl becomes old enough, she learns the tasks that she will perform for the rest of her life. Mosuo women do all the housework, including cleaning, tending the fire, cooking, gathering firewood, feeding the livestock, and spinning and weaving.<ref name=\"Kingdom\">Kingdom of Women: The Matriarchal Mosuo of China (2007, 54 min.)

Today, due to increased trade with surrounding villages and cities, it is easier to obtain goods. Nevertheless, some Mosuo women, especially those of older generations, know how to use looms to produce cloth goods.\n\n===Role of men===\n[[File:Mosuo boys.jpg|thumb|Mosuo boys]]\nAccording to some, men have no responsibility in Mosuo society\u2014they have no jobs, rest all day, and conserve their strength for nighttime visits.<ref name = \"Ladies\">{{citation | title = The Ladies of the Lake: A Matriarchal Society | publisher = Journeymen Pictures| isbn = 978-1463105402 }}.</ref> However, Mosuo men do have roles in their society. They help to bring up the children of their sisters and female cousins, build houses and are in charge of livestock and fishing,<ref name = \"Kingdom\" /> which they learn from their uncles and older male family members as soon as they are old enough.\n\nMen deal with the slaughter of livestock, in which women never participate. Slaughtered pigs, in particular, are kept whole and stored in a dry, airy place that keeps them edible for up to ten years.{{cn|date=June 2018}} This is especially helpful when harsh winters make food scarce.\n\n==Matrilineality==       <!-- a redirect target for links from other articles -->\nMosuo families tend to trace their [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] through the female side of the family. Occasionally, in fact, they may not know who the father of a child is, which does not carry stigma as in many other societies. Children belong to and reside within their mother's household and have access to its land and resources.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mattison|first1=Siobh\u00e1n M.|title=\"Evolutionary Contributions to Solving the \"Matrilineal Puzzle\"|journal=Human Nature|date=2011|volume=22|issue=1\u20132|pages=64\u201368|doi=10.1007/s12110-011-9107-7|pmid=22388801}}</ref>\n\n===Matriarch===\nThe matriarch (''Ah mi,'' or elder female, in Chinese) is the head of the house. The ''Ah mi'' has absolute power;<ref name=\"Kingdom\" /> she decides the fate of all those living under her roof. In walking marriages, Mosuo women are responsible for much of the work done around the house and financial decisions. The matriarch also manages the money and jobs of each family member.<ref name=\"Ladies\"/> When the ''Ah mi'' wishes to pass her duties on to the next generation, she will give this female successor the keys to the household storage,<ref name = \"Kingdom\" /> signifying the passing on of property rights and responsibility.\n\n===History===\nAn important historical fact often missed in studies of the Mosuo was that their social organization has traditionally been feudal, with a small [[nobility]] controlling a larger [[peasant]] population.<ref name=\"Hua\">Hua, Cai. ''A Society without Fathers or Husbands: The Na of China.'' Asti Hustvedt, trans. New York: Zone Books, 2001.</ref> The Mosuo nobility practiced a \"parallel line of descent\" that encouraged cohabitation, usually within the nobility,<ref>Hua, Cai.

Thus, if a Mosuo commoner female married a male serf, her daughter would be another commoner, while her son would have serf status.<ref name = \"Hua\"/>\n\nChuan-Kang Shih argued that matrilineality and \"walking marriage\" (''tisese'') is a primary institution of family, sex and reproduction, and marriage is secondary.<ref>Chuan-Kang Shih. \"Genesis of Marriage among the Moso and Empire-Building in Late Imperial China.\" In ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' 60, no.2 (May 2001):381-412.</ref> As Shih argues, marriage, as different from ''tisese'', was introduced into Mosuo society through contact with other ethnic groups during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] empire-building process.\n\n===Adoption===\nIf there are no offspring of one sex, it is common for a child from another family to join an adoptive household.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\">{{citation | last = Blumenfield | first = Tami | url = http://web.pdx.edu/~tblu2/Na/myths.pdf | title = The Na of Southwest China: Debunking the Myths | year = 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025007/http://web.pdx.edu/~tblu2/Na/myths.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-20 }}.</ref> Such a child might come from a large family, or one too small to continue. Children raised in this sense are genealogically linked to their new households. They are treated as equal family members; in some instances, adopted females become the matriarchs of their adoptive families.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\"/>\n\n==Walking marriages==\n\nOne of the best known aspects of Mosuo culture is its practice of  \"walking marriage\" (\u8d70\u5a5a z\u01d2u h\u016bn in Chinese), although this practice remains poorly understood.<ref name=\":0\" /> Walking marriages are the most prominent form of marriage in Mosuo culture; however, it is not unheard of for women in Mosuo culture to marry outside of their culture, therefore participating in marriages other than walking marriages. In a walking marriage, both partners live under the roof of their respective extended families during the day; however, at night it is common for the man to visit and stay at the women's house (if given permission) until sunrise. Therefore, they do not technically live in the same household, but they are free to visit when granted permission.  Children of parents in a walking marriage are not raised by their father. The brothers of the mother (maternal uncles) in the marriage take on the responsibilities of the father since the father isn\u2019t typically around during the daytime. Due to the separation of the father and mother, it is crucial for the uncle(s) to play a large role in the development of the child.<ref name=\"Matrilineal Culture 2006\">\"Matriarchal/Matrilineal Culture.\" Matriarchal/Matrilineal Culture. Lugu Lake Mosuo Cultural Development Association, 2006. Web. 25 Oct. 2016.</ref>\n\nShih (2010) offers the most sophisticated anthropological account of Mosuo practices of sexual union. \"All on-going sexual relationships in Mosuo culture are called \"walking marriages.\" These bonds are \"based on mutual affection.\"<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" /> \"When a Mosuo woman or man expresses interest in a potential partner, it is the woman who may give the man permission to visit her. These visits are usually kept secret, with the man visiting the woman's house after dark, spending the night, and returning to his own home in the morning.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> After the birth of the child, the man has no moral, cultural, or legal obligation to take care of the child. However, the child will be raised with adequate care and attention. The overwhelming support from the woman's extended family, allows both the man and woman to engage in sexual relations with whomever they please. \n\n=== General practice ===\n\"The Mosuo have large extended families, and several generations (great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, etc.) live together in the same house. Everyone lives in communal quarters, and there are no private bedrooms or living areas, except for women between certain ages (see the section on \"coming of age\", below) who may have their own private rooms.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"While a pairing may be long-term, the man never lives with the woman's family, or vice versa. Mosuo men and women continue to live with and be responsible to their respective families. The couple do not share property. The father usually has little responsibility for his offspring.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> However, this does not mean that men can wipe their hands free of responsibilities and spend every night participating in shenanigans. After work, they are obligated to go home and help raise their nieces and nephews. The children rely on the collective effort of the extended family rather than that of the biological father.<ref name=\"Matrilineal Culture 2006\"/>\n\n\"A father may indicate an interest in the upbringing of his children by bringing gifts to the mother's family. This gives him status within the mother's family, while not actually making him part of the family.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Matrilineal society ===\nUnlike other cultures, women in the Mosuo society dominate the household and family. They are responsible for housework, agricultural duties, and taking care of children. In a walking marriage, the ancestral line is most important on the wife's side of the family and the children of the couple reside and belong to the wife's family household.<ref name=\":0\" /> Considering women are responsible for most domestic jobs, they have a larger role in the walking marriage and are viewed with more respect and importance in this society.<ref>Yuan, Lu. \"Land of the Walking Marriages.\" Natural History. Ed. Sam Mitchell. N.p.: n.p., n.d. 57-65. Print.</ref>\n\nHusbands in walking marriages have a much less involved role than wives. The husbands in these relationships are generally the figures who are in charge of all religious and political decisions for the family.<ref>Gong, Binglin, Huibin Yan, and Chun-Lei Yang. \"Gender Differences in the Dictator Experiment: Evidence from the Matrilineal Mosuo and the Patriarchal Yi.\" SSRN Electronic Journal (2010): 1-25. Web. 25 Oct. 2016.</ref> Regarding the family responsibilities, the father or husband in the family does not have nearly as many responsibilities regarding the family as the wife does. In fact, the male relatives of the mother's side of the family, such as uncles and cousins, are generally the \"father figure\" to the husband's children.<ref name=\"Mattison, Siobh\u00e1n M. 2014\">Mattison, Siobh\u00e1n M., Brooke Scelza, and Tami Blumenfield. \"Paternal Investment and the Positive Effects of Fathers among the Matrilineal Mosuo of Southwest China.\" American Anthropologist 116.3 (2014): 591-610. Web. 24 Oct. 2016.</ref> The mother's brothers occupy the central role in the household. Their roles include disciplining children, caring for them, and supporting the children financially.<ref name=\"Mattison, Siobh\u00e1n M. 2014\"/> Since the husband and wife live with their separate immediate families, they help take care of the families' children and issues regarding their household. Even though fathers are involved in their sister's children's lives, they are not necessarily involved in their biological children's life. In walking marriages, the involvement of a father in his child's life is optional.<ref name=\"Mattison, Siobh\u00e1n M. 2014\"/> If a father decides to be involved in the upbringing of his own biological child, he can bring gifts and help with work around the woman's household. This relationship can be performed regardless if the woman and man are still in the walking marriage and it gives the man a type of \"official status\" among the family without being fully involved.<ref>Gong, Binglin, Huibin Yan, and Chun-Lei Yang. \"Gender Differences in the Dictator Experiment: Evidence from the Matrilineal Mosuo and the Patriarchal Yi.\" SSRN Electronic Journal (2010): 1-25. Web. 25 Oct. 2016.\n</ref>\n\n=== Advantages to a walking marriage ===\nOther than the child receiving exceptional care and attention from the extended family, there are many inconspicuous advantages for participating in a walking marriage. For example: divorce is never an issue because the man and woman are not legally bound together, thus sharing very few of the same responsibilities. There are also never any disputes over who owns custody of the child since the child belongs to the mother's extended family and takes the mother's last name. In the case of a parent's death, the child still has a prodigious amount of care and affection from the extended family.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" />\n\n=== Myths and controversies ===\nOutsiders often believe the following myths:\n\n==== Mosuo women have many partners ====\n\"While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time. Anthropologists call this system \"[[serial monogamy]].\" Most Mosuo form long-term relationships and do not change partners frequently.<ref name=\"LLMCDA-Matrilineal\" /> Some of these pairings may even last a lifetime.\"\n\nBut, in other anthropologists' views, it is a more recent change, \"in the face of political campaigns and cultural integration with the [[Han Chinese]]\", and \"previous generations often continued with multiple partners even after a child was born. Some older Na report having upwards of 30, 40, even 50 partners throughout their lifetime\"<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" /> and despite these changes, \"notions of exclusivity are not entrenched, and the Na language has no word for 'jealousy'.\" <ref name=\"Blumenfield\" />\n\n==== Fathers of children are commonly not known ====\n\"The large majority of women know their children's fathers; it is actually a source of embarrassment if a mother cannot identify a child's father.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" /> But, \"unlike many cultures which castigate mothers and children without clear paternity, Na children induce no such censure\".<ref name=\"Blumenfield\" /> The father of a child born from a walking marriage will not see his child during the day, but rather at night time. The father doesn't play as large a role in the development of the child. \"At a child's birth, the father, his mother and sisters come to celebrate, and bring gifts. On [[Chinese New Year|New Year's Day]], a child visits the father to pay respect to him and his household. A father also participates in the coming-of-age ceremony. Though he does not have an everyday role, the father is nevertheless an important partner.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Customs==\n[[File:Mosuo girls.jpg|thumb|Mosuo Women]]\n\n===Coming of age===\nThe coming-of-age ceremony, which occurs at the age of thirteen, is one of the most important events in a Mosuo child's life. Before this ceremony, Mosuo children all dress the same and are restricted from certain aspects of Mosuo life, particularly those that involve religious rites. Also, a child who dies before this ceremony does not receive the traditional funeral. Once they come of age, girls are given their skirts, and boys are given their trousers (thus, it is called the \"skirt ceremony\" for girls, and the \"trouser ceremony\" for boys).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=Judith|title=Unhitching the Horse From the Carriage: Love and Marriage Among the Mosuo|journal=Utah Law Review|date=2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming of age, Mosuo females can get their own private bedroom, called a \"flowering room\"; and, once past [[puberty]], can begin to invite partners for \"walking marriages\".\n\n===Hearth===\nThis is the center of the household. It combines the worship of nature, ancestors, and spirits.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> Behind the hearth is a slab of stone (called ''guo zhuang'' in Chinese) and an ancestral altar where Mosuo household members leave a food offering. They do this before each meal, even when having tea.<ref name=\"Hua\"/>\n\n===Funeral===\nDeath is the domain of men,<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> who make all funeral arrangements. It is the only time men prepare food for family and guests. Usually, every family in the village will send at least one male to help with the preparations. Dabas and Lamas are invited to recite prayers for the deceased. Mosuo believe that if a spirit does not have assistance of a Daba, it will be lost.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> Without Lamas, a spirit will not be able to attain reincarnation.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> Caskets are small and square, with the deceased's body placed in the fetal position so that it can be reborn in the next life. During cremation, a decorated horse is led around the fire, which Mosuo believe will help carry the deceased's spirit away. Afterwards, friends and family gather to pay their last respects and wish the deceased an easy journey to their ancestral land.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/>\n\n===Dogs===\nWhile some Asian cultures practice the custom of eating dogs, this is strictly forbidden to the Mosuo.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> In Mosuo culture, a myth describes that long ago, dogs had life spans of 60 years while humans had life spans of thirteen years. Humans felt their life span was too short, so they traded it with the dogs in exchange for paying homage to them.<ref name=\"Hua\"/> Therefore, dogs are valued members of the family. They are never killed, and they most certainly are never eaten. During the initiation rites into adulthood, Mosuo adolescents pray before the family dogs.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/>\n\n==Religion==\nReligion is a major part of Mosuo life. It is made up of two coexisting beliefs: their own syncretic faith called [[Daba (religion)|Daba]] and the influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].\n\n===Daba===\nDaba has been a part of Mosuo culture for thousands of years, handed down through generations by word of mouth. It functions as a repository of most of the Mosuo culture and history. It is based on [[animism|animistic]] principles and involves ancestor worship and the worship of a mother goddess: \"The Mosuo are alone among their neighbors to have a guardian mother goddess rather than a patron warrior god\".<ref name = \"Mathieu 2003\">Mathieu, Christine. ''A History and Anthropological Study of the Ancient Kingdoms of the Sino-Tibetan Borderland \u2013 Naxi and Mosuo'', ''Mellen Studies in Anthropology'', Vol. 11, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe primary tasks of the priest (or [[shaman]]), also called ''daba'', are to perform exorcisms and assist deceased spirits.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> Priests drink alcohol until they go into a trance and can converse with these spirits. Since the Mosuo have no written language, there is no religious script, nor is there a temple. All Daba priests are male, and they live in their mother's house with their brothers and sisters. When not pursuing their religious duties, they engage in everyday tasks such as fishing and herding.<ref name=\"academia.edu\">On the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions Systems in Dabaism and Dongbaism and on the analysis of the two writing systems according to an innovative interpretation, cf. XU Duoduo. (2015). A Comparison of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions Between Dabaism and Dongbaism. ''Archaeoastronomy and Ancient Technologies'', 3, 2: 61-81 (Links: 1. [https://www.academia.edu/16722054/Xu_Duoduo._A_comparison_of_the_twenty-eight_lunar_mansions_between_Dabaism_and_Dongbaism academia.edu]; 2. [http://aaatec.org/vol3n2.php Archaeoastronomy and Ancient Technologies]).</ref>\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, Daba plays a far smaller role in the lives of the Mosuo. The daba is mostly called on to perform traditional ceremonies at key events, such as naming a child, a child's coming-of-age ceremony, a funeral, or special events such as the Spring Festival. The daba is also called on to perform specific rites if someone is sick.\n\nA cultural crisis is emerging. Due to past Chinese government policies, which made being a Daba priest illegal (this policy has now ceased), there are very few remaining dabas, most of whom are old men. This leads some Mosuo to worry that Mosuo history and heritage may be lost when the current generation of Dabas are gone.\n\n===Buddhism===\nBuddhism has started to play a larger role in their culture in recent years. Today Tibetan-style Buddhism is the predominant religion, but it has been somewhat adapted to Mosuo society. Like the Buddhist population of Tibet, both lay and monastic Buddhists among the Mosuo eat meat. Mosuo [[lama]]s offer prayers of thanks and prayers for the dead,<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> offer basic religious and secular education to young children, and counsel adults. In families with more than one male child, one will most often be sent to be a monk.<ref name=\"Blumenfield\"/>\n\nThe Mosuo even have their own \"living Buddha\", a man said to be a reincarnation of one of the great Tibetan spiritual leaders. He usually lives in [[Lijiang, Yunnan|Lijiang]], but returns to the main Tibetan temple in Yongning for important spiritual holidays. Many Mosuo families will send at least one male to be trained as a monk, and in recent years, the number of such monks has increased quite significantly. The current Mosuo Living Buddha died of old age in April 2011. {{citation needed|reason=unsourced|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn most Mosuo homes, a statue of some Buddhist deity can be found above the cooking fire; the family will usually put a small portion of whatever they are cooking in the fire, as an offering to their deity. Tibetan Buddhist holidays and festivals are participated in by the entire Mosuo community.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Mosuo woman near Lugu Lake.jpg|thumb|Y\u00ed woman near Lugu Lake]]\nThe Mosuo are primarily farmers. Subsistence is mostly based on agriculture. Farmers work \"seven hours a day and seven months a year\".<ref>Hua, Cai. ''A Society without Fathers or Husbands: The Na of China'', p. 41. Asti Hustvedt, trans. New York: Zone Books, 2001.</ref> In the past, they cultivated [[oats]], [[buckwheat]], and [[flax]] exclusively.<ref name=\"Hua, Cai page 40\">Hua, Cai. ''A Society without Fathers or Husbands: The Na of China'', p. 40. Asti Hustvedt, trans. New York: Zone Books, 2001.</ref> This changed under [[Han Chinese|Han]] influence at the end of the nineteenth century. Since then, these farmers have also cultivated, among other things, corn, sunflowers, soybeans, potatoes and other vegetables such as pumpkins and beans. Potatoes were their main staple for a while until the mid-twentieth century when they began growing rice, which today makes up more than half of annual production.<ref name=\"Hua, Cai page 40\"/> In recent years, subsistence for some Mosuo has shifted dramatically from agriculture due to a thriving tourist industry<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Mattison|first1=Siobh\u00e1n M.|last2=Scelza|first2=Brooke|last3=Blumenfield|first3=Tami|title=Paternal Investment and the Positive Effects of Fathers among the Matrilineal Mosuo of Southwest China|journal=American Anthropologist|date=2014|volume=116|issue=3|pages=591\u2013610|doi=10.1111/aman.12125}}</ref>\n\nMosuo also keep a variety of livestock. Since the early twentieth century they have raised buffalo, cows, horses, and goats which originated from Han and Tibetan regions. However, their preferred stock is pigs. Pork plays several important roles in Mosuo society. It is fed to guests, is the obligatory offering at funerals, and used as payment or reimbursement. Hua (2001) insists that it is \"a kind of currency and... a symbol of wealth\".<ref>Hua, Cai. ''A Society without Fathers or Husbands: The Na of China'', p. 42. Asti Hustvedt, trans. New York: Zone Books, 2001.</ref>\n\nOnce a year, regions of Mosuo males gather for a livestock fair. They travel for miles on buses, horses, or foot to attend.<ref name=\"Kingdom\" /> Here men sell and trade livestock to supplement household incomes.\n\nThe Mosuo fish on [[Lake Lugu]] and also set land-based fish traps; however, they do not use motorboats, and catching fish in open water using their very primitive gear is not easy.\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Na language}}\nThe Mosuo speak [[Na language|Na]] (a.k.a. [[Narua language|Narua]]), a [[Naish languages|Naish language]] (closely related to [[Naxi language|Naxi)]], a member of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language family]]. Although there is no question that the language of the Mosuo and that of the Naxi are closely related, some Mosuo speakers resent the use of the language name Naxi, which is commonly used to refer to the dialect of the town of Lijiang and the surrounding villages. A more adequate name is Na, used in several linguistic publications<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Tone in Yongning Na : lexical tones and morphotonology|last=Michaud|first=Alexis|isbn=9783946234869|location=Berlin|pages=|oclc=992500105|date = 2017-04-26}}</ref>.

In the Yongning region during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. the Mosuo integrated many Han ideals.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/> The Mosuo also accepted Buddhism and adapted it to fit their values. Neither the Cultural Revolution nor trade between different cultures fundamentally changed Mosuo beliefs. But recently, Mosuo society has been rapidly changing.\n\n===Modernity===\nWith improved technology, there are better roads and transportation. Young Mosuo men and women use these modes to leave their villages and find employment in neighboring cities. Television has brought the ideas of the modern world and an image of a more affluent lifestyle. Also, men have begun to take jobs independent of the household and earn their own income. Older Mosuo fear emerging property conflicts as a consequence. Care for the family, with younger children generations leaving the villages, is also a concern.<ref name=\"Kingdom\"/>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Lake Lugu With Moshui-Zu Woman.JPG|thumb|On Lake Lugu]]\nMosuo living near Lugu Lake inhabit an aesthetically pleasing region. Photographers, television crews, writers, and artists are drawn to their homes. This increased attention has also brought tourists. Tourism is primarily domestic and typically occurs as a part of organized tour groups to view a culture that seems \"exotic\". Tourism has influenced kinship and parenting practices, with Mosuo residing in areas where tourism is prevalent being less likely to adhere to strict matrilineal norms.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Mattison|first1=Siobh\u00e1n M|last2=Scelza|first2=Brooke|last3=Blumenfield|first3=Tami|title=Paternal Investment and the Positive Effects of Fathers among the Matrilineal Mosuo of Southwest China|journal=American Anthropologist|date=2014|volume=116|issue=3|pages=591\u2013610|ref=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12125/epdf|doi=10.1111/aman.12125}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\nThere are many documentaries made about the Mosuo, in English and Mandarin, and there has even been a [[film festival]] dedicated to some of them.

The aircraft was controlled through ailerons on the inner portion of the trailing edges with pitch control through elevators outboard of the fins, situated at approximately \u00be-span giving yaw control and stability. The undercarriage was of the mono-wheel type, common to many gliders, but with outrigger wheel struts in the lower fins keeping the aircraft level when on the ground.<ref name=\"j2mcl\">{{cite web |title=THK-13 |url=https://www.j2mcl-planeurs.net/dbj2mcl/planeurs-machines/planeur-fiche_0int.php?code=1932 |website=www.j2mcl-planeurs.net |accessdate=30 March 2019 |language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nTo validate the design a 10% scale model was attached to a [[THK-5]] and used as a flying wind tunnel, to validate the design values.<ref name=\"isakoc\">{{cite web |title=THK-13 u\u00e7an kanat, T\u00fcrk hayalet bombard\u0131man u\u00e7a\u011f\u0131 |url=https://www.isakoc.com/thk-13-ucan-kanat-turk-hayalet-bombardiman-ucagi-kopyasi-amerikan-b2-bombardiman-ucagi.html |website=\u0130sa Ko\u00e7 |accessdate=30 March 2019 |language=tr |date=12 June 2014}}</ref> The THK-13 was initially planned to have a small piston engine or turbojet, but was completed as a glider, principally launched by aero-tow behind a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 44]]. The first flight took place in mid 1948, flown by Kadri Kavuk\u00e7u, lasting for around 30 minutes. Modifications were carried out before the next flight in August 1948, flown by Cemal Uygun. The aircraft took-off , but at {{cvt|150|-|200|m}} the right wing dropped, caused by a control restriction, so Uygun carried out an emergency landing, with the aircraft suffering some damage.

The spacecraft, which was based on a modified Earth-orbiting commercial communications [[satellite]] (i.e., SES's [[Astra 1A]] satellite), carried a payload of instruments designed to study the geology, geophysics, and climate of Mars from orbit. The mission ended in August 1993 when communications were lost three days before the spacecraft had been scheduled to enter [[orbit]].<ref name=\"mars obsvr\">{{cite web|title=Mars Observer|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/past/observer/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Goals/strategy==\nAccording to NASA, there are four broad goals of the MEP, all having to do with understanding the potential for [[life]] on Mars.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mars Exploration Program's Science Theme|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n{{wide image|NASA-JourneyToMars-ScienceExplorationTechnology-20141202.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Journey to Mars \u2013 Science, Exploration, Technology.}}\n\n===Goal 1: Determine if life ever arose on Mars===\n[[File:PIA16239 High-Resolution Self-Portrait by Curiosity Rover Arm Camera.jpg|thumb|200px|right|<center>[[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity''{{'}}s]] self-portrait on the [[Mars|planet Mars]] at \"[[Rocknest (Mars)|Rocknest]]\" ([[MAHLI]], October 31, 2012).</center>]]\nIn order to understand Mars' [[Planetary habitability|habitability potential]], it must be determined whether or not there ever was [[life on Mars]], which begins with assessing the planet's suitability for life. The main strategy regarding the MEP, nicknamed \"Follow the Water,\" is the general idea that where life is present, there is water (at least in instances on Earth). It is likely that if life ever did arise on Mars, there would need to be a supply of water that was present for a substantial amount of time. Therefore, a prominent goal of the MEP is to look for places where water is, was, or could possibly be, such as dried up riverbeds, under the planetary surface, and in Mars' polar ice caps.\n\nAside from water, life also needs sources of energy to survive. The abundance of [[superoxides]] makes life on the surface of Mars very unlikely, which essentially rules out sunlight as a possible source of energy for life. Therefore, alternative sources of energy must be searched for, such as [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] and [[chemical energy]]. These sources, which are both used by life forms on Earth, could be used by [[microorganism|microscopic life forms]] living under the Mars' surface.\n\nLife on Mars can also be searched for by finding signatures of past and present life or [[biosignature]]s. Relative carbon abundance and the location and forms that it can be found in can inform where and how life may have developed. Also, the presence of [[carbonate minerals]], along with the fact that [[atmosphere of mars|Mars' atmosphere]] is made up largely of [[carbon dioxide]], would tell scientists that water may have been on the planet long enough to foster the development of life.<ref name=\"goal 1\">{{cite web|title=Goal 1: Determine if Life Ever Arose On Mars|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/goal1/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Goal 2: Characterize the climate of Mars===\nAnother goal of the MEP is to characterize both the current and past [[climate of Mars]], as well as factors that influence climate change on Mars. Currently what is known is that the climate is regulated by seasonal changes of Mars' ice caps, movement of dust by the atmosphere, and the exchange of water vapor between the surface and the atmosphere. To understand these climatic phenomena means helping scientists more effectively model Mars' past climate, which brings a higher degree of understanding of the dynamics of Mars.<ref name=\"goal 2\">{{cite web|title=Goal 2: Characterize the Climate of Mars|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/goal2/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Goal 3: Characterize the geology of Mars===\nThe [[geology of Mars]] is differentiable from that of Earth by, among other things, its extremely large volcanoes and lack of crust movement. A goal of the MEP is to understand these differences from Earth along with the way that wind, water, volcanoes, tectonics, [[impact crater|cratering]] and other processes have shaped the surface of Mars. Rocks can help scientists describe the sequence of events in Mars' history, tell whether there was an abundance of water on the planet through identifying minerals that are formed only in water, and tell if Mars once had a [[magnetosphere|magnetic field]] (which would point toward Mars at one point being a dynamic Earth-like planet).<ref name=\"goal 3\">{{cite web|title=Goal 3: Characterize the Geology of Mars|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/goal3/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Goal 4: Prepare for the human exploration of Mars===\nA [[human mission to Mars]] presents a massive engineering challenge. With Mars' surface containing superoxides and lacking a [[magnetosphere]] and an [[ozone layer]] to protect from radiation from the Sun, scientists would have to thoroughly understand as much of Mars' dynamics as possible before any action can be taken toward the goal of putting humans on Mars.<ref name=\"goal 4\">{{cite web| title=Goal 4: Prepare for the Human Exploration of Mars| url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/goal4/| work=Mars Exploration program| publisher=NASA| accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\nMars exploration missions have historically had some of the highest failure rates for NASA missions,<ref name=chronology /> which can be attributed to the immense engineering challenges of these missions as well as some bad luck.{{Ambiguous|date=September 2018}}<ref name=\"mars curse\">{{cite web|last=O'Neill|first=Ian|title=The Mars Curse|url=http://www.universetoday.com/13267/the-mars-curse-why-have-so-many-missions-failed/|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=2008-03-22}}</ref> With many of the goals of the MEP involving entry, descent, and landing of spacecraft (EDL) on the surface of Mars, factors like the planet's atmosphere, uneven surface terrain, and high cost of replicating Mars-like environments for testing come into play.<ref name=challenges>{{cite journal|last=Braun|first=Robert|title=Mars Exploration Entry, Descent and Landing Challenges|journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets|volume=44|issue=2|pages=310|url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39664/1/05-3869.pdf|accessdate=18 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526014618/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39664/1/05-3869.pdf|archivedate=26 May 2010|bibcode=2007JSpRo..44..310B|year=2007|doi=10.2514/1.25116|citeseerx=10.1.1.463.8773}}</ref>\n\n===Atmosphere===\n[[Image:Mars Observer.jpg|thumb|200px|left|<center>Artist's rendition of the Mars Observer</center>]]\nCompared to the Earth, the [[atmosphere of Mars]] is about 100 times thinner. As a result, if a landing craft were to descend into Mars' atmosphere, it would decelerate at a much lower altitude, and depending on the object's mass, may not have enough time to reach terminal velocity. In order to deploy super- or subsonic decelerators, velocity must be below a threshold or they will not be effective. Therefore, technologies must be developed so that a landing craft can be decelerated enough to allow adequate time for other necessary landing processes to be carried out before landing.<ref name=challenges />\n\nMars' atmosphere varies significantly over the course of a [[Timekeeping on Mars|Mars year]], which prevents engineers from being able to develop a system for EDL common among all missions. Frequently-occurring dust storms increase lower atmospheric temperature and lessen atmospheric density, which, coupled with the extremely variable elevations on Mars' surface, forces a conservative selection of a landing site in order to allow for sufficient craft deceleration.<ref name=challenges />\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Rocky Mars Surface.jpeg|thumb|275px|<center>The rocky surface of Mars, as seen by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] Lander.</center>]]\nThe surface of Mars is extremely uneven, containing [[rock (geology)|rocks]], mountainous terrain, and craters. For a landing craft, the ideal landing area would be flat and debris-free. Since this terrain is almost impossible to find on Mars, landing gear must be very stable and have enough ground clearance to prevent problems with tipping over and instability upon landing. In addition, the deceleration systems of these landers would need to include thrusters that are pointed at the ground. These thrusters must be designed so that they only need to be active for an extremely short amount of time; if they are active and pointed at rocky ground for more than a few milliseconds, they start to dig trenches, launch small rocks up into the landing gear, and cause destabilizing backpressure to be forced upon the lander.<ref name=challenges />\n\nFinding an adequate landing site means being able to estimate rock size from orbit. The technology to accurately determine rock size under 0.5 meters in diameter from orbit has not yet been developed, so instead rock size distribution is inferred from its relationship to thermal inertia, based on thermal response of the landing site measured by satellites currently orbiting Mars. The [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] also helps this cause in the sense that its cameras can see rocks larger than 0.5 m in diameter.<ref name=challenges />\n\nAlong with the possibility of the lander tipping over on sloped surfaces, large topographical features like hills, mesas, craters and trenches pose the problem of interference with ground sensors. Radar and Doppler radar can falsely measure altitude during descent and the algorithms that target the touchdown point of the lander can be \"tricked\" into releasing the lander too early or late if the craft passes over mesas or trenches while descending.<ref name=challenges />\n\n===Mars-like environment replication costs===\nWith Mars EDL sequences only lasting about 5\u20138 minutes, the associated systems must be unquestionably reliable. Ideally, this would be verified by data obtained by carrying out large-scale tests of various components of the EDL systems on Earth-based testing. However, the costs of reproducing environments in which this data would be relevant in terms of Mars' environment are considerably high, resulting in testing being purely ground-based or simulating results of tests involving technologies derived from past missions.<ref name=challenges />\n\n==Programs==\n===InSight===\n[[InSight]], launched from Earth May 5, 2018, the lander touched down on Mars November 26, 2018 on Elysium Planitia.<ref>{{cite web|title=InSight Timeline|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/launch/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Program costs==\nMars exploration missions, as do most NASA missions, can be fairly costly.

The spacecraft, which was based on a modified Earth-orbiting commercial communications [[satellite]] (i.e., SES's [[Astra 1A]] satellite), carried a payload of instruments designed to study the geology, geophysics, and climate of Mars from orbit. The mission ended in August 1993 when communications were lost three days before the spacecraft had been scheduled to enter [[orbit]].<ref name=\"mars obsvr\">{{cite web|title=Mars Observer|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/past/observer/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Goals/strategy==\nAccording to NASA, there are four broad goals of the MEP, all having to do with understanding the potential for [[life]] on Mars.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mars Exploration Program's Science Theme|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n{{wide image|NASA-JourneyToMars-ScienceExplorationTechnology-20141202.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Journey to Mars \u2013 Science, Exploration, Technology.}}\n\n===Goal 1: Determine if life ever arose on Mars===\n[[File:PIA16239 High-Resolution Self-Portrait by Curiosity Rover Arm Camera.jpg|thumb|200px|right|<center>[[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity''{{'}}s]] self-portrait on the [[Mars|planet Mars]] at \"[[Rocknest (Mars)|Rocknest]]\" ([[MAHLI]], October 31, 2012).</center>]]\nIn order to understand Mars' [[Planetary habitability|habitability potential]], it must be determined whether or not there ever was [[life on Mars]], which begins with assessing the planet's suitability for life. The main strategy regarding the MEP, nicknamed \"Follow the Water,\" is the general idea that where life is present, there is water (at least in instances on Earth). It is likely that if life ever did arise on Mars, there would need to be a supply of water that was present for a substantial amount of time. Therefore, a prominent goal of the MEP is to look for places where water is, was, or could possibly be, such as dried up riverbeds, under the planetary surface, and in Mars' polar ice caps.\n\nAside from water, life also needs sources of energy to survive. The abundance of [[superoxides]] makes life on the surface of Mars very unlikely, which essentially rules out sunlight as a possible source of energy for life. Therefore, alternative sources of energy must be searched for, such as [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] and [[chemical energy]]. These sources, which are both used by life forms on Earth, could be used by [[microorganism|microscopic life forms]] living under the Mars' surface.\n\nLife on Mars can also be searched for by finding signatures of past and present life or [[biosignature]]s. Relative carbon abundance and the location and forms that it can be found in can inform where and how life may have developed. Also, the presence of [[carbonate minerals]], along with the fact that [[atmosphere of mars|Mars' atmosphere]] is made up largely of [[carbon dioxide]], would tell scientists that water may have been on the planet long enough to foster the development of life.<ref name=\"goal 1\">{{cite web|title=Goal 1: Determine if Life Ever Arose On Mars|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/goal1/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Goal 2: Characterize the climate of Mars===\nAnother goal of the MEP is to characterize both the current and past [[climate of Mars]], as well as factors that influence climate change on Mars. Currently what is known is that the climate is regulated by seasonal changes of Mars' ice caps, movement of dust by the atmosphere, and the exchange of water vapor between the surface and the atmosphere. To understand these climatic phenomena means helping scientists more effectively model Mars' past climate, which brings a higher degree of understanding of the dynamics of Mars.<ref name=\"goal 2\">{{cite web|title=Goal 2: Characterize the Climate of Mars|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/goal2/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Goal 3: Characterize the geology of Mars===\nThe [[geology of Mars]] is differentiable from that of Earth by, among other things, its extremely large volcanoes and lack of crust movement. A goal of the MEP is to understand these differences from Earth along with the way that wind, water, volcanoes, tectonics, [[impact crater|cratering]] and other processes have shaped the surface of Mars. Rocks can help scientists describe the sequence of events in Mars' history, tell whether there was an abundance of water on the planet through identifying minerals that are formed only in water, and tell if Mars once had a [[magnetosphere|magnetic field]] (which would point toward Mars at one point being a dynamic Earth-like planet).<ref name=\"goal 3\">{{cite web|title=Goal 3: Characterize the Geology of Mars|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/goal3/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Goal 4: Prepare for the human exploration of Mars===\nA [[human mission to Mars]] presents a massive engineering challenge. With Mars' surface containing superoxides and lacking a [[magnetosphere]] and an [[ozone layer]] to protect from radiation from the Sun, scientists would have to thoroughly understand as much of Mars' dynamics as possible before any action can be taken toward the goal of putting humans on Mars.<ref name=\"goal 4\">{{cite web| title=Goal 4: Prepare for the Human Exploration of Mars| url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/science/goal4/| work=Mars Exploration program| publisher=NASA| accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\nMars exploration missions have historically had some of the highest failure rates for NASA missions,<ref name=chronology /> which can be attributed to the immense engineering challenges of these missions as well as some bad luck.{{Ambiguous|date=September 2018}}<ref name=\"mars curse\">{{cite web|last=O'Neill|first=Ian|title=The Mars Curse|url=http://www.universetoday.com/13267/the-mars-curse-why-have-so-many-missions-failed/|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=2008-03-22}}</ref> With many of the goals of the MEP involving entry, descent, and landing of spacecraft (EDL) on the surface of Mars, factors like the planet's atmosphere, uneven surface terrain, and high cost of replicating Mars-like environments for testing come into play.<ref name=challenges>{{cite journal|last=Braun|first=Robert|title=Mars Exploration Entry, Descent and Landing Challenges|journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets|volume=44|issue=2|pages=310|url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39664/1/05-3869.pdf|accessdate=18 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526014618/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39664/1/05-3869.pdf|archivedate=26 May 2010|bibcode=2007JSpRo..44..310B|year=2007|doi=10.2514/1.25116|citeseerx=10.1.1.463.8773}}</ref>\n\n===Atmosphere===\n[[Image:Mars Observer.jpg|thumb|200px|left|<center>Artist's rendition of the Mars Observer</center>]]\nCompared to the Earth, the [[atmosphere of Mars]] is about 100 times thinner. As a result, if a landing craft were to descend into Mars' atmosphere, it would decelerate at a much lower altitude, and depending on the object's mass, may not have enough time to reach terminal velocity. In order to deploy super- or subsonic decelerators, velocity must be below a threshold or they will not be effective. Therefore, technologies must be developed so that a landing craft can be decelerated enough to allow adequate time for other necessary landing processes to be carried out before landing.<ref name=challenges />\n\nMars' atmosphere varies significantly over the course of a [[Timekeeping on Mars|Mars year]], which prevents engineers from being able to develop a system for EDL common among all missions. Frequently-occurring dust storms increase lower atmospheric temperature and lessen atmospheric density, which, coupled with the extremely variable elevations on Mars' surface, forces a conservative selection of a landing site in order to allow for sufficient craft deceleration.<ref name=challenges />\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Rocky Mars Surface.jpeg|thumb|275px|<center>The rocky surface of Mars, as seen by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] Lander.</center>]]\nThe surface of Mars is extremely uneven, containing [[rock (geology)|rocks]], mountainous terrain, and craters. For a landing craft, the ideal landing area would be flat and debris-free. Since this terrain is almost impossible to find on Mars, landing gear must be very stable and have enough ground clearance to prevent problems with tipping over and instability upon landing. In addition, the deceleration systems of these landers would need to include thrusters that are pointed at the ground. These thrusters must be designed so that they only need to be active for an extremely short amount of time; if they are active and pointed at rocky ground for more than a few milliseconds, they start to dig trenches, launch small rocks up into the landing gear, and cause destabilizing backpressure to be forced upon the lander.<ref name=challenges />\n\nFinding an adequate landing site means being able to estimate rock size from orbit. The technology to accurately determine rock size under 0.5 meters in diameter from orbit has not yet been developed, so instead rock size distribution is inferred from its relationship to thermal inertia, based on thermal response of the landing site measured by satellites currently orbiting Mars. The [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] also helps this cause in the sense that its cameras can see rocks larger than 0.5 m in diameter.<ref name=challenges />\n\nAlong with the possibility of the lander tipping over on sloped surfaces, large topographical features like hills, mesas, craters and trenches pose the problem of interference with ground sensors. Radar and Doppler radar can falsely measure altitude during descent and the algorithms that target the touchdown point of the lander can be \"tricked\" into releasing the lander too early or late if the craft passes over mesas or trenches while descending.<ref name=challenges />\n\n===Mars-like environment replication costs===\nWith Mars EDL sequences only lasting about 5\u20138 minutes, the associated systems must be unquestionably reliable. Ideally, this would be verified by data obtained by carrying out large-scale tests of various components of the EDL systems on Earth-based testing. However, the costs of reproducing environments in which this data would be relevant in terms of Mars' environment are considerably high, resulting in testing being purely ground-based or simulating results of tests involving technologies derived from past missions.<ref name=challenges />\n\n==Programs==\n===InSight===\nInSight, launched from Earth May 5, 2018, the lander touched down on Mars November 26, 2018 on Elysium Planitia.<ref>{{cite web|title=InSight Timeline|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/launch/|work=Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Program costs==\nMars exploration missions, as do most NASA missions, can be fairly costly.

His mother was a descendant of talmudist [[Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller]], the [[Isaiah Horowitz|Shlah HaKadosh]], and [[Rashi]]. He studied with his father, and also in [[yeshiva]]s located in [[Slutsk]] and [[Shklov]]. He also had a close relationship with his uncle, [[Yaakov Kantrowitz]], rabbi of [[Timkovichi]], whom he greatly revered and considered his mentor.\n\nFeinstein was appointed rabbi of [[Lyuban, Belarus|Luba\u0144]], where he served for sixteen years. He married Shima Kustanovich in 1920, and had four children (Pesach Chaim, Fay Gittel, Shifra, and David), before leaving Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/rabbis/feinstein.htm|title=Great Leaders of Our People \u2013 Rav Moshe Feinstein |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref> Pesach Chaim died in Europe, and another son, Reuven, was born in the United States. Under increasing pressure from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet regime]], he moved with his family to New York City in 1936, where he lived for the rest of his life.\n\nSettling on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], he became the [[rosh yeshiva]] of [[Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem]]. He later established a branch of the yeshiva in Staten Island, New York, now headed by his son [[Reuven Feinstein]]. His son [[Dovid Feinstein]] heads the [[Manhattan]] branch.\n\nHe was president of the [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada]], and chaired the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]] of [[Agudath Israel of America]] from the 1960s until his death. Feinstein also took an active leadership role in Israel's [[Chinuch Atzmai]].\n\nFeinstein was revered by many as the ''[[Gadol|Gadol Hador]]'' (greatest Torah sage of the generation), including by [[Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky]], [[Yonasan Steif]], [[Elyah Lopian]], [[Aharon Kotler]], [[Yaakov Kamenetsky]], and [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]], even though several of them were far older than he. Feinstein was also recognized by many as the preeminent Torah sage and ''[[posek]]'' of his generation, and people from around the world called upon him to answer their most complicated halachic questions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Notable decisions==\nOwing to his prominence as an [[posek|adjudicator of Jewish law]], Feinstein was asked the most difficult questions, in which he issued a number of innovative and controversial decisions. Soon after arriving in the United States, he established a reputation for handling business and labor disputes. For instance, he wrote about strikes, seniority, and fair competition. Later, he served as the chief Halakhic authority for the [[Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists]], indicative of his expertise in Jewish medical ethics. In the medical arena, he opposed the early, unsuccessful heart transplants, although it is orally reported that in his later years, he allowed a person to receive a heart transplant (after the medical technique of preventing rejection was improved). On such matters, he often consulted with various scientific experts, including his son-in-law [[Moshe David Tendler]], who is a professor of [[biology]] and serves as a rosh yeshiva at [[Yeshiva University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/375175373/Halakhic-Bioethic|title=The Halakhic Definition of Life in a Bioethical Context|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}</ref>\nAs one of the prominent leaders of American Orthodoxy, Feinstein issued opinions that clearly distanced his community from [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]].<ref>For example, see Roth, Joel. ''The Halakhic Process: A Systematic Analysis'', JTS: 1986, pp.71ff. Robinson (2001).</ref> He faced intense opposition from Hasidic Orthodoxy on several controversial decisions, such as rulings on [[artificial insemination]] and [[mechitza]]. In the case of his position not to prohibit [[Jewish law and history on smoking|cigarette smoking]], though he recommended against it and prohibited second-hand smoke, other Orthodox rabbinic authorities disagreed. Even his detractors, while disagreeing with specific rulings, still considered him to be a leading decisor of Jewish law.

His father, David Feinstein, was the rabbi of Uzdan and a great-grandson of the [[Vilna Gaon]]'s brother. His mother was a descendant of talmudist [[Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller]], the [[Isaiah Horowitz|Shlah HaKadosh]], and [[Rashi]]. He studied with his father, and also in [[yeshiva]]s located in [[Slutsk]] and [[Shklov]]. He also had a close relationship with his uncle, [[Yaakov Kantrowitz]], rabbi of [[Timkovichi]], whom he greatly revered and considered his mentor.\n\nFeinstein was appointed rabbi of [[Lyuban, Belarus|Luba\u0144]], where he served for sixteen years. He married Shima Kustanovich in 1920, and had four children (Pesach Chaim, Fay Gittel, Shifra, and David), before leaving Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/rabbis/feinstein.htm|title=Great Leaders of Our People \u2013 Rav Moshe Feinstein |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref> Pesach Chaim died in Europe, and another son, Reuven, was born in the United States. Under increasing pressure from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet regime]], he moved with his family to New York City in 1936, where he lived for the rest of his life.\n\nSettling on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], he became the [[rosh yeshiva]] of [[Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem]]. He later established a branch of the yeshiva in Staten Island, New York, now headed by his son [[Reuven Feinstein]]. His son [[Dovid Feinstein]] heads the [[Manhattan]] branch.\n\nHe was president of the [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada]], and chaired the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]] of [[Agudath Israel of America]] from the 1960s until his death. Feinstein also took an active leadership role in Israel's [[Chinuch Atzmai]].\n\nFeinstein was revered by many as the ''[[Gadol|Gadol Hador]]'' (greatest Torah sage of the generation), including by [[Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky]], [[Yonasan Steif]], [[Elyah Lopian]], [[Aharon Kotler]], [[Yaakov Kamenetsky]], and [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]], even though several of them were far older than he. Feinstein was also recognized by many as the preeminent Torah sage and ''[[posek]]'' of his generation, and people from around the world called upon him to answer their most complicated halachic questions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Notable decisions==\nOwing to his prominence as an [[posek|adjudicator of Jewish law]], Feinstein was asked the most difficult questions, in which he issued a number of innovative and controversial decisions. Soon after arriving in the United States, he established a reputation for handling business and labor disputes. For instance, he wrote about strikes, seniority, and fair competition. Later, he served as the chief Halakhic authority for the [[Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists]], indicative of his expertise in Jewish medical ethics. In the medical arena, he opposed the early, unsuccessful heart transplants, although it is orally reported that in his later years, he allowed a person to receive a heart transplant (after the medical technique of preventing rejection was improved). On such matters, he often consulted with various scientific experts, including his son-in-law [[Moshe David Tendler]], who is a professor of [[biology]] and serves as a rosh yeshiva at [[Yeshiva University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/375175373/Halakhic-Bioethic|title=The Halakhic Definition of Life in a Bioethical Context|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}</ref>\nAs one of the prominent leaders of American Orthodoxy, Feinstein issued opinions that clearly distanced his community from [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]].<ref>For example, see Roth, Joel. ''The Halakhic Process: A Systematic Analysis'', JTS: 1986, pp.71ff. Robinson (2001).</ref> He faced intense opposition from Hasidic Orthodoxy on several controversial decisions, such as rulings on [[artificial insemination]] and [[mechitza]]. In the case of his position not to prohibit [[Jewish law and history on smoking|cigarette smoking]], though he recommended against it and prohibited second-hand smoke, other Orthodox rabbinic authorities disagreed. Even his detractors, while disagreeing with specific rulings, still considered him to be a leading decisor of Jewish law.

The terminology has also been used to refer to films that do not necessarily reflect Mormon themes but have been made by Mormon filmmakers.\n\nLDS cinema films might be considered distinct from LDS Church movies like ''[[Legacy (movie)|Legacy]]'' and ''[[The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd|Testaments]]'', since they are commercial and not produced for teaching or proselytizing LDS doctrine. LDS cinema is usually produced and directed by Latter-day Saints. The films typically have LDS themes and are often marketed especially toward Latter-day Saints, though there has been an effort to \"cross over\" into more mainstream themes.\n\n==History==\nFilms about Latter-day Saints are nothing new. The LDS Church sponsored the production and release of the feature-length films ''[[One Hundred Years of Mormonism]]'' (1913) and ''[[The Life of Nephi]]'' (1914). Films about Mormons, especially lurid pulp fiction-inspired tales of hypnotic missionaries and Western pioneer stories,  were a staple of the early silent, black and white film era. With films made primarily by LDS filmmakers for an LDS audience, the \"LDS Cinema\" movement is distinct from the broader use of Mormon characters in mainstream Hollywood films. The \"LDS Cinema\" movement began around 1999, when [[Richard Dutcher]]'s company, Zion Films, released ''[[God's Army (motion picture)|God's Army]]'' commercially. The film, which was produced on a budget of $300,000, grossed about $2.5 million at the box office and many more millions of dollars worth of video purchases. Observing the market success of ''God's Army'', many other LDS studios began producing films targetet at Latter-day Saint audiences.\n\nAlthough ''God's Army'' dealt with the overtly religious subject of [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]], and many LDS comedies are sometimes incomprehensible to people outside the LDS Church, a growing trend moves toward making LDS-themed movies more broadly accessible. The acclaimed [[World War II]] movie ''[[Saints and Soldiers]]'' is perhaps the most successful crossover LDS film to date. More accessible films have been thought by some as likely to ensure larger potential markets. However, \"accessibility\" has not necessarily translated into greater box office earnings or critical acclaim than achieved by the more \"insider\"-oriented LDS Cinema films.\n\nLDS comedies in particular have been panned by critics, who have branded most efforts thus far inaccessible and unfunny to those outside the intended market. Such movies have frequently been perceived as overly reliant upon the audience's extensive knowledge of LDS practices and LDS cultural norms.\n\n==MPAA ratings==\nOne aspect of the culture of LDS cinema is heightened concern over [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film ratings]]. Many Mormons feel disinclined to view movies rated R, so LDS film producers risk greatly diminished revenue for exceeding a PG or PG-13 rating. One PG-13 film, ''The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1'', gained its rating for depicting a decapitation that occurs in the [[Book of Mormon]]. Producers defended the scene as essential. Some critics{{Who|date=February 2010}} leveled a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Tougher standards for independent studios|common complaint about the MPAA]] &ndash; that it awards a higher rating to movies ''not'' produced by the [[major film studio]]s. Nonetheless, producers re-edited the movie to earn a PG rating for [[DVD]] distribution. Another film, ''Saints and Soldiers'' received an R-rating prior to [[film festival]] screening. Producers edited the movie to receive PG-13 for commercial distribution.\n\n==Selected notable companies==\n*[[Excel Entertainment Group]]\n*[[Halestorm Entertainment]]\n\n==Selected filmography==\n\n===Drama===\n*''[[Brigham Young (film)|Brigham Young]]'' (1940) &ndash; Follows the story of [[Brigham Young]] after [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]'s death. \n*''[[Bad Bascomb (film)|Bad Bascomb]]'' (1946) &ndash; Two outlaws hide out in a Mormon wagon and one of them befriends a little girl.\n*''[[Wagon Master]]'' (1950) &ndash; Forced out of Crystal City, a group of Mormons head west in search of the promised land.\n*''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1969) &ndash; Two unlikely prospectors share the same wife in a Californian mining town. \n*''[[Messenger of Death]]'' (1988) &ndash; A film about an attempt by a water company to start a family feud among [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormons]] to take the family's land for the company.\n*''[[God's Army (motion picture)|God's Army]]'' (1999) &ndash; The first general release, modern Mormon cinema film, about LDS missionaries; directed by [[Richard Dutcher]].\n*''Handcart'' &ndash; tale of the Martin handcart company<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337632/</ref>\n**''[[God's Army 2|God's Army 2: States of Grace]]'' (2005) &ndash; A sequel to ''God's Army'', by Richard Dutcher\n*''[[Brigham City (movie)|Brigham City]]'' (2001) &ndash; A murder mystery, also by Dutcher.\n*''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' (2001) &ndash; Not by an LDS studio.

The terminology has also been used to refer to films that do not necessarily reflect Mormon themes but have been made by Mormon filmmakers.\n\nLDS cinema films might be considered distinct from LDS Church movies like ''[[Legacy (movie)|Legacy]]'' and ''[[The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd|Testaments]]'', since they are commercial and not produced for teaching or proselytizing LDS doctrine. LDS cinema is usually produced and directed by Latter-day Saints. The films typically have LDS themes and are often marketed especially toward Latter-day Saints, though there has been an effort to \"cross over\" into more mainstream themes.\n\n==History==\nFilms about Latter-day Saints are nothing new. The LDS Church sponsored the production and release of the feature-length films ''[[One Hundred Years of Mormonism]]'' (1913) and ''[[The Life of Nephi]]'' (1914). Films about Mormons, especially lurid pulp fiction-inspired tales of hypnotic missionaries and Western pioneer stories,  were a staple of the early silent, black and white film era. With films made primarily by LDS filmmakers for an LDS audience, the \"LDS Cinema\" movement is distinct from the broader use of Mormon characters in mainstream Hollywood films. The \"LDS Cinema\" movement began around 1999, when [[Richard Dutcher]]'s company, Zion Films, released ''[[God's Army (motion picture)|God's Army]]'' commercially. The film, which was produced on a budget of $300,000, grossed about $2.5 million at the box office and many more millions of dollars worth of video purchases. Observing the market success of ''God's Army'', many other LDS studios began producing films targetet at Latter-day Saint audiences.\n\nAlthough ''God's Army'' dealt with the overtly religious subject of [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]], and many LDS comedies are sometimes incomprehensible to people outside the LDS Church, a growing trend moves toward making LDS-themed movies more broadly accessible. The acclaimed [[World War II]] movie ''[[Saints and Soldiers]]'' is perhaps the most successful crossover LDS film to date. More accessible films have been thought by some as likely to ensure larger potential markets. However, \"accessibility\" has not necessarily translated into greater box office earnings or critical acclaim than achieved by the more \"insider\"-oriented LDS Cinema films.\n\nLDS comedies in particular have been panned by critics, who have branded most efforts thus far inaccessible and unfunny to those outside the intended market. Such movies have frequently been perceived as overly reliant upon the audience's extensive knowledge of LDS practices and LDS cultural norms.\n\n==MPAA ratings==\nOne aspect of the culture of LDS cinema is heightened concern over [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film ratings]]. Many Mormons feel disinclined to view movies rated R, so LDS film producers risk greatly diminished revenue for exceeding a PG or PG-13 rating. One PG-13 film, ''The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1'', gained its rating for depicting a decapitation that occurs in the [[Book of Mormon]]. Producers defended the scene as essential. Some critics{{Who|date=February 2010}} leveled a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Tougher standards for independent studios|common complaint about the MPAA]] &ndash; that it awards a higher rating to movies ''not'' produced by the [[major film studio]]s. Nonetheless, producers re-edited the movie to earn a PG rating for [[DVD]] distribution. Another film, ''Saints and Soldiers'' received an R-rating prior to [[film festival]] screening. Producers edited the movie to receive PG-13 for commercial distribution.\n\n==Selected notable companies==\n*[[Excel Entertainment Group]]\n*[[Halestorm Entertainment]]\n\n==Selected filmography==\n\n===Drama===\n*''[[Brigham Young (film)|Brigham Young]]'' (1940) &ndash; Follows the story of [[Brigham Young]] after [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]'s death. \n*''[[Bad Bascomb (film)|Bad Bascomb]]'' (1946) &ndash; Two outlaws hide out in a Mormon wagon and one of them befriends a little girl.\n*''[[Wagon Master]]'' (1950) &ndash; Forced out of Crystal City, a group of Mormons head west in search of the promised land.\n*''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1969) &ndash; Two unlikely prospectors share the same wife in a Californian mining town. \n*''[[Messenger of Death]]'' (1988) &ndash; A film about an attempt by a water company to start a family feud among [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormons]] to take the family's land for the company.\n*''[[God's Army (motion picture)|God's Army]]'' (1999) &ndash; The first general release, modern Mormon cinema film, about LDS missionaries; directed by [[Richard Dutcher]].\n*''Handcart'' &ndash; tale of the Martin handcart company<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337632/</ref>\n**''[[God's Army 2|God's Army 2: States of Grace]]'' (2005) &ndash; A sequel to ''God's Army'', by Richard Dutcher\n*''[[Brigham City (movie)|Brigham City]]'' (2001) &ndash; A murder mystery, also by Dutcher.\n*''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' (2001) &ndash; Not by an LDS studio.

section to open (1869) was from the Central Pier to the Battery Hotel. In 1888 the line was extended from the hotel to Strawberry Gardens in Heysham, and in 1895 an extension was built from the pier to East View. These lines were built and owned by The Morecambe Tramways Company Limited. Finally in 1897 an extension was built to Bare by Morecambe Corporation and leased to the Tramways company<ref name=\"LSJ\">{{cite book |title=The Leyland Society Journal |year=July 2008}}</ref>. In 1909 Morecambe Corporation purchased the section between Battery and Bare, leaving the Tramway Company to operate the 1.25 mile Battery to Strawberry Gardens section. This section was relaid and operated using petrol mechanical trams from 1912 to 24 October 1924<ref name=\"LSJ\"/>.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThe network was linear, of length 3.59 miles, with a depot on the Heysham Road<ref name=\"TramDir\"/>{{page needed|date=August 2016}} at {{gbmappingsmall|SD 4200 6325}} between Stanley Road and Cumberland View Road.\n\n==Tramcars==\nThe fleet, in a livery of maroon, teak and white, and later green, consisted of:<ref name=\"TramDir\"/>{{page needed|date=August 2016}}\n* 2 single deck tramcars<ref name=\"TramDir\"/>{{page needed|date=August 2016}}\n* 15 double deck horse tramcars<ref name=\"TramDir\"/>{{page needed|date=August 2016}}\n* 4 single deck petrol tramcars<ref name=\"TramDir\"/>{{page needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of town tramway systems in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tramwaybadgesandbuttons.com/page148/styled-79/styled-70/page497.html Morecambe Tramways uniformed staff.]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/banksider/2244033035/in/photostream/ Morecambe horse tram on Flickr]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/banksider/2244825940/in/photostream/ Morecambe horse tram on Flickr]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/banksider/2244032753/in/photostream/ Morecambe horse tram on Flickr]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/banksider/2244861138/in/photostream/ Morecambe horse tram on Flickr]\n\n{{coord|54.0640|N|2.8786|W|display=title}}\n\n{{Historic UK Trams}}\n{{City of Lancaster}}\n\n[[Category:Tram transport in England]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Lancashire]]\n[[Category:Morecambe]]\n[[Category:Historic transport in Lancashire]]\n[[Category:Transport in the City of Lancaster]]\n[[Category:Railway companies established in 1869]]\n[[Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1924]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morecambe_Tramways"}
