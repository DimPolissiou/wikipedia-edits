The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role of the Church and the status and affairs of Italy. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941 and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I of Germany]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) appointed him as [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He was subsequently married to [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters, in 947 and became one of the king's closest allies. The relationship was strained, however, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had conducted with the rebellious [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], which he saw as threatening his own power. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto, but the rebellion was defeated and Conrad was stripped of his duchy. Conrad and Otto were soon reconciled, with Conrad fighting for Otto in the great [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955. Though the Germans were successful in halting the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], Conrad lost his life in the battle. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], a grandson of Otto I. Sometime between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' oldest son, [[Henry of Speyer]], was born. Little is known of his life as he died the age of 20 between 985 and 990. Conrad II's father was [[Henry of Speyer]], and his mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]], an area of [[Upper Lorraine]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman. After her remarriage, Adelaide demonstrated no close relationship with her son.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]] after deposing the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]] during the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his position at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded so as not to diminish his rank. Otto of Worms remained loyal to the new Emperor, receiving rulership of the [[March of Verona]] in 955, though the actual Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III appointed Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV were candidates for election as King of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany'', in return. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his holdings in Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival. Buchard assumed care for Conrad, providing his education and upbringing by 1000.\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]], the elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by Emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy. Conrad the Younger was placed in Conrad's care.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\">{{cite book|author1=Lenelotte M\u00f6ller|author2=Hans Ammerich|title=Die Salier: 1024-1125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZd4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT3|date=1 December 2015|publisher=marixverlag|isbn=978-3-8438-0474-5|pages=3\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\n===Adulthood===\nConrad married [[Gisela of Swabia]], a twice widowed [[duchess]], in 1016.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Gisela was the daughter of [[Herman II of Swabia|Duke Herman II of Swabia]] who, in 1002, unsuccessfully claimed the German throne following [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]'s death, losing the election to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]]. Gisela was first married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]]. By the marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] at the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. This marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}\n\nConrad II's hopes of obtaining his own duchy failed, but his marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and her father. The marriage was problematic because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad: both were descendants of [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian King]] [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], Henry in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was not allowed among relatives of the first to seventh generations. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists took exception to the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] used this breach of canonical law to force Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II were eventually reconciled, allowing him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024. Childless, Henry's death brought the [[Ottonian dynasty]], which had ruled Germany since 919, to an end. Without a clear successor as [[King of Germany]], Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]]. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbiship Aribo of Mainz]], the [[Primate of Germany]], also assisted Cunigunde.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bmagon.html |title= Archbishop Aribo di Magonza  |publisher= Catholic-Hierarchy  | date=July 24, 2017 | author= | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Konr\u00e1d2.jpg|thumb|left|Conrad&nbsp;II, depicted in the Chronicle of [[Ekkehard von Aura]]]]\n\nOn September 4, 1024, the German princes gathered at ''Kamba'', a historical name for an area on the east banks of the [[Rhine River]] opposite the modern German town of [[Oppenheim]]. Now the location of ''Kamba'' is marked with a small equestrian statue of Conrad II. The chronicler and Conrad's [[chaplain]], [[Wipo of Burgundy]] attended the meeting and documented the event. Archbishop Aribo presided over the assembly. Conrad presented himself as a candidate for election, as did his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]].

The [[Duchy of Saxony]] adopted a neutral strategy while the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] favored the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favored the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him. The secular dukes then cast their votes for the elder Conrad as well.

The duchies of Saxony and Lorraine were in opposition to his rule, as well as his cousin Conrad of Carinthia. To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]. The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=209}}\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.<ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 71\">Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref>\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref> With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew.

Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass depiction, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]]. Henry married [[Gunhilda of Denmark]], daughter of King [[Canute the Great]] of [[England]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]] by [[Emma of Normandy]]. This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.<ref name=\"Bolton2017\">{{cite book|author=Timothy Bolton|title=Cnut the Great p. 162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ssCDgAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-20833-7}}</ref> Henry, who would later become Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], became his father's chief counselor.\n\nConrad campaigned unsuccessfully against [[Poland]] in 1028\u20131030. In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans. Thus he effectively elevates the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority. By this assignment only, one reserves the rights for the office of Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\"/>\n\n===Second Italian expedition===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|Emperor Conrad II's tomb in the crypt of [[Speyer Cathedral]], Germany]]\nIn 1038, Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over [[Capua]] with its Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf]], whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops. Conrad's daughter-in-law and stepson died. Conrad himself returned home safely and held court on important occasions in [[Solothurn]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Goslar]]. His son Henry was invested with the duchies of Swabia and Carinthia.{{sfn|North|2001|p=143}}\n\nA year later in 1039 Conrad fell ill and died of [[gout]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345}} His heart and bowels are buried at the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345-346}} His body was transferred to Speyer via [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], where the funeral procession made stops. His body is buried at Speyer Cathedral, which was still under construction at this time. During a major excavation in 1900 his sarcophagus was relocated from his original resting place in front of the altar to the crypt, where it is still visible today along with those of seven of his successors.\n\nA biography of Conrad II in chronicle form, ''Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris'', was written by his chaplain [[Wipo of Burgundy]], and presented to Henry III in 1046, not long after he was crowned.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Family and children==\n{{see also|Kings of Germany family tree}}\nConrad married Gisela of Swabia in 1016, the daughter of Duke Herman II of Swabia.

of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role of the Church and the status and affairs of Italy. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941 and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I of Germany]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) appointed him as [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He was subsequently married to [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters, in 947 and became one of the king's closest allies. The relationship was strained, however, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had conducted with the rebellious [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], which he saw as threatening his own power. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto, but the rebellion was defeated and Conrad was stripped of his duchy. Conrad and Otto were soon reconciled, with Conrad fighting for Otto in the great [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955. Though the Germans were successful in halting the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], Conrad lost his life in the battle. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], a grandson of Otto I. Sometime between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' oldest son, [[Henry of Speyer]], was born. Little is known of his life as he died the age of 20 between 985 and 990. Conrad II's father was [[Henry of Speyer]], and his mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]], an area of [[Upper Lorraine]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman.

Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his position at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded so as not to diminish his rank. Otto of Worms remained loyal to the new Emperor, receiving rulership of the [[March of Verona]] in 955, though the actual Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III appointed Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV were candidates for election as King of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany'', in return. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his holdings in Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival. Buchard assumed care for Conrad, providing his education and upbringing by 1000.\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]], the elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by Emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy. Conrad the Younger was placed in Conrad's care.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\">{{cite book|author1=Lenelotte M\u00f6ller|author2=Hans Ammerich|title=Die Salier: 1024-1125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZd4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT3|date=1 December 2015|publisher=marixverlag|isbn=978-3-8438-0474-5|pages=3\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\n===Adulthood===\nConrad married [[Gisela of Swabia]], a twice widowed [[duchess]], in 1016.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Gisela was the daughter of [[Herman II of Swabia|Duke Herman II of Swabia]] who, in 1002, unsuccessfully claimed the German throne following [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]'s death, losing the election to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]]. Gisela was first married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]]. By the marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] at the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. This marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}\n\nConrad II's hopes of obtaining his own duchy failed, but his marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and her father. The marriage was problematic because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad: both were descendants of [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian King]] [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], Henry in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was not allowed among relatives of the first to seventh generations. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists took exception to the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] used this breach of canonical law to force Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II were eventually reconciled, allowing him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024.

Without a clear successor as [[King of Germany]], Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]].

As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him. The secular dukes then cast their votes for the elder Conrad as well.

The duchies of Saxony and Lorraine were in opposition to his rule, as well as his cousin Conrad of Carinthia. To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]. The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.<ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 71\">Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref>\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref> With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

[[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute.

Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles.

Within game-based learning initiatives, students might use ''[[Gamestar Mechanic]]'' or ''[[GameMaker]]'' to create their own video game, or play ''[[Minecraft]]'', for example, where they explore and create 3D worlds. In these examples, along with games such as ''Surge'' for [[PlayStation]] and ''[[Angry Birds]]'', the learning agenda is encompassed within the game itself.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\nSome authors contrast gamification of learning with game-based learning, claiming that gamification occurs only when learning happens in a non-game context, such as a school classroom, and when a series of game elements is arranged into a system or \"game layer\" which operates in coordination with the learning in that regular classroom.<ref name=2012W /> Others include games that are created to induce learning.<ref>Kapp (2012), p. 200: \"result of the brainstorming process ... is the creation of a gamification design document outlining the design of the game ...\"</ref>\n\n== Game elements that can facilitate learning ==\nSome elements of games that may be used to motivate learners and facilitate learning include:\n* Progress mechanics (points/badges/leaderboards, or PBL's)\n* [[Narrative]] and characters \n* Player control\n* Immediate feedback\n* Opportunities for collaborative problem solving\n* Scaffolded learning with increasing challenges\n* Opportunities for mastery, and leveling up\n* Social connection\n\nWhen a classroom incorporates the use of some of these elements, that environment can be considered \"gamified\". There is no distinction as to how many elements need to be included to officially constitute gamification, but a guiding principle is that gamification takes into consideration the complex system of reasons a person chooses to act, and not just one single factor.<ref name=2012W /> Progress mechanics, which need not make use of advanced technology, are often thought of as constituting a gamified system<ref name=2012K /> However, used in isolation, these points and opportunities to earn achievements are not necessarily effective motivators for learning.<ref name=2012K /> Engaging video games which can keep players playing for hours on end do not maintain players' interest by simply offering the ability to earn points and beat levels. Rather, the story that carries players along, the chances for players to connect and collaborate with others, the immediate feedback, the increasing challenges, and the powerful choices given to players about how to proceed throughout the game, are immensely significant factors in sustained engagement. Business initiatives designed to use gamification to retain and recruit customers, but do not incorporate a creative and balanced approach to combining game elements, may be destined to fail.<ref name=Gartner2012>{{cite press release |last1=Pettey |first1=Christy |last2=van der Meulen |first2=Rob |date=27 November 2012 |title= Gartner Says by 2014, 80 Percent of Current Gamified Applications Will Fail to Meet Business Objectives Primarily Due to Poor Design |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2251015 | publisher=Gartner, Inc. |accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref> Similarly, in learning contexts, the unique needs of each set of learners, along with the specific learning objectives relevant to that context must inform the combination of game elements to shape a compelling gamification system that has the potential to motivate learners.<ref name=2013H&S>{{Cite report |last1=Huang |first1=Wendy Hsin-Yuan |last2=Soman |first2=Dilip |date= 10 December 2013 |title= A Practitioner\u2019s Guide To Gamification Of Education |url= http://inside.rotman.utoronto.ca/behaviouraleconomicsinaction/files/2013/09/GuideGamificationEducationDec2013.pdf |series=Research Report Series Behavioural Economics in Action |publisher=Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto |accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nA system of game elements which operates in the classroom is explicit, and consciously experienced by the students in the classroom.

This pacing fosters continued engagement and interest which can mean that learners are focused on educational tasks, and may get into a state of [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], or deeply absorbed in learning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|title=Finding Flow: The psychology of engagement with everyday life|year=1997|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465024117}}</ref>\n\n== Application ==\nThree key ways in which a classroom, [[course (education)|course]], or unit can be gamified are through changing the language, adapting the [[Grading (education)|grading]] process, and modifying the structure of the learning environment. With regard to language, instead of referring to academic requirements with the typical associated terms, game-like names may be used instead. For example, making a course presentation might be referred to as \"embarking on a quest\", writing an exam might be \"defeating monsters\", and creating a prototype might be classed as \"completing a mission\". In terms of grading, the grading scheme for a course might be adapted to make use of [[Experience point|experience points (XP)]] as opposed to letter grades. Each student can begin at level one with zero points; as they progress through the course, completing missions and demonstrating learning, they earn XP. A chart can be developed to illustrate how many XP is required to earn a letter grade. For example, earning 1500 XP might translate to a C, while 2000 would earn a B, and 2500, an A. Some teachers use XP, as well as health points (HP) and knowledge points (KP) to motivate students in the classroom, but do not connect these points with the letter grades students get on a report card. Instead these points are connected with earning virtual rewards such as badges or trophies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe structure of a course or unit may be adapted in various ways to incorporate elements of gamification; these adaptations can affect the role of the student, the role of the teacher, and role of the learning environment. The role of a student in a gamified environment might be to adopt an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] and a game name with which they navigate through their learning tasks. Students may be organized into [[team]]s or [[guild]]s, and be invited to embark on learning quests with their fellow guild members. They may be encouraged to help other guild members, as well as those in other guilds, if they have mastered a learning task ahead of others. Students tend to express themselves as one of the following game-player types; player (motivated by extrinsic rewards), socialiser (motivated by relatedness), free spirit (motivated by autonomy), achiever (motivated by mastery) and philanthropist (motivated by purpose).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gameification: A Simple Introduction and a Bit More|last = Marczewski|first = Andrej|publisher = Self-published on Amazon Digital Services|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>  The role of the teacher is to design a gamified application, embedding game dynamics and mechanics that appeal to the target group (i.e. students) and provide the type of rewards that are attractive to the motivation of the majority.<ref>{{Cite journal|url =https://journals.ala.org/ltr/article/view/5632 |title = Designing Gamification in the Right Way|last = Kim|first = Bohyun|date = 2015|journal = Library Technology Reports |volume=51 |issue=2 |access-date=5 August 2016}}</ref> Therefore, it is important teachers know their students so they are able to best design a gamififed program that not only interests the students but also one in which matches the specific learning goals that hit on elements of knowledge from the curriculum.<ref name=2012K /> The teacher also needs to responsibly track student achievements with a web-based platform, such as [[Open Badges]], the WordPress plug-in GameOn or an [[online spreadsheet]]. The teacher may also publish a [[High score|leaderboard]] online which illustrates the students who have earned the most XP, or reached the highest level of play. The teacher may define the parameters of the classroom \"game\", giving the ultimate learning goal a name, defining the learning tasks which make up the unit or the course, and specifying the rewards for completing those tasks. The other important role of the teacher is to provide encouragement and guidance for students as they navigate the gamified environment.\n\nThe role of a gamified learning environment may be structured to provide an overarching narrative which functions as a context for all the learning activities. For example, a narrative might involve an impending [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]] attack which can be fended off or a murder mystery which can be solved, ultimately, through the process of learning. Learning is the focus of each gamified system. Sometimes the narrative is related to the content being learned, for example, in the case of a disease outbreak which can be stopped through learning biology. In some cases the narrative is unrelated, as in a case of music students who learn to play pieces as the means to collectively climb up to the top of a mountain, experiencing various challenges and setbacks along the way. Other ways in which gaming elements are part of the role of the learning environment include theme music played at opportune times, a continuous feedback loop which, if not instantaneous, is as quick as possible, a variety of individual and collaborative challenges, and the provision of choice as to which learning activities are undertaken, how they will be undertaken, or in which order they will be undertaken.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\n== History ==\nWithout adding extra gaming elements to the classroom, schooling already contains some elements which are analogous to games.<ref name=L&H2011>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=J.|last2=Hammer |first2=J. |title=Gamification in education: What, how, why bother?|journal=Academic Exchange Quarterly|year=2011|volume=15 |issue=2 |url=http://www.gamifyingeducation.org/files/Lee-Hammer-AEQ-2011.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516005227/http://www.gamifyingeducation.org/files/Lee-Hammer-AEQ-2011.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-16}}{{unreliable source?|reason=Academic Exchange Quarterly is on Beall's list of questionable journals; it may provide only token peer-review, if any|date=August 2016}}</ref>  Since the 1700s, school has presented opportunities for students to earn marks for handing in assignments and completing exams,<ref>{{cite book|last=Reisner|first=Edward H.|title=Nationalism and Education since 1789: A Social and Political History of Modern Education|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924032694006|date=1922|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2016}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Pierson |first=George |title=C.

Since the early 1900s, with the advent of [[psychoanalytic theory]], reward management programs were developed and can still be seen in schools. For example, many teachers set up reward programs in their classrooms which allow students to earn free time, school supplies or treats for finishing homework or following classroom rules.<ref name=2011D />\n\nWhile some have criticized the term \"gamification\" then, as simply a new name for a practice that has been used in education for many years,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kirk|first1=Terry|last2=Harris |first2=Christopher|title=It's all fun and games in the library|journal=Knowledge Quest|year=2011|volume=40|issue=1|pages=8\u20139|url=http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/knowledgequest/docs/GuestEdColumn_SeptOct2011.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> gamification does not refer to a one-dimensional system where a reward is offered for performing a certain behaviour. The gamification of learning is an approach which recently has evolved, in coordination with technological developments, to include much larger scales for gameplay, new tools, and new ways to connect people.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Rughini\u015f|first=R\u0103zvan|title=Gamification for productive interaction: Reading and working with the gamification debate in education|journal=Information Systems and Technologies (Cisti), Iberian Conference on|conference=Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)|year=2013|issn=2166-0727|publisher=IEEE|location=Lisboa}}</ref>  The term gamification, coined in 2002, is not a one-dimensional reward system.

Some of these contexts include the [[Starbucks]] and [[Shoppers Drug Mart]] loyalty programs, location-based check-in applications such as [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]], and mobile and web applications and tools that reward and broadcast healthy eating, drinking, and exercise habits, such as [[Fitocracy]], [[BACtrack]] and [[Fitbit]]. These examples involve the use of game elements such as points, badges and leaderboards to motivate behavioural changes and track those changes in online platforms. The gamification of learning is related to these popular initiatives, but specifically focuses on the use of game elements to facilitate student engagement and motivation to learn. It is difficult to pinpoint when gamification, in the strict sense of the term, came to be used in educational contexts, although examples shared online by classroom teachers begin appearing in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nThe research of Dom\u00ednguez and colleagues about gamifying learning experiences suggests that common beliefs about the benefits obtained when using games in education can be challenged. Students who completed the gamified experience got better scores in practical assignments and in overall score, but their findings also suggest that these students performed poorly on written assignments and participated less on class activities, although their initial motivation was higher. The researchers concluded that gamification in e-learning platforms seems to have the potential to increase student motivation, but that it is not trivial to achieve that effect, as a big effort is required in the design and implementation of the experience for it to be fully motivating for participants. On the one hand, qualitative analysis of the study suggests that gamification can have a great emotional and social impact on students, as reward systems and competitive social mechanisms seem to be motivating for them. But quantitative analysis suggests that the cognitive impact of gamification on students is not very significant. Students who followed traditional exercises performed similarly in overall score than those who followed gamified exercises. Disadvantages of gamified learning were reported by 57 students who did not want to participate in the gamified experience. The most frequent reason argued by students was 'time availability'. The second most important reason were technical problems. Other reasons were that there were too many students and that they had to visit so many [[web page]]s and applications at the university that they did not want to use a new one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dom\u00ednguez |first1=Adri\u00e1n |last2=Saenz-de-Navarrete |first2=Joseba |last3=de-Marcos |first3=Luis |last4=Fern\u00e1ndez-Sanz |first4=Luis |last5=Pag\u00e9s |first5=Carmen |last6= Mart\u00ednez-Herr\u00e1iz |first6=Jos\u00e9-Javier |title=Gamifying learning experiences: Practical implications and outcomes |journal=Computers & Education |year=2013|volume=63 |pages=380\u2013392 |doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.020}}</ref>\n\nAnother field where serious games are used to improve learning is health care. Petit dit Dariel, Raby, Ravaut and Rothan-Tondeur investigated the developing of serious games potential in nursing education. They suggest that few nursing students have long-term exposure to home-care and community situations. New pedagogical tools are needed to adequately and consistently prepare nurses for the skills they will need to care for patients outside acute care settings. Advances in information and communications technologies offer an opportunity to explore innovative pedagogical solutions that could help students develop these skills in a safe environment. Laboratory simulations with high fidelity mannequins, for example, have become an integral element in many health care curricula.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Petit dit Dariel|first1=Odessa J.|last2=Raby |first2=Thibaud |last3=Ravaut|first3=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last4= Rothan-Tondeur|first4=Monique |title=Developing the Serious Games Potential in Nursing Education|year=2013|journal=Nurse Education Today|volume=33|issue=12|pages=1569\u20131575|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2012.12.014|pmid=23332500}}</ref> A recent systematic review found evidence suggesting that the use of simulation mannequins significantly improved three outcomes integral to clinical reasoning: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking and the ability to identify deteriorating patients.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lapkin|first1=Samuel|last2=Levett-Jones|first2=Tracy |last3=Bellchambers|first3=Helen |last4=Fernandez|first4=Ritin |title=Effectiveness of Patient Simulation Manikins in Teaching Clinical Reasoning Skills to Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Systematic Review|journal=Clinical Simulation in Nursing|volume=6|issue=6|year=2010|pages=e207\u2013e222|doi=10.1016/j.ecns.2010.05.005}}</ref>\n\nIn the study of Mouaheb, Fahli, Moussetad and Eljamali an American version of a serious game was investigated: [[Virtual U]]niversity. Results showed that learning using this serious game has educational values that are based on learning concepts advocated by constructivist psycho-cognitive theories. It guarantees intrinsic motivation, generates cognitive conflicts and provides situated learning. The use of Virtual University allowed the researchers to identify the following key points: from its playfulness combined with video game technologies, the tool was able to motivate learners intrinsically; the simulation game also recreates learning situations extremely close to that of reality, especially considering the complexity, dynamism and all of the interrelations and interactions that exist within the university system. This is a major educational advantage by encouraging 1) an intense interaction that generates real cognitive or socio-cognitive conflicts, providing a solid construction of knowledge; 2) an autonomy in the learning process following a strong metacognitive activity; 3) an eventual transfer of acquired skills.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mouaheb|first1=Houda|last2=Fahli|first2=Ahmed |last3=Moussetad|first3=Mohammed |last4= Eljamali |first4=Said |title=The Serious Game: What Educational Benefits?|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=46|year=2012|pages=5502\u20135508|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.465|url= }}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nGamification of learning has been criticized for its use of extrinsic motivators, which some teachers believe must be avoided since they have the potential to decrease intrinsic motivation for learning (see [[overjustification]]).

Within game-based learning initiatives, students might use ''[[Gamestar Mechanic]]'' or ''[[GameMaker]]'' to create their own video game, or play ''[[Minecraft]]'', for example, where they explore and create 3D worlds. In these examples, along with games such as ''Surge'' for [[PlayStation]] and ''[[Angry Birds]]'', the learning agenda is encompassed within the game itself.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\nSome authors contrast gamification of learning with game-based learning, claiming that gamification occurs only when learning happens in a non-game context, such as a school classroom, and when a series of game elements is arranged into a system or \"game layer\" which operates in coordination with the learning in that regular classroom.<ref name=2012W /> Others include games that are created to induce learning.<ref>Kapp (2012), p. 200: \"result of the brainstorming process ... is the creation of a gamification design document outlining the design of the game ...\"</ref>\n\n== Game elements that can facilitate learning ==\nSome elements of games that may be used to motivate learners and facilitate learning include:\n* Progress mechanics (points/badges/leaderboards, or PBL's)\n* [[Narrative]] and characters \n* Player control\n* Immediate feedback\n* Opportunities for collaborative problem solving\n* Scaffolded learning with increasing challenges\n* Opportunities for mastery, and leveling up\n* Social connection\n\nWhen a classroom incorporates the use of some of these elements, that environment can be considered \"gamified\". There is no distinction as to how many elements need to be included to officially constitute gamification, but a guiding principle is that gamification takes into consideration the complex system of reasons a person chooses to act, and not just one single factor.<ref name=2012W /> Progress mechanics, which need not make use of advanced technology, are often thought of as constituting a gamified system<ref name=2012K /> However, used in isolation, these points and opportunities to earn achievements are not necessarily effective motivators for learning.<ref name=2012K /> Engaging video games which can keep players playing for hours on end do not maintain players' interest by simply offering the ability to earn points and beat levels. Rather, the story that carries players along, the chances for players to connect and collaborate with others, the immediate feedback, the increasing challenges, and the powerful choices given to players about how to proceed throughout the game, are immensely significant factors in sustained engagement.

This pacing fosters continued engagement and interest which can mean that learners are focused on educational tasks, and may get into a state of [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], or deeply absorbed in learning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|title=Finding Flow: The psychology of engagement with everyday life|year=1997|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465024117}}</ref>\n\n== Application ==\nThree key ways in which a classroom, [[course (education)|course]], or unit can be gamified are through changing the language, adapting the [[Grading (education)|grading]] process, and modifying the structure of the learning environment. With regard to language, instead of referring to academic requirements with the typical associated terms, game-like names may be used instead. For example, making a course presentation might be referred to as \"embarking on a quest\", writing an exam might be \"defeating monsters\", and creating a prototype might be classed as \"completing a mission\". In terms of grading, the grading scheme for a course might be adapted to make use of [[Experience point|experience points (XP)]] as opposed to letter grades. Each student can begin at level one with zero points; as they progress through the course, completing missions and demonstrating learning, they earn XP. A chart can be developed to illustrate how many XP is required to earn a letter grade. For example, earning 1500 XP might translate to a C, while 2000 would earn a B, and 2500, an A. Some teachers use XP, as well as health points (HP) and knowledge points (KP) to motivate students in the classroom, but do not connect these points with the letter grades students get on a report card. Instead these points are connected with earning virtual rewards such as badges or trophies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe structure of a course or unit may be adapted in various ways to incorporate elements of gamification; these adaptations can affect the role of the student, the role of the teacher, and role of the learning environment. The role of a student in a gamified environment might be to adopt an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] and a game name with which they navigate through their learning tasks. Students may be organized into [[team]]s or [[guild]]s, and be invited to embark on learning quests with their fellow guild members. They may be encouraged to help other guild members, as well as those in other guilds, if they have mastered a learning task ahead of others. Students tend to express themselves as one of the following game-player types; player (motivated by extrinsic rewards), socialiser (motivated by relatedness), free spirit (motivated by autonomy), achiever (motivated by mastery) and philanthropist (motivated by purpose).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gameification: A Simple Introduction and a Bit More|last = Marczewski|first = Andrej|publisher = Self-published on Amazon Digital Services|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>  The role of the teacher is to design a gamified application, embedding game dynamics and mechanics that appeal to the target group (i.e. students) and provide the type of rewards that are attractive to the motivation of the majority.<ref>{{Cite journal|url =https://journals.ala.org/ltr/article/view/5632 |title = Designing Gamification in the Right Way|last = Kim|first = Bohyun|date = 2015|journal = Library Technology Reports |volume=51 |issue=2 |access-date=5 August 2016}}</ref> Therefore, it is important teachers know their students so they are able to best design a gamififed program that not only interests the students but also one in which matches the specific learning goals that hit on elements of knowledge from the curriculum.<ref name=2012K /> The teacher also needs to responsibly track student achievements with a web-based platform, such as [[Open Badges]], the WordPress plug-in GameOn or an [[online spreadsheet]]. The teacher may also publish a [[leaderboard]] online which illustrates the students who have earned the most XP, or reached the highest level of play. The teacher may define the parameters of the classroom \"game\", giving the ultimate learning goal a name, defining the learning tasks which make up the unit or the course, and specifying the rewards for completing those tasks. The other important role of the teacher is to provide encouragement and guidance for students as they navigate the gamified environment.\n\nThe role of a gamified learning environment may be structured to provide an overarching narrative which functions as a context for all the learning activities. For example, a narrative might involve an impending [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]] attack which can be fended off or a murder mystery which can be solved, ultimately, through the process of learning. Learning is the focus of each gamified system. Sometimes the narrative is related to the content being learned, for example, in the case of a disease outbreak which can be stopped through learning biology. In some cases the narrative is unrelated, as in a case of music students who learn to play pieces as the means to collectively climb up to the top of a mountain, experiencing various challenges and setbacks along the way. Other ways in which gaming elements are part of the role of the learning environment include theme music played at opportune times, a continuous feedback loop which, if not instantaneous, is as quick as possible, a variety of individual and collaborative challenges, and the provision of choice as to which learning activities are undertaken, how they will be undertaken, or in which order they will be undertaken.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\n== History ==\nWithout adding extra gaming elements to the classroom, schooling already contains some elements which are analogous to games.<ref name=L&H2011>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=J.|last2=Hammer |first2=J. |title=Gamification in education: What, how, why bother?|journal=Academic Exchange Quarterly|year=2011|volume=15 |issue=2 |url=http://www.gamifyingeducation.org/files/Lee-Hammer-AEQ-2011.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516005227/http://www.gamifyingeducation.org/files/Lee-Hammer-AEQ-2011.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-16}}{{unreliable source?|reason=Academic Exchange Quarterly is on Beall's list of questionable journals; it may provide only token peer-review, if any|date=August 2016}}</ref>  Since the 1700s, school has presented opportunities for students to earn marks for handing in assignments and completing exams,<ref>{{cite book|last=Reisner|first=Edward H.|title=Nationalism and Education since 1789: A Social and Political History of Modern Education|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924032694006|date=1922|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2016}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Pierson |first=George |title=C.

Since the early 1900s, with the advent of [[psychoanalytic theory]], reward management programs were developed and can still be seen in schools. For example, many teachers set up reward programs in their classrooms which allow students to earn free time, school supplies or treats for finishing homework or following classroom rules.<ref name=2011D />\n\nWhile some have criticized the term \"gamification\" then, as simply a new name for a practice that has been used in education for many years,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kirk|first1=Terry|last2=Harris |first2=Christopher|title=It's all fun and games in the library|journal=Knowledge Quest|year=2011|volume=40|issue=1|pages=8\u20139|url=http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/knowledgequest/docs/GuestEdColumn_SeptOct2011.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> gamification does not refer to a one-dimensional system where a reward is offered for performing a certain behaviour. The gamification of learning is an approach which recently has evolved, in coordination with technological developments, to include much larger scales for gameplay, new tools, and new ways to connect people.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Rughini\u015f|first=R\u0103zvan|title=Gamification for productive interaction: Reading and working with the gamification debate in education|journal=Information Systems and Technologies (Cisti), Iberian Conference on|conference=Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)|year=2013|issn=2166-0727|publisher=IEEE|location=Lisboa}}</ref>  The term gamification, coined in 2002, is not a one-dimensional reward system.

Some of these contexts include the [[Starbucks]] and [[Shoppers Drug Mart]] loyalty programs, location-based check-in applications such as [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]], and mobile and web applications and tools that reward and broadcast healthy eating, drinking, and exercise habits, such as [[Fitocracy]], [[BACtrack]] and [[Fitbit]]. These examples involve the use of game elements such as points, badges and leaderboards to motivate behavioural changes and track those changes in online platforms. The gamification of learning is related to these popular initiatives, but specifically focuses on the use of game elements to facilitate student engagement and motivation to learn. It is difficult to pinpoint when gamification, in the strict sense of the term, came to be used in educational contexts, although examples shared online by classroom teachers begin appearing in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nThe research of Dom\u00ednguez and colleagues about gamifying learning experiences suggests that common beliefs about the benefits obtained when using games in education can be challenged. Students who completed the gamified experience got better scores in practical assignments and in overall score, but their findings also suggest that these students performed poorly on written assignments and participated less on class activities, although their initial motivation was higher. The researchers concluded that gamification in e-learning platforms seems to have the potential to increase student motivation, but that it is not trivial to achieve that effect, as a big effort is required in the design and implementation of the experience for it to be fully motivating for participants. On the one hand, qualitative analysis of the study suggests that gamification can have a great emotional and social impact on students, as reward systems and competitive social mechanisms seem to be motivating for them. But quantitative analysis suggests that the cognitive impact of gamification on students is not very significant. Students who followed traditional exercises performed similarly in overall score than those who followed gamified exercises. Disadvantages of gamified learning were reported by 57 students who did not want to participate in the gamified experience. The most frequent reason argued by students was 'time availability'. The second most important reason were technical problems. Other reasons were that there were too many students and that they had to visit so many [[web page]]s and applications at the university that they did not want to use a new one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dom\u00ednguez |first1=Adri\u00e1n |last2=Saenz-de-Navarrete |first2=Joseba |last3=de-Marcos |first3=Luis |last4=Fern\u00e1ndez-Sanz |first4=Luis |last5=Pag\u00e9s |first5=Carmen |last6= Mart\u00ednez-Herr\u00e1iz |first6=Jos\u00e9-Javier |title=Gamifying learning experiences: Practical implications and outcomes |journal=Computers & Education |year=2013|volume=63 |pages=380\u2013392 |doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.020}}</ref>\n\nAnother field where serious games are used to improve learning is health care. Petit dit Dariel, Raby, Ravaut and Rothan-Tondeur investigated the developing of serious games potential in nursing education. They suggest that few nursing students have long-term exposure to home-care and community situations. New pedagogical tools are needed to adequately and consistently prepare nurses for the skills they will need to care for patients outside acute care settings. Advances in information and communications technologies offer an opportunity to explore innovative pedagogical solutions that could help students develop these skills in a safe environment. Laboratory simulations with high fidelity mannequins, for example, have become an integral element in many health care curricula.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Petit dit Dariel|first1=Odessa J.|last2=Raby |first2=Thibaud |last3=Ravaut|first3=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last4= Rothan-Tondeur|first4=Monique |title=Developing the Serious Games Potential in Nursing Education|year=2013|journal=Nurse Education Today|volume=33|issue=12|pages=1569\u20131575|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2012.12.014|pmid=23332500}}</ref> A recent systematic review found evidence suggesting that the use of simulation mannequins significantly improved three outcomes integral to clinical reasoning: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking and the ability to identify deteriorating patients.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lapkin|first1=Samuel|last2=Levett-Jones|first2=Tracy |last3=Bellchambers|first3=Helen |last4=Fernandez|first4=Ritin |title=Effectiveness of Patient Simulation Manikins in Teaching Clinical Reasoning Skills to Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Systematic Review|journal=Clinical Simulation in Nursing|volume=6|issue=6|year=2010|pages=e207\u2013e222|doi=10.1016/j.ecns.2010.05.005}}</ref>\n\nIn the study of Mouaheb, Fahli, Moussetad and Eljamali an American version of a serious game was investigated: [[Virtual U]]niversity. Results showed that learning using this serious game has educational values that are based on learning concepts advocated by constructivist psycho-cognitive theories. It guarantees intrinsic motivation, generates cognitive conflicts and provides situated learning. The use of Virtual University allowed the researchers to identify the following key points: from its playfulness combined with video game technologies, the tool was able to motivate learners intrinsically; the simulation game also recreates learning situations extremely close to that of reality, especially considering the complexity, dynamism and all of the interrelations and interactions that exist within the university system. This is a major educational advantage by encouraging 1) an intense interaction that generates real cognitive or socio-cognitive conflicts, providing a solid construction of knowledge; 2) an autonomy in the learning process following a strong metacognitive activity; 3) an eventual transfer of acquired skills.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mouaheb|first1=Houda|last2=Fahli|first2=Ahmed |last3=Moussetad|first3=Mohammed |last4= Eljamali |first4=Said |title=The Serious Game: What Educational Benefits?|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=46|year=2012|pages=5502\u20135508|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.465|url= }}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nGamification of learning has been criticized for its use of extrinsic motivators, which some teachers believe must be avoided since they have the potential to decrease intrinsic motivation for learning (see [[overjustification]]).

'''Jane Marple''' is an elderly woman who lives in the village of [[St. Mary Mead]] and acts as an amateur consulting [[detective]]. She is one of the best known of Christie's characters and has been portrayed numerous times on screen. Her first appearance was in a short story published in ''[[The Royal Magazine]]'' in December 1927, \"[[The Tuesday Night Club]]\",<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Curran|title=Agatha Christie: Murder in the Making|location=New York|publisher=Harper|year=2011|isbn=978-0-06-206542-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/agathachristiemu0000curr/page/140 140]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/agathachristiemu0000curr/page/140}}</ref> which later became the first chapter of ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932). Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930 and her last appearance was in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' in 1976.\n\n==Origins==\nThe character of Miss Marple is based on friends of Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, n\u00e9e West).<ref>Margaret West was the sister of Mary Ann Boehmer, Agatha Christie's maternal grandmother. Margaret married Christie's paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863 in Westbourne, West Sussex. He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St.John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret's stepson, Frederick Miller, went on to marry her niece Clara, and Agatha was the result. {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2957794/Agatha-Christie-used-her-grandmother-as-a-model-for-Miss-Marple-new-tapes-reveal.html|title=Agatha Christie used her step grandmother as a model for Miss Marple, new tapes reveal|first=Stephen|last=Adams|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-09-16}}</ref> Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was \"the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies \u2013 old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Agatha|title=An Autobiography|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-635328-7|page=449}}</ref> Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. When [[Michael Morton (dramatist)|Michael Morton]] adapted the novel for the stage, he replaced the character of Caroline with a young girl.

This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books, she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West, appears in some stories, including ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'', ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'' (which also feature his wife, Joyce Lempri\u00e8re). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (including Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda, and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper, faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating companion, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as \"an old lady\" in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ''Sleeping Murder'', forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' but she is if anything more agile in ''[[Nemesis (Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', set only sixteen months later.\n\nMiss Marple's background is described in some detail, albeit in glimpses across the novels and short stories in which she appears. She has a very large family, including a sister, the mother of [[Raymond West (character)|Raymond]] and Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter|The Thumb Mark of St. Peter]]'').\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Miss Marple Series===\n# ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1930, Novel)\n#''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932, Collection)\n#''[[The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' (1939, Collection)\n# ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942, Novel)\n# ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1943, Novel)\n# ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (1950, Novel)\n# ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'' (1950, Collection)\n# ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952, Novel) - also published as Murder With Mirrors\n# ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1953, Novel)\n# ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957, Novel) - also published as What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!\n# ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960, Collection)\n# ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]'' (1961, Collection)\n# ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]] (''1962, Novel)\n# ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (1964, Novel)\n# ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (1965, Novel)\n# ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1971, Novel)\n# ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (1976, Novel)\n# ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories|Miss Marple's Final Cases]]'' (1979, Collection)\n\n===Miss Marple short story collections===\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932 short story collection featuring Miss Marple, also published as ''The Tuesday Club Murders'')\n* ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories]]'' (short stories collected posthumously, also published as ''Miss Marple's Final Cases'', but only six of the eight stories actually feature Miss Marple) (written between 1939 and 1954, published 1979)\n* ''Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories'', published 1985, includes 20 from 4 sets: ''[[The Tuesday Club Murders]]'', ''[[The Regatta Mystery]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'', and ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]''.\n\nMiss Marple also appears in \"Greenshaw's Folly\", a short story included as part of the Poirot collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960).

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia''. NY: Simon and Schuster, 2000. 386-87.\n{{ISBN|9780671028312}} \nbooks.google.com/books?id=R3syC8weGO8C&pg=PA386</ref> Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones. Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes. Lansbury would find later fame in a similar role as [[Jessica Fletcher]].\n\n===Ita Ever===\nIn 1983, [[Estonians|Estonian]] stage and film actress [[Ita Ever]] starred in the [[Russian language]] [[Mosfilm]] adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (using the Russian edition's translated title, ''The Secret of the Blackbirds'') as the character of Miss Marple.<ref name=\"PBS Mystery.

[[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy. She had earlier appeared in a TV movie adaptation of the non-Marple Christie story ''Murder Is Easy'', playing an elderly lady somewhat similar to Miss Marple.\n\n===Joan Hickson===\n{{Main article|Miss Marple (TV series)}}\n\nFrom 1984 to 1992, the [[BBC]] adapted all of the original Miss Marple novels as a series titled ''Miss Marple''. [[Joan Hickson]] played the lead role.

[[Geraldine McEwan]] starred in the first three series. [[Julia McKenzie]] took over the role in the fourth season.\n\nThe adaptations change the plots and characters of the original books (e.g. incorporating lesbian affairs, changing the identities of some killers, renaming or removing significant characters, and even using stories from other books in which Miss Marple did not originally feature). In the Geraldine McEwan series it is revealed that when she was young (portrayed by [[Julie Cox]] in a flashback), Miss Marple had an affair with a married soldier, Captain Ainsworth, who was killed in action in World War I, in December 1915. It is also said (in ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'') that she served as an ambulance driver during World War I.\n\nListing of the TV series featuring Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie:\n* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Sittaford Mystery]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Towards Zero]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Murder Is Easy]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Why Didn't They Ask Evans?]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Secret of Chimneys]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Blue Geranium|The Blue Geranium]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#Greenshaw.27s Folly|Greenshaw's Folly]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' (2013)\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main article|Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple}}\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Japanese TV network [[NHK]] produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple'', which features both Miss Marple and [[Hercule Poirot]].

a [[fictional character]] in [[Agatha Christie]]'s crime novels and short stories. '''Jane Marple''' is an elderly [[spinster]] who lives in the village of [[St. Mary Mead]] and acts as an amateur consulting [[detective]]. She is one of the best known of Christie's characters and has been portrayed numerous times on screen. Her first appearance was in a short story published in ''[[The Royal Magazine]]'' in December 1927, \"[[The Tuesday Night Club]]\",<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Curran|title=Agatha Christie: Murder in the Making|location=New York|publisher=Harper|year=2011|isbn=978-0-06-206542-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/agathachristiemu0000curr/page/140 140]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/agathachristiemu0000curr/page/140}}</ref> which later became the first chapter of ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932). Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930 and her last appearance was in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' in 1976.\n\n==Origins==\nThe character of Miss Marple is based on friends of Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, n\u00e9e West).<ref>Margaret West was the sister of Mary Ann Boehmer, Agatha Christie's maternal grandmother. Margaret married Christie's paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863 in Westbourne, West Sussex. He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St.John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret's stepson, Frederick Miller, went on to marry her niece Clara, and Agatha was the result. {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2957794/Agatha-Christie-used-her-grandmother-as-a-model-for-Miss-Marple-new-tapes-reveal.html|title=Agatha Christie used her step grandmother as a model for Miss Marple, new tapes reveal|first=Stephen|last=Adams|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-09-16}}</ref> Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was \"the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies \u2013 old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Agatha|title=An Autobiography|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-635328-7|page=449}}</ref> Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. When [[Michael Morton (dramatist)|Michael Morton]] adapted the novel for the stage, he replaced the character of Caroline with a young girl. This change saddened Christie and she determined to give old maids a voice: Miss Marple was born.<ref name=\"agathachristie.com\">{{cite web|url=http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|title=Characters \u2013 Miss Marple|work=Agatha Christie|accessdate=2012-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010144904/http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|archivedate=10 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nChristie may have taken the name from [[Marple railway station]], through which she passed, or from Marple Hall, near her sister Madge's home at [[Abney Hall]].<ref name=\"Cheshire Life\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/out-about/was-miss-marple-born-in-cheshire-1-1631050 | title=Was Miss Marple Born in Cheshire? | date=15 September 2010 | publisher=Cheshire Life | accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.poirot.us/mprofile.php \"Marple's Profile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126123518/http://poirot.us/mprofile.php |date=26 November 2010 }}, Hercule Poirot Central, ''accessed 30 March 2009''.</ref>\n\n==Character==\nThe character of Jane Marple in the first Miss Marple book, ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'', is markedly different from how she appears in later books. This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books, she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West, appears in some stories, including ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'', ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'' (which also feature his wife, Joyce Lempri\u00e8re). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (including Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda, and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper, faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating companion, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as \"an old lady\" in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ''Sleeping Murder'', forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' but she is if anything more agile in ''[[Nemesis (Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', set only sixteen months later.\n\nMiss Marple's background is described in some detail, albeit in glimpses across the novels and short stories in which she appears. She has a very large family, including a sister, the mother of [[Raymond West (character)|Raymond]] and Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter|The Thumb Mark of St. Peter]]'').\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Miss Marple Series===\n# ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1930, Novel)\n#''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932, Collection)\n#''[[The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' (1939, Collection)\n# ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942, Novel)\n# ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1943, Novel)\n# ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (1950, Novel)\n# ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'' (1950, Collection)\n# ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952, Novel) - also published as Murder With Mirrors\n# ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1953, Novel)\n# ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957, Novel) - also published as What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!\n# ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960, Collection)\n# ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]'' (1961, Collection)\n# ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]] (''1962, Novel)\n# ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (1964, Novel)\n# ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (1965, Novel)\n# ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1971, Novel)\n# ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (1976, Novel)\n# ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories|Miss Marple's Final Cases]]'' (1979, Collection)\n\n===Miss Marple short story collections===\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932 short story collection featuring Miss Marple, also published as ''The Tuesday Club Murders'')\n* ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories]]'' (short stories collected posthumously, also published as ''Miss Marple's Final Cases'', but only six of the eight stories actually feature Miss Marple) (written between 1939 and 1954, published 1979)\n* ''Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories'', published 1985, includes 20 from 4 sets: ''[[The Tuesday Club Murders]]'', ''[[The Regatta Mystery]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'', and ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]''.\n\nMiss Marple also appears in \"Greenshaw's Folly\", a short story included as part of the Poirot collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960).

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia''. NY: Simon and Schuster, 2000. 386-87.\n{{ISBN|9780671028312}} \nbooks.google.com/books?id=R3syC8weGO8C&pg=PA386</ref> Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones. Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes. Lansbury would find later fame in a similar role as [[Jessica Fletcher]].\n\n===Ita Ever===\nIn 1983, [[Estonians|Estonian]] stage and film actress [[Ita Ever]] starred in the [[Russian language]] [[Mosfilm]] adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (using the Russian edition's translated title, ''The Secret of the Blackbirds'') as the character of Miss Marple.<ref name=\"PBS Mystery.

[[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy.

[[Julia McKenzie]] took over the role in the fourth season.\n\nThe adaptations change the plots and characters of the original books (e.g. incorporating lesbian affairs, changing the identities of some killers, renaming or removing significant characters, and even using stories from other books in which Miss Marple did not originally feature). In the Geraldine McEwan series it is revealed that when she was young (portrayed by [[Julie Cox]] in a flashback), Miss Marple had an affair with a married soldier, Captain Ainsworth, who was killed in action in World War I, in December 1915. It is also said (in ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'') that she served as an ambulance driver during World War I.\n\nListing of the TV series featuring Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie:\n* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Sittaford Mystery]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Towards Zero]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Murder Is Easy]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Why Didn't They Ask Evans?]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Secret of Chimneys]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Blue Geranium|The Blue Geranium]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#Greenshaw.27s Folly|Greenshaw's Folly]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' (2013)\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main article|Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple}}\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Japanese TV network [[NHK]] produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple'', which features both Miss Marple and [[Hercule Poirot]].

{"title_page": "List of one-hit wonders on the UK Singles Chart", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a list of artists who have achieved one [[List of number-one singles (UK)|number-one hit]] on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and no other entry whatsoever on the chart. The list uses the strict ''[[The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles]]'' definition of \"[[one-hit wonder]]\", a term also commonly used more loosely to refer to any act known primarily for one major hit.\n\n==Methodology==\nA hit is attributed to the main artist given credit. If a single is released by two artists with the conjunction 'and' or 'versus' then both artists have equal billing (e.g. [[Jane Birkin]] and [[Serge Gainsbourg]]) and are both counted as having a number one (in this case \"[[Je t'aime... moi non plus]]\") whereas if the conjunction between two artists is 'featuring' or 'with' (or similar) then the first artist is considered the main artist for that hit, with the other artist listed being given a lesser billing (traditionally in these cases they would be additional vocalists or contributing instrumentalists, although in the 21st century it became common for the lead vocalist to be a 'featured' artist).\n\nArtists who are classed as one-hit wonders within the past twelve months are not yet added to the list, as they may still follow-up their number one with another hit. A one-hit wonder from earlier who now goes on to score another hit will be removed from this list.\n\n==One-hit wonders==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Artist\n! Peak date\n! Song\n!

The list uses the strict ''[[The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles]]'' definition of \"[[one-hit wonder]]\", a term also commonly used more loosely to refer to any act known primarily for one major hit.\n\n==Methodology==\nA hit is attributed to the main artist given credit. If a single is released by two artists with the conjunction 'and' or 'versus' then both artists have equal billing (e.g. [[Jane Birkin]] and [[Serge Gainsbourg]]) and are both counted as having a number one (in this case \"[[Je t'aime... moi non plus]]\") whereas if the conjunction between two artists is 'featuring' or 'with' (or similar) then the first artist is considered the main artist for that hit, with the other artist listed being given a lesser billing (traditionally in these cases they would be additional vocalists or contributing instrumentalists, although in the 21st century it became common for the lead vocalist to be a 'featured' artist).\n\nArtists who are classed as one-hit wonders within the past twelve months are not yet added to the list, as they may still follow-up their number one with another hit. A one-hit wonder from earlier who now goes on to score another hit will be removed from this list.\n\n==One-hit wonders==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Artist\n! Peak date\n! Song\n!

[[Pornography|Pornographic]] films present [[sexual fantasies]] and usually include erotically stimulating material such as [[nudity in film|nudity]] ([[Softcore pornography|softcore]]) and [[sexual intercourse]] ([[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]]). A distinction is sometimes made between \"erotic\" and \"pornographic\" films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit [[Sex in film|sexuality]], and focuses more on arousal than [[storytelling]], but the distinction is highly subjective.\n\nPornographic films are produced and distributed on a variety of media, depending on the demand and technology available, including traditional [[film stock]] in various formats, [[Home video|video for home viewing]], [[DVD]]s, [[Internet pornography|Internet download]], [[cable TV]], in addition to other media. Today, pornographic films are sold or rented on DVD; shown through Internet streaming, special channels and [[pay-per-view]] on cable and satellite; and viewed in rapidly disappearing [[adult theater]]s. By law, they are generally not permitted to be shown in mainstream cinemas, or on [[free-to-air]] television.\n\nFilms with [[wikt:risqu\u00e9|risqu\u00e9]] content have been produced since the invention of motion picture in the 1880s. Production of such films was profitable, and a number of [[Film producer|producers]] began to specialize in their production. However, various groups within society considered such depictions [[immoral]], labeled them \"pornographic\", and attempted to have them suppressed under [[obscenity laws]], with varying degrees of success. Such films continued to be produced, but could only be distributed by [[Underground press|underground channels]]. Because the viewing of such films carried a [[social stigma]], they were viewed at [[brothel]]s, [[adult movie theaters]], [[stag party|stag parties]], at home, in private clubs, and also at night cinemas.\n\nOnly in the 1970s, during the [[Golden Age of Porn]], were pornographic films semi-legitimized; and by the 1980s, pornography on [[home video]] achieved wider distribution. The rise of the [[Internet]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s similarly changed the way pornographic films were distributed, complicating [[censorship]] regimes around the world and legal prosecutions of \"obscenity\".\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Pierre Woodman at work in Australia.png|thumb|350px|right|Staff and actors at a pornographic film set in Australia]]\nPornographic films are typically categorized as either [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] or [[hardcore pornography]]. In general, softcore pornography is pornography that does not depict explicit [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[sexual penetration]] or extreme [[Sexual fetish|fetishism]].<ref name=Amis>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4153718,00.html |title=A rough trade |accessdate=29 February 2012 |author=[[Martin Amis]] |date=17 March 2001|work=[[Guardian.co.uk]]}}</ref> It generally contains [[Nudity in film|nudity]] or partial nudity in sexually suggestive situations. Hardcore pornography is pornography that depicts penetration or extreme fetish acts, or both. It contains graphic sexual activity and visible penetration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/modern/20th-Century-Nudes.html |title=P20th Century Nudes in Art |publisher=The Art History Archive|accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> A pornographic work is characterized as hardcore if it has any hardcore content.\n\nPornographic films are generally classified into subgenres which describe the [[sexual fantasy]] which the film and actors attempt to create. Subgenres can also be classified into the characteristics of the performers or the type of sexual activity on which it concentrates and not necessarily on the [[Niche market|market]] to which each subgenre appeals. The subgenres usually conform to certain [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], and each may appeal to a particular audience.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of erotic depictions|Stag film}}\n\n===Early years: 20th century===\n[[File:Johann Schwarzer movies about 1906.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Images from early Austrian erotic movies (about 1906, first image showing ''[[Am Sklavenmarkt]]'') by photographer [[Johann Schwarzer]] and his Saturn Film company]]\nProduction of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYxFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA454 |title=My Ladyboy Date: Give love a chance |first=Heinz |last=Duthel |publisher=BoD \u2013 Books on Demand |date=3 January 2018 |page=454 |isbn=9783746064253}}</ref> Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen [[Eug\u00e8ne Pirou]] and [[Albert Kirchner]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailydot.com/irl/history-of-porn/ |title=A brief and incredible history of porn |first=Lyz |last=Lenz |date=17 October 2016 |access-date=30 December 2018 |work=[[Daily Dot]] |publisher=[[Complex Media, Inc.]]}}</ref> Kirchner (under the name \"L\u00e9ar\") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou.

It was a 47-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips (\"the mysteries of the kiss revealed\"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and obscene to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution.<ref name=sexinfilms1 /> Perhaps in defiance and \"to spice up a film\", this was followed by many kiss imitators, including ''[[The Kiss in the Tunnel]]'' (1899) and ''The Kiss'' (1900). A [[tableau vivant]] style was used in short film ''The Birth of the Pearl'' (1901)<ref>Produced by [[Frederick S.

[[Johann Schwarzer]] formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at those screenings. Before Schwarzer's productions, erotic films were provided by the [[Path\u00e9]] brothers from French produced sources. In 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities which destroyed all the films they could find,<ref>Michael Achenbach, Paolo Caneppele, Ernst Kieninger: ''Projektionen der Sehnsucht: Saturn, die erotischen Anf\u00e4nge der \u00f6sterreichischen Kinematografie''. Filmarchiv Austria, Wien 2000, {{ISBN|3-901932-04-6}}.</ref> though some have since resurfaced from private collections. There were a number of American films in the 1910s which contained female [[nudity in film]].\n\nBecause Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In ''[[Black and White and Blue]]'' (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of [[Buenos Aires]] and other South American cities by the turn of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years. However, none of these earliest pornographic films are known to have survived. According to Patrick Robertson's ''Film Facts'', \"the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is '''A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge'''\" made in France in 1908. The plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn.

Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their [[bathtub]]s to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesmen, but anyone caught viewing or possessing them risked a prison sentence.<ref name=history>{{cite video |people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, Dean Kuipers (Cast) |date=7 March 2006 |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |medium=DVD |location=Port Washington, NY |publisher=Koch Vision |accessdate=21 October 2006 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=22 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |date=29 March 2005 |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html |title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic |work=Time Magazine |publisher=Time inc |accessdate=16 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n===1950s: home movies ===\nThe post-war era saw technological developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market and amateur film-making, particularly the introduction of the [[8 mm film|8 mm]] and [[super 8 mm film|super-8]] film gauges, popular for the home movie market.\n\nEntrepreneurs emerged to meet the demand. In Britain, in the 1950s, [[Harrison Marks]] produced films which were considered risqu\u00e9, and which today would be described as \"soft core\". In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films for the 8&nbsp;mm market of his models undressing and posing topless, popularly known as \"glamour home movies\". To Marks, the term \"glamour\" was a euphemism for nude modeling/photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/bbcwords/glamour-new.html|title=Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1960s: Europe and United States===\nOn the European continent, sex films were more explicit. Starting in 1961, [[Lasse Braun]] was a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Braun was able to accumulate funds for his lavish productions from the profit gained with so-called loops, ten-minute [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] movies which he sold to [[Reuben Sturman]], who distributed them to 60,000 American [[peep show]] booths.<ref>Eric Schlosser, ''Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market'' (Houghton Mifflin Books, 2004), p. 143.</ref> Braun was always on the move, and made his hardcore movies in a number of countries, including Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nIn December 1960, American female director [[Doris Wishman]] began producing a series of eight [[pornographic]] films, or [[nudist]] films without sex scenes, including ''[[Hideout in the Sun]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053908/|title=Hideout in the Sun|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1960), ''[[Nude on the Moon]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056293/|title=Nude on the Moon|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1961) and ''[[Diary of a Nudist]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054809/|title=Diary of a Nudist|date=27 December 1961|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1961). She also produced a series of [[sexploitation]] films.\n\nIn the 1960s, social and judicial attitudes towards the explicit depiction of sexuality began to change. For example, Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' (1967) included numerous frank nude scenes and simulated [[sexual intercourse]]. In one particularly controversial scene, Lena kisses her lover's flaccid [[human penis|penis]]. The film was exhibited in mainstream cinemas, but in 1969 it was banned in [[Massachusetts]] allegedly for being [[pornography|pornographic]]. The ban was challenged in the courts, with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ultimately declaring that the film was not obscene,<ref>''Byrne v. Karalexis'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/396/976/case.html 396 U.S. 976 (1969)] and [http://supreme.justia.com/us/401/216/case.html 401 U.S. 216 (1971)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/31|title=Film International - Thinking Film Since 1973|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> paving the way for other sexually explicit films. Another Swedish film ''[[Language of Love]]'' (1969) was also sexually explicit, but was framed as a quasi-documentary sex [[educational film]], which made its legal status uncertain though controversial.\n\nIn 1969, [[Denmark]] became the first country to abolish all censorship laws, enabling pornography, including hardcore pornography. The example was followed by toleration in the [[Netherlands]], also in 1969. There was an explosion of pornography commercially produced in those countries, including, at the very beginning, [[child pornography]] and [[bestiality]] porn. Now that being a pornographer was legal, there was no shortage of businessmen who invested in plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, needed to be smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold \"under the counter\" or (sometimes) shown in \"members only\" cinema clubs.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn the [[United States]], producers of pornographic films formed the [[Adult Film Association of America]] in 1969, after the release of ''[[Blue Movie]]'' by [[Andy Warhol]], to fight against [[censorship]], and to defend the industry against [[obscenity]] charges.<ref name=\"afw0187\">\"10th Annual Erotic Awards,\" ''Adam Film World'', January 1987, p. 7</ref>\n\n===1970s: adult theaters and movie booths in the United States ===\nIn the 1970s, there was a more tolerant judicial attitude to non-mainstream films. However, mainstream theatres would normally not screen even softcore films, leading to a rise of [[adult theater]]s in the [[United States]] and many other countries. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated \"movie booths\" in [[sex shop]]s that displayed pornographic \"loops\" (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).\n\nDenmark started producing comparatively big-budget theatrical feature film sex comedies such as ''[[Bordellet]]'' (1972), the [[Bedside-films|''Bedside''-films]] (1970\u20131976) and the [[Zodiac-films|''Zodiac''-films]] (1973\u20131978), starring mainstream actors (a few of whom even performed their own sex scenes) and usually not thought of as \"porno films\" though all except the early ''Bedside''-films included hardcore pornographic scenes. Several of these films still rank among the most seen films in Danish film history<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.dk/solgtebilletter.php|title=Scope > Flest solgte billetter|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> and all remain favourites on [[home video]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekkofilm.dk/?allowbreak=false&id=472 |title=Sengekant (inkl. en uges skiferie) |language=Danish |work=Ekko.dk |accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, ''[[Blue Movie]]'' by [[Andy Warhol]] was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"NYT-19690722\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"WS-2002-2005\">{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |work=WarholStars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-19690810\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

These were shot on film and screened in mainstream movie theaters. The prediction that frank depictions of onscreen sex would soon become commonplace did not materialize. [[William Rotsler]] expressed this in 1973, \"Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled subdivision.

California]]'' (1973). The case established that [[obscenity]] was not legally protected, but the case also established the [[Miller test]], a three-pronged test to determine obscenity (which is not legal) as opposed to [[indecency]] (which may or may not be legal).\n\n===1980s: new technology and new legal cases===\nWith the arrival of the home [[video cassette recorder]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pornographic movie industry experienced massive growth and spawned adult stars like [[Traci Lords]], [[Seka (actress)|Seka]], [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Christy Canyon]], [[Ginger Lynn]], [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]] and directors such as [[Gregory Dark]]. By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of [[videotape]]. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because videotape produced a different image quality. However, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits, since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realized that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's homes. This was the end of the age of big-budget productions; the mainstreaming of pornography had begun. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover nearly every fetish possible, since the production of pornography was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands were now being made, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.<ref name=history/><ref name=time/> One could now not only watch pornography in the comfort and privacy of one's own home, but also find more choices available to satisfy specific fantasies and fetishes.\n\nSimilarly, the [[camcorder]] spurred changes in pornography in the 1980s, when people could make their own amateur sex movies, whether for private use, or for wider distribution.\n\nThe year 1987 saw an important legal case in the U.S. when the ''[[de facto]]'' result of [[California v. Freeman]] was the legalization of [[hardcore pornography]]. The prosecution of Harold Freeman was initially planned as the first in a series of legal cases to effectively outlaw the production of such movies.<ref>bluefilm</ref>\n\n===1990s: DVD and the Internet age===\nIn the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on [[DVD]]. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format ([[videotape]]) and allowed innovations such as \"interactive\" videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.\n\nThe introduction and widespread availability of the [[Internet]] further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously, videos would be ordered from an adult bookstore, or through mail-order; but, with the Internet, people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).\n\nPornography can be distributed over the Internet in a number of ways, including [[paysite]]s, [[video hosting service]]s, and [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]]. While pornography had been traded electronically since the 1980s, it was in the invention of the [[World Wide Web]] in 1991 as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time that led to an explosion in online pornography.\n\n[[File:Kim Kardashian West 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|American television personality [[Kim Kardashian]] rose to fame following the release of the pornographic film ''[[Kim Kardashian, Superstar]]'' in 2007, in which she had [[sexual intercourse]] with American singer [[Ray J]].]]\n\n[[Viv Thomas]], [[Paul Thomas (pornographic actor)|Paul Thomas]], [[Andrew Blake (director)|Andrew Blake]], [[Antonio Adamo]], and [[Rocco Siffredi]] were prominent directors of pornographic films in the 1990s. In 1998, the [[Denmark|Danish]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated film production company [[Zentropa]] became the world's first mainstream film company to openly produce [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] pornographic films, starting with ''[[Constance (1998 film)|Constance]]'' (1998). That same year, Zentropa also produced ''[[Idioterne]]'' (1998), directed by [[Lars von Trier]], which won many international awards and was nominated for a [[Golden Palm]] in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). ''Idioterne'' started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as [[Catherine Breillat]]'s ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'', which starred pornstar [[Rocco Siffredi]].\n\nIn 1999, the Danish TV channel [[Kanal K\u00f8benhavn]] started broadcasting hardcore films at night, uncoded and freely available to any viewer in the [[Copenhagen]] area (as of 2009, this is still the case, courtesy of [[Innocent Pictures]], a company started by Zentropa).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanalkobenhavn.dk/6_erotik.html|title=Kanal K\u00f8benhavn - Erotik og Kontakt|date=28 December 2013|accessdate=18 August 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228194319/http://www.kanalkobenhavn.dk/6_erotik.html|archivedate=28 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOnce people could watch adult movies in the privacy of their own homes, a new adult market developed that far exceeded the scope of its theater-centric predecessor. More recently, the Internet has served as catalyst for creating a still-larger market for porn, a market that is even less traditionally theatrical.\n\nBy the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. Of late, webcams and webcam recordings are again expanding the market. Thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers' demand.\n\n=== 2000s: competition and contraction ===\nBy the 2000s, the fortunes of the pornography industry had changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by [[streaming media]] delivery over the [[Internet]], competition from bootleg, amateur and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size.<ref name=theroux-guardian-jun2012/>\n\n==Pornographic film industry==\n{{see also|Sex industry}}\n\n===Economics===\nGlobally, pornography is a large scale business with revenues of nearly $100 billion<ref name=2013Industry>{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Chris|title=After rough 2013, porn studios look for a better year \u2013 \"Globally, porn is a $97 billion industry, according to Kassia Wosick, assistant professor of sociology at New Mexico State University.

Traditionally, the audience of pornographic films has been predominantly the straight male. In this situation, the main male actor acted as proxy for the viewer enacting the sexual fantasy of the genre of the film. A typical pornographic film featured a female performer on whom the film focused. Her male partner traditionally had no distinctive features other than a large penis. However, there has been an increase in female viewers over time, and there have recently been efforts to increase the [[sexualization]] of male performers also. New features such as men with smaller penises, charming facial features and well-built bodies are becoming predominant in pornographic films, as well as the emergence of [[feminist pornography]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/22/porn-women \"'Porn made for women, by women\"] May, Catalina.

Huffington Post, 4 March 2013. Accessed 11 October 2013</ref> In recent times a gay audience has also developed, and the scenarios of the films have adjusted accordingly.\n\nPornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create that fantasy. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres. In general, pornographic films follow a number of conventions. For example, irrespective of the genre, most actors are required to appear nude in pornographic films.\n\nIn films directed to a heterosexual male audience, the primary focus is on the female actors in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance. The female actors are commonly presented in erotic, provocative or suggestive clothing. If they are wearing shoes, they are usually high-heel. They do not normally wear jewellery or glasses. They are usually in the high range of [[physical attractiveness]].\n\nMost male performers in heterosexual pornography are selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess. They are presented as being able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies.\n\n===Legal status===\n{{Main|List of pornography laws by region}}\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held in 1969 that State laws making mere private possession of obscene material a crime are invalid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=394&invol=557|title=STANLEY v. GEORGIA|work=Findlaw|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> Further attempts were made in the 1970s in the United States to close down the pornography industry, this time by prosecuting those in the industry on [[prostitution]] charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of ''[[People v. Freeman]]''. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely ''portraying'' a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]] making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.<ref name=\"cbsnews2003\"/><ref>But see news.com.au: [http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/coffee-shop-girls-face-charges-over-sex-shows/story-e6frfq80-1225827686559 Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows] February 08, 2010</ref>\n\nAt present, no other state in the United States has either implemented or accepted this legal distinction between commercial pornography performers versus prostitutes as shown in the Florida case where sex film maker Clinton Raymond McCowen, aka \"Ray Guhn\", was indicted on charges of \"soliciting and engaging in prostitution\" for his creation of pornography films which included \"McCowen and his associates recruited up to 100 local men and women to participate in group sex scenes, the affidavit says.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=15700 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209182130/http://www.xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=15700 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |title=Webmaster Ray Guhn Arrested in Florida |accessdate=June 26, 2006 |website=xbiz.com }}</ref> The distinction that California has in its legal determination in the Freeman decision is usually denied in most states' local prostitution laws, which do not specifically exclude performers from such inclusion.\n\nIn some cases, some states have ratified their local state laws for inclusion to prevent California's Freeman decision to be applied to actors who are paid a fee for sexual actions within their state borders. One example is the state of Texas whose prostitution law specifically states:\n\n:An offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or pay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a person to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.43.htm |title=Texas Penal Code, Chapter 43: Public Indecency |accessdate=April 18, 2007 |publisher=Texas Legislature}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, federal law prohibits the sale, distribution or dissemination of obscene materials through the mail, over the broadcast airwaves, on cable or satellite TV, on the Internet, over the telephone or by any other means that cross state lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-71 |title=18 USC Chapter 71 - OBSCENITY &#124; Title 18 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure &#124; U.S. Code &#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2013-05-06}}</ref> Most states also have specific laws banning the sale or distribution of obscene pornography within state borders. The only protection for obscene material recognized by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is personal possession in the home [[Stanley v. Georgia]].\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States]] affirmed in [[Miller v. California]] that obscenity was not protected speech. Further, the court ruled that each community is responsible for setting its own standards about what is considered to be obscene material. If pornographic material is prosecuted and brought to trial, a jury can deem it obscene based on:\n# whether \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n# whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law and\n# whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nIn many countries pornography is legal to distribute and to produce, but there are some restrictions. Pornography is also banned in some countries, in particular in the [[Muslim world]] and [[China]], but can be accessed through the Internet in some of these nations.\n\n=== Health issues ===\nSex acts in pornographic films have traditionally been performed without the use of [[condom]]s, with an accompanying risk of [[sexually transmitted disease]] among performers. In 1986, there was an outbreak of [[HIV]] infection which led to the deaths through [[AIDS]] of several actors and actresses. This led to the creation in 1998 of the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]], which helped set up a monitoring system in the U.S. pornographic film industry, which required pornographic film actors to be tested for HIV every 30 days.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Basten |first1=Fred |last2=Holmes |first2=Laurie |last3=Holmes |first3=John C. |title=Porn King: The John Holmes Story|year=1998|publisher=John Holmes Inc|isbn=978-1-880047-69-9}}</ref> {{As of|2013}}, HIV infection of performers in the U.S. pornography industry has been rare, with only a few outbreaks being recorded over the subsequent three decades.

[[Pornography|Pornographic]] films present [[sexual fantasies]] and usually include erotically stimulating material such as [[nudity in film|nudity]] ([[Softcore pornography|softcore]]) and [[sexual intercourse]] ([[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]]). A distinction is sometimes made between \"erotic\" and \"pornographic\" films on the basis that the latter category contains more explicit [[Sex in film|sexuality]], and focuses more on arousal than [[storytelling]], but the distinction is highly subjective.\n\nPornographic films are produced and distributed on a variety of media, depending on the demand and technology available, including traditional [[film stock]] in various formats, [[Home video|video for home viewing]], [[DVD]]s, [[Internet pornography|Internet download]], [[cable TV]], in addition to other media. Today, pornographic films are sold or rented on DVD; shown through Internet streaming, special channels and [[pay-per-view]] on cable and satellite; and viewed in rapidly disappearing [[adult theater]]s. By law, they are generally not permitted to be shown in mainstream cinemas, or on [[free-to-air]] television.\n\nFilms with [[wikt:risqu\u00e9|risqu\u00e9]] content have been produced since the invention of motion picture in the 1880s. Production of such films was profitable, and a number of [[Film producer|producers]] began to specialize in their production. However, various groups within society considered such depictions [[immoral]], labeled them \"pornographic\", and attempted to have them suppressed under [[obscenity law]]s, with varying degrees of success. Such films continued to be produced, but could only be distributed by [[Underground press|underground channels]]. Because the viewing of such films carried a [[social stigma]], they were viewed at [[brothel]]s, [[adult movie theater]]s, [[stag party|stag parties]], at home, in private clubs, and also at night cinemas.\n\nOnly in the 1970s, during the [[Golden Age of Porn]], were pornographic films semi-legitimized; and by the 1980s, pornography on [[home video]] achieved wider distribution. The rise of the [[Internet]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s similarly changed the way pornographic films were distributed, complicating [[censorship]] regimes around the world and legal prosecutions of \"obscenity\".\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Pierre Woodman at work in Australia.png|thumb|350px|right|Staff and actors at a pornographic film set in Australia]]\nPornographic films are typically categorized as either [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] or [[hardcore pornography]]. In general, softcore pornography is pornography that does not depict explicit [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[sexual penetration]] or extreme [[Sexual fetish|fetishism]].<ref name=Amis>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4153718,00.html |title=A rough trade |accessdate=29 February 2012 |author=[[Martin Amis]] |date=17 March 2001|work=[[Guardian.co.uk]]}}</ref> It generally contains [[Nudity in film|nudity]] or partial nudity in sexually suggestive situations. Hardcore pornography is pornography that depicts penetration or extreme fetish acts, or both. It contains graphic sexual activity and visible penetration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/modern/20th-Century-Nudes.html |title=P20th Century Nudes in Art |publisher=The Art History Archive|accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> A pornographic work is characterized as hardcore if it has any hardcore content.\n\nPornographic films are generally classified into subgenres which describe the [[sexual fantasy]] which the film and actors attempt to create. Subgenres can also be classified into the characteristics of the performers or the type of sexual activity on which it concentrates and not necessarily on the [[Niche market|market]] to which each subgenre appeals. The subgenres usually conform to certain [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], and each may appeal to a particular audience.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of erotic depictions|Stag film}}\n\n===Early years: 20th century===\n[[File:Johann Schwarzer movies about 1906.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Images from early Austrian erotic movies (about 1906, first image showing ''[[Am Sklavenmarkt]]'') by photographer [[Johann Schwarzer]] and his Saturn Film company]]\nProduction of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYxFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA454 |title=My Ladyboy Date: Give love a chance |first=Heinz |last=Duthel |publisher=BoD \u2013 Books on Demand |date=3 January 2018 |page=454 |isbn=9783746064253}}</ref> Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen [[Eug\u00e8ne Pirou]] and [[Albert Kirchner]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailydot.com/irl/history-of-porn/ |title=A brief and incredible history of porn |first=Lyz |last=Lenz |date=17 October 2016 |access-date=30 December 2018 |work=[[Daily Dot]] |publisher=[[Complex Media, Inc.]]}}</ref> Kirchner (under the name \"L\u00e9ar\") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou.

[[Johann Schwarzer]] formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at those screenings. Before Schwarzer's productions, erotic films were provided by the [[Path\u00e9]] brothers from French produced sources. In 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities which destroyed all the films they could find,<ref>Michael Achenbach, Paolo Caneppele, Ernst Kieninger: ''Projektionen der Sehnsucht: Saturn, die erotischen Anf\u00e4nge der \u00f6sterreichischen Kinematografie''. Filmarchiv Austria, Wien 2000, {{ISBN|3-901932-04-6}}.</ref> though some have since resurfaced from private collections. There were a number of American films in the 1910s which contained female [[nudity in film]].\n\nBecause Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In ''[[Black and White and Blue]]'' (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of [[Buenos Aires]] and other South American cities by the turn of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years. However, none of these earliest pornographic films are known to have survived. According to Patrick Robertson's ''Film Facts'', \"the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is '''A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge'''\" made in France in 1908. The plot depicts a weary soldier who has a tryst with a servant girl at an inn. The [[Argentinian]] ''[[El Satario]]'', whose original title could have been ''El S\u00e1tiro'' (''The Satyr''), might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-6671-2010-12-05.html|title=P\u00e1gina/12 :: radar|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> He also notes that \"the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film ''[[Am Abend]]'' (1910) is a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and [[anal penetration]].\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Patrick |date=December 2001 |title=Film Facts |publisher=Billboard Books |isbn=978-0-8230-7943-8 |page=256}}</ref>\n\n===1920s\u20131940s suppression===\nPornographic movies were widespread in the [[silent movie]] era of the 1920s, and were often shown in [[brothel]]s. Soon illegal, [[stag films]], or [[erotic films|blue films]], as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their [[bathtub]]s to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesmen, but anyone caught viewing or possessing them risked a prison sentence.<ref name=history>{{cite video |people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, Dean Kuipers (Cast) |date=7 March 2006 |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |medium=DVD |location=Port Washington, NY |publisher=Koch Vision |accessdate=21 October 2006 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=22 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |date=29 March 2005 |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html |title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic |work=Time Magazine |publisher=Time inc |accessdate=16 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n===1950s: home movies ===\nThe post-war era saw technological developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market and amateur film-making, particularly the introduction of the [[8 mm film|8 mm]] and [[super 8 mm film|super-8]] film gauges, popular for the home movie market.\n\nEntrepreneurs emerged to meet the demand. In Britain, in the 1950s, [[Harrison Marks]] produced films which were considered risqu\u00e9, and which today would be described as \"soft core\". In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films for the 8&nbsp;mm market of his models undressing and posing topless, popularly known as \"glamour home movies\". To Marks, the term \"glamour\" was a euphemism for nude modeling/photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/bbcwords/glamour-new.html|title=Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1960s: Europe and United States===\nOn the European continent, sex films were more explicit. Starting in 1961, [[Lasse Braun]] was a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Braun was able to accumulate funds for his lavish productions from the profit gained with so-called loops, ten-minute [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] movies which he sold to [[Reuben Sturman]], who distributed them to 60,000 American [[peep show]] booths.<ref>Eric Schlosser, ''Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market'' (Houghton Mifflin Books, 2004), p. 143.</ref> Braun was always on the move, and made his hardcore movies in a number of countries, including Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nIn December 1960, American female director [[Doris Wishman]] began producing a series of eight [[pornographic]] films, or [[nudist]] films without sex scenes, including ''[[Hideout in the Sun]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053908/|title=Hideout in the Sun|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1960), ''[[Nude on the Moon]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056293/|title=Nude on the Moon|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1961) and ''[[Diary of a Nudist]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054809/|title=Diary of a Nudist|date=27 December 1961|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> (1961). She also produced a series of [[sexploitation]] films.\n\nIn the 1960s, social and judicial attitudes towards the explicit depiction of sexuality began to change. For example, Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' (1967) included numerous frank nude scenes and simulated [[sexual intercourse]]. In one particularly controversial scene, Lena kisses her lover's flaccid [[human penis|penis]]. The film was exhibited in mainstream cinemas, but in 1969 it was banned in [[Massachusetts]] allegedly for being [[pornography|pornographic]]. The ban was challenged in the courts, with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ultimately declaring that the film was not obscene,<ref>''Byrne v. Karalexis'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/396/976/case.html 396 U.S. 976 (1969)] and [http://supreme.justia.com/us/401/216/case.html 401 U.S. 216 (1971)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/31|title=Film International - Thinking Film Since 1973|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> paving the way for other sexually explicit films. Another Swedish film ''[[Language of Love]]'' (1969) was also sexually explicit, but was framed as a quasi-documentary sex [[educational film]], which made its legal status uncertain though controversial.\n\nIn 1969, [[Denmark]] became the first country to abolish all censorship laws, enabling pornography, including hardcore pornography. The example was followed by toleration in the [[Netherlands]], also in 1969. There was an explosion of pornography commercially produced in those countries, including, at the very beginning, [[child pornography]] and [[bestiality]] porn. Now that being a pornographer was legal, there was no shortage of businessmen who invested in plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, needed to be smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold \"under the counter\" or (sometimes) shown in \"members only\" cinema clubs.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn the [[United States]], producers of pornographic films formed the [[Adult Film Association of America]] in 1969, after the release of ''[[Blue Movie]]'' by [[Andy Warhol]], to fight against [[censorship]], and to defend the industry against [[obscenity]] charges.<ref name=\"afw0187\">\"10th Annual Erotic Awards,\" ''Adam Film World'', January 1987, p. 7</ref>\n\n===1970s: adult theaters and movie booths in the United States ===\nIn the 1970s, there was a more tolerant judicial attitude to non-mainstream films. However, mainstream theatres would normally not screen even softcore films, leading to a rise of [[adult theater]]s in the [[United States]] and many other countries. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated \"movie booths\" in [[sex shop]]s that displayed pornographic \"loops\" (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).\n\nDenmark started producing comparatively big-budget theatrical feature film sex comedies such as ''[[Bordellet]]'' (1972), the [[Bedside-films|''Bedside''-films]] (1970\u20131976) and the [[Zodiac-films|''Zodiac''-films]] (1973\u20131978), starring mainstream actors (a few of whom even performed their own sex scenes) and usually not thought of as \"porno films\" though all except the early ''Bedside''-films included hardcore pornographic scenes. Several of these films still rank among the most seen films in Danish film history<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.dk/solgtebilletter.php|title=Scope > Flest solgte billetter|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> and all remain favourites on [[home video]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekkofilm.dk/?allowbreak=false&id=472 |title=Sengekant (inkl. en uges skiferie) |language=Danish |work=Ekko.dk |accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, ''[[Blue Movie]]'' by [[Andy Warhol]] was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"NYT-19690722\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"WS-2002-2005\">{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |work=WarholStars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-19690810\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

California]]'' (1973). The case established that [[obscenity]] was not legally protected, but the case also established the [[Miller test]], a three-pronged test to determine obscenity (which is not legal) as opposed to [[indecency]] (which may or may not be legal).\n\n===1980s: new technology and new legal cases===\nWith the arrival of the home [[video cassette recorder]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pornographic movie industry experienced massive growth and spawned adult stars like [[Traci Lords]], [[Seka (actress)|Seka]], [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Christy Canyon]], [[Ginger Lynn]], [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]] and directors such as [[Gregory Dark]]. By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of [[videotape]]. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because videotape produced a different image quality. However, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits, since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realized that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's homes. This was the end of the age of big-budget productions; the mainstreaming of pornography had begun. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover nearly every fetish possible, since the production of pornography was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands were now being made, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.<ref name=history/><ref name=time/> One could now not only watch pornography in the comfort and privacy of one's own home, but also find more choices available to satisfy specific fantasies and fetishes.\n\nSimilarly, the [[camcorder]] spurred changes in pornography in the 1980s, when people could make their own amateur sex movies, whether for private use, or for wider distribution.\n\nThe year 1987 saw an important legal case in the U.S. when the ''[[de facto]]'' result of [[California v. Freeman]] was the legalization of [[hardcore pornography]]. The prosecution of Harold Freeman was initially planned as the first in a series of legal cases to effectively outlaw the production of such movies.<ref>bluefilm</ref>\n\n===1990s: DVD and the Internet age===\nIn the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on [[DVD]]. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format ([[videotape]]) and allowed innovations such as \"interactive\" videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.\n\nThe introduction and widespread availability of the [[Internet]] further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously, videos would be ordered from an adult bookstore, or through mail-order; but, with the Internet, people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).\n\nPornography can be distributed over the Internet in a number of ways, including [[paysite]]s, [[video hosting service]]s, and [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]]. While pornography had been traded electronically since the 1980s, it was in the invention of the [[World Wide Web]] in 1991 as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time that led to an explosion in online pornography.\n\n[[File:Kim Kardashian West 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|American television personality [[Kim Kardashian]] rose to fame following the release of the pornographic film ''[[Kim Kardashian, Superstar]]'' in 2007, in which she had [[sexual intercourse]] with American singer [[Ray J]].]]\n\n[[Viv Thomas]], [[Paul Thomas (pornographic actor)|Paul Thomas]], [[Andrew Blake (director)|Andrew Blake]], [[Antonio Adamo]], and [[Rocco Siffredi]] were prominent directors of pornographic films in the 1990s. In 1998, the [[Denmark|Danish]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated film production company [[Zentropa]] became the world's first mainstream film company to openly produce [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] pornographic films, starting with ''[[Constance (1998 film)|Constance]]'' (1998). That same year, Zentropa also produced ''[[Idioterne]]'' (1998), directed by [[Lars von Trier]], which won many international awards and was nominated for a [[Golden Palm]] in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). ''Idioterne'' started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as [[Catherine Breillat]]'s ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'', which starred pornstar [[Rocco Siffredi]].\n\nIn 1999, the Danish TV channel [[Kanal K\u00f8benhavn]] started broadcasting hardcore films at night, uncoded and freely available to any viewer in the [[Copenhagen]] area (as of 2009, this is still the case, courtesy of [[Innocent Pictures]], a company started by Zentropa).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanalkobenhavn.dk/6_erotik.html|title=Kanal K\u00f8benhavn - Erotik og Kontakt|date=28 December 2013|accessdate=18 August 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228194319/http://www.kanalkobenhavn.dk/6_erotik.html|archivedate=28 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOnce people could watch adult movies in the privacy of their own homes, a new adult market developed that far exceeded the scope of its theater-centric predecessor. More recently, the Internet has served as catalyst for creating a still-larger market for porn, a market that is even less traditionally theatrical.\n\nBy the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. Of late, webcams and webcam recordings are again expanding the market. Thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers' demand.\n\n=== 2000s: competition and contraction ===\nBy the 2000s, the fortunes of the pornography industry had changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by [[streaming media]] delivery over the [[Internet]], competition from bootleg, amateur and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size.<ref name=theroux-guardian-jun2012/>\n\n==Pornographic film industry==\n{{see also|Sex industry}}\n\n===Economics===\nGlobally, pornography is a large scale business with revenues of nearly $100 billion<ref name=2013Industry>{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Chris|title=After rough 2013, porn studios look for a better year \u2013 \"Globally, porn is a $97 billion industry, according to Kassia Wosick, assistant professor of sociology at New Mexico State University.

Traditionally, the audience of pornographic films has been predominantly the straight male. In this situation, the main male actor acted as proxy for the viewer enacting the sexual fantasy of the genre of the film. A typical pornographic film featured a female performer on whom the film focused. Her male partner traditionally had no distinctive features other than a large penis. However, there has been an increase in female viewers over time, and there have recently been efforts to increase the [[sexualization]] of male performers also. New features such as men with smaller penises, charming facial features and well-built bodies are becoming predominant in pornographic films, as well as the emergence of [[feminist pornography]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/22/porn-women \"'Porn made for women, by women\"] May, Catalina.

Huffington Post, 4 March 2013. Accessed 11 October 2013</ref> In recent times a gay audience has also developed, and the scenarios of the films have adjusted accordingly.\n\nPornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create that fantasy. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres. In general, pornographic films follow a number of conventions. For example, irrespective of the genre, most actors are required to appear nude in pornographic films.\n\nIn films directed to a heterosexual male audience, the primary focus is on the female actors in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance. The female actors are commonly presented in erotic, provocative or suggestive clothing. If they are wearing shoes, they are usually high-heel. They do not normally wear jewellery or glasses. They are usually in the high range of [[physical attractiveness]].\n\nMost male performers in heterosexual pornography are selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess. They are presented as being able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies.\n\n===Legal status===\n{{Main|List of pornography laws by region}}\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held in 1969 that State laws making mere private possession of obscene material a crime are invalid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=394&invol=557|title=STANLEY v. GEORGIA|work=Findlaw|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> Further attempts were made in the 1970s in the United States to close down the pornography industry, this time by prosecuting those in the industry on [[prostitution]] charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of ''[[People v. Freeman]]''. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely ''portraying'' a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]] making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.<ref name=\"cbsnews2003\"/><ref>But see news.com.au: [http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/coffee-shop-girls-face-charges-over-sex-shows/story-e6frfq80-1225827686559 Coffee shop girls face charges over sex shows] February 08, 2010</ref>\n\nAt present, no other state in the United States has either implemented or accepted this legal distinction between commercial pornography performers versus prostitutes as shown in the Florida case where sex film maker Clinton Raymond McCowen, aka \"Ray Guhn\", was indicted on charges of \"soliciting and engaging in prostitution\" for his creation of pornography films which included \"McCowen and his associates recruited up to 100 local men and women to participate in group sex scenes, the affidavit says.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=15700 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209182130/http://www.xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=15700 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |title=Webmaster Ray Guhn Arrested in Florida |accessdate=June 26, 2006 |website=xbiz.com }}</ref> The distinction that California has in its legal determination in the Freeman decision is usually denied in most states' local prostitution laws, which do not specifically exclude performers from such inclusion.\n\nIn some cases, some states have ratified their local state laws for inclusion to prevent California's Freeman decision to be applied to actors who are paid a fee for sexual actions within their state borders. One example is the state of Texas whose prostitution law specifically states:\n\n:An offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or pay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a person to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.43.htm |title=Texas Penal Code, Chapter 43: Public Indecency |accessdate=April 18, 2007 |publisher=Texas Legislature}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, federal law prohibits the sale, distribution or dissemination of obscene materials through the mail, over the broadcast airwaves, on cable or satellite TV, on the Internet, over the telephone or by any other means that cross state lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-71 |title=18 USC Chapter 71 - OBSCENITY &#124; Title 18 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure &#124; U.S. Code &#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2013-05-06}}</ref> Most states also have specific laws banning the sale or distribution of obscene pornography within state borders. The only protection for obscene material recognized by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is personal possession in the home [[Stanley v. Georgia]].\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States]] affirmed in [[Miller v. California]] that obscenity was not protected speech. Further, the court ruled that each community is responsible for setting its own standards about what is considered to be obscene material. If pornographic material is prosecuted and brought to trial, a jury can deem it obscene based on:\n# whether \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n# whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law and\n# whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nIn many countries pornography is legal to distribute and to produce, but there are some restrictions. Pornography is also banned in some countries, in particular in the [[Muslim world]] and [[China]], but can be accessed through the Internet in some of these nations.\n\n=== Health issues ===\nSex acts in pornographic films have traditionally been performed without the use of [[condom]]s, with an accompanying risk of [[sexually transmitted disease]] among performers. In 1986, there was an outbreak of [[HIV]] infection which led to the deaths through [[AIDS]] of several actors and actresses. This led to the creation in 1998 of the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]], which helped set up a monitoring system in the U.S. pornographic film industry, which required pornographic film actors to be tested for HIV every 30 days.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Basten |first1=Fred |last2=Holmes |first2=Laurie |last3=Holmes |first3=John C. |title=Porn King: The John Holmes Story|year=1998|publisher=John Holmes Inc|isbn=978-1-880047-69-9}}</ref> {{As of|2013}}, HIV infection of performers in the U.S. pornography industry has been rare, with only a few outbreaks being recorded over the subsequent three decades.
