It is a member of the [[New World vulture]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Cathartidae]]. This vulture lives predominantly in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern [[Mexico]] to northern [[Argentina]]. It is the only surviving member of the genus '''''Sarcoramphus''''', although fossil members are known.\n\nLarge and predominantly white, the king vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail [[feather]]s. The head and neck are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy [[Wattle (anatomy)|caruncle]] on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures have been known to live for up to 30 years in captivity.\n\nKing vultures were popular figures in the [[Mayan codices]] as well as in local folklore and medicine. Although currently listed as [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]], they are decreasing in number, due primarily to [[habitat loss]].\n\n== Etymology, taxonomy and systematics ==\nThe king vulture was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' as ''Vultur papa'',<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The Kern vulture (''Sarcoramphus kernense''), lived in southwestern [[North America]] during the mid-[[Pliocene]] ([[Piacenzian]]), some 3.5\u20132.5 million years ago). It was a little-known component of the [[Blancan]]/[[Delmontian]] [[faunal stage]]s. The only material is a broken [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] [[humerus]] [[fossil]], found at [[Pozo Creek]], [[Kern County, California]]. As per [[Loye H. Miller]]'s original description, \"[c]ompared with [''S. papa''] the [[type (biology)|type]] conforms in general form and curvature except for its greater size and robustness.\"<ref name = miller1931/> The large span in time between the existence of the two species suggests that the Kern vulture might be distinct, but as the fossil is somewhat damaged and rather non-diagnostic, even assignment to this genus is not completely certain.<ref name=Fisher44/> During the [[Late Pleistocene]], another species probably assignable to the genus, ''Sarcoramphus fisheri'', occurred in [[Peru]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilbur | first = Sanford | title = Vulture Biology and Management | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1983 |page=12| isbn = 0-520-04755-9 }}</ref> A supposed king vulture relative from [[Quaternary]] cave deposits on [[Cuba]] turned out to be bones of the [[eagle]]-sized [[hawk]] ''[[Buteogallus borrasi]]'' (formerly in ''Titanohierax'').<ref name=suarez/>\n\nLittle can be said of the [[evolution]]ary history of the genus, mainly because remains of other [[Neogene]] New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The [[teratorn]]s held sway over the [[ecological niche]] of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the [[Great American Interchange]], and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in [[Central America]].<ref name = miller1931 /> The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the ''S. fisheri \u2013 S. papa'' lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 [[mya (unit)|mya]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilbur | first = Sanford | title = Vulture Biology and Management | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1983 |page=6| isbn = 0-520-04755-9 }}</ref>\n\n=== Bartram's \"painted vulture\" ===\n[[File:Sarcorhamphus sacer Albin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eleazar Albin]]'s 1734 drawing which has sometimes been identified as a \"painted vulture\"]] \nA \"'''painted vulture'''\" (\"'''''Sarcoramphus sacra'''''\" or \"'''''S. papa sacra'''''\") is described in [[William Bartram]]'s notes of his travels in [[Florida]] during the 1770s.

Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking.

It is a member of the [[New World vulture]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Cathartidae]]. This vulture lives predominantly in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern [[Mexico]] to northern [[Argentina]]. It is the only surviving member of the genus '''''Sarcoramphus''''', although fossil members are known.\n\nLarge and predominantly white, the king vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail [[feather]]s. The head and neck are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy [[Wattle (anatomy)|caruncle]] on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures have been known to live for up to 30 years in captivity.\n\nKing vultures were popular figures in the [[Mayan codices]] as well as in local folklore and medicine. Although currently listed as [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]], they are decreasing in number, due primarily to [[habitat loss]].\n\n== Etymology, taxonomy and systematics ==\nThe king vulture was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' as ''Vultur papa'',<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The Kern vulture (''Sarcoramphus kernense''), lived in southwestern [[North America]] during the mid-[[Pliocene]] ([[Piacenzian]]), some 3.5\u20132.5 million years ago). It was a little-known component of the [[Blancan]]/[[Delmontian]] [[faunal stage]]s. The only material is a broken [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] [[humerus]] [[fossil]], found at [[Pozo Creek]], [[Kern County, California]]. As per [[Loye H. Miller]]'s original description, \"[c]ompared with [''S. papa''] the [[type (biology)|type]] conforms in general form and curvature except for its greater size and robustness.\"<ref name = miller1931/> The large span in time between the existence of the two species suggests that the Kern vulture might be distinct, but as the fossil is somewhat damaged and rather non-diagnostic, even assignment to this genus is not completely certain.<ref name=Fisher44/> During the [[Late Pleistocene]], another species probably assignable to the genus, ''Sarcoramphus fisheri'', occurred in [[Peru]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilbur | first = Sanford | title = Vulture Biology and Management | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1983 |page=12| isbn = 0-520-04755-9 }}</ref> A supposed king vulture relative from [[Quaternary]] cave deposits on [[Cuba]] turned out to be bones of the [[eagle]]-sized [[hawk]] ''[[Buteogallus borrasi]]'' (formerly in ''Titanohierax'').<ref name=suarez/>\n\nLittle can be said of the [[evolution]]ary history of the genus, mainly because remains of other [[Neogene]] New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The [[teratorn]]s held sway over the [[ecological niche]] of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the [[Great American Interchange]], and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in [[Central America]].<ref name = miller1931 /> The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the ''S. fisheri \u2013 S. papa'' lineage.

Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking.

{"title_page": "Geometallurgy", "text_new": "'''Geometallurgy''' relates to the practice of combining [[geology]] or [[geostatistics]]  with [[metallurgy]], or, more specifically, [[extractive metallurgy]], to create a spatially  or geologically based predictive model for [[mineral processing]] plants.  It is used in the hard rock [[mining]] industry for risk management and mitigation during mineral processing plant design.  It is also used, to a lesser extent, for [[production planning]] in more variable ore deposits.\n\nThere are four important components or steps to developing a geometallurgical program,:<ref>Bulled, D., and McInnes, C:  Flotation plant design and production planning through geometallurgical modeling.  Centenary of Flotation Symposium, Brisbane, QLD, 6-9.  June 2005.</ref>\n\n*the geologically informed selection of a number of ore samples\n*laboratory-scale test work to determine the ore's response to mineral processing [[unit operation]]s\n*the distribution of these parameters throughout the orebody using an accepted geostatistical technique\n*the application of a mining sequence plan and mineral processing models to generate a prediction of the process plant behavior\n\n==Sample selection==\n\nThe sample mass and size distribution requirements are dictated by the kind of mathematical model that will be used to simulate the process plant, and the test work required to provide the appropriate model parameters.  Flotation testing usually requires several kg of sample and grinding/hardness testing can required between 2 and 300&nbsp;kg.<ref>McKen, A., and Williams, S.:  An overview of the small-scale tests required to characterize ore grindability. International Autogenous and Semi-Autogenous Grinding Technology 2006, Vancouver, Canada, 2006</ref>\n\nThe sample selection procedure is performed to optimize [[granularity]], sample support, and cost.  Samples are usually [[core sample]]s composited over the height of the mining bench.<ref>Amelunxen, P. et al:  Use of geostatistics to generate an orebody hardness dataset and to quantify the relationship between sample spacing and the precision of the throughput estimate.  Autogenous and Semi-Autogenous Grinding Technology 2001, Vancouver, Canada, 2006</ref>  For hardness parameters, the [[variogram]] often increases rapidly near the origin and can reach the sill at distances significantly smaller than the typical drill hole collar spacing.  For this reason the incremental model precision due to additional test work is often simply a consequence of the [[central limit theorem]], and secondary correlations are sought to increase the precision without incurring additional sampling and testing costs.  These secondary correlations can involve multi-variable [[regression analysis]] with other, non-metallurgical, ore parameters and/or domaining by rock type, lithology, alteration, [[mineralogy]], or structural domains.<ref>Amelunxen, P.:  The application of the SAG Power Index to ore body hardness characterization for the design and optimization of comminution circuits, M.

For this reason the incremental model precision due to additional test work is often simply a consequence of the [[central limit theorem]], and secondary correlations are sought to increase the precision without incurring additional sampling and testing costs.  These secondary correlations can involve multi-variable [[regression analysis]] with other, non-metallurgical, ore parameters and/or domaining by rock type, lithology, alteration, [[mineralogy]], or structural domains.<ref>Amelunxen, P.:  The application of the SAG Power Index to ore body hardness characterization for the design and optimization of comminution circuits, M.

It was discovered by [[Oyo Mitsunobu]] (1934\u20132003). Typical protocol is to add the phosphine and azodicarboxylate together at -10C, typically in THF of toluene, until a white precipitate forms. This white, cloudy suspension is the ylide.  Then a solution of the nucleophile and alcohol are added together and reaction can, and in many cases is, heated to reflux. The alcohol reacts with the phosphine to create a good leaving group then undergoes an [[walden inversion|inversion]] of [[stereochemistry]] in classic SN2 fashion as the nucleophile displaces it. A common side-product (or byproduct) is produced when the azodicarboxylate displaces the leaving group instead of the desired nucleophile. This happens if the nucleophile is not acidic enough (less than 13 pKa) or is not nucleophilic enough due to steric or electronic constraints. A variation of this reaction utilizing a nitrogen nucleophile is known as a Fukuyama-Mitsunobu. \n\n[[Image:Mitsunobu-Reaction V.1.svg|center|450px|The Mitsunobu reaction]]\n\nSeveral reviews have been published.<ref>{{ cite journal | last1 = Mitsunobu | first1 = O. | title = The Use of Diethyl Azodicarboxylate and Triphenylphosphine in Synthesis and Transformation of Natural Products | journal = Synthesis | year = 1981 | volume = 1981 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201328 | doi = 10.1055/s-1981-29317 }}</ref><ref>{{ Cite book | author = Castro, B.

The identity of intermediates and the roles they play has been the subject of debate.\n\nInitially, the triphenyl phosphine ('''2''') makes a nucleophilic attack upon diethyl azodicarboxylate ('''1''') producing a betaine intermediate '''3''', which deprotonates the carboxylic acid ('''4''') to form the ion pair '''5'''. DEAD itself deprotonates the alcohol ('''6''') forming an alkoxide that can form the key oxyphosphonium ion '''8'''. The ratio and interconversion of intermediates '''8'''\u2013'''11''' depend on the carboxylic acid pKa and the solvent polarity.<ref>{{ cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00388a110 | title = Mechanism of the triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate induced dehydration reactions (Mitsunobu reaction).

The formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediate '''8''' is slow and facilitated by the alkoxide. Therefore, the overall rate of reaction is controlled by carboxylate basicity and solvation.<ref>{{ cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00227a032 | title = A mechanistic study of the Mitsunobu esterification reaction | year = 1988 | last1 = Hughes | first1 = D.

Typically, one dissolves the alcohol, the carboxylic acid, and triphenylphosphine in [[tetrahydrofuran]] or other suitable solvent (e.g. [[diethyl ether]]), cool to 0&nbsp;\u00b0C using an ice-bath, slowly add the DEAD dissolved in THF, then stir at room temperature for several hours. If this is unsuccessful, then preforming the betaine may give better results. To preform the betaine, add DEAD to triphenylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, followed by the addition of the alcohol and finally the acid.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Volante, R.  | journal = [[Tetrahedron Letters]] | year = 1981 | volume = 22 | pages = 3119\u20133122 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(01)81842-6 | title = A new, highly efficient method for the conversion of alcohols to thiolesters and thiols | issue = 33 }}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Other nucleophilic functional groups===\nMany other functional groups can serve as [[nucleophile]]s besides [[carboxylic acid]]s.

It was discovered by [[Oyo Mitsunobu]] (1934\u20132003). Typical protocol is to add the phosphine and azodicarboxylate together at -10C, typically in THF of toluene, until a white precipitate forms. This white, cloudy suspension is the ylide.  Then a solution of the nucleophile and alcohol are added together and reaction can, and in many cases is, heated to reflux. The alcohol reacts with the phosphine to create a good leaving group then undergoes an [[walden inversion|inversion]] of [[stereochemistry]] in classic SN2 fashion as the nucleophile displaces it. A common side-product (or byproduct) is produced when the azodicarboxylate displaces the leaving group instead of the desired nucleophile. This happens if the nucleophile is not acidic enough (less than 13 pKa) or is not nucleophilic enough due to steric or electronic constraints. A variation of this reaction utilizing a nitrogen nucleophile is known as a Fukuyama-Mitsunobu. \n\n[[Image:Mitsunobu-Reaction V.1.svg|center|450px|The Mitsunobu reaction]]\n\nSeveral reviews have been published.<ref>{{ cite journal | last1 = Mitsunobu | first1 = O. | title = The Use of Diethyl Azodicarboxylate and Triphenylphosphine in Synthesis and Transformation of Natural Products | journal = Synthesis | year = 1981 | volume = 1981 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201328 | doi = 10.1055/s-1981-29317 }}</ref><ref>{{ Cite book | author = Castro, B.

The identity of intermediates and the roles they play has been the subject of debate.\n\nInitially, the triphenyl phosphine ('''2''') makes a nucleophilic attack upon diethyl azodicarboxylate ('''1''') producing a betaine intermediate '''3''', which deprotonates the carboxylic acid ('''4''') to form the ion pair '''5'''. DEAD itself deprotonates the alcohol ('''6''') forming an alkoxide that can form the key oxyphosphonium ion '''8'''. The ratio and interconversion of intermediates '''8'''\u2013'''11''' depend on the carboxylic acid pKa and the solvent polarity.<ref>{{ cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00388a110 | title = Mechanism of the triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate induced dehydration reactions (Mitsunobu reaction).

Completed in approximately 1657\u201359, the painting is on display at the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden|Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]] in [[Dresden]]. For many years, the attribution of the painting\u2014which features a young Dutch woman reading a letter before an open window\u2014was lost, with first [[Rembrandt]] and then [[Pieter de Hooch]] being credited for the work before it was properly identified in 1880. After [[World War II]], the painting was briefly in possession of the Soviet Union.\nApparently well-preserved, the painting may have been altered after the painter's death.\n\n==Composition==\nThe painting depicts a young Dutch blonde girl standing at an open window, in profile, reading a letter. A red drapery hangs over the top of the window glass, which has opened inward and which, in its lower right quadrant, reflects her. A tasseled [[ochre]] drapery in the foreground right, partially closed, masks a quarter of the room in which she stands. The color of the drape reflects the green of the woman's gown and the shades of the fruit tilted in a bowl on the red-draped table.

Dresden|Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]]\n}}\n'''''Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] painter [[Johannes Vermeer]]. Completed in approximately 1657\u201359, the painting is on display at the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden|Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]] in [[Dresden]]. For many years, the attribution of the painting\u2014which features a young Dutch woman reading a letter before an open window\u2014was lost, with first [[Rembrandt]] and then [[Pieter de Hooch]] being credited for the work before it was properly identified in 1880. After [[World War II]], the painting was briefly in possession of the Soviet Union.\nApparently well-preserved, the painting may have been altered after the painter's death.\n\n==Composition==\nThe painting depicts a young Dutch blonde girl standing at an open window, in profile, reading a letter. A red drapery hangs over the top of the window glass, which has opened inward and which, in its lower right quadrant, reflects her. A tasseled [[ochre]] drapery in the foreground right, partially closed, masks a quarter of the room in which she stands. The color of the drape reflects the green of the woman's gown and the shades of the fruit tilted in a bowl on the red-draped table. On the table beside the bowl, a peach is cut in half, revealing its pit.\n\n==Symbolism and technique==\nIn ''Vermeer, 1632\u20131675'' (2000), Norbert Schneider indicates that the open window is on one level intended to represent \"the woman's longing to extend her [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]\" beyond the constraints of her home and society, while the fruit \"is a symbol of extramarital relations.\"<ref>Schneider (2000), p. 49.</ref> He concludes that the letter is a love letter either planning or continuing her illicit relationship.
