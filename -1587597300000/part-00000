This iteration is Korean-American but still has a similar portrayal to his comic book counterpart as a reporter for the ''Daily Bugle''. He is convinced that he can crack [[Spider-Man]]'s mystery identity, and that the Green Goblin is connected. [[J. Jonah Jameson]] thinks he's wasting his time and nearly hands the assignment to [[Frederick Foswell]], but [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] tells him to \"run with it\". When Venom outs Spider-Man's true identity, Ned interviews people that Peter Parker and Spider-Man both know, like [[Aunt May|May Parker]], the Connors family, [[Norman Osborn]], [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]], [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Eddie Brock]]. He eventually concludes that Peter cannot be Spider-Man, since Peter wore Spider-Man's costume unmasked on [[Halloween]] night, a risky move the real Spider-Man would not make and continues with his investigation.

At one point in the ride, he attacks guests with a pumpkin bomb that almost hits them, but stops thanks to the intervention of Spider-Man who attacks Hobgoblin and stops him from further hurting guests. During the climax, he and Scream grab onto Spider-Man (who was webbing onto guests) and sends them through the city, before he is defeated when the ride vehicle crashes into his glider.

The [[ancient Egypt]]ians had an elaborate set of '''funerary practices''' that they believed were necessary to ensure their immortality after death (the afterlife). These rituals and protocols included [[Mummy|mummifying the body]], casting [[magic spell]]s, and burial with specific grave goods thought to be needed in the [[Ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|Egyptian afterlife]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/index.html |title=Digital Egypt, Burial customs |access-date=2018-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015021042/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/index.html |archive-date=2014-10-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120322222734/https://web.olivet.edu/gradusers/hgerth/leeanne.htm ''Ancient Egyptian Mummies: A Web Quest for 4th-6th Grade (Social Studies)''], Lee Anne Brandt. Retrieved from the [[Wayback Machine]] internet archive on May 8, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptian burial process evolved over time as old customs were discarded and new ones adopted, but several important elements of the process persisted. Although specific details changed over time, the preparation of the body, the magic rituals, and grave goods were all essential parts of a proper Egyptian funeral.\n\nThere were many different gods to prepare for. The ancient Egyptians believed that each god would separately judge the deceased before he could enter the afterlife.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Egyptian mourners001.jpg|left|thumb|121px|[[Professional mourners]] in an eloquent gesture of [[Professional mourning|mourning]].]]\n\nAlthough no writing survives from [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic Egypt]], scholars believe the importance of the physical body and its preservation originated there. This would explain why people of that time did not follow the common practice of cremation but rather buried the dead. Some also believe they may have feared the bodies would rise again if mistreated after death.<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Roger Lichtenberg, Mummies and Death in Egypt, (London: [[Cornell University|Cornell University Press]], 2006), p. 9</ref>\n\nEarly bodies were buried in simple, shallow oval pits, with a few burial goods. Sometimes multiple people and animals were placed in the same grave. Over time, graves became more complex, with the body placed in a wicker basket, then later in wooden or [[terracotta]] coffins. The latest tombs Egyptians made were sarcophagi. These graves contained burial goods like jewelry, food, games and sharpened splint.<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Dunand and Roger Lichtenberg, Mummies and Death in Egypt, (London: Cornell University Press, 2006), p. 7</ref>\n\nThis demonstrates that this ancient period had a sense of the afterlife, though archaeological evidence may show the average person had little chance of getting into it. This may be because admission required that the deceased must be able to serve a purpose there. The [[pharaoh]] was allowed in because of his role in life, and others needed to have some role there.\n\n[[Ancient Egyptian retainer sacrifices|Human sacrifice]]s found in early royal tombs reinforce this view. Those sacrificed were probably meant to serve the pharaoh in his afterlife. Eventually, [[Ushabti|figurines]] and wall paintings begin to replace human victims.<ref>Sergio Donadoni, ''The Egyptians'', (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997) p. 262</ref> Some of these figurines may have been created to resemble certain people, so they could follow the pharaoh after their lives ended.\n\nNote that not only the [[Social class|lower classes]] had to rely on the pharaoh's favor, but also the noble classes. They believed that when he died, the pharaoh became some sort of god, who could bestow upon certain individuals the ability to have an afterlife. This belief existed from the predynastic period through the [[Old Kingdom]].\n\nAlthough many spells from the predeceasing texts were carried over, the new coffin texts also had additional new spells added, along with slight changes made to make this new [[funerary text]] more relatable to the nobility.<ref name=\" Erik Hornung\"/> In the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], however, the importance of the pharaoh declined. Funerary texts, previously restricted to royal use, became more widely available. The pharaoh was no longer a [[god-king]] in the sense that only he was allowed in the next life due to his status here, now he was merely the ruler of the population who upon his death would be leveled down towards the plane of the mortals.<ref>John A. Wilson, The Culture of Ancient Egypt, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965), p. 116.</ref>\n\n===Prehistory, earliest burials===\nThe first funerals in Egypt are known from the villages of Omari and [[Maadi]] in the north, near present-day [[Cairo]]. The people of these villages buried their dead in a simple, round grave with a pot. The body was neither treated nor arranged in a regular way as would be the case later in the historical period. Without any written evidence, there is little to provide information about contemporary beliefs concerning the afterlife except for the regular inclusion of a single pot in the grave. Given later customs, the pot was probably intended to hold food for the deceased.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=71}}</ref>\n\n===Predynastic period, development of customs===\nFunerary customs were developed during the [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic period]] from those of the Prehistoric Period. At first, people excavated round graves with one pot in the [[Badari culture|Badarian Period]] (4400-3800 B.C.E.), continuing the tradition of Omari and Maadi cultures. By the end of the Predynastic period, there were increasing numbers of objects deposited with the body in rectangular graves, and there is growing evidence of rituals practiced by Egyptians of the [[Naqada culture|Naquada II Period]] (3650-3300 B.C.E). At this point, bodies were regularly arranged in a crouched or fetal position with the face toward either the east the rising sun or the west (which in this historical period was the land of the dead). Artists painted jars with funeral processions and perhaps ritual dancing. Figures of bare-breasted women with birdlike faces and their legs concealed under skirts also appeared in some graves. Some graves were much richer in goods than others, demonstrating the beginnings of social stratification. Gender differences in burial emerged with the inclusion of weapons in men's graves and cosmetics palettes in women's graves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=71\u201372}}</ref>\n\nBy 3,600 BCE, Egyptians had begun to mummify the dead, wrapping them in linen bandages with embalming oils (conifer resin and aromatic plant extracts).<ref>[https://www.livescience.com/63351-mummy-older-than-pharaohs.html Mindy Seisberger, 'This Ancient Mummy Is Older Than the Pharaohs', Live Science, 16 August 2016]</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/08/news-egyptian-prehistoric-mummy-embalming-recipe/ Maya Wei-Haas,'Mummy yields earliest known Egyptian embalming recipe', National Geographic,15 August 2018] </ref>\n\n===Early Dynastic Period, tombs and coffins===\nBy the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], some Egyptians were wealthy enough to build tombs over their burials rather than placing their bodies in simple pit graves dug into the sand. The rectangular, mud-brick tomb with an underground burial chamber, called a [[mastaba]], developed in this period. These tombs had niched walls, a style of building called the palace-fa\u00e7ade motif because the walls imitated those surrounding the palace of the king. Since commoners as well as kings, however, had such tombs, the architecture suggests that in death, some wealthy people did achieve an elevated status. Later in the historical period, it is certain that the deceased was associated with the god of the dead, [[Osiris]].\n\nGrave goods expanded to include furniture, jewelry, and games as well as the weapons, cosmetic palettes, and food supplies in decorated jars known earlier, in the Predynastic period. Now, however, in the richest tombs, grave goods numbered in the thousands. Only the newly invented coffins for the body were made specifically for the tomb. There is also some inconclusive evidence for mummification. Other objects in the tombs that had been used during daily life suggest that Egyptians already in the First Dynasty anticipated needing in the next life. Further continuity from this life into the next can be found in the positioning of tombs: those persons who served the king during their lifetimes chose burials close to their lord. The use of [[stele|stela]] in front of the tomb began in the First Dynasty, indicating a desire to individualize the tomb with the deceased's name.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=72\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Old Kingdom, pyramids and mummification===\n[[File: Relief of Men Presenting Oxen, ca. 2500-2350 B.C.E. Limestone.jpg|thumbnail|right|'' Relief of Men Presenting Oxen'', ca. 2500\u20132350 B.C.E. Limestone. In this relief, three men bring cattle to the tomb owner, \"from the towns of the estate,\" as the inscription says. Two of these balding, rustic laborers wear kilts of coarse material and the other wears nothing at all. A fragmentary scene below shows men bringing cranes, which Egyptians penned and raised for food. Artisans carved images of live food animals in tombs to supply the deceased with an eternal source of provisions. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nIn the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], kings first built pyramids for their tombs surrounded by stone mastaba tombs for their high officials. The fact that most high officials were also royal relatives suggests another motivation for such placement: these complexes were also family cemeteries.\n\nAmong the elite, bodies were mummified, wrapped in linen bandages, sometimes covered with molded plaster, and placed in stone sarcophagi or plain wooden coffins. At the end of the Old Kingdom, mummy masks in [[cartonnage]] (linen soaked in plaster, modeled and painted) also appeared. Canopic containers now held their internal organs. Amulets of gold, [[Egyptian faience|faience]], and [[carnelian]] first appeared in various shapes to protect different parts of the body. There is also the first evidence of inscriptions inside the coffins of the elite during the Old Kingdom. Often, reliefs of everyday items were etched onto the walls supplemented grave goods, which made them available through their representation.\n\nThe new false door was a non-functioning stone sculpture of a door into the tomb, found either inside the chapel or on the outside of the mastaba; it served as a place to make offerings and recite prayers for the deceased. Statues of the deceased were now included in tombs and used for ritual purposes. Burial chambers of some private people received their first decorations in addition to the decoration of the chapels. At the end of the Old Kingdom, the burial chamber decorations depicted offerings, but not people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=74\u201377}}</ref>\n\n===First Intermediate Period, regional variation===\nThe political situation in the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], with many centers of power, is reflected in the many local styles of art and burial at this time. The many regional styles for decorating coffins make their origins easy to distinguish from each other. For example, some coffins have one-line inscriptions, and many styles include the depiction of ''Wadjet'' eyes (the human eye with the markings of a falcon). There are also regional variations in the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] used to decorate coffins.\n\nOccasionally men had tools and weapons in their graves, while some women had jewelry and cosmetic objects such as mirrors. Grindstones were sometimes included in women's tombs, perhaps to be considered a tool for food preparation in the next world, just as the weapons in men's tombs imply men's assignment to a role in fighting.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=77}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Kingdom, new tomb contents===\n[[File:Mask from a Coffin. Cartonnage,37.1387E.jpg|thumbnail|Mask from a coffin. Cartonnage, 37.1387E, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nBurial customs in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] reflect some of the political trends of this period. During the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]], tombs were cut into the mountains of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] surrounding the king's tomb or in local cemeteries in [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Middle Egypt]]; Thebes was the native city of the Eleventh Dynasty kings, and they preferred to be buried there. But the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]], high officials served the kings of a new family now ruling from the north in [[Lisht]]; these kings and their high officials preferred burial in a mastaba near the pyramids belonging to their masters. Moreover, the difference in topography between Thebes and Lisht led to a difference in tomb type: in the north, nobles build mastaba tombs on the flat desert plains, while in the south, local dignitaries continued to excavate tombs in the mountain.\n\nFor those of ranks lower than royal courtiers during the Eleventh Dynasty, tombs were simpler. Coffins could be simple wooden boxes with the body either mummified and wrapped in linen or simply wrapped without mummification, and the addition of a cartonnage mummy mask. Some tombs included wooded shoes and a simple statue near the body. In one burial there were only twelve loaves of bread, a leg of beef, and a jar of beer for food offerings. Jewelry could be included but only rarely were objects of great value found in non-elite graves. Some burials continued to include the [[Wooden tomb model|wooden models]] that were popular during the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]]. Wooden models of boats, scenes of food production, craftsmen and workshops, and professions such as scribes or soldiers have been found in the tombs of this period.\n\nSome rectangular coffins of the Twelfth Dynasty have short inscriptions and representations of the most important offerings the deceased required. For men, the objects depicted were weapons and symbols of office as well as food. Women's coffins depicted mirrors, sandals, and jars containing food and drink. Some coffins included texts that were later versions of the royal [[Pyramid Texts]].\n\nAnother kind of faience model of the deceased as a mummy seems to anticipate the use of ''[[shabti]]'' figurines (also called ''shawabti'' or an ''ushabti'') later in the Twelfth Dynasty. These early figurines do not have the text directing the figure to work in the place of the deceased that is found in later figurines. The richest people had stone figurines that seem to anticipate ''shabtis'', though some scholars have seen them as mummy substitutes rather than servant figures.\n\nIn the later Twelfth Dynasty, significant changes occurred in burials, perhaps reflecting administrative changes enacted by King [[Senusret III|Senwosret III]] (1836\u20131818 B.C.E.). The body was now regularly placed on its back, rather than its side as had been done for thousands of years. Coffin texts and wooden models disappeared from new tombs of the period while heart scarabs and figurines shaped like mummies were now often included in burials, as they would be for the remainder of Egyptian history. Coffin decoration was simplified. The [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] saw another change in decoration. Different motifs were found in the north and south, a reflection of decentralized government power at the time. There was also a marked increase in the number of burials in one tomb, a rare occurrence in earlier periods. The reuse of one tomb by a family over generations seems to have occurred when wealth was more equitably spread.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bleiberg |first1=Edward |author-link=Edward Bleiberg |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=77\u201386}}</ref>\n\n===Second Intermediate Period, foreigner burials===\nKnown graves from the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] reveal the presence of non-Egyptians buried in the country. In the north, graves associated with the [[Hyksos]], a western [[Semitic people]] ruling the north from the northeast delta, include small mud-brick structures containing the body, pottery vessels, a dagger in a men's graves and often a nearby donkey burial. Simple pan-shaped graves in various parts of the country are thought to belong to [[Nubia]]n soldiers. Such graves reflect very ancient customs and feature shallow, round pits, bodies contracted and minimal food offerings in pots. The occasional inclusion of identifiable Egyptian materials from the Second Intermediate Period provides the only marks distinguishing these burials from those of Predynastic and even earlier periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York|pages=86\u201389}}</ref>\n\n===New Kingdom, new object purposes===\n[[File:S10.08 Deir-El-Bahari, image 9932.jpg|thumbnail|Deir-El-Bahari]]\nThe majority of elite tombs in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] were rock-cut chambers. Kings were buried in multi-roomed, rock-cut tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]] and no longer in pyramids. Priests conducted funerary rituals for them in stone temples built on the west bank of the [[Nile]] opposite of Thebes. From the current evidence, the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] appears to be the last period in which Egyptians regularly included multiple objects from their daily lives in their tombs; beginning in the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], tombs contained fewer items from daily life and included objects made especially for the next world. Thus the change from the Eighteenth to the Nineteenth Dynasties formed a dividing line in burial traditions: The Eighteenth Dynasty more closely remembered the immediate past in its customs whereas the Nineteenth Dynasty anticipated the customs of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]].\n\n[[File: Tutankhamun's bed (Cairo Museum).jpg|thumb|Gilded bier fashioned to resemble the goddess [[Sekhmet]], the fierce protector of the kings in life and death, from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], Cairo Museum]] \nPeople of the elite ranks in the Eighteenth Dynasty placed furniture as well as clothing and other items in their tombs, objects they undoubtedly used during life on earth. Beds, headrests, chairs, stools, leather sandals, jewelry, musical instruments, and wooden storage chests were present in these tombs. While all of the objects listed were for the elite, many poor people did not put anything beyond weapons and cosmetics into their tombs.\n\nNo elite tombs survive unplundered from the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Ramesside period]]. In this period, artists decorated tombs belonging to the elite with more scene of religious events, rather than the everyday scene that had been popular since the Old Kingdom. The funeral itself, the funerary meal with multiple relatives, the worshipping of the gods, even figures in the underworld were subjects in elite tomb decorations. The majority of objects found in the Ramesside period tombs were made for the afterlife. Aside from the jewelry, which could have been used also during life, objects in Ramesside tombs were manufactured for the next world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York |pages=89\u2013100}}</ref>\n\n===Third Intermediate Period===\n[[File: Funerary Figurine of King Pinudjem I, ca. 1025-1007 B.C.E., 16.190.jpg|thumbnail|Shabties of King Pinudjem I, ca. 1025\u20131007 B.C.E., 16.190, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nAlthough the political structure of the New Kingdom collapsed at the end of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]], the majority of burials in the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]] directly reflect developments from the earlier period. At the beginning of this time, reliefs resembled those from the Ramesside period. Only at the very end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] did new funerary practices of the Late Period begin to be seen.\n\nLittle is known of tombs from this period. The very lack of decorations in tombs seems to have led to much more elaborate decoration of coffins. The remaining grave goods of the period show fairly cheaply made ''shabties'', even when the owner was a queen or a princess.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=100\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n===Late Period, monumentality and return to traditions===\nBurials in the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] could make use of large-scale, temple-like tombs built for the non-royal elite for the first time. But the majority of tombs in this period were in shafts sunk into the desert floor. In addition to fine statuary and reliefs reflecting the style of the Old Kingdom, the majority of grave goods were specially made for the tomb. Coffins continued to bear religious texts and scenes. Some shafts were personalized by the use of stela with the deceased prayers and name on it. ''Shabties'' in faience for all classes are known. Canopic jars, though often nonfunctional, continued to be included. Staves and scepters representing the deceased's office in life were often present as well. A figure of either the god Osiris or of the composite deity Ptah-Sokar-Osiris could be found, along with heart scarabs, both gold and faience examples of djed-columns, [[Eye of Horus]] amulets, figures of gods, and images of the deceased's ''ba''.

The front of the mummy was often painted with a selection of traditional Egyptian symbols. Mummy masks in either traditional Egyptian style or Roman style could be added to the mummies. Another possibility was a Roman-style mummy portrait, executed in [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] (pigment suspended in wax) on a wooden panel. Sometimes the feet of the mummy was covered. An alternative to this was a complete shroud with Egyptian motifs but a portrait in the Roman style.

The family and friends of the deceased had a choice of options that ranged in price for the preparation of the body, similar to the process at modern funeral homes. Next, the embalmers escorted the body to ''ibw'', translated to \u201cplace of purification,\u201d a tent in which the body was washed, and then ''per nefer'', \u201cthe House of Beauty,\u201d where mummification took place.<ref name=\":2\" />[[File:Bemalte Mumienbinde.JPG|thumb|left|Painted mummy bandage]]\n\n=== Mummification process ===\nIn order to live for all eternity and be presented in front of [[Osiris]], the body of the deceased had to be preserved by [[mummy|mummification]], so that the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|soul]] could reunite with it, and take pleasure in the afterlife. The main process of mummification was preserving the body by [[dehydrating]] it using [[natron]], a natural material found in [[Wadi Natrun]] which is like a combination of baking soda and salt. The body was drained of any liquids and left with the skin, hair and muscles preserved.<ref>Salima Ikram, Ancient Egypt, pp. 275\u2013282</ref>\n\n[[File:Seti I memmy head.png|thumb|Mummy of pharaoh [[Seti I]].]]The process of mummification was available for anyone who could afford it. It was believed that even those who could not afford this process could still enjoy the afterlife with the right reciting of spells. Mummification existed in three different processes, ranging from most expensive, moderately expensive, and most simplistic, or cheapest.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most classic, common, and most expensive method of mummification dates back to the [[18th Dynasty]]. The first step was to remove the internal organs and liquid so that the body would not decay. The embalmers took out the brain through a process named [[excerebration]] by inserting a metal hook through the nostril, breaking through it into the brain. They removed as much as they could with the hook, and the rest they liquefied with drugs and drained out.<ref name=\":2\" /> They threw out the brain because they thought that the heart did all the thinking. The next step was to remove the internal organs, the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines, and place them in [[canopic jars]] with lids shaped like the heads of the protective deities, the [[four sons of Horus]]: Imsety, Hapy, Duamutef, and Qebhseneuf. [[Imset]]y was human-headed, and guarded the liver; [[Hapi (Son of Horus)|Hapy]] was ape-headed, and guarded the lungs; [[Duamutef]] was jackal-headed, and guarded the stomach; [[Qebehsenuef|Qebhseneuf]] was hawk-headed, and guarded the small and large intestines.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-25|[25]]]</sup> Sometimes the four canopic jars were placed into a [[canopic chest]], and buried with the mummified body. A canopic chest resembled a \"miniature coffin\" and was intricately painted. The Ancient Egyptians believed that by burying the deceased with their organs, they may rejoin with them in the afterlife.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-26|[26]]]</sup> Other times, the organs were cleaned and cleansed, and then returned into the body.<ref name=\":2\" /> The body cavity was then rinsed and cleaned with wine and an array of spices. The body was sewn up with aromatic plants and spices left inside.<ref name=\":2\" /> The heart stayed in the body, because in the hall of judgment, it would be weighed against the feather of [[Ma'at]]. After the body was washed with wine, it was stuffed with bags of [[natron]]. The dehydration process took 40 days.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-27|[27]]]</sup>\n\nThe second part of the process took 30 days. This was the time where the deceased turned into a semi divine being, and all that was left in the body from the first part was removed, followed by applying first wine and then oils. The oils were for ritual purposes, as well as for preventing the limbs and bones from breaking while being wrapped. The body was sometimes colored with a golden resin, which protected the body from bacteria and insects. Additionally, this practice was based on the belief that divine beings had flesh of gold. Next, the body was wrapped in linen cut into strips with [[amulets]] while a priest recited prayers and burned [[incense]]. The linen was adhered to the body using gum, opposed to a glue.<ref name=\":2\" /> The dressing provided the body physical protection from the elements, and depending on how wealthy the deceased's family was, the deceased could be dressed with an ornamented funeral mask and shroud.<ref name=\":2\" /> Special care was given to the head, hands, feet, and genitals, as contemporary mummies reveal extra wrappings and paddings in these areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Christina|first=Riggs|author-link=Christina Riggs|date=2010-01-22|title=Funerary rituals (Ptolemaic and Roman Periods)|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n10x347|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> Mummies were identified via small, wooden name-tags tied typically around the deceased's neck.<ref name=\":2\" /> The 70-day process is connected to Osiris and the length the star [[Sothis (star)|Sothis]] was absent from the sky.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-28|[28]]]</sup>\n\nThe second, moderately expensive option for mummification did not involve an incision into the abdominal cavity or the removal of the internal organs. Instead, the embalmers injected the oil of a cedar tree into the body, which prevented liquid from leaving the body. The body was then laid in natron for a specific number of days. The oil was then drained out of the body, and with it came the internal organs, the stomach and the intestines, which were liquefied by the cedar oil. The flesh dissolved in the natron, which left only skin and bones left of the deceased body. The remains are given back to the family.<ref name=\":2\" /> The cheapest, most basic method of mummification, which was often chosen by the poor, involved purging out the deceased's internal organs, and then laying the body in natron for 70 days. The body was then given back to the family.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Burial rituals==\n[[File:Opening of the Mouth - Tutankhamun and Aja.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ay]] performing the opening of the mouth for [[Tutankhamun]].]]\n\nAfter the mummy was prepared, it would need to be re-animated, symbolically, by a priest. The [[opening of the mouth ceremony]] was conducted by a priest who would utter a spell and touch the mummy or [[sarcophagus]] with a ceremonial [[adze]]&nbsp;\u2013 a copper or stone blade. This ceremony ensured that the mummy could breathe and speak in the afterlife. In a similar fashion, the priest could utter spells to reanimate the mummy's arms, legs, and other body parts.\n\nThe priests, maybe even the king's successor, move the body through the causeway to the [[mortuary temple]]. This is where prayers were recited, incense was burned, and more rituals were performed to help prepare the king for his final journey. The king's mummy was then placed inside the pyramid along with enormous amount of food, drink, furniture, clothes, and jewelry which were to be used in the afterlife.\n\nThe pyramid was sealed so that no one would ever enter it again. However the king's soul could move through the burial chamber as it wished. After the funeral the king becomes a god and could be worshipped in the temples beside his pyramid.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Janice Kamrin and Salima Ikram, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nIn ancient times Egyptians were buried directly in the ground.

Therefore, the Ancient Egyptians were very serious about the way in which the tombs were built.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Death and the afterlife in ancient Egypt|last=1958-|first=Taylor, John H.|date=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226791647|location=Chicago|oclc=45195698}}</ref> Two hallmarks of the tomb included (1) a burial chamber, which housed the physical body of the deceased (inside a coffin) as well as funerary objects deemed most important, and (2) A \"cult place,\" which resembled a chapel where mourners, family, and friends could congregate. The tomb of a king included a full temple, instead of a chapel.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nTypically, the tomb of a deceased person was located somewhere close by their home community. The Ancient Egyptians opted to bury the deceased in land that was not particularly fertile or useful for vegetation. Therefore, tombs were mostly built in desert areas. Tombs were usually built near each other, and rarely stood alone. For a deceased king, however, the tomb was located in a place of utmost sacredness.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nIn the [[Prehistoric Egypt]], bodies were buried in deserts because they would naturally be preserved by dehydration. The \"graves\" were small oval or rectangular pits dug in the sand. They could give the body of the deceased in a tight position on its left side alongside a few jars of food and drink and slate palettes with magical religious spells. The size of graves eventually increased but according to status and wealth. The dry, desert conditions were a benefit in ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the complex burial preparations that the wealthy had.\n\nThe simple graves evolved into [[mudbrick]] structures called ''[[mastabas]].'' Royal mastabas later developed into \"step pyramids\" and then \"true pyramids.\"<ref>Leonard Lesko, pp. 4\u20135</ref> As soon as a king took the throne he would start to build his pyramid.

If the deceased was of a notably high-class, they were buried near the king, whereas middle and lower class individuals were simply buried near the communities in which they had lived.<ref name=\":5\"/> In many cases, the tombs of the high-class were situated in accordance with the tombs of the lower classes so that they would be viewed as a \"focal point.\" For example, one burial site was designed so that the tombs of the governors were placed alongside the slope of a hill, whereas the tombs of the governor's attendants were placed at the foot of the hill.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\n==Coffins==\n[[File:Exhibit at Lovre Museum, Paris 01.jpg|thumb|Coffin of a mummy at Louvre, Paris]]\nAfter having been preserved, the mummy was placed into a coffin. Although the coffins that housed the deceased bodies were made simply of wood, they were intricately painted and designed to suit each individual. During the Old Kingdom, the following was included on each coffin: the title of the deceased, a list of offerings, a false compartment through which ka could pass through, and painted eyes so that the deceased could look through the coffin.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/exhibits/online/mummification/artifacts6.html|title=Artifacts: Mummy Cases, Coffins, and Sarcophagi, Mummification, Online Exhibits, Exhibits, Spurlock Museum, U of I|website=www.spurlock.illinois.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> The decorations on the coffin usually fit the deceased's status.\n\nDuring the Middle Kingdom, the coffin was treated as if it were a \"miniature tomb\" and was painted and inscribed like so. Goddesses Isis and Nephthys were painted on the coffins, and were said to guard the deceased in the afterlife. Along the sides of the coffins, the four sons of Horus were painted, amongst other gods. Prayers were often inscribed on the coffins as well.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\nAnthropoid coffins soon emerged, which were tailored to the contour of the deceased's body. The deceased's face and hair was painted onto the coffin so to personalize it further.<ref name=\":62\" /> A sarcophagus, which is a large, stone container, was used to house the coffin, and provide supplementary protection to the dead body. The Ancient Egyptians translated the word \"sarcophagus\" to mean \"possessor of life,\" and therefore, the sarcophagus would aid the deceased into the afterlife.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historyembalmed.org/egyptian-mummies/sarcophagus.htm|title=Sarcophagus|website=www.historyembalmed.org|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Damnation ==\nOne of the funerary practices followed by the Egyptians was preparing properly for the afterlife.

Most funerary literature consists of lists of spells and instructions for navigating the afterlife. During the Old Kingdom, only the pharaoh had access to this material, which scholars refer to as the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]''. The Pyramid Texts are a collection of spells to assure the royal resurrection and protect the pharaoh from various malignant influences. The Pharaoh [[Unas]] was the first to use this collection of spells, as he and a few subsequent pharaohs had them carved on the walls of their [[pyramid]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/literature/religious/pyramid.html |title=Digital Egypt, Pyramid texts |access-date=2018-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303120804/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/literature/religious/pyramid.html |archive-date=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These texts were individually chosen from a larger bank of spells.\n\nIn the [[First Intermediate Period]] and in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], some of the Pyramid Text spells also are found in burial chambers of high officials and on many coffins, where they begin to evolve into what scholars call the ''[[Coffin Texts]]''. In this period, the nobles and many non-royal Egyptians began to have access to funerary literature. Although many spells from the earlier texts were carried over, the new coffin texts also had additional spells, along with slight changes made to make this new funerary text more fit for the nobility.<ref name=\"Erik Hornung\">Erik Hornung, The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Afterlife, (Cornell: Cornell University Press, 1999) p. 7</ref>\n\nIn The [[New Kingdom]], the Coffin texts became the Book of the Dead, or the Funeral Papyri, and would last through the Late Kingdom. The text in these books was divided according to chapters/ spells, which were almost two-hundred in number. Each one of these texts was individualized for the deceased, though to varying degrees. If the person was rich enough, then they could commission their own personal version of the text that would include only the spells that they wanted. However, if one was not so wealthy, then one had to make do with the pre-made versions that had spaces left for the name of the deceased.\n\nIf the scribe ran out of room while doing the transcription, he would just stop the spell wherever he was and would not continue.<ref>Raymond O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian [[Book of the Dead|Book of The Dead]], (New York, [[British Museum]] Publications, 1985) p. 11.</ref> It is not until the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] that there began to be any regulation of the order or even the number of spells that were to be included in the Book of the Dead.\nAt this time, the regulation is set at 192 spells to be placed in the book, with certain ones holding the same place at all times.<ref>Raymond O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian Book of The Dead, (New York, British Museum Publications, 1985) p. 11.</ref> This makes it seem as if the order of the texts was not what was important, so the person could place them in an order that he was comfortable with, but rather that it was what was written that mattered.\n\n==Judgement==\nThe idea of judgement went as follows: in order to be considered for the admittance into the afterlife, those who died were obligated to undergo a multi-step judgement by certain gods.<ref name=\":5\"/> The concept and belief in judgement is outlined in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', a funerary text of the new kingdom. The Book of the Dead is composed of spells relating to the deceased and the afterlife. Spell 125, in particular, is understood to be delivered by the deceased at the outset of the judgement process.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe visual picture of what judgement looks like has been discovered through Ancient Egyptian ruins and artefacts. The procedure was depicted as follows: The deceased's heart was weighed in comparison to a feather, while a vicious beast awaited to eat the heart (if the deceased was found to be a sinner).<ref name=\":5\" /> [[Osiris]] was the judge (among others), and represented an ideal output of the judgement process for the deceased who entered his judgement hall. This is because he resurrected and regained his godly status after he was justified against his brother Seth, who wrongly murdered him.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Smith|date=2008-10-27|title=Osiris and the Deceased|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/29r70244|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> The deceased pleaded to Osiris, among 42 judges, that they had not committed sin, which is known as a \"negative confession.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe 42 judges assessed how virtuous the life of the deceased was, and this represented the principal element of the deceased entering the afterlife.

At a minimum, these consisted of everyday objects such as bowls, combs, and other trinkets, along with food. Wealthier Egyptians could afford to be buried with jewelry, furniture, and other valuables, which made them targets of tomb robbers. In the early Dynastic Period, tombs were filled with daily life objects, such as furniture, jewelry and other valuables. They also contained many stone and pottery vessels.<ref>Grajetzki, ''Burial Customs'', pp. 7\u201314</ref>\n\nAs burial customs developed in the Old Kingdom, wealthy citizens were buried in wooden or stone coffins. However, the number of burial goods declined. They were often just a set of copper models, tools and vessels.<ref>Grajetzki, ''Burial Customs'', pp. 15\u201326</ref> Starting in the First Intermediate period, [[Wooden tomb model|wooden models]] became very popular burial goods. These wooden models often depict everyday activities that the deceased expected to continue doing in the afterlife. Also, a type of rectangular [[coffin]] became the standard, being brightly painted and often including an [[Ancient Egyptian offering formula|offering formula]]. Objects of daily use were not often included in the tombs during this period.\n\n[[File:Egyptian - Heart Scarab of Bak-en-Djehuti - Walters 42380 - Back.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient Egyptians put green stone scarab beetles into the coffins of important people, along with the mummified bodies.]]\nAt the end of the Middle Kingdom, new object types were introduced into burials, such as the first shabtis and the first heart scarabs. [[ushabti|Shabtis]] were little clay statues made to perform tasks on command for the pharaoh. Now objects of daily use appear in tombs again, often magical items already employed for protecting the living. Scarabs (beetles) collect animal dung and roll it into little balls. To the Egyptians, these balls looked like the life-giving Sun, so they hoped that scarabs would bring them long life. [[scarab (artifact)|Scarabs]] have been found in tombs and graves.<ref>{{cite book|author=Starry Dog|title=Biggest Ever Book of Questions & Answers|year=2003|publisher=WS PACIFIC PUBLICATIONS, INC|isbn=978-1-4454-8792-2|pages=71|chapter=History: Ancient Egypt}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Kingdom, some of the old burial customs changed. For example, an anthropoid coffin shape became standardized, and the deceased were provided with a small shabti statue, which the Egyptians believed would perform work for them in the afterlife. Elite burials were often filled with objects of daily use. Under [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]] and later all daily life objects disappear from tombs. They most often only contained a selection of items especially made for the burial. Also, in later burials, the numbers of shabti statues increased; in some burials, numbering more than four hundred statues. In addition to these shabti statues, the deceased could be buried with many different types of magical figurines to protect them from harm.\n\n== Funerary Boats ==\nFunerary boats were a part of some ancient Egyptian burials.<ref>Mary Ann Sullivan, [https://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/egypt/giza/boat/boat.html ''Solar Boat/Funerary Boat of Cheops (Khufu)''], \u00a9 2001. Retrieved May 9, 2013.</ref> Boats played a major role in Egyptian religion because they were conceived as the main means by which the gods traveled across the sky and through to the netherworld. One type of boat used at funerals was for making pilgrimages to holy sites such as [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. A large funerary boat, for example, was found near the pyramid of the Old Kingdom [[Khufu|Pharaoh Cheops]]. The funerary boats are called [[Felucca]] and they were usually made of wood; the Egyptians used a collection of papyrus reeds and tied them together with the wood very tightly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dkfindout.com/us/history/ancient-egypt/ancient-egyptian-boats/|title=DK Find Out! {{!}} Fun Facts for Kids on Animals, Earth, History and more!|website=DK Find Out!|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> The most common route for funerary boats was the River Nile to the afterlife. The boat carried the coffin and often had a dog in the boat since they believed a dog would lead the deceased to the afterlife.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/image/ancient-egyptian-model-funerary-boat|title=Ancient Egyptian model funerary boat - Australian Museum|website=australianmuseum.net.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> The boats usually measured about 20 feet or longer. These however didn't match those of the great pharaohs like Pharaoh Khufu (who built the Great Pyramid.) His funerary boat was approximately 144 foot long with 12 oars. Common funerary boats were smaller sized with few oars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://classroom.synonym.com/ancient-egypt-funeral-boats-6445.html|title=Facts of Ancient Egypt Funeral Boats {{!}} Synonym|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Role of Animals ==\nSeveral kinds of animal remains have been discovered in tombs all around Dayr al-Barsha, a Coptic village in Middle Egypt. The remains found in the shafts and burial chambers included dogs, foxes, eagle owls, bats, rodents, and snakes. These were determined to be individuals that had entered the deposits by accident. Other animal remains that were found were more common and recurred more than those individuals that wound up accidentally trapped in these tombs. These remains included numerous gazelle and cattle bones, as well as calves and goats which were believed to have been in result of human behavior. This was due to finding that some remains had fragments altered, missing, or separated from their original skeletons. These remains also had traces of paint and cut marks on them, seen especially with cattle skulls and feet. Based on this, the natural environment of the Dayr al-Barsha tombs, and the fact that only some parts of these animals were found, the possibility of natural deposition can be ruled out, and the cause of these remains in fact are most likely caused by animal sacrifices, as only the head, foreleg, and feet were apparently selected for deposition within the tombs. According to a study by Christopher Eyre, cattle meat was actually not a part of the daily diet in Ancient Egypt, as the consumption of meat only took place during celebrations including funerary and mortuary rituals, and the practice of providing the deceased with offerings of cattle going back to the Predynastic Period.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Meyer|first1=Marleen|last2=Van Neer|first2=Wim|last3=Peeters|first3=Christoph|last4=Willems|first4=Harco|title=The Role of Animals in the Funerary Rites at Dayr al-Barsh\u0101|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|date=2005|volume=42|pages=45\u201371|jstor=27651798}}</ref>\n\n==Ancient Egyptian mummification and funeral in fiction==\n* [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895), depicts the whole process of mummification and funeral at the fall of the [[20th Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Egypt}}\n* [[Death and afterlife in Ancient Egypt]]\n* [[Mummy#Egyptian mummies|Egyptian mummies]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n* Allen, James P.

These rituals and protocols included [[Mummy|mummifying the body]], casting [[magic spell]]s, and burial with specific grave goods thought to be needed in the [[Ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs|Egyptian afterlife]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/index.html |title=Digital Egypt, Burial customs |access-date=2018-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015021042/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/index.html |archive-date=2014-10-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120322222734/https://web.olivet.edu/gradusers/hgerth/leeanne.htm ''Ancient Egyptian Mummies: A Web Quest for 4th-6th Grade (Social Studies)''], Lee Anne Brandt. Retrieved from the [[Wayback Machine]] internet archive on May 8, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptian burial process evolved over time as old customs were discarded and new ones adopted, but several important elements of the process persisted. Although specific details changed over time, the preparation of the body, the magic rituals, and grave goods were all essential parts of a proper Egyptian funeral.\n\nThere were many different gods to prepare for. The ancient Egyptians believed that each god would separately judge the deceased before he could enter the afterlife.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Egyptian mourners001.jpg|left|thumb|121px|[[Professional mourners]] in an eloquent gesture of [[Professional mourning|mourning]].]]\n\nAlthough no writing survives from [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic Egypt]], scholars believe the importance of the physical body and its preservation originated there. This would explain why people of that time did not follow the common practice of cremation but rather buried the dead. Some also believe they may have feared the bodies would rise again if mistreated after death.<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Roger Lichtenberg, Mummies and Death in Egypt, (London: [[Cornell University|Cornell University Press]], 2006), p. 9</ref>\n\nEarly bodies were buried in simple, shallow oval pits, with a few burial goods. Sometimes multiple people and animals were placed in the same grave. Over time, graves became more complex, with the body placed in a wicker basket, then later in wooden or [[terracotta]] coffins. The latest tombs Egyptians made were sarcophagi. These graves contained burial goods like jewelry, food, games and sharpened splint.<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Dunand and Roger Lichtenberg, Mummies and Death in Egypt, (London: Cornell University Press, 2006), p. 7</ref>\n\nThis demonstrates that this ancient period had a sense of the afterlife, though archaeological evidence may show the average person had little chance of getting into it. This may be because admission required that the deceased must be able to serve a purpose there. The [[pharaoh]] was allowed in because of his role in life, and others needed to have some role there.\n\n[[Ancient Egyptian retainer sacrifices|Human sacrifice]]s found in early royal tombs reinforce this view. Those sacrificed were probably meant to serve the pharaoh in his afterlife. Eventually, [[Ushabti|figurines]] and wall paintings begin to replace human victims.<ref>Sergio Donadoni, ''The Egyptians'', (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997) p. 262</ref> Some of these figurines may have been created to resemble certain people, so they could follow the pharaoh after their lives ended.\n\nNote that not only the [[Social class|lower classes]] had to rely on the pharaoh's favor, but also the noble classes. They believed that when he died, the pharaoh became some sort of god, who could bestow upon certain individuals the ability to have an afterlife. This belief existed from the predynastic period through the [[Old Kingdom]].\n\nAlthough many spells from the predeceasing texts were carried over, the new coffin texts also had additional new spells added, along with slight changes made to make this new [[funerary text]] more relatable to the nobility.<ref name=\" Erik Hornung\"/> In the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], however, the importance of the pharaoh declined. Funerary texts, previously restricted to royal use, became more widely available. The pharaoh was no longer a [[god-king]] in the sense that only he was allowed in the next life due to his status here, now he was merely the ruler of the population who upon his death would be leveled down towards the plane of the mortals.<ref>John A. Wilson, The Culture of Ancient Egypt, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965), p. 116.</ref>\n\n===Prehistory, earliest burials===\nThe first funerals in Egypt are known from the villages of Omari and [[Maadi]] in the north, near present-day [[Cairo]]. The people of these villages buried their dead in a simple, round grave with a pot. The body was neither treated nor arranged in a regular way as would be the case later in the historical period. Without any written evidence, there is little to provide information about contemporary beliefs concerning the afterlife except for the regular inclusion of a single pot in the grave. Given later customs, the pot was probably intended to hold food for the deceased.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=71}}</ref>\n\n===Predynastic period, development of customs===\nFunerary customs were developed during the [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic period]] from those of the Prehistoric Period. At first, people excavated round graves with one pot in the [[Badari culture|Badarian Period]] (4400-3800 B.C.E.), continuing the tradition of Omari and Maadi cultures. By the end of the Predynastic period, there were increasing numbers of objects deposited with the body in rectangular graves, and there is growing evidence of rituals practiced by Egyptians of the [[Naqada culture|Naquada II Period]] (3650-3300 B.C.E). At this point, bodies were regularly arranged in a crouched or fetal position with the face toward either the east the rising sun or the west (which in this historical period was the land of the dead). Artists painted jars with funeral processions and perhaps ritual dancing. Figures of bare-breasted women with birdlike faces and their legs concealed under skirts also appeared in some graves. Some graves were much richer in goods than others, demonstrating the beginnings of social stratification. Gender differences in burial emerged with the inclusion of weapons in men's graves and cosmetics palettes in women's graves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=71\u201372}}</ref>\n\nBy 3,600 BCE, Egyptians had begun to mummify the dead, wrapping them in linen bandages with embalming oils (conifer resin and aromatic plant extracts).<ref>[https://www.livescience.com/63351-mummy-older-than-pharaohs.html Mindy Seisberger, 'This Ancient Mummy Is Older Than the Pharaohs', Live Science, 16 August 2016]</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/08/news-egyptian-prehistoric-mummy-embalming-recipe/ Maya Wei-Haas,'Mummy yields earliest known Egyptian embalming recipe', National Geographic,15 August 2018] </ref>\n\n===Early Dynastic Period, tombs and coffins===\nBy the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], some Egyptians were wealthy enough to build tombs over their burials rather than placing their bodies in simple pit graves dug into the sand. The rectangular, mud-brick tomb with an underground burial chamber, called a [[mastaba]], developed in this period. These tombs had niched walls, a style of building called the palace-fa\u00e7ade motif because the walls imitated those surrounding the palace of the king. Since commoners as well as kings, however, had such tombs, the architecture suggests that in death, some wealthy people did achieve an elevated status. Later in the historical period, it is certain that the deceased was associated with the god of the dead, [[Osiris]].\n\nGrave goods expanded to include furniture, jewelry, and games as well as the weapons, cosmetic palettes, and food supplies in decorated jars known earlier, in the Predynastic period. Now, however, in the richest tombs, grave goods numbered in the thousands. Only the newly invented coffins for the body were made specifically for the tomb. There is also some inconclusive evidence for mummification. Other objects in the tombs that had been used during daily life suggest that Egyptians already in the First Dynasty anticipated needing in the next life. Further continuity from this life into the next can be found in the positioning of tombs: those persons who served the king during their lifetimes chose burials close to their lord. The use of [[stele|stela]] in front of the tomb began in the First Dynasty, indicating a desire to individualize the tomb with the deceased's name.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=72\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Old Kingdom, pyramids and mummification===\n[[File: Relief of Men Presenting Oxen, ca. 2500-2350 B.C.E. Limestone.jpg|thumbnail|right|'' Relief of Men Presenting Oxen'', ca. 2500\u20132350 B.C.E. Limestone. In this relief, three men bring cattle to the tomb owner, \"from the towns of the estate,\" as the inscription says. Two of these balding, rustic laborers wear kilts of coarse material and the other wears nothing at all. A fragmentary scene below shows men bringing cranes, which Egyptians penned and raised for food. Artisans carved images of live food animals in tombs to supply the deceased with an eternal source of provisions. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nIn the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], kings first built pyramids for their tombs surrounded by stone mastaba tombs for their high officials. The fact that most high officials were also royal relatives suggests another motivation for such placement: these complexes were also family cemeteries.\n\nAmong the elite, bodies were mummified, wrapped in linen bandages, sometimes covered with molded plaster, and placed in stone sarcophagi or plain wooden coffins. At the end of the Old Kingdom, mummy masks in [[cartonnage]] (linen soaked in plaster, modeled and painted) also appeared. Canopic containers now held their internal organs. Amulets of gold, [[Egyptian faience|faience]], and [[carnelian]] first appeared in various shapes to protect different parts of the body. There is also the first evidence of inscriptions inside the coffins of the elite during the Old Kingdom. Often, reliefs of everyday items were etched onto the walls supplemented grave goods, which made them available through their representation.\n\nThe new false door was a non-functioning stone sculpture of a door into the tomb, found either inside the chapel or on the outside of the mastaba; it served as a place to make offerings and recite prayers for the deceased. Statues of the deceased were now included in tombs and used for ritual purposes. Burial chambers of some private people received their first decorations in addition to the decoration of the chapels. At the end of the Old Kingdom, the burial chamber decorations depicted offerings, but not people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=74\u201377}}</ref>\n\n===First Intermediate Period, regional variation===\nThe political situation in the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], with many centers of power, is reflected in the many local styles of art and burial at this time. The many regional styles for decorating coffins make their origins easy to distinguish from each other. For example, some coffins have one-line inscriptions, and many styles include the depiction of ''Wadjet'' eyes (the human eye with the markings of a falcon). There are also regional variations in the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] used to decorate coffins.\n\nOccasionally men had tools and weapons in their graves, while some women had jewelry and cosmetic objects such as mirrors. Grindstones were sometimes included in women's tombs, perhaps to be considered a tool for food preparation in the next world, just as the weapons in men's tombs imply men's assignment to a role in fighting.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=77}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Kingdom, new tomb contents===\n[[File:Mask from a Coffin. Cartonnage,37.1387E.jpg|thumbnail|Mask from a coffin. Cartonnage, 37.1387E, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nBurial customs in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] reflect some of the political trends of this period. During the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]], tombs were cut into the mountains of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] surrounding the king's tomb or in local cemeteries in [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Middle Egypt]]; Thebes was the native city of the Eleventh Dynasty kings, and they preferred to be buried there. But the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]], high officials served the kings of a new family now ruling from the north in [[Lisht]]; these kings and their high officials preferred burial in a mastaba near the pyramids belonging to their masters. Moreover, the difference in topography between Thebes and Lisht led to a difference in tomb type: in the north, nobles build mastaba tombs on the flat desert plains, while in the south, local dignitaries continued to excavate tombs in the mountain.\n\nFor those of ranks lower than royal courtiers during the Eleventh Dynasty, tombs were simpler. Coffins could be simple wooden boxes with the body either mummified and wrapped in linen or simply wrapped without mummification, and the addition of a cartonnage mummy mask. Some tombs included wooded shoes and a simple statue near the body. In one burial there were only twelve loaves of bread, a leg of beef, and a jar of beer for food offerings. Jewelry could be included but only rarely were objects of great value found in non-elite graves. Some burials continued to include the [[Wooden tomb model|wooden models]] that were popular during the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]]. Wooden models of boats, scenes of food production, craftsmen and workshops, and professions such as scribes or soldiers have been found in the tombs of this period.\n\nSome rectangular coffins of the Twelfth Dynasty have short inscriptions and representations of the most important offerings the deceased required. For men, the objects depicted were weapons and symbols of office as well as food. Women's coffins depicted mirrors, sandals, and jars containing food and drink. Some coffins included texts that were later versions of the royal [[Pyramid Texts]].\n\nAnother kind of faience model of the deceased as a mummy seems to anticipate the use of ''[[shabti]]'' figurines (also called ''shawabti'' or an ''ushabti'') later in the Twelfth Dynasty. These early figurines do not have the text directing the figure to work in the place of the deceased that is found in later figurines. The richest people had stone figurines that seem to anticipate ''shabtis'', though some scholars have seen them as mummy substitutes rather than servant figures.\n\nIn the later Twelfth Dynasty, significant changes occurred in burials, perhaps reflecting administrative changes enacted by King [[Senusret III|Senwosret III]] (1836\u20131818 B.C.E.). The body was now regularly placed on its back, rather than its side as had been done for thousands of years. Coffin texts and wooden models disappeared from new tombs of the period while heart scarabs and figurines shaped like mummies were now often included in burials, as they would be for the remainder of Egyptian history. Coffin decoration was simplified. The [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] saw another change in decoration. Different motifs were found in the north and south, a reflection of decentralized government power at the time. There was also a marked increase in the number of burials in one tomb, a rare occurrence in earlier periods. The reuse of one tomb by a family over generations seems to have occurred when wealth was more equitably spread.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bleiberg |first1=Edward |author-link=Edward Bleiberg |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=77\u201386}}</ref>\n\n===Second Intermediate Period, foreigner burials===\nKnown graves from the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] reveal the presence of non-Egyptians buried in the country. In the north, graves associated with the [[Hyksos]], a western [[Semitic people]] ruling the north from the northeast delta, include small mud-brick structures containing the body, pottery vessels, a dagger in a men's graves and often a nearby donkey burial. Simple pan-shaped graves in various parts of the country are thought to belong to [[Nubia]]n soldiers. Such graves reflect very ancient customs and feature shallow, round pits, bodies contracted and minimal food offerings in pots. The occasional inclusion of identifiable Egyptian materials from the Second Intermediate Period provides the only marks distinguishing these burials from those of Predynastic and even earlier periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York|pages=86\u201389}}</ref>\n\n===New Kingdom, new object purposes===\n[[File:S10.08 Deir-El-Bahari, image 9932.jpg|thumbnail|Deir-El-Bahari]]\nThe majority of elite tombs in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] were rock-cut chambers. Kings were buried in multi-roomed, rock-cut tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]] and no longer in pyramids. Priests conducted funerary rituals for them in stone temples built on the west bank of the [[Nile]] opposite of Thebes. From the current evidence, the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] appears to be the last period in which Egyptians regularly included multiple objects from their daily lives in their tombs; beginning in the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], tombs contained fewer items from daily life and included objects made especially for the next world. Thus the change from the Eighteenth to the Nineteenth Dynasties formed a dividing line in burial traditions: The Eighteenth Dynasty more closely remembered the immediate past in its customs whereas the Nineteenth Dynasty anticipated the customs of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]].\n\n[[File: Tutankhamun's bed (Cairo Museum).jpg|thumb|Gilded bier fashioned to resemble the goddess [[Sekhmet]], the fierce protector of the kings in life and death, from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], Cairo Museum]] \nPeople of the elite ranks in the Eighteenth Dynasty placed furniture as well as clothing and other items in their tombs, objects they undoubtedly used during life on earth. Beds, headrests, chairs, stools, leather sandals, jewelry, musical instruments, and wooden storage chests were present in these tombs. While all of the objects listed were for the elite, many poor people did not put anything beyond weapons and cosmetics into their tombs.\n\nNo elite tombs survive unplundered from the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Ramesside period]]. In this period, artists decorated tombs belonging to the elite with more scene of religious events, rather than the everyday scene that had been popular since the Old Kingdom. The funeral itself, the funerary meal with multiple relatives, the worshipping of the gods, even figures in the underworld were subjects in elite tomb decorations. The majority of objects found in the Ramesside period tombs were made for the afterlife. Aside from the jewelry, which could have been used also during life, objects in Ramesside tombs were manufactured for the next world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum |year=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, New York |pages=89\u2013100}}</ref>\n\n===Third Intermediate Period===\n[[File: Funerary Figurine of King Pinudjem I, ca. 1025-1007 B.C.E., 16.190.jpg|thumbnail|Shabties of King Pinudjem I, ca. 1025\u20131007 B.C.E., 16.190, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nAlthough the political structure of the New Kingdom collapsed at the end of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]], the majority of burials in the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]] directly reflect developments from the earlier period. At the beginning of this time, reliefs resembled those from the Ramesside period. Only at the very end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] did new funerary practices of the Late Period begin to be seen.\n\nLittle is known of tombs from this period. The very lack of decorations in tombs seems to have led to much more elaborate decoration of coffins. The remaining grave goods of the period show fairly cheaply made ''shabties'', even when the owner was a queen or a princess.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasure from the Brooklyn Museum|date=2008|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=100\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n===Late Period, monumentality and return to traditions===\nBurials in the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] could make use of large-scale, temple-like tombs built for the non-royal elite for the first time. But the majority of tombs in this period were in shafts sunk into the desert floor. In addition to fine statuary and reliefs reflecting the style of the Old Kingdom, the majority of grave goods were specially made for the tomb. Coffins continued to bear religious texts and scenes. Some shafts were personalized by the use of stela with the deceased prayers and name on it. ''Shabties'' in faience for all classes are known. Canopic jars, though often nonfunctional, continued to be included. Staves and scepters representing the deceased's office in life were often present as well. A figure of either the god Osiris or of the composite deity Ptah-Sokar-Osiris could be found, along with heart scarabs, both gold and faience examples of djed-columns, [[Eye of Horus]] amulets, figures of gods, and images of the deceased's ''ba''.

The front of the mummy was often painted with a selection of traditional Egyptian symbols. Mummy masks in either traditional Egyptian style or Roman style could be added to the mummies. Another possibility was a Roman-style mummy portrait, executed in [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] (pigment suspended in wax) on a wooden panel. Sometimes the feet of the mummy was covered. An alternative to this was a complete shroud with Egyptian motifs but a portrait in the Roman style.

The family and friends of the deceased had a choice of options that ranged in price for the preparation of the body, similar to the process at modern funeral homes. Next, the embalmers escorted the body to ''ibw'', translated to \u201cplace of purification,\u201d a tent in which the body was washed, and then ''per nefer'', \u201cthe House of Beauty,\u201d where mummification took place.<ref name=\":2\" />[[File:Bemalte Mumienbinde.JPG|thumb|left|Painted mummy bandage]]\n\n=== Mummification process ===\nIn order to live for all eternity and be presented in front of [[Osiris]], the body of the deceased had to be preserved by [[mummy|mummification]], so that the [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|soul]] could reunite with it, and take pleasure in the afterlife. The main process of mummification was preserving the body by [[dehydrating]] it using [[natron]], a natural material found in [[Wadi Natrun]] which is like a combination of baking soda and salt. The body was drained of any liquids and left with the skin, hair and muscles preserved.<ref>Salima Ikram, Ancient Egypt, pp. 275\u2013282</ref>\n\n[[File:Seti I memmy head.png|thumb|Mummy of pharaoh [[Seti I]].]]The process of mummification was available for anyone who could afford it. It was believed that even those who could not afford this process could still enjoy the afterlife with the right reciting of spells. Mummification existed in three different processes, ranging from most expensive, moderately expensive, and most simplistic, or cheapest.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most classic, common, and most expensive method of mummification dates back to the [[18th Dynasty]]. The first step was to remove the internal organs and liquid so that the body would not decay. The embalmers took out the brain through a process named [[excerebration]] by inserting a metal hook through the nostril, breaking through it into the brain. They removed as much as they could with the hook, and the rest they liquefied with drugs and drained out.<ref name=\":2\" /> They threw out the brain because they thought that the heart did all the thinking. The next step was to remove the internal organs, the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines, and place them in [[canopic jars]] with lids shaped like the heads of the protective deities, the [[four sons of Horus]]: Imsety, Hapy, Duamutef, and Qebhseneuf. [[Imset]]y was human-headed, and guarded the liver; [[Hapi (Son of Horus)|Hapy]] was ape-headed, and guarded the lungs; [[Duamutef]] was jackal-headed, and guarded the stomach; [[Qebehsenuef|Qebhseneuf]] was hawk-headed, and guarded the small and large intestines.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-25|[25]]]</sup> Sometimes the four canopic jars were placed into a [[canopic chest]], and buried with the mummified body. A canopic chest resembled a \"miniature coffin\" and was intricately painted. The Ancient Egyptians believed that by burying the deceased with their organs, they may rejoin with them in the afterlife.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-26|[26]]]</sup> Other times, the organs were cleaned and cleansed, and then returned into the body.<ref name=\":2\" /> The body cavity was then rinsed and cleaned with wine and an array of spices. The body was sewn up with aromatic plants and spices left inside.<ref name=\":2\" /> The heart stayed in the body, because in the hall of judgment, it would be weighed against the feather of [[Ma'at]]. After the body was washed with wine, it was stuffed with bags of [[natron]]. The dehydration process took 40 days.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-27|[27]]]</sup>\n\nThe second part of the process took 30 days. This was the time where the deceased turned into a semi divine being, and all that was left in the body from the first part was removed, followed by applying first wine and then oils. The oils were for ritual purposes, as well as for preventing the limbs and bones from breaking while being wrapped. The body was sometimes colored with a golden resin, which protected the body from bacteria and insects. Additionally, this practice was based on the belief that divine beings had flesh of gold. Next, the body was wrapped in linen cut into strips with [[amulets]] while a priest recited prayers and burned [[incense]]. The linen was adhered to the body using gum, opposed to a glue.<ref name=\":2\" /> The dressing provided the body physical protection from the elements, and depending on how wealthy the deceased's family was, the deceased could be dressed with an ornamented funeral mask and shroud.<ref name=\":2\" /> Special care was given to the head, hands, feet, and genitals, as contemporary mummies reveal extra wrappings and paddings in these areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Christina|first=Riggs|author-link=Christina Riggs|date=2010-01-22|title=Funerary rituals (Ptolemaic and Roman Periods)|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n10x347|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> Mummies were identified via small, wooden name-tags tied typically around the deceased's neck.<ref name=\":2\" /> The 70-day process is connected to Osiris and the length the star [[Sothis (star)|Sothis]] was absent from the sky.<sup>[[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#cite note-28|[28]]]</sup>\n\nThe second, moderately expensive option for mummification did not involve an incision into the abdominal cavity or the removal of the internal organs. Instead, the embalmers injected the oil of a cedar tree into the body, which prevented liquid from leaving the body. The body was then laid in natron for a specific number of days. The oil was then drained out of the body, and with it came the internal organs, the stomach and the intestines, which were liquefied by the cedar oil. The flesh dissolved in the natron, which left only skin and bones left of the deceased body. The remains are given back to the family.<ref name=\":2\" /> The cheapest, most basic method of mummification, which was often chosen by the poor, involved purging out the deceased's internal organs, and then laying the body in natron for 70 days. The body was then given back to the family.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Burial rituals==\n[[File:Opening of the Mouth - Tutankhamun and Aja.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ay]] performing the opening of the mouth for [[Tutankhamun]].]]\n\nAfter the mummy was prepared, it would need to be re-animated, symbolically, by a priest. The [[opening of the mouth ceremony]] was conducted by a priest who would utter a spell and touch the mummy or [[sarcophagus]] with a ceremonial [[adze]]&nbsp;\u2013 a copper or stone blade. This ceremony ensured that the mummy could breathe and speak in the afterlife. In a similar fashion, the priest could utter spells to reanimate the mummy's arms, legs, and other body parts.\n\nThe priests, maybe even the king's successor, move the body through the causeway to the [[mortuary temple]]. This is where prayers were recited, incense was burned, and more rituals were performed to help prepare the king for his final journey. The king's mummy was then placed inside the pyramid along with enormous amount of food, drink, furniture, clothes, and jewelry which were to be used in the afterlife.\n\nThe pyramid was sealed so that no one would ever enter it again. However the king's soul could move through the burial chamber as it wished. After the funeral the king becomes a god and could be worshipped in the temples beside his pyramid.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Janice Kamrin and Salima Ikram, pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nIn ancient times Egyptians were buried directly in the ground.

Therefore, the Ancient Egyptians were very serious about the way in which the tombs were built.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Death and the afterlife in ancient Egypt|last=1958-|first=Taylor, John H.|date=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226791647|location=Chicago|oclc=45195698}}</ref> Two hallmarks of the tomb included (1) a burial chamber, which housed the physical body of the deceased (inside a coffin) as well as funerary objects deemed most important, and (2) A \"cult place,\" which resembled a chapel where mourners, family, and friends could congregate. The tomb of a king included a full temple, instead of a chapel.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nTypically, the tomb of a deceased person was located somewhere close by their home community. The Ancient Egyptians opted to bury the deceased in land that was not particularly fertile or useful for vegetation. Therefore, tombs were mostly built in desert areas. Tombs were usually built near each other, and rarely stood alone. For a deceased king, however, the tomb was located in a place of utmost sacredness.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nIn the [[Prehistoric Egypt]], bodies were buried in deserts because they would naturally be preserved by dehydration. The \"graves\" were small oval or rectangular pits dug in the sand. They could give the body of the deceased in a tight position on its left side alongside a few jars of food and drink and slate palettes with magical religious spells. The size of graves eventually increased but according to status and wealth. The dry, desert conditions were a benefit in ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the complex burial preparations that the wealthy had.\n\nThe simple graves evolved into [[mudbrick]] structures called ''[[mastabas]].'' Royal mastabas later developed into \"step pyramids\" and then \"true pyramids.\"<ref>Leonard Lesko, pp. 4\u20135</ref> As soon as a king took the throne he would start to build his pyramid.

If the deceased was of a notably high-class, they were buried near the king, whereas middle and lower class individuals were simply buried near the communities in which they had lived.<ref name=\":5\"/> In many cases, the tombs of the high-class were situated in accordance with the tombs of the lower classes so that they would be viewed as a \"focal point.\" For example, one burial site was designed so that the tombs of the governors were placed alongside the slope of a hill, whereas the tombs of the governor's attendants were placed at the foot of the hill.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\n==Coffins==\n[[File:Exhibit at Lovre Museum, Paris 01.jpg|thumb|Coffin of a mummy at Louvre, Paris]]\nAfter having been preserved, the mummy was placed into a coffin. Although the coffins that housed the deceased bodies were made simply of wood, they were intricately painted and designed to suit each individual. During the Old Kingdom, the following was included on each coffin: the title of the deceased, a list of offerings, a false compartment through which ka could pass through, and painted eyes so that the deceased could look through the coffin.<ref name=\":62\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/exhibits/online/mummification/artifacts6.html|title=Artifacts: Mummy Cases, Coffins, and Sarcophagi, Mummification, Online Exhibits, Exhibits, Spurlock Museum, U of I|website=www.spurlock.illinois.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> The decorations on the coffin usually fit the deceased's status.\n\nDuring the Middle Kingdom, the coffin was treated as if it were a \"miniature tomb\" and was painted and inscribed like so. Goddesses Isis and Nephthys were painted on the coffins, and were said to guard the deceased in the afterlife. Along the sides of the coffins, the four sons of Horus were painted, amongst other gods. Prayers were often inscribed on the coffins as well.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\nAnthropoid coffins soon emerged, which were tailored to the contour of the deceased's body. The deceased's face and hair was painted onto the coffin so to personalize it further.<ref name=\":62\" /> A sarcophagus, which is a large, stone container, was used to house the coffin, and provide supplementary protection to the dead body. The Ancient Egyptians translated the word \"sarcophagus\" to mean \"possessor of life,\" and therefore, the sarcophagus would aid the deceased into the afterlife.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historyembalmed.org/egyptian-mummies/sarcophagus.htm|title=Sarcophagus|website=www.historyembalmed.org|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Damnation ==\nOne of the funerary practices followed by the Egyptians was preparing properly for the afterlife.

Most funerary literature consists of lists of spells and instructions for navigating the afterlife. During the Old Kingdom, only the pharaoh had access to this material, which scholars refer to as the ''[[Pyramid Texts]]''. The Pyramid Texts are a collection of spells to assure the royal resurrection and protect the pharaoh from various malignant influences. The Pharaoh [[Unas]] was the first to use this collection of spells, as he and a few subsequent pharaohs had them carved on the walls of their [[pyramid]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/literature/religious/pyramid.html |title=Digital Egypt, Pyramid texts |access-date=2018-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303120804/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/literature/religious/pyramid.html |archive-date=2014-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These texts were individually chosen from a larger bank of spells.\n\nIn the [[First Intermediate Period]] and in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], some of the Pyramid Text spells also are found in burial chambers of high officials and on many coffins, where they begin to evolve into what scholars call the ''[[Coffin Texts]]''. In this period, the nobles and many non-royal Egyptians began to have access to funerary literature. Although many spells from the earlier texts were carried over, the new coffin texts also had additional spells, along with slight changes made to make this new funerary text more fit for the nobility.<ref name=\"Erik Hornung\">Erik Hornung, The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Afterlife, (Cornell: Cornell University Press, 1999) p. 7</ref>\n\nIn The [[New Kingdom]], the Coffin texts became the Book of the Dead, or the Funeral Papyri, and would last through the Late Kingdom. The text in these books was divided according to chapters/ spells, which were almost two-hundred in number. Each one of these texts was individualized for the deceased, though to varying degrees. If the person was rich enough, then they could commission their own personal version of the text that would include only the spells that they wanted. However, if one was not so wealthy, then one had to make do with the pre-made versions that had spaces left for the name of the deceased.\n\nIf the scribe ran out of room while doing the transcription, he would just stop the spell wherever he was and would not continue.<ref>Raymond O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian [[Book of the Dead|Book of The Dead]], (New York, [[British Museum]] Publications, 1985) p. 11.</ref> It is not until the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] that there began to be any regulation of the order or even the number of spells that were to be included in the Book of the Dead.\nAt this time, the regulation is set at 192 spells to be placed in the book, with certain ones holding the same place at all times.<ref>Raymond O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian Book of The Dead, (New York, British Museum Publications, 1985) p. 11.</ref> This makes it seem as if the order of the texts was not what was important, so the person could place them in an order that he was comfortable with, but rather that it was what was written that mattered.\n\n==Judgement==\nThe idea of judgement went as follows: in order to be considered for the admittance into the afterlife, those who died were obligated to undergo a multi-step judgement by certain gods.<ref name=\":5\"/> The concept and belief in judgement is outlined in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', a funerary text of the new kingdom. The Book of the Dead is composed of spells relating to the deceased and the afterlife. Spell 125, in particular, is understood to be delivered by the deceased at the outset of the judgement process.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe visual picture of what judgement looks like has been discovered through Ancient Egyptian ruins and artefacts. The procedure was depicted as follows: The deceased's heart was weighed in comparison to a feather, while a vicious beast awaited to eat the heart (if the deceased was found to be a sinner).<ref name=\":5\" /> [[Osiris]] was the judge (among others), and represented an ideal output of the judgement process for the deceased who entered his judgement hall. This is because he resurrected and regained his godly status after he was justified against his brother Seth, who wrongly murdered him.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Smith|date=2008-10-27|title=Osiris and the Deceased|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/29r70244|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> The deceased pleaded to Osiris, among 42 judges, that they had not committed sin, which is known as a \"negative confession.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe 42 judges assessed how virtuous the life of the deceased was, and this represented the principal element of the deceased entering the afterlife.

At a minimum, these consisted of everyday objects such as bowls, combs, and other trinkets, along with food. Wealthier Egyptians could afford to be buried with jewelry, furniture, and other valuables, which made them targets of tomb robbers. In the early Dynastic Period, tombs were filled with daily life objects, such as furniture, jewelry and other valuables. They also contained many stone and pottery vessels.<ref>Grajetzki, ''Burial Customs'', pp. 7\u201314</ref>\n\nAs burial customs developed in the Old Kingdom, wealthy citizens were buried in wooden or stone coffins. However, the number of burial goods declined. They were often just a set of copper models, tools and vessels.<ref>Grajetzki, ''Burial Customs'', pp. 15\u201326</ref> Starting in the First Intermediate period, [[Wooden tomb model|wooden models]] became very popular burial goods. These wooden models often depict everyday activities that the deceased expected to continue doing in the afterlife. Also, a type of rectangular [[coffin]] became the standard, being brightly painted and often including an [[Ancient Egyptian offering formula|offering formula]]. Objects of daily use were not often included in the tombs during this period.\n\n[[File:Egyptian - Heart Scarab of Bak-en-Djehuti - Walters 42380 - Back.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient Egyptians put green stone scarab beetles into the coffins of important people, along with the mummified bodies.]]\nAt the end of the Middle Kingdom, new object types were introduced into burials, such as the first shabtis and the first heart scarabs. [[ushabti|Shabtis]] were little clay statues made to perform tasks on command for the pharaoh. Now objects of daily use appear in tombs again, often magical items already employed for protecting the living. Scarabs (beetles) collect animal dung and roll it into little balls. To the Egyptians, these balls looked like the life-giving Sun, so they hoped that scarabs would bring them long life. [[scarab (artifact)|Scarabs]] have been found in tombs and graves.<ref>{{cite book|author=Starry Dog|title=Biggest Ever Book of Questions & Answers|year=2003|publisher=WS PACIFIC PUBLICATIONS, INC|isbn=978-1-4454-8792-2|pages=71|chapter=History: Ancient Egypt}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Kingdom, some of the old burial customs changed. For example, an anthropoid coffin shape became standardized, and the deceased were provided with a small shabti statue, which the Egyptians believed would perform work for them in the afterlife. Elite burials were often filled with objects of daily use. Under [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]] and later all daily life objects disappear from tombs. They most often only contained a selection of items especially made for the burial. Also, in later burials, the numbers of shabti statues increased; in some burials, numbering more than four hundred statues. In addition to these shabti statues, the deceased could be buried with many different types of magical figurines to protect them from harm.\n\n== Funerary Boats ==\nFunerary boats were a part of some ancient Egyptian burials.<ref>Mary Ann Sullivan, [https://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/egypt/giza/boat/boat.html ''Solar Boat/Funerary Boat of Cheops (Khufu)''], \u00a9 2001. Retrieved May 9, 2013.</ref> Boats played a major role in Egyptian religion because they were conceived as the main means by which the gods traveled across the sky and through to the netherworld. One type of boat used at funerals was for making pilgrimages to holy sites such as [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. A large funerary boat, for example, was found near the pyramid of the Old Kingdom [[Khufu|Pharaoh Cheops]]. The funerary boats are called [[Felucca]] and they were usually made of wood; the Egyptians used a collection of papyrus reeds and tied them together with the wood very tightly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dkfindout.com/us/history/ancient-egypt/ancient-egyptian-boats/|title=DK Find Out! {{!}} Fun Facts for Kids on Animals, Earth, History and more!|website=DK Find Out!|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> The most common route for funerary boats was the River Nile to the afterlife. The boat carried the coffin and often had a dog in the boat since they believed a dog would lead the deceased to the afterlife.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/image/ancient-egyptian-model-funerary-boat|title=Ancient Egyptian model funerary boat - Australian Museum|website=australianmuseum.net.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}</ref> The boats usually measured about 20 feet or longer. These however didn't match those of the great pharaohs like Pharaoh Khufu (who built the Great Pyramid.) His funerary boat was approximately 144 foot long with 12 oars. Common funerary boats were smaller sized with few oars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://classroom.synonym.com/ancient-egypt-funeral-boats-6445.html|title=Facts of Ancient Egypt Funeral Boats {{!}} Synonym|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Role of Animals ==\nSeveral kinds of animal remains have been discovered in tombs all around Dayr al-Barsha, a Coptic village in Middle Egypt. The remains found in the shafts and burial chambers included dogs, foxes, eagle owls, bats, rodents, and snakes. These were determined to be individuals that had entered the deposits by accident. Other animal remains that were found were more common and recurred more than those individuals that wound up accidentally trapped in these tombs. These remains included numerous gazelle and cattle bones, as well as calves and goats which were believed to have been in result of human behavior. This was due to finding that some remains had fragments altered, missing, or separated from their original skeletons. These remains also had traces of paint and cut marks on them, seen especially with cattle skulls and feet. Based on this, the natural environment of the Dayr al-Barsha tombs, and the fact that only some parts of these animals were found, the possibility of natural deposition can be ruled out, and the cause of these remains in fact are most likely caused by animal sacrifices, as only the head, foreleg, and feet were apparently selected for deposition within the tombs. According to a study by Christopher Eyre, cattle meat was actually not a part of the daily diet in Ancient Egypt, as the consumption of meat only took place during celebrations including funerary and mortuary rituals, and the practice of providing the deceased with offerings of cattle going back to the Predynastic Period.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Meyer|first1=Marleen|last2=Van Neer|first2=Wim|last3=Peeters|first3=Christoph|last4=Willems|first4=Harco|title=The Role of Animals in the Funerary Rites at Dayr al-Barsh\u0101|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|date=2005|volume=42|pages=45\u201371|jstor=27651798}}</ref>\n\n==Ancient Egyptian mummification and funeral in fiction==\n* [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895), depicts the whole process of mummification and funeral at the fall of the [[20th Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Egypt}}\n* [[Death and afterlife in Ancient Egypt]]\n* [[Mummy#Egyptian mummies|Egyptian mummies]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n* Allen, James P.

He went on to win several titles in that series, as well as the [[SCCA]] and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]]. He also competed in the 1984 [[Long Beach Grand Prix]].\n\nIn 1990, he moved to [[North Carolina]] and made his [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup]] debut that year at [[The Bud at the Glen]] in the No. 22 owned by [[Buddy Baker]]. He spent the next decade running short tracks in the [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]], and the [[Busch Series]]. He suffered injuries in 1996 at [[Watkins Glen International Raceway]], while practicing a Winston Cup car, he crashed into the wall and was unconscious for 45 minutes. He made his return to NASCAR in [[1998 in NASCAR|1998]], when he was unable to qualify for the [[Save Mart/Kragen 350]] in his No. 70 [[Ford Thunderbird]].\n\nHe ran 9 of the 14 races in [[NASCAR West Series]] in 1999, before he moved up to the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] in 2000, where he ran his own No. 51 Chevys, but only ran a limited schedule to sponsorship issues and injuries. Since then, he has run one Craftsman Truck race and is owner of [[Rick Ware Racing]]. He is the father of [[Cody Ware]] and Carson Ware.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.
