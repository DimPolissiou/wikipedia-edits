Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> His mother grew up in her father's house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the revolution.\n\nBoth Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641).\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government.

He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Philanthropy & Charity==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

She was a daughter of [[Charles VI of France]] and [[Isabeau of Bavaria]].\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Mariage de Jean V de Bretagne et de Jeanne de France.png|thumb|left|The marriage of John and Joan by [[Froissart]].]]\n\nJoan married [[John V, Duke of Brittany]], in 1396. Three years after the wedding, her spouse became duke and she duchess of Brittany.\n\nAs duchess, Joan is perhaps most known for her role during the conflict between John V and the [[count of Penthi\u00e8vre|Counts of Penthi\u00e8vre]]. The Penthi\u00e8vre branch had lost the [[Breton War of Succession]] in the 1340s. As a result, they lost the ducal title of Brittany to the Montforts. The conclusion to the conflict took many years to confirm until 1365 when the [[Treaty of Gu\u00e9rande (1365)|Treaty of Gu\u00e9rande]] was signed. Despite the military loss and the diplomatic treaty, the Counts of Penthi\u00e8vre had not renounced their ducal claims to Brittany and continued to pursue them. In 1420, they invited John V to a festival held at Ch\u00e2tonceaux. He accepted the invitation, but when he arrived, he was captured and kept prisoner.\n\nThe Counts of Penthi\u00e8ve then spread rumours of his death, and moved him to a new prison each day. Joan of France called upon all the barons of Brittany to respond. They besieged all the castles of the Penthi\u00e8vre family one by one. Joan ended the conflict by seizing the dowager countess of Penthi\u00e8vre, [[Margaret of Clisson]], and forcing her to have the duke freed.\n\nJoan died in 1433, during her husband's reign.\n\nA [[Book of Hours]] by the [[Bedford Master]], ''[[Heures Lamoignon]]'', was dedicated to her.\n\n==Issue ==\nShe had seven children:\n\n*Anne (1409 \u2013 c. 1415)\n* [[Isabella of Brittany|Isabella]] (1411 \u2013 c. 1442), who in 1435 married [[Guy XIV of Laval]] and had 3 children with him.\n*Margaret (1412 \u2013 c. 1421)\n* [[Francis I, Duke of Brittany|Francis I]] (1414 \u2013 c. 1450), duke of Brittany\n*Catherine (1416 \u2013 c. 1421)\n* [[Peter II, Duke of Brittany|Peter II]] (1418 \u2013 c. 1457), duke of Brittany\n* [[Gilles of Brittany|Gilles]] (1420 \u2013 c. 1450), [[lord|seigneur]] of Chantoc\u00e9.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

She was a daughter of [[Charles VI of France]] and [[Isabeau of Bavaria]].\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Mariage de Jean V de Bretagne et de Jeanne de France.png|thumb|left|The marriage of John and Joan by [[Froissart]].]]\n\nJoan married [[John V, Duke of Brittany]] in 1396. Three years after the wedding, her spouse became duke and she duchess of Brittany.\n\nAs duchess, Joan is perhaps most known for her role during the conflict between John V and the [[count of Penthi\u00e8vre|Counts of Penthi\u00e8vre]]. The Penthi\u00e8vre branch had lost the [[Breton War of Succession]] in the 1340s. As a result, they lost the ducal title of Brittany to the Montforts. The conclusion to the conflict took many years to confirm until 1365 when the [[Treaty of Gu\u00e9rande (1365)|Treaty of Gu\u00e9rande]] was signed. Despite the military loss and the diplomatic treaty, the Counts of Penthi\u00e8vre had not renounced their ducal claims to Brittany and continued to pursue them. In 1420, they invited John V to a festival held at Ch\u00e2tonceaux. He accepted the invitation, but when he arrived, he was captured and kept prisoner.\n\nThe Counts of Penthi\u00e8ve then spread rumours of his death, and moved him to a new prison each day. Joan of France called upon all the barons of Brittany to respond. They besieged all the castles of the Penthi\u00e8vre family one by one. Joan ended the conflict by seizing the dowager countess of Penthi\u00e8vre, [[Margaret of Clisson]], and forcing her to have the duke freed.\n\nJoan died in 1433, during her husband's reign.\n\nA [[Book of Hours]] by the [[Bedford Master]], ''[[Heures Lamoignon]]'', was dedicated to her.\n\n==Issue ==\nShe had seven children:\n\n*Anne (1409 \u2013 c. 1415)\n* [[Isabella of Brittany|Isabella]] (1411 \u2013 c. 1442), who in 1435 married [[Guy XIV of Laval]] and had 3 children with him.\n*Margaret (1412 \u2013 c. 1421)\n* [[Francis I, Duke of Brittany|Francis I]] (1414 \u2013 c. 1450), duke of Brittany\n*Catherine (1416 \u2013 c. 1421)\n* [[Peter II, Duke of Brittany|Peter II]] (1418 \u2013 c. 1457), duke of Brittany\n* [[Gilles of Brittany|Gilles]] (1420 \u2013 c. 1450), [[lord|seigneur]] of Chantoc\u00e9.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

After being passed over for succession as [[Aga Khan]], he served as the [[Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations]] from 1958 to 1960, where he became a vice president of the General Assembly.\n\nHis first name was typically spelled \"Aly\" in the press. The titles of prince and princess, which are claimed by children of the Aga Khan by virtue of their descent from the [[Qajar]] king [[Fath Ali Shah]] of the [[Persia|Persian]] [[Qajar dynasty]] of Turkic origin, were recognized as [[courtesy title]]s by the British government in 1938.<ref name=\"throne\">[[Anne Edwards|Edwards, Anne]] (1996).

His father was born in [[Karachi]], [[British India]] (now in modern-day Pakistan). His mother was [[Italians|Italian]]. His paternal grandfather was born in [[Iran]]. He had two brothers: Prince Giuseppe Mahdi Aga Khan (who died in 1911) and, by his father's third marriage, [[Sadruddin Aga Khan]].

There isn't any amount of money in the entire world for which it is worth sacrificing this child's privilege of living as a normal Christian girl here in the United States. There just isn't anything else in the world that can compare with her sacred chance to do that.

His father, however, strongly opposed the union with another Hollywood actress. After a year-long engagement, Tierney separated from the Prince and moved back to the United States to tend to her mental health.<ref>[http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/267/Gene+Tierney/index.html \"The Private Life and Times of Gene Tierney\"]</ref><ref>Tierney and Herskowitz (1978) Wyden Books, Self- Portrait p.157-158</ref> In the late 1950s Aly was known to start dating the [[fashion]] model [[Simone Micheline Bodin]] (who called herself [[Bettina Graziani]]).

He died shortly afterward at [[Foch Hospital]] (in Suresnes). Bettina survived with a minor injury to her forehead, though the shock of the accident would result in a miscarriage.

Markey]], owner of [[Calumet Farm]] [[Thoroughbred]] racing stable in [[Lexington, KY]], named one of her outstanding [[colt (horse)|colts]], \"[[Alydar]]\" in his honor because she always addressed the prince as, \"Aly Darling\".\n\nIn the British 1969 #1 hit song \"[[Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?]]\", singer/lyricist [[Peter Sarstedt]] sings to his girlfriend, who has become a famous top socialite and she knows the Aga Khan, who has sent her a race horse for Christmas, which she keeps just for a laugh.\n\nIn the 20 May 2012 episode of ''[[Mad Men]]'', Don Draper mentions that he thought Joan Harris was seeing Aly Khan, given the frequency of flower deliveries to her office.\n\nIn a ''[[Honeymooners]]'' episode titled \"The Golfer\", which first aired on 15 October 1955, Alice Kramden \u2014 when asked about the whereabouts of her husband Ralph \u2014 facetiously exclaims, \"He's out tiger hunting with Aly Khan.\"\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Ismaili imams]]\n* [[Fatimids]]\n* [[Isma'ilism]]\n* [[Nizari]]\n* [[Aga Khan]]\n\n==References==\n;Inline\n{{reflist}}\n\n;General\n* [[Simone Micheline Bodin|Bettina]] (1965).

This episode is based on the [[Sharpe's Company (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Bernard Cornwell]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nIt is 1812. General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellesley]] ([[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]]) is ready to invade Spain from Portugal. But two formidable fortresses stand in the way. When the first, [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], is taken, [[William Lawford|Colonel Lawford]] is severely wounded and forced to relinquish command of the [[South Essex Regiment]], depriving Captain Sharpe ([[Sean Bean]]) of an influential friend.\n\nColonel Windham ([[Clive Francis]]), the new commander, brings his own officers, so Sharpe is demoted to lieutenant and is humiliated by being put in charge of the baggage and losing command of his \"chosen men\" to an aristocratic officer ([[Marc Warren]]) who [[sale of commissions|purchased the commission]] of the South Essex's Light Company. Worse, one of the reinforcements is Sergeant [[Obidiah Hakeswill]] ([[Pete Postlethwaite]]), an old enemy from Sharpe's days in India.\n\nMeanwhile, Sharpe's lover, Teresa ([[Assumpta Serna]]), tells him that he has a baby daughter living with her family in [[Badajoz]], the second fortress town. Not knowing who she is, Hakeswill tries to rape her, but proves no match for her. Teresa then slips into Badajoz to spy on the French and to see her baby.\n\nTo cause trouble for Sharpe, Hakeswill steals from the officers and plants a picture frame belonging to Windham in the kit of Sharpe's right-hand man, Sergeant Harper ([[Daragh O'Malley]]). When it is found, the colonel has Harper flogged. Later, during a night skirmish, a turncoat French soldier escapes the besieged town, bearing a dispatch and a letter from Teresa, but he is shot and killed. Sharpe recovers the letter, which contains a map showing where she is staying, but on his way back Hakeswill tries to shoot Sharpe in the confusion, but kills a young ensign ([[William Mannering]]) who has the misfortune to step in front of him at that exact moment.\n\nEventually the walls of [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|Badajoz are breached]], but the first assault falters. Sharpe rallies the men and leads them into the town. Hakeswill gets to Teresa first due to the letter he stole from Sharpe, [[List of Sharpe series characters#In the TV series|Harry Price]], one of Sharpe's officers, intervenes and is shot and apparently killed by Hakeswill while trying to protect Teresa. (Price reappears, in ''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]'', this time played by Nicholas Irons.) Sharpe is not far behind and stops Hakeswill, who is wounded in the process, but Hakeswill still manages to get away.\n\nFor his bravery and because many of the other officers have been killed, Sharpe gets back command of his Light Company.

General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellesley]] ([[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]]) is ready to invade Spain from Portugal. But two formidable fortresses stand in the way. When the first, [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], is taken, [[William Lawford|Colonel Lawford]] is severely wounded and forced to relinquish command of the [[South Essex Regiment]], depriving Captain Sharpe ([[Sean Bean]]) of an influential friend.\n\nColonel Windham ([[Clive Francis]]), the new commander, brings his own officers, so Sharpe is demoted to lieutenant and is humiliated by being put in charge of the baggage and losing command of his \"chosen men\" to an aristocratic officer ([[Marc Warren]]) who [[sale of commissions|purchased the commission]] of the South Essex's Light Company. Worse, one of the reinforcements is Sergeant [[Obidiah Hakeswill]] ([[Pete Postlethwaite]]), an old enemy from Sharpe's days in India.\n\nMeanwhile, Sharpe's lover, Teresa ([[Assumpta Serna]]), tells him that he has a baby daughter living with her family in [[Badajoz]], the second fortress town. Not knowing who she is, Hakeswill tries to rape her, but proves no match for her. Teresa then slips into Badajoz to spy on the French and to see her baby.\n\nTo cause trouble for Sharpe, Hakeswill steals from the officers and plants a picture frame belonging to Windham in the kit of Sharpe's right-hand man, Sergeant Harper ([[Daragh O'Malley]]). When it is found, the colonel has Harper flogged. Later, during a night skirmish, a turncoat French soldier escapes the besieged town, bearing a dispatch and a letter from Teresa, but he is shot and killed. Sharpe recovers the letter, which contains a map showing where she is staying, but on his way back Hakeswill tries to shoot Sharpe in the confusion, but kills a young ensign ([[William Mannering]]) who has the misfortune to step in front of him at that exact moment.\n\nEventually the walls of [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|Badajoz are breached]], but the first assault falters. Sharpe rallies the men and leads them into the town. Hakeswill gets to Teresa first due to the letter he stole from Sharpe, [[List of Sharpe series characters#In the TV series|Harry Price]], one of Sharpe's officers, intervenes and is shot and apparently killed by Hakeswill while trying to protect Teresa. (Price reappears, in ''[[Sharpe's Waterloo]]'', this time played by Nicholas Irons.) Sharpe is not far behind and stops Hakeswill, who is wounded in the process, but Hakeswill still manages to get away.\n\nFor his bravery and because many of the other officers have been killed, Sharpe gets back command of his Light Company. Harper is exonerated when he finds the missing portrait of Windham's wife hidden in Hakeswill's [[shako]] and returns it to the colonel.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[Richard Sharpe (fictional character)|Richard Sharpe]]\n* [[Daragh O'Malley]] as Sergeant [[Patrick Harper (fiction)|Patrick Harper]]\n* [[Assumpta Serna]] as [[Teresa Moreno|Comandante Teresa Moreno]]\n* [[Clive Francis]] as Colonel Windham \n* [[Nicholas Jones (actor)|Nicholas Jones]] as Colonel Fletcher \n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as [[Nairn (fictional character)|Major Nairn]]\n* [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] as [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Lord Wellington]]\n* [[Michael Cochrane]] as [[Sir Henry Simmerson]]\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as Sergeant [[Obadiah Hakeswill]]\n* [[Michael Mears]] as Rifleman Francis Cooper\n* [[John Tams]] as [[Daniel Hagman|Rifleman Daniel Hagman]]\n* [[Jason Salkey]] as [[Sergeant Harris|Rifleman Harris]]\n* [[Lyndon Davies]] as Rifleman Ben Perkins\n* [[William Mannering]] as  Ensign Matthews ([[Viscount]])\n* [[Scott Cleverdon]] as [[Harry Price (fictional character)|Lieutenant Harry Price]]\n* [[Robert Morgan (British actor)|Robert Morgan]] as Major Collett\n* [[Peter Gunn (actor)|Peter Gunn]] as Private Clayton\n* [[Louise Germaine]] as Sally Clayton\n* [[Soo Drouet]] as Mrs. Grimes\n* [[Marc Warren]] as Captain Rymer\n* [[Peter Birrel]] as Don Moreno\n* [[Tat Whalley]] as Hope\n* [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Pradon]] as Reynier\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0111156|title=Sharpe's Company}}\n* [http://www.sharpefilm.com/company/index.html Sharpe's Company at SharpeFilm.com]\n\n{{Bernard Cornwell}}\n\n[[Category:1994 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:1990s historical films]]\n[[Category:1990s war films]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on historical novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on military novels]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars films]]\n[[Category:Sharpe (TV series)|Company]]\n[[Category:War television films]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1812]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe%27s_Company_(TV_programme)"}
