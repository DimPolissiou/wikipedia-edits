To progress through the game, players are tasked with moving between various  platforms and solving intricate puzzles. The game world unfolds to the player in the form of a [[Metroidvania]], with new movement abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas. Unlike its predecessor ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest|The Blind Forest]]'', ''Will of the Wisps'' relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \"soul links\", and the sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a \"shard\" system that allows players to upgrade Ori in various ways, like sticking to walls and those that are equipped can be changed on the fly.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |title= Ori and the Will of the Wisps is taking serious inspiration from Zelda with its new focus on fluid combat |last= Loveridge |first= Sam |date= February 27, 2020 |accessdate= March 3, 2020 |work= [[GamesRadar+]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303061750/https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |title= Soul Links in Ori and the Will of the Wisps \"didn't make sense\", says developer |last= Donovan |first= Imogen |date= March 9, 2020 |accessdate= March 15, 2020 |work= VideoGamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200314191058/https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |archive-date= March 14, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nThe game's story is centered on a new adventure to discover the world beyond the forest of Nibel, uncover the truths of the lost ones, and unearth Ori's true destiny.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ori-will-of-the-wisps|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps for Xbox One and Windows 10|website=Xbox.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821213035/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ori-will-of-the-wisps|archive-date=2017-08-21|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2018.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to Ku. Ku is born with a damaged wing, rendering her unable to fly before Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking themselves to Niwen, where a storm causes Ori and Ku to be separated. \n\nOri's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad who looked over the Inkwater Marsh. He asks Ori to set The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water and allowing Ori to enter the Silent Woods, and its graveyard of owls where Ku had fallen. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]], desperate to rejoin with them. Ori clears the water and finds Ku with them having a brief encounter with Shriek, a deformed owl who was an orphan on birth and rejected by the rest of her kind. Ori and Ku attempt to escape the Silent Woods and Shriek, but she intervenes and kills Ku.\n\nAfter Ori mourns over Ku, Kwolok explains to them the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's passing, the light it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered all across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed all of the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori to seek out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. During Ori's journey to complete this task, they run into Kwolok again, being controlled by a hostile creature Ori previously encountered in The Wellspring. Ori breaks its control over Kwolok, allowing Kwolok to kill the creature, but with its control having taken its toll, Kwolok dies shortly after. In Kwolok's final moments, he pleads for Ori to watch over Niwen, stating Ori may be the only one who can.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow, but are ambushed by Shriek along the way; Seir attacks Shriek to defend it and Ori, but a sympathetic Ori stops Seir from attacking her any further. Shriek however, rejects Ori's kindness and flies away, while Naru and Gumo arrive at Niwen at roughly the same time. Upon arriving at the Spirit Willow, Seir revives it. However, the tree states to Ori it can no longer carry Seir and asks them to merge with Seir to restore Niwen, though Ori would have to leave their previous life behind. Before Seir can return to Ori, Shriek reappears and snatches Seir. After a hard battle, Ori defeats Shriek, who, still unwilling to accept change, returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her decayed parents. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way to Seir and merges with it, restoring Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they discover a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. The three work together to allow the tree to flourish while the Spirit Tree, narrating, reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the Spirit Tree completely grew and life began anew. The game ends with the cycle beginning again, as a new spirit guardian falls from the tree.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience,\" explains Daniel Smith, senior producer at Xbox Games Studios, who has been attached to the Ori projects since before the first title launched.\n\n\"But our community told us that there wasn't a lot of draw to come back in once they'd completed the title.

Goroff further mentioned that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines ''The Blind Forest''{{'}}s mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with 'emotional platformers', ''Will of the Wisps'' doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience\".<ref name=\"EGMreview\"/> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner praised the game's graphics, story and combat, subsequently calling the game better than its predecessor. Reiner said that \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game.

Moreover, he highlighted occasional visual bugs as negative aspects of the game.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> \n\nAustin Wood, reviewer for ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', acclaimed the game and its \"breathtaking music\", world and its platforming.

It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp'' is an irresistible challenge.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to Ku. Ku is born with a damaged wing, rendering her unable to fly before Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking themselves to Niwen, where a storm causes Ori and Ku to be separated. \n\nOri's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad who looked over the Inkwater Marsh. He asks Ori to set The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water and allowing for Ori to enter the Silent Woods, and its graveyard of owls where Ku had fallen. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]], desperate to rejoin with them. Ori clears the water and finds Ku with them having a brief encounter with Shriek, a deformed owl who was an orphan on birth and rejected by the rest of her kind. Ori and Ku attempt to escape the Silent Woods and Shriek, but she intervenes and kills Ku.\n\nAfter Ori mourns over Ku, Kwolok explains to them the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's passing, the light it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered all across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed all of the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori to seek out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. During Ori's journey to complete this task, they run into Kwolok again, being controlled by a hostile creature Ori previously encountered in The Wellspring. Ori breaks its control over Kwolok, allowing Kwolok to kill the creature, but with its control having taken its toll, Kwolok dies shortly after. In Kwolok's final moments, he pleads for Ori to watch over Niwen, stating Ori may be the only one who can.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow, but are ambushed by Shriek along the way; Seir attacks Shriek to defend it and Ori, but a sympathetic Ori stops Seir from attacking her any further. Shriek however, rejects Ori's kindness and flies away, while Naru and Gumo arrive at Niwen at roughly the same time. Upon arriving at the Spirit Willow, Seir revives it. However, the tree states to Ori it can no longer carry Seir and asks them to merge with Seir to restore Niwen, though Ori would have to leave their previous life behind. Before Seir can return to Ori, Shriek reappears and snatches Seir. After a hard battle, Ori defeats Shriek, who, still unwilling to accept change, returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her decayed parents. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way to Seir and merges with it, restoring Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they discover a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. The three work together to allow the tree to flourish while the Spirit Tree, narrating, reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the Spirit Tree completely grew and life began anew. The game ends with the cycle beginning again, as a new spirit guardian falls from the tree.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience,\" explains Daniel Smith, senior producer at Xbox Games Studios, who has been attached to the Ori projects since before the first title launched.\n\n\"But our community told us that there wasn't a lot of draw to come back in once they'd completed the title.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

It is part of a chain of islands in the west of the country that make up [[Sandys Parish, Bermuda|Sandys Parish]], lying between the larger [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]] and [[Watford Island, Bermuda]], with which it has been joined by a man-made isthmus. South of Watford Island is [[Somerset Island, Bermuda|Somerset Island]]. Boaz and Watford are connected to Somerset by Watford Bridge, and to Ireland by Gray's Bridge. Watford's east coast forms part of the edge of the [[Great Sound, Bermuda|Great Sound]]. The western end of the channel between Boaz and Watford was blocked by the isthmus, creating a [[camber]] that opens to the Great Sound. Boaz and Watford Islands were parts of the Royal Naval base, which included the HM Dockyard on Ireland Island.\n\nThe Clarence Barracks were built on Boaz in the middle of the 19th century to house convict labourers who had formerly been accommodated aboard [[Prison hulks]]. A hospital and other connected facilities were built on neighboring Watford Island. When the Convict Establishment was withdrawn in the 1860s, both islands were transferred to the [[British Army]], and the bridge between was replaced with the [[Causeway|man-made isthmus]].\n\n[[File:RNAS Boaz Island Bermuda Hangar.jpg|thumb|Hangar at RNAS Boaz Island]]\nWith the reduction of the [[Bermuda Garrison]] after the [[First World War]], both islands were returned to the Royal Navy in the 1930s. From 1939, Boaz Island and Watford Island were used as [[RNAS Boaz Island (HMS Malabar)|Royal Naval Air Station Boaz Island]]. The primary role of the air station was the servicing, repair and replacement of spotter floatplanes and flying boats belonging to naval vessels. Early in the Second World War, with no other units to fill the role, aeroplanes from Boaz Island were used to maintain anti-submarine air patrols, using whatever aircrew were on hand, including pilots from the Bermuda Flying School on Darrell's Island.

Its east coast forms part of the edge of the [[Great Sound, Bermuda|Great Sound]]. Boaz Island was part of the Royal Naval base, which included the HM Dockyard on Ireland Island.\n\nBarracks were built there in the middle of the 19th century to house convict labourers who had formerly been housed aboard [[Prison hulks]]. A hospital and other connected facilities were built on neighboring Watford Island.

The primary role of the air station was the servicing, repair and replacement of spotter floatplanes and flying boats belonging to naval vessels. Early in the Second World War, with no other units to fill the role, aeroplanes from Boaz Island were used to maintain anti-submarine air patrols, using whatever aircrew were on hand, including pilots from the Bermuda Flying School on Darrell's Island.

The Romanian administration and military were evacuated, and the [[Red Army]] and [[NKVD]] quickly [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied the land]]. Many families were caught by surprise by the rapid sequence of events, and had members on both sides of the new border. Therefore, many tried to cross the border, with or without official permission. According to official Soviet data, during{{Specify|date=April 2007}}, in the area patrolled by the 97th Unit of Soviet Border Troops, 471 people had crossed the border illegally from the districts of [[Hlyboka]], [[Hertsa]], [[Putila]], and [[Storozhynets]]. The zone assigned to this unit extended from the border to about 7.5&nbsp;km (4.7&nbsp;mi) south of [[Chernivtsi]].\n\nFrom the more remote areas of the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] (northern portion of the acquired territories that was included in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]), such as the districts of [[Vashkivtsi]], [[Zastavna]], [[Novoselytsia]], [[Sadhora]], and Chernivtsi-rural, during{{Specify|date=April 2007}}, 628 people crossed the border to find refuge in Romania. This phenomenon cut across all ethnic and social groups in the occupied territories. A [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] scholar estimated the number of refugees to Romania during the first year of Soviet administration at 7,000.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nThe Soviet authorities' reaction to this phenomenon was twofold. First, border patrol efforts were strengthened. Second, lists were made of families that had one or more members which had fled to Romania, and thus were considered \"[[Traitor of Motherland Family Member|traitors of the Motherland]]\", therefore subject to [[labor camp]] deportation. On January 1, 1941, the lists made by the 97th Unit of the Soviet Border Guards mentioned 1,085 persons. Tables for other localities included names for 1,294 people (on December 7, 1940). At this point, even people who were merely suspected of intending to flee to Romania began to be included.\n\nOn November 19, 1940, 40 families (a total of 105 people) from [[Cernauti-|Suceveni]] village, also carrying 20 guns, tried to cross the frontier at F\u00e2nt\u00e2na Alb\u0103. At night, a battle ensued with the Soviet border guards, during which 3 people were killed, 2 were wounded and captured by the Soviets, while the rest of the group (including 5 wounded) managed to arrive in [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i]], on the other side of the border. However, in short order, the relatives of the 105 people were all arrested and deported to Siberia.<ref name=\"Popescu\">Popescu</ref>\n\nIn January 1941, over 100 villagers from [[Cernauti-|Mahala]], [[Ostri\u0163a]], [[Horecea]] and other villages successfully crossed the border and arrived in Romania.<ref name=\"Popescu\"/> This gave confidence to other villagers. Therefore, a group of over 500 people from the villages of Mahala, [[Cotul-Ostri\u0163ei]], [[Buda (Bukovina)|Buda]], [[Sir\u0103u\u0163i]], [[Horecea-Urbana]], and Ostri\u0163a tried to cross to Romania during the night of February 6, 1941. However, they had been denounced to the authorities and were discovered by the border guards at 06:00. Volleys of machinegun fire from multiple directions resulted in numerous dead, including the organizers N. Merticar, N. Nica, and N. Isac. About 57 people managed to reach Romania, but 44 others were arrested and tried as \"members of a counter-revolutionary organization\".<ref name=\"Popescu\"/> On April 14, 1941, the [[Kiev]] Military District Tribunal sentenced 12 of them to death, while the other 32 were sentenced to 10 years forced labor and 5 years of loss of civic rights each.

Mihailiuc describes what happened at F\u00e2nt\u00e2na Alb\u0103 on April 1, 1941, as a \"[[massacre]]\", a \"genocide\", and a \"slaughter\".<ref>Cre\u0163u</ref>\n\nThere is some controversy as to whether or not the Soviet border guards warned the column of people to stop before firing upon it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Some sources say that the Soviets ordered the column to halt, but that a flag-bearer in front of the column reassured the people that the guards were forbidden to open fire upon groups of over 20.

As a result of emigration and killings,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} the Romanian population of [[Romanians of Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi region]] dropped by more than 75,000 between the Romanian 1930 census and the first Soviet census of 1959.

A [[fossil]] of the single and [[type species]], ''B. taimyrensis'', has been discovered in [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] of the Early [[Devonian]] [[Period (geology)|period]] ([[Lochkovian]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]) in the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Siberia]], [[Russia]]. The name of the genus honors [[Carsten Borchgrevink]], an Anglo-Norwegian [[explorer]] who participated in many expeditions to [[Antarctica]]. ''Borchgrevinkium'' represents a poorly known genus whose affinities are uncertain.\n\nIt had several unique characteristics that differentiated it from many other arthropods, such as its long parabolic (nearly U-shaped) [[prosoma]] (head), its elongated first and second [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]] and the presence of paired \"ridges\" in the surface of its third to tenth [[tergite]]s ([[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]] halves of the segments). Furthermore, the [[opisthosoma]] ([[Abdomen#Other animals|abdomen]]) of ''Borchgrevinkium'' was triangular, and its [[telson]] (\"tail\"), short and wedge-shaped. It was a small [[animal]], approximately {{convert|3|cm|abbr=off}} long.\n\nThe only known specimen of the genus was collected in 1956 and described in 1959 by the Russian paleontologist [[Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov]]. He determined that it was a [[eurypterid]] and classified it in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Mycteroptidae]]. However, its classification changed repeatedly over the years, being transferred from Eurypterida to [[Xiphosura]] and back to Eurypterida some time later. Nowadays, ''Borchgrevinkium'' is tentatively considered as a [[prosomapod]], with more fossil material needed to ensure its current classification.\n\n== Description ==\nThe size of the only known specimen of ''Borchgrevinkium'', PIN 1271/1, is estimated more or less at {{convert|3|cm|abbr=off}}, making it a small [[arthropod]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|url=https://iris.univ-lille.fr/handle/1908/2215|title=M\u00e9rostomates du D\u00e9vonien inf\u00e9rieur et moyen de Sib\u00e9rie|first=Nestor I.|last=Novojilov|author-link= Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov|journal=Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9ologique du Nord|volume=78|language=fr|year=1959|pp=243\u2013258}}</ref>\n\nThe [[prosoma]] was longer than wider (covering one third of the length of the [[animal]]), parabolic (nearly U-shaped) and with a length of {{convert|1.35|cm|abbr=on}}.

The prosomal [[Arthropod leg|appendages]] (limbs) are only known by the tip of poorly preserved left pairs. They were short, undifferentiated and [[Spine (zoology)|spiniferous]]. The [[opisthosoma]] ([[Abdomen#Other animals|abdomen]]) was triangular and {{convert|1.23|cm|abbr=on}} long. It was composed of 12 [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]], with the first one being exceptionally long and forming with the second segment an \"extension\" of the prosoma.

Furthermore, these tergites had on their surfaces converging paired \"folds\" or \"ridges\" that progressively narrowed to the center of the tenth tergite. These ridges were almost parallel to the [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] lobes. On the eleventh tergite, the edges were slightly curved. The pretelson (the segment that preceded the tail) had a bifid (divided into two lobes) dorsal projection. The [[telson]] (the \"tail\") was cuneiform (wedge-like), short and narrow, and measured {{convert|0.45|cm|abbr=on}}.

It was deposited in the [[Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], in [[Moscow]]. Novojilov considered it unique enough to be erected as a new [[genus]], ''Borchgrevinkium'', named after the Anglo-Norwegian [[explorer]] [[Carsten Borchgrevink]] for his expeditions to [[Antarctica]]. He compared it with the then [[xiphosura]]n genus ''[[Weinbergina]]'', assuming that ''Borchgrevinkium'' was also a xiphosuran. However, the Norwegian paleontologist [[Leif St\u00f8rmer]], who assisted him during his study, noticed that what Novojilov had considered to be an accidental fissure was actually part of the \"macrosegment\" (the first segment), finding as well the tip of the appendages after closer examination. The presence of this macrosegment convinced Novojilov that ''Borchgrevinkium'' represented a new [[eurypterid]], more specifically one part of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Mycteroptidae]]. Afterwards, he compared it to the [[species]] ''[[Mycterops|Mycterops matthieui]]'' and ''[[Woodwardopterus|Woodwardopterus scabrosus]]'' (members of the family), without finding many similarities but still classifying ''Borchgrevinkium'' in the eurypterid group.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Borchgrevinkium'' was remitted to the family Woodwardopteridae together with ''Woodwardopterus'' in 1966 by the American paleontologist Erik Norman Kjellesvig-Waering.

''Borchgrevinkium'' might belong to this clade as well.]]\n''Borchgrevinkium'' was originally described as a mycteroptid eurypterid by Novojilov, although he also noted a certain resemblance to ''Weinbergina'', especially for the paired \"ridges\" that both have on their tergites.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nowadays, his descriptions are considered inaccurate, inexhaustive and based only on the best preserved material.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the genus continued being considered by other authors as a eurypterid. In 1966, Kjellesvig-Waering classified ''Borchgrevinkium'' with ''Woodwardopterus'' in the family Woodwardopteridae. He based this conclusion on the similarity of the ornamentation, the shape of the prosoma and the exceptional size of the first two segments of both.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1972, St\u00f8rmer questioned the affiliation of the genus in this clade and suggested that it might represent a chasmataspidid within the [[Order (biology)|order]] Xiphosura.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Arthropods from the Lower Devonian (Lower Emsian) of Alken an der Mosel, Germany.

The woodwardopterines were presumably united by the great elongation of the first two segments.<ref name=\":5\" /> This point of view was not approved by other researchers, and eventually Woodwardopterina was [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] with [[Stylonurina]] and Woodwardopteridae with Mycteroptidae.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nNowadays, ''Borchgrevinkium'' is a highly uncertain and problematic genus. Its eurypterid nature was soon denied again in 2013, when Lamsdell placed it in the clade Prosomapoda. It encomapasses all [[chelicerate]]s with prosomal uniramous appendages (appendages composed of a single series of [[Podomere|segments]] attached end-to-end) in the adult stage (excluding the sixth and last appendage). However, the appendages of ''Borchgrevinkium'' are poorly known.

The name of the genus honors [[Carsten Borchgrevink]], an Anglo-Norwegian [[explorer]] who participated in many expeditions to [[Antarctica]]. ''Borchgrevinkium'' represents a poorly known genus whose affinities are uncertain.\n\nIt had several unique characteristics that differentiated it from many other arthropods, such as its long parabolic (nearly U-shaped) [[prosoma]] (head), its elongated first and second [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]] and the presence of paired \"ridges\" in the surface of its third to tenth [[tergite]]s ([[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]] halves of the segments).

He determined that it was a [[eurypterid]] and classified it in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Mycteroptidae]]. However, its classification changed repeatedly over the years, being transferred from Eurypterida to [[Xiphosura]] and back to Eurypterida some time later.

The prosomal [[Arthropod leg|appendages]] (limbs) are only known by the tip of poorly preserved left pairs. They were short, undifferentiated and [[Spine (zoology)|spiniferous]]. The [[opisthosoma]] ([[Abdomen#Other animals|abdomen]]) was triangular and {{convert|1.23|cm|abbr=on}} long. It was composed of 12 [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]], with the first one being exceptionally long and forming with the second segment an \"extension\" of the prosoma.

Furthermore, these tergites had on their surfaces converging paired \"folds\" or \"ridges\" that progressively narrowed to the center of the tenth tergite. These ridges were almost parallel to the [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] lobes. On the eleventh tergite, the edges were slightly curved. The pretelson (the segment that preceded the tail) had a bifid (divided into two lobes) dorsal projection. The [[telson]] (the \"tail\") was cuneiform (wedge-like), short and narrow, and measured {{convert|0.45|cm|abbr=on}}.

He compared it with the then [[xiphosura]]n genus ''[[Weinbergina]]'', assuming that ''Borchgrevinkium'' was also a xiphosuran. However, the Norwegian paleontologist [[Leif St\u00f8rmer]], who assisted him during his study, noticed that what Novojilov had considered to be an accidental fissure was actually part of the \"macrosegment\" (the first segment), finding as well the tip of the appendages after closer examination. The presence of this macrosegment convinced Novojilov that ''Borchgrevinkium'' represented a new [[eurypterid]], more specifically one part of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Mycteroptidae]]. Afterwards, he compared it to the [[species]] ''[[Mycterops|Mycterops matthieui]]'' and ''[[Woodwardopterus|Woodwardopterus scabrosus]]'' (members of the family), without finding many similarities but still classifying ''Borchgrevinkium'' in the eurypterid group.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Borchgrevinkium'' was remitted to the family Woodwardopteridae together with ''Woodwardopterus'' in 1966 by the American paleontologist Erik Norman Kjellesvig-Waering.

In 1966, Kjellesvig-Waering classified ''Borchgrevinkium'' with ''Woodwardopterus'' in the family Woodwardopteridae. He based this conclusion on the similarity of the ornamentation, the shape of the prosoma and the exceptional size of the first two segments of both.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1972, St\u00f8rmer questioned the affiliation of the genus in this clade and suggested that it might represent a chasmataspidid within the [[Order (biology)|order]] Xiphosura.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Arthropods from the Lower Devonian (Lower Emsian) of Alken an der Mosel, Germany.

The woodwardopterines were presumably united by the great elongation of the first two segments.<ref name=\":5\" /> This point of view was not approved by other researchers, and eventually Woodwardopterina was [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] with [[Stylonurina]] and Woodwardopteridae with Mycteroptidae.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nNowadays, ''Borchgrevinkium'' is a highly uncertain and problematic genus. Its eurypterid nature was soon denied again in 2013, when Lamsdell placed it in the clade Prosomapoda.

Unsurprisingly, Goldie turns on Louie until she sees that he's invited to Doofus' birthday party and asks him to take her. They arrive pretending to be an aunt and nephew intending to take all of the million-dollar gift bags. However, Doofus sniffs out frauds among his guests and sends them to his \"Honey Bin\", leaving Louie and Goldie; Glomgold and his puppet-son; and Beaks and his robot-son, B.O.Y.D. (Nicolas Cantu). Once he's removed the villains, Doofus demands to know who ruined his party. Goldie blames Louie, so Doofus programs B.O.Y.D. to attack him, but Goldie saves him. The party turns out to be a test, as Doofus claims Goldie as his new \"Gemeemama\". Louie's allowed to leave with the gift bags, but he decides to rescue Goldie. He gives B.O.Y.D. to Doofus as a brother, who transfers half of his fortune to his account for his new parents ([[Yuri Lowenthal]] & [[Tara Platt]]), who finally stand up to Doofus and ground him. During the confusion, Goldie steals the gift bags, but keeps a picture of Louie.

The others arrive to help Lena, but Magica turns her into a copy of her, so they'll attack her instead and prove her point.

A US population strategy and action to create conditions for fertility decline. A major concern reiterated in the paper concerns the effect of population on starvation and famine.\n\n\"Growing populations will have a serious impact on the need for food especially in the poorest, fastest growing LDCs.[least developed countries] While under normal weather conditions and assuming food production growth in line with recent trends, total world agricultural production could expand faster than population, there will nevertheless be serious problems in food distribution and financing, making shortages, even at today's poor nutrition levels, probable in many of the larger more populous LDC regions. Even today 10 to 20 million people die each year due, directly or indirectly, to malnutrition. Even more serious is the consequence of major crop failures which are likely to occur from time to time.\n\n\"The most serious consequence for the short and middle term is the possibility of massive famines in certain parts of the world, especially the poorest regions.

The [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] National Champion was [[Joe Leonard]] and the [[Indianapolis 500]] winner was [[Al Unser]].

On February 18, the non-championship races at Rafaela were tranformed into a points-paying double round, due to a request from race organizers. On June 9, the Langhorne round was cancelled after the drivers refused to race at the outdated venue, and on June 30, USAC cancelled the race at the new Mountaineer Speedway, which was never built to completion. The 1971 season was the first time the 500 mile triple crown was on the schedule with the addition of Ontario Motor Speedway's California 500 the previous year & the Pocono 500 added in this season.<ref name=\"Speedsport\" /><ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n{{-}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%\"\n|-\n!
