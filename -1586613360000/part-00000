Rowe, [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] and [[Robert R. Reisz]] in [[2011 in paleontology|2011]]; the [[type species]] is ''Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis''. The [[Genus#Generic_name|generic name]] honours Sarah Butler and is derived from the greek ''sauros'' meaning \"lizard\". The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from ''aurum'' (Latin), \"gold\", and ''fontanalis'' (Latin), \"of the spring\" in reference to Gold Spring, Arizona, where the holotype was found. ''Sarahsaurus'' is the fourth basal sauropodomorph dinosaur to have been identified in [[North America]]; the other three are ''[[Anchisaurus]]'' and ''[[Ammosaurus]]'' from the Early Jurassic of the [[Connecticut River Valley]], and ''[[Seitaad]]'' of the later [[Navajo Sandstone]] of Early Jurassic Utah. It is thought to have appeared through a dispersal event that originated in South America and was separate from those of the other two sauropodomorphs.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/> The animal is notable for possessing very large, powerful hands, possibly suggesting that it was an omnivore.<ref>http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101006-new-dinosaur-north-america-science/</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Skull===\nThe {{Dinogloss|external naris}} (skull opening for the nostril) was less than half the size of the orbit (eye socket). It was bordered by the nasal, premaxilla, and, to a small extent, the maxilla, the latter two forming the upper jaw. Between the premaxilla and maxilla there was a large opening, the subnarial foramen. The antorbital fossa, an additional skull opening seen in most dinosaurs that was situated between the external naris and orbit, was less then half the length of the orbit. Much of the upper margin of the orbit was formed by the {{Dinogloss|frontal bone}} of the {{Dinogloss|skull roof}}; this bone, however, did not contribute to the front margin of the {{Dinogloss|upper temporal fenestra}} at the rear end of the skull roof. Instead, this front margin was formed by the {{Dinogloss|postorbital}} and {{Dinogloss|parietal bones}}, with the front part of the parietal being forked to connect with the latter. Between the parietal and the supraoccipital, which follows behind the parietal at the back of the skull, was another opening, the postparietal fenestra, which was large in ''Sarahsaurus''. A unique feature of the genus can be found on the underside of the braincase, where a shallow ridge spanned between the {{Dinogloss|basipterygoid processes}}, bony downwards projections of the braincase that brace the latter against the {{Dinogloss|palate}}. The lower jaw curved downwards towards its tip, and the jaw joint was located well below the level of the tooth row. There is no evidence for a beak.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/><ref name=\"marsh2018\"/>\n\nEach side of the upper jaw was lined with 20 teeth \u2013 four in the premaxilla, the front bone of the upper jaw, and 16 in the maxilla which followed behind. The dentary bone of the lower jaw likewise had 20 teeth. The teeth were moderately [[heterodont]], i.e., tooth shape varied within the jaw, and sat slightly obliquely in the jaw, slightly overlapping each other. Their cutting edges were {{Dinogloss|serrated}} with up to 20 {{Dinogloss|denticles}} per tooth.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/>\n\n===Postcranium===\nThe spine comprised 10 cervical (neck) vertebrae; 14 dorsal (trunk) vertebrae; three sacral (hip) vertebrae; and ca. 50 caudal (tail) vertebrae. In contrast to the later [[sauropods]], the sides of the dorsal vertebrae did not show deep cavities caused by [[air sacs]] invading the bone ({{Dinogloss|postcranial skeletal pneumaticity}}). The scapula (shoulder blade) was hourglass-shaped. In the holotype specimen, the scapula and [[coracoid]] were unfused, probably connected only via cartilage; this might indicate that the individual was not yet fully mature. The [[clavicle]] was probably connected to the [[sternum]] via a [[synovial joint]]. The left and right clavicles were attached to each other, probably by a [[ligament]], but not fused. The [[humerus]] (upper arm bone) was more than half the length of the [[femur]] (upper thigh bone), and had a large crest on its front side for muscle attachment, the {{Dinogloss|deltopectoral crest}}, which extended for half the length of the bone and had a S-shaped edge. In the hand, the {{Dinogloss|ungual}} (claw bone) of the first finger was the largest.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/>\n\nIn the hip, the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] had two downwards-facing bony projections, the ischial and pubic peduncle, which connected to the two lower hip bones, the ischium and the pubis, respectively, as in other dinosaurs. In ''Sarahsaurus'',  the ischial peduncle was only half the length of the pubic peduncle. The {{Dinogloss|acetabulum}} (hip joint) was formed by all three hip bones, as in other dinosaurs, though in ''Sarahsaurus'' the ischium contributed less than half as much as the pubis. The pubis was unique in having two separate openings, the {{Dinogloss|obturator foramen}} and the pubic foramen; the latter was lacking in most other [[Archosauria|archosaurs]]. The femur was straight and elliptical in cross-section. The [[tibia]] (shin bone) reached 84% of the length of the femur.<ref name=Sarahsaurus/>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Sarahsaurus braincase.jpg|thumb|Holotype braincase in multiple views]]\nIn a [[cladistic]] analysis, presented by Apaldetti and colleagues in November 2011, ''Sarahsaurus'' was found to be most closely related to ''[[Ignavusaurus]]'' within [[Massopoda]].

It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related [[bonobo]] (sometimes called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\") are classified in the genus [[Pan (genus)|''Pan'']]. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that ''Pan'' is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Human evolution|human lineage]] and is [[human]]s' closest living relative.\n\nThe chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing {{convert|40|\u2013|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|\u2013|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females and standing {{convert|100|to|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more. The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for [[hunting]] and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals.\n\nThe chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as [[chimpanzees' tea party|chimpanzees' tea parties]], circus acts and stage shows.

In the reanalysis, Terrace and Bever concluded that Nim's utterances could be explained merely as prompting on the part of the experimenters, as well as mistakes in reporting the data. \"Much of the apes' behavior is pure drill\", he said. \"Language still stands as an important definition of the human species.\" In this reversal, Terrace now argued Nim's use of ASL was not like human [[language acquisition]].

Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by [[deforestation]] in both West and Central Africa. Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations, and may allow [[poacher]]s more access to areas that had not been seriously affected by humans. Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nChimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1\u20133% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade, and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nInfectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. They succumb to many diseases that afflict humans, because the two species are so similar. As human populations grow, so does the risk of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal |Animals |Mammals |Primates |Africa}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropopithecus|''Anthropopithecus''}}\n* {{annotated link|Bili ape}}\n* {{annotated link|List of individual apes}}\n* {{annotated link|Prostitution among animals}}\n* {{annotated link|Theory of mind}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General sources===\n*{{cite book | last=Goodall | first=Jane | authorlink=Jane Goodall | year=1986 | title=The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior | publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-11649-8 | ref=harv | url=https://archive.org/details/chimpanzeesofgom00good}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category |Pan_troglodytes |Common chimpanzee}}\n{{Wikispecies |Pan troglodytes |Common Chimpanzee}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124001529/http://www.discoverchimpanzees.org/ DiscoverChimpanzees.org]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/chimp/ Chimpanzee Genome resources]\n* [http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/chimpanzee Primate Info Net ''Pan troglodytes'' Factsheets]\n* [http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.SpeciesProfile?spcode=A06C U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Species Profile]\n* View the [http://www.ensembl.org/Pan_troglodytes/Info/Index/ common chimpanzee genome] in [[Ensembl]]\n* [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive Human Timeline (Interactive)] \u2013 [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], [[National Museum of Natural History]] (August 2016).\n{{Hominidae nav}}\n{{Apes}}\n\n{{Taxonbar |from=Q4126704}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:chimpanzee, common}}\n[[Category:Chimpanzees|common chimpanzee]]\n[[Category:Tool-using mammals]]\n[[Category:Primates of Africa]]\n[[Category:Extant Pliocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1775|common chimpanzee]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Great ape native to the forests and savannahs of tropical Africa}}\n{{good article}}\n{{other uses|Chimpanzee (disambiguation)|Chimp (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name =Common chimpanzee<ref name=MSW>{{MSW3 Groves|pages=183|id=12100798}}</ref>\n| fossil_range={{fossilrange|4|0|earliest=6}}<ref name=\"McBrearty Jablonski 2005 pp. 105\u2013108\">{{cite journal | last=McBrearty | first=Sally | last2=Jablonski | first2=Nina G. | title=First fossil chimpanzee | journal=Nature | volume=437 | issue=7055 | year=2005 | issn=0028-0836 | doi=10.1038/nature04008 | pmid=16136135 | pages=105\u2013108| bibcode=2005Natur.437..105M}}</ref>\n| status=EN\n| status_system=IUCN3.1\n| status_ref=<ref name=\"iucn\">{{cite iucn | author=Humle, T. | author2=Maisels, F. | author3=Oates, J.F. | author4=Plumptre, A. | author5=Williamson, E.A. | title=''Pan troglodytes'' (errata 2018)| volume=2016 | page=e.T15933A129038584 | year=2016 | doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-2.RLTS.T15933A17964454.en}}</ref>\n| image=Eastern Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) (7068198095) (cropped).jpg\n| image_caption=An eastern chimpanzee (''Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii'')  at [[Kibale National Park]], Uganda\n| genus=Pan\n| species=troglodytes\n| authority=([[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach]], 1775)\n| range_map=Pan troglodytes area.png\n| range_map_caption=distribution of subspecies<br/>1.

It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related [[bonobo]] (sometimes called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\") are classified in the genus [[Pan (genus)|''Pan'']]. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that ''Pan'' is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Human evolution|human lineage]] and is [[human]]s' closest living relative.\n\nThe chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing {{convert|40|\u2013|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|\u2013|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females and standing {{convert|100|to|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more. The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for [[hunting]] and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals.\n\nThe chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as [[chimpanzees' tea party|chimpanzees' tea parties]], circus acts and stage shows. They are sometimes kept as pets, though their strength and aggressiveness makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in America. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as [[American Sign Language]] to chimpanzees, with limited success.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English name \"chimpanzee\" is first recorded in 1738.<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chimpanzee |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> It is derived from [[Vili language|Vili]] ''ci-mpenze''<ref>{{cite book |title=American Heritage Dictionary |date=2011 |edition=5th |chapter-url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=chimpanzee |access-date=31 August 2018 |chapter=chimpanzee |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}}</ref> or [[Tshiluba language]] ''chimpenze'', with a meaning of \"[[ape]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/chimpanzee#etymonline_v_11268 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref> The colloquialism \"chimp\" was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chimp |title=chimp definition &#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2009-06-06}}</ref> The genus name ''Pan'' derives from the [[Pan (god)|Greek god]], while the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''troglodytes'' was taken from the [[Troglodytae]], a mythical race of cave-dwellers.<ref name=\"Corbey\"/><ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy and genetics==\nThe first great ape known to Western science in the 17th century was the \"[[orangutan|orang-outang]]\" (genus ''Pongo''), the local [[Malay language|Malay]] name being recorded in Java by the Dutch physician [[Jacobus Bontius]].

In the reanalysis, Terrace and Bever concluded that Nim's utterances could be explained merely as prompting on the part of the experimenters, as well as mistakes in reporting the data. \"Much of the apes' behavior is pure drill\", he said. \"Language still stands as an important definition of the human species.\" In this reversal, Terrace now argued Nim's use of ASL was not like human [[language acquisition]]. Nim never initiated conversations himself, rarely introduced new words, and simply imitated what the humans did.

Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by [[deforestation]] in both West and Central Africa. Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations, and may allow [[poacher]]s more access to areas that had not been seriously affected by humans. Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nChimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1\u20133% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade, and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nInfectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. They succumb to many diseases that afflict humans, because the two species are so similar. As human populations grow, so does the risk of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal |Animals |Mammals |Primates |Africa}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropopithecus|''Anthropopithecus''}}\n* {{annotated link|Bili ape}}\n* {{annotated link|List of individual apes}}\n* {{annotated link|Prostitution among animals}}\n* {{annotated link|Theory of mind}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General sources===\n*{{cite book | last=Goodall | first=Jane | authorlink=Jane Goodall | year=1986 | title=The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior | publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-11649-8 | ref=harv | url=https://archive.org/details/chimpanzeesofgom00good}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category |Pan_troglodytes |Common chimpanzee}}\n{{Wikispecies |Pan troglodytes |Common Chimpanzee}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124001529/http://www.discoverchimpanzees.org/ DiscoverChimpanzees.org]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/chimp/ Chimpanzee Genome resources]\n* [http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/chimpanzee Primate Info Net ''Pan troglodytes'' Factsheets]\n* [http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.SpeciesProfile?spcode=A06C U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Species Profile]\n* View the [http://www.ensembl.org/Pan_troglodytes/Info/Index/ common chimpanzee genome] in [[Ensembl]]\n* [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive Human Timeline (Interactive)] \u2013 [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], [[National Museum of Natural History]] (August 2016).\n{{Hominidae nav}}\n{{Apes}}\n\n{{Taxonbar |from=Q4126704}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:chimpanzee, common}}\n[[Category:Chimpanzees|common chimpanzee]]\n[[Category:Tool-using mammals]]\n[[Category:Primates of Africa]]\n[[Category:Extant Pliocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1775|common chimpanzee]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toIlium(link changed toIlium (bone)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee"}
