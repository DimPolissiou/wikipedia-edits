She is now a professor emeritus at the  [[University Paris Diderot]]. The author of more than 30 books, including  ''[[Powers of Horror]]'', ''Tales of Love'', ''Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia'', ''Proust and the Sense of Time'', and the trilogy ''Female Genius'', she has been awarded [[Commander of the Legion of Honor]], [[Ordre national du M\u00e9rite|Commander of the Order of Merit]], the [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]], the [[Hannah Arendt Prize]], and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize, awarded by the Havel Foundation.\n\nKristeva became influential in international critical analysis, [[cultural studies]] and [[feminism]] after publishing her first book, ''Semeiotik\u00e8'', in 1969. Her sizeable body of work includes books and essays which address [[intertextuality]], the [[semiotic]], and [[abjection]], in the fields of [[linguistics]], literary theory and criticism, [[psychoanalysis]], biography and autobiography, political and cultural analysis, art and art history. She is prominent in [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[poststructuralist]] thought.\n\nKristeva is also the founder of the [[Simone de Beauvoir Prize]] committee.<ref>[http://www.campaign4equality.info/english/spip.php?article440 Simone de Beauvoir Prize 2009 goes to the One Million Signatures Campaign in Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201060949/http://www.campaign4equality.info/english/spip.php?article440 |date=2009-02-01 }}, Change for Equality</ref>\n\n==Life==\nBorn in [[Sliven]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] to Christian parents, Kristeva is the daughter of a church accountant.

She trained in psychoanalysis, and earned her degree in 1979. In some ways, her work can be seen as trying to adapt a [[psychoanalytic]] approach to the [[poststructuralist]] criticism. For example, her view of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]], and its construction, shares similarities with [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Lacan]].  However, Kristeva rejects any understanding of the subject in a structuralist sense; instead, she favors a subject always \"[[Process philosophy|in process]]\" or \"on trial\".<ref>{{cite book|last=McAfee|first=No\u00ealle|title=Julia Kristeva|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-63434-9|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1F4oOL1PACMC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=sujet+en+proces+on+trial#v=onepage&q=sujet%20en%20proces%20on%20trial&f=false}}</ref>  In this way, she contributes to the poststructuralist critique of essentialized structures, whilst preserving the teachings of psychoanalysis.

As explained by Augustine Perumalil, Kristeva's \"semiotic is closely related to the infantile [[pre-Oedipal]] referred to in the works of Freud, [[Otto Rank]], [[Melanie Klein]], British [[Object Relation]] psychoanalysis, and Lacan's pre-[[mirror stage]]. It is an emotional field, tied to the [[instincts]], which dwells in the fissures and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of language rather than in the [[Denotation (Semiotics)|denotative meanings]] of words.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Perumalil|first=Augustine|title=The History of Women in Philosophy}}</ref> Furthermore, according to Birgit Schippers, the semiotic is a realm associated with the musical, the poetic, the rhythmic, and that which lacks structure and meaning. It is closely tied to the \"feminine\", and represents the undifferentiated state of the pre-Mirror Stage infant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schippers|first=Birgit|title=Julia Kristeva and Feminist Thought|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nUpon entering the Mirror Stage, the child learns to distinguish between self and other, and enters the realm of shared cultural meaning, known as [[The Symbolic|the symbolic]]. In ''Desire in Language'' (1980), Kristeva describes the symbolic as the space in which the development of language allows the child to become a \"speaking subject,\" and to develop a sense of identity separate from the mother. This process of separation is known as abjection, whereby the child must reject and move away from the mother in order to enter into the world of language, culture, meaning, and the social. This realm of language is called the symbolic and is contrasted with the semiotic in that it is associated with the masculine, the law, and structure. Kristeva departs from Lacan in the idea that even after entering the symbolic, the subject continues to oscillate between the semiotic and the symbolic. Therefore, rather than arriving at a fixed identity, the subject is permanently \"in process\". Because female children continue to identify to some degree with the mother figure, they are especially likely to retain a close connection to the semiotic. This continued identification with the mother may result in what Kristeva refers to in ''[[Black Sun (Kristeva book)|Black Sun]]'' (1989) as [[melancholia]] ([[Major depressive disorder|depression]]), given that female children simultaneously reject and identify with the mother figure.\n\nIt has also been suggested (e.g., Creed, 1993) that the degradation of women and women's bodies in popular culture (and particularly, for example, in [[slasher film]]s) emerges because of the threat to identity that the mother's body poses: it is a reminder of time spent in the undifferentiated state of the semiotic, where one has no concept of self or identity. After abjecting the mother, subjects retain an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] fascination with the semiotic, desiring to reunite with the mother, while at the same time fearing the loss of identity that accompanies it. [[Misogyny in horror films|Slasher films]] thus provide a way for audience members to safely reenact the process of abjection by vicariously expelling and destroying the mother figure.\n\nKristeva is also known for her adoption of [[Plato]]\u2019s idea of the ''[[Kh\u00f4ra|chora]]'', meaning \"a nourishing maternal space\" (Schippers, 2011). Kristeva's idea of the ''chora'' has been interpreted in several ways: as a reference to the uterus, as a metaphor for the relationship between the mother and child, and as the temporal period preceding the Mirror Stage. In her essay ''Motherhood According to [[Giovanni Bellini]]'' from ''Desire in Language'' (1980), Kristeva refers to the ''chora'' as a \"non-expressive totality formed by drives and their stases in a motility that is full of movement as it is regulated.\" She goes on to suggest that it is the mother's body that mediates between the ''chora'' and the symbolic realm: the mother has access to culture and meaning, yet also forms a totalizing bond with the child.\n\nKristeva is also noted for her work on the concept of [[intertextuality]].\n\n===Anthropology and psychology===<!--This is a great example of how 'Theory' can be explained clearly, and with reference to the theoreticians' work-->\nKristeva argues that [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]], or the connection between the social and the subject, do not represent each other, but rather follow the same logic: the survival of the group and the subject. Furthermore, in her analysis of [[Oedipus]], she claims that the speaking subject cannot exist on his/her own, but that he/she \"stands on the fragile threshold as if stranded on account of an impossible demarcation\" (''[[Powers of Horror]]'', p.&nbsp;85).[[File:Julia Kristeva \u00e0 Paris en 2008.jpg|thumb|Julia Kristeva in Paris in 2008]]\n\nIn her comparison between the two disciplines, Kristeva claims that the way in which an individual excludes the abject mother as a means of forming an identity, is the same way in which societies are constructed. On a broader scale, cultures exclude the maternal and the feminine, and by this come into being.{{clarify|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Feminist==\nKristeva has been regarded as a key proponent of [[French feminism]] together with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous]], and [[Luce Irigaray]].<ref>Vanda Zajko and [[Miriam Leonard]] (eds.), ''Laughing with Medusa''.

Indiana University press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-253-33334-2}}</ref> although her relation to feminist circles and movements in France has been quite controversial. Kristeva made a famous disambiguation of three types of feminism in \"Women's Time\" in ''New Maladies of the Soul'' (1993); while rejecting the first two types, including that of Beauvoir, her stands are sometimes considered rejecting feminism altogether. Kristeva proposed the idea of multiple sexual identities against the joined code {{clarify|date=April 2012}} of \"unified feminine language\".\n\n===Denunciation of identity politics===\nKristeva argues her writings have been misunderstood by American feminist academics. In Kristeva's view, it was not enough simply to dissect the structure of language in order to find its hidden meaning. Language should also be viewed through the prisms of history and of individual psychic and sexual experiences. This [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] approach enabled specific social groups to trace the source of their oppression to the very language they used. However, Kristeva believes that it is harmful to posit collective identity above individual identity, and that this political assertion of sexual, ethnic, and religious identities is ultimately [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]].<ref>Riding, Alan, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/arts/correcting-her-idea-of-politically-correct.html?pagewanted=all Correcting Her Idea of Politically Correct]. ''New York Times''. June 14, 2001</ref>\n\n==Novelist==\nKristeva wrote a number of novels that resemble detective stories. While the books maintain narrative suspense and develop a stylized surface, her readers also encounter ideas intrinsic to her theoretical projects.  Her characters reveal themselves mainly through psychological devices, making her type of fiction mostly resemble the later work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]].  Her fictional oeuvre, which includes ''The Old Man and the Wolves'', ''Murder in Byzantium'', and ''Possessions'', while often allegorical, also approaches the autobiographical in some passages, especially with one of the protagonists of ''Possessions'', Stephanie Delacour\u2014a French journalist\u2014who can be seen as Kristeva's alter ego. ''Murder in Byzantium'' deals with themes from orthodox Christianity and politics; she referred to it as \"a kind of anti-[[The Da Vinci Code|Da Vinci Code]]\".<ref name=sutherland>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/ideas/story/0,,1730437,00.html|title= The ideas interview: Julia Kristeva; Why is a great critic ashamed of being fashionable?|first=John|last=Sutherland|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 March 2006|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nFor her \"innovative explorations of questions on the intersection of language, culture and literature\", Kristeva was awarded the [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]] in 2004.

She trained in psychoanalysis, and earned her degree in 1979. In some ways, her work can be seen as trying to adapt a [[psychoanalytic]] approach to the [[poststructuralist]] criticism. For example, her view of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]], and its construction, shares similarities with [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Lacan]].  However, Kristeva rejects any understanding of the subject in a structuralist sense; instead, she favors a subject always \"[[Process philosophy|in process]]\" or \"on trial\".<ref>{{cite book|last=McAfee|first=No\u00ealle|title=Julia Kristeva|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-63434-9|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1F4oOL1PACMC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=sujet+en+proces+on+trial#v=onepage&q=sujet%20en%20proces%20on%20trial&f=false}}</ref>  In this way, she contributes to the poststructuralist critique of essentialized structures, whilst preserving the teachings of psychoanalysis.

As explained by Augustine Perumalil, Kristeva's \"semiotic is closely related to the infantile [[pre-Oedipal]] referred to in the works of Freud, [[Otto Rank]], [[Melanie Klein]], British [[Object Relation]] psychoanalysis, and Lacan's pre-[[mirror stage]]. It is an emotional field, tied to the [[instincts]], which dwells in the fissures and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of language rather than in the [[Denotation (Semiotics)|denotative meanings]] of words.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Perumalil|first=Augustine|title=The History of Women in Philosophy}}</ref> Furthermore, according to Birgit Schippers, the semiotic is a realm associated with the musical, the poetic, the rhythmic, and that which lacks structure and meaning. It is closely tied to the \"feminine\", and represents the undifferentiated state of the pre-Mirror Stage infant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schippers|first=Birgit|title=Julia Kristeva and Feminist Thought|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nUpon entering the Mirror Stage, the child learns to distinguish between self and other, and enters the realm of shared cultural meaning, known as [[The Symbolic|the symbolic]]. In ''Desire in Language'' (1980), Kristeva describes the symbolic as the space in which the development of language allows the child to become a \"speaking subject,\" and to develop a sense of identity separate from the mother. This process of separation is known as abjection, whereby the child must reject and move away from the mother in order to enter into the world of language, culture, meaning, and the social. This realm of language is called the symbolic and is contrasted with the semiotic in that it is associated with the masculine, the law, and structure. Kristeva departs from Lacan in the idea that even after entering the symbolic, the subject continues to oscillate between the semiotic and the symbolic. Therefore, rather than arriving at a fixed identity, the subject is permanently \"in process\". Because female children continue to identify to some degree with the mother figure, they are especially likely to retain a close connection to the semiotic. This continued identification with the mother may result in what Kristeva refers to in ''[[Black Sun (Kristeva book)|Black Sun]]'' (1989) as [[melancholia]] ([[Major depressive disorder|depression]]), given that female children simultaneously reject and identify with the mother figure.\n\nIt has also been suggested (e.g., Creed, 1993) that the degradation of women and women's bodies in popular culture (and particularly, for example, in [[slasher film]]s) emerges because of the threat to identity that the mother's body poses: it is a reminder of time spent in the undifferentiated state of the semiotic, where one has no concept of self or identity. After abjecting the mother, subjects retain an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] fascination with the semiotic, desiring to reunite with the mother, while at the same time fearing the loss of identity that accompanies it. [[Misogyny in horror films|Slasher films]] thus provide a way for audience members to safely reenact the process of abjection by vicariously expelling and destroying the mother figure.\n\nKristeva is also known for her adoption of [[Plato]]\u2019s idea of the ''[[Kh\u00f4ra|chora]]'', meaning \"a nourishing maternal space\" (Schippers, 2011). Kristeva's idea of the ''chora'' has been interpreted in several ways: as a reference to the uterus, as a metaphor for the relationship between the mother and child, and as the temporal period preceding the Mirror Stage. In her essay ''Motherhood According to [[Giovanni Bellini]]'' from ''Desire in Language'' (1980), Kristeva refers to the ''chora'' as a \"non-expressive totality formed by drives and their stases in a motility that is full of movement as it is regulated.\" She goes on to suggest that it is the mother's body that mediates between the ''chora'' and the symbolic realm: the mother has access to culture and meaning, yet also forms a totalizing bond with the child.\n\nKristeva is also noted for her work on the concept of [[intertextuality]].\n\n===Anthropology and psychology===<!--This is a great example of how 'Theory' can be explained clearly, and with reference to the theoreticians' work-->\nKristeva argues that [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]], or the connection between the social and the subject, do not represent each other, but rather follow the same logic: the survival of the group and the subject. Furthermore, in her analysis of [[Oedipus]], she claims that the speaking subject cannot exist on his/her own, but that he/she \"stands on the fragile threshold as if stranded on account of an impossible demarcation\" (''[[Powers of Horror]]'', p.&nbsp;85).[[File:Julia Kristeva \u00e0 Paris en 2008.jpg|thumb|Julia Kristeva in Paris in 2008]]\n\nIn her comparison between the two disciplines, Kristeva claims that the way in which an individual excludes the abject mother as a means of forming an identity, is the same way in which societies are constructed. On a broader scale, cultures exclude the maternal and the feminine, and by this come into being.{{clarify|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Feminist==\nKristeva has been regarded as a key proponent of [[French feminism]] together with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous]], and [[Luce Irigaray]].<ref>Vanda Zajko and [[Miriam Leonard]] (eds.), ''Laughing with Medusa''.

Routledge, 2007.</ref><ref>Humm, Maggie, ''Feminism and Film''. Indiana University press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-253-33334-2}}</ref> although her relation to feminist circles and movements in France has been quite controversial. Kristeva made a famous disambiguation of three types of feminism in \"Women's Time\" in ''New Maladies of the Soul'' (1993); while rejecting the first two types, including that of Beauvoir, her stands are sometimes considered rejecting feminism altogether. Kristeva proposed the idea of multiple sexual identities against the joined code {{clarify|date=April 2012}} of \"unified feminine language\".\n\n===Denunciation of identity politics===\nKristeva argues her writings have been misunderstood by American feminist academics. In Kristeva's view, it was not enough simply to dissect the structure of language in order to find its hidden meaning. Language should also be viewed through the prisms of history and of individual psychic and sexual experiences. This [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] approach enabled specific social groups to trace the source of their oppression to the very language they used. However, Kristeva believes that it is harmful to posit collective identity above individual identity, and that this political assertion of sexual, ethnic, and religious identities is ultimately [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]].<ref>Riding, Alan, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/arts/correcting-her-idea-of-politically-correct.html?pagewanted=all Correcting Her Idea of Politically Correct]. ''New York Times''. June 14, 2001</ref>\n\n==Novelist==\nKristeva wrote a number of novels that resemble detective stories. While the books maintain narrative suspense and develop a stylized surface, her readers also encounter ideas intrinsic to her theoretical projects.  Her characters reveal themselves mainly through psychological devices, making her type of fiction mostly resemble the later work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]].  Her fictional oeuvre, which includes ''The Old Man and the Wolves'', ''Murder in Byzantium'', and ''Possessions'', while often allegorical, also approaches the autobiographical in some passages, especially with one of the protagonists of ''Possessions'', Stephanie Delacour\u2014a French journalist\u2014who can be seen as Kristeva's alter ego. ''Murder in Byzantium'' deals with themes from orthodox Christianity and politics; she referred to it as \"a kind of anti-[[The Da Vinci Code|Da Vinci Code]]\".<ref name=sutherland>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/ideas/story/0,,1730437,00.html|title= The ideas interview: Julia Kristeva; Why is a great critic ashamed of being fashionable?|first=John|last=Sutherland|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 March 2006|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nFor her \"innovative explorations of questions on the intersection of language, culture and literature\", Kristeva was awarded the [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]] in 2004. She won the 2006 [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] for Political Thought.  She has also been awarded Commander of the Legion of Honor, Commander of the Order of Merit, and the Vaclav Havel Prize.<ref>http://www.holbergprisen.no/en/julia-kristeva/french-order{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On October 10th, 2019, she received an ''honoris causa'' doctorate from [[Catholic University of Portugal|Universidade Cat\u00f3lica Portuguesa]].\n\n==Scholarly reception==\n[[Roman Jakobson]] said that \"Both readers and listeners, whether agreeing or in stubborn disagreement with Julia Kristeva, feel indeed attracted to her contagious voice and to her genuine gift of questioning generally adopted 'axioms,' and her contrary gift of releasing various 'damned questions' from their traditional question marks.\"<ref>''Desire in Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art'', Columbia University Press, 1980 (In Preface)</ref>\n\n[[Roland Barthes]] comments that \"Julia Kristeva changes the place of things: she always destroys the last prejudice, the one you thought you could be reassured by, could be take &#91;sic&#93; pride in; what she displaces is the already-said, the d\u00e9ja-dit, i.e., the instance of the signified, i.e., stupidity; what she subverts is authority -the authority of monologic science, of filiation.\"<ref>Roland Barthes, ''The Rustle of language'', p 168</ref> \n \n[[Ian Almond]] criticizes Kristeva's ethnocentrism. He cites [[Gayatri Spivak]]'s conclusion that Kristeva's book ''About Chinese Women'' \"belongs to that very eighteenth century [that] Kristeva scorns\" after pinpointing \"the brief, expansive, often completely ungrounded way in which she writes about  two thousand years of a culture she is unfamiliar with\".<ref>Ian Almond, ''The New Orientalists: Postmodern Representations of Islam from Foucault to Baudrillard'', I.B.Tauris, 2007, p. 132</ref> Almond notes the absence of sophistication in Kristeva's remarks concerning the Muslim world and the dismissive terminology she uses to describe its culture and believers.<ref>Ian Almond, ''The New Orientalists: Postmodern Representations of Islam from Foucault to Baudrillard'', I.B.Tauris, 2007</ref> He criticizes Kristeva's opposition which juxtaposes \"Islamic societies\" against \"democracies where life is still fairly  pleasant\" by pointing out that Kristeva displays no awareness of the complex and nuanced debate ongoing among women theorists in the Muslim world, and that she does not refer to anything other than the Rushdie fatwa in dismissing the entire Muslim faith as \"reactionary and persecutory\".<ref>Ian Almond, ''The New Orientalists: Postmodern Representations of Islam from Foucault to Baudrillard'', I.B.Tauris, 2007, pp. 154\u201355</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Intellectual Impostures]]'' (1997), physics professors [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] devote a chapter to Kristeva's use of mathematics in her writings. They argue that Kristeva fails to show the relevance of the mathematical concepts she discusses to linguistics and the other fields she studies, and that no such relevance exists.<ref>[[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]], ''Intellectual Impostures'', Profile Books, 1998, p. 47</ref>\n\n==Alleged collaboration with the Communist Regime in Bulgaria==\nIn 2018, Bulgaria's state Dossier Commission announced that Kristeva had been an agent for the [[Committee for State Security]]  under the code name \"Sabina\". She was supposedly recruited in June 1971.<ref>https://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/actualites/20180328.OBS4308/julia-kristeva-avait-ete-recrutee-par-les-services-secrets-communistes-bulgares.html</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/28/julia-kristeva-communist-secret-agent-bulgaria-claims</ref> Five years earlier she left Bulgaria to study in France.

The populations of rural areas of the country have been the hardest hit. Teen abuse of opioids has been noticeably increasing since 2006, using prescription drugs more than any illicit drug except [[marijuana]]; more than [[cocaine]], heroin, and [[methamphetamine]] combined. The crisis has also changed moral, social, and cultural resistance to street drug alternatives such as heroin.\n\nThe opioid epidemic has been described as a uniquely American problem, where prescription rates alone are 40 percent higher than in other developed countries. This has made it one of the worst drug crises in American history, causing more deaths annually than car crashes or guns, and leaving many children orphaned. As a result, the government began cracking down on pharmacists and doctors who were over-prescribing opioid painkillers.\n\nIn 2011, the [[Obama Administration|Obama administration]] began to deal with the crisis, and in 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] authorized millions of dollars in funding for opioid research and treatment, followed by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] director, Dr. [[Thomas Frieden]], stating that \"America is awash in opioids; urgent action is critical.\"  Soon after, many state governors declared a \"state of emergency\" to combat the opioid epidemic in their own states, and undertook major efforts to stop it. In July 2017, opioid addiction was cited as the \"[<nowiki/>[[Food and Drug Administration]]'s] biggest crisis\", followed by President [[Donald Trump]] declaring the opioid crisis a \"national emergency.\" In September 2019, he ordered U.S. mail carriers to block shipments of the most powerful and dangerous opioid, fentanyl, coming from other countries.\n\n==Background==\n[[Opioid]]s are a diverse class of moderately strong, addictive, and inexpensive drugs, which include [[opiate]]s (i.e., morphine and heroin), [[oxycodone]] ([[OxyContin]], [[oxycodone/paracetamol|Percocet]]), [[hydrocodone]] ([[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Vicodin]], [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Norco]]), and [[fentanyl]]. Opioids are typically prescribed for pain management.

It is given in combination with Naloxone because Naloxone works as an [[opioid antagonist]], meaning it will block the effects of the opioid medication. This combination drug can help by reducing a person's withdrawal symptoms while they are discontinuing opioids after a period of chronic use.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nWhile Suboxone is indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence, it does contain an opioid which means a person may be at risk of developing dependence to it as well.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n====Behavioral treatment====\nBehavioral treatment is less effective without medical treatment during the initial [[detoxification]].

In the context of the opioid epidemic, harm reduction strategies are designed to improve health outcomes and reduce overdose deaths.<ref name=\":9\" /> Because many pain sufferers are also depressed, a challenge of harm reduction is that some applications, such as the use of drugs to reverse or avoid opioid overdose can nullify the effects of antidepressant medications which depend on the natural human opioid system.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Barglow |first=Peter |name-list-format=vanc |date=July\u2013August 2019 |title=Confessions of an American Opium-Prescriber |url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/2019/07/confessions-of-an-american-opium-prescriber/ |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=53\u201356 |archive-urlhttp://archive.is/ud97s= |archive-date=6 March 2020 |access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Naloxone====\n[[Naloxone]] (most commonly sold under the brand name Narcan) can be used as a rescue medication for opioid overdose or as a preventive measure for those wanting to stop using opiates. It is an [[opioid antagonist]], meaning it binds to [[opioid receptor]]s, which prevents them from being activated by opiates. It binds more strongly than other drugs, so that when someone is overdosing on opioids, naloxone can be administered, allowing it to take the place of the opioid drug in the person's receptors, turning them off. This blocks the effect of the receptors.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMany states have made Narcan available for purchase without a prescription. Additionally, police officers in many districts have begun carrying Narcan on a routine basis.<!-- Needs citation  -->\n\nTake-home naloxone overdose prevention kits have shown promise in areas exhibiting rapid increases in opioid overdoses and deaths due to the increased availability of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Many counties offer Narcan training programs with the aim of educating the surrounding community on how to use Narcan.

As a result, the government began cracking down on pharmacists and doctors who were over-prescribing opioid painkillers.\n\nIn 2011, the [[Obama Administration|Obama administration]] began to deal with the crisis, and in 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] authorized millions of dollars in funding for opioid research and treatment, followed by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] director, Dr. [[Thomas Frieden]], stating that \"America is awash in opioids; urgent action is critical.\"  Soon after, many state governors declared a \"state of emergency\" to combat the opioid epidemic in their own states, and undertook major efforts to stop it. In July 2017, opioid addiction was cited as the \"[<nowiki/>[[Food and Drug Administration]]'s] biggest crisis\", followed by President [[Donald Trump]] declaring the opioid crisis a \"national emergency.\" In September 2019, he ordered U.S. mail carriers to block shipments of the most powerful and dangerous opioid, fentanyl, coming from other countries.\n\n==Background==\n[[Opioid]]s are a diverse class of moderately strong, addictive, and inexpensive drugs, which include [[opiate]]s (i.e., morphine and heroin), [[oxycodone]] ([[OxyContin]], [[oxycodone/paracetamol|Percocet]]), [[hydrocodone]] ([[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Vicodin]], [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Norco]]), and [[fentanyl]]. Opioids are typically prescribed for pain management. They are effective for treating acute pain but are less useful for treating chronic pain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander GC, Kruszewski SP, Webster DW | title = Rethinking opioid prescribing to protect patient safety and public health | journal = Jama | volume = 308 | issue = 18 | pages = 1865\u20136 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23150006 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2012.14282 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Furlan A, Chaparro LE, Irvin E, Mailis-Gagnon A | title = A comparison between enriched and nonenriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trials of opioids for chronic noncancer pain | journal = Pain Research & Management | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 337\u201351 | date = 2011 | pmid = 22059206 | doi = 10.1155/2011/465281 }}</ref><ref name=\":19\" /> The potency and availability of these substances, despite their high risk of [[drug addiction|addiction]] and [[drug overdose|overdose]], have made them popular both as medical treatments and as [[recreational drugs]].

It is an [[opioid antagonist]], meaning it binds to [[opioid receptor]]s, which prevents them from being activated by opiates. It binds more strongly than other drugs, so that when someone is overdosing on opioids, naloxone can be administered, allowing it to take the place of the opioid drug in the person's receptors, turning them off. This blocks the effect of the receptors.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMany states have made Narcan available for purchase without a prescription.
