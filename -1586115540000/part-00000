In 1934 and again in 1970-73 grave goods from the 1st to 4th Centuries were found.  There are also traces of a further use of the grave yard in the 6th Century as well.  The modern municipality of Losone is first mentioned in 1061 as ''Loxono'' though this is from a 1402 copy of the original.  In 1200 it was mentioned as ''de losono''.<ref name=HDS/>   During the [[Middle Ages]] the settlement or ''borgo'' included; the so-called Bassa Losone, Arcegno and until 1807, Vosa im Onsernonetal.  It formed a ''[[B\u00fcrgergemeinde|Vicinanza]]'' in the [[parish]] of Locarno and had its own statutes and laws.  The status of an independent ''Vicinanza'' was confirmed in 1734.  Losone owned rights to alpine pastures in the valleys of Bosco/Gurin, Onsernone and Vigezzo.  The people paid to the nobles of Locarno a [[tithe]] on [[vineyard]]s and grain.  In 1799, Losone opposed the [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] authorities who wanted to create a political municipality.  Even after it became a political municipality in 1803, the ''Vicinanza'' played an important political and economic role.<ref name=HDS/>\n[[File:Losone San Rocco 060415.jpg|thumb|150px|left|S. Rocco Church]]\nThe [[parish church]] of S. Lorenzo is first mentioned in 1243, though it is older than that.  It separated, some time before 1580, from the mother church of San Vittore in [[Muralto]] to form a [[parish]].  In 1747 the church was granted a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Roman Catholic hierarchies|rector]].\n\nThe local economy traditionally relied on agriculture and quarries.  During the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Ancien R\u00e9gime]] many of residents emigrated for jobs.  [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|Grinders]], [[pewter]] workers and customs officers moved from Losone to Tuscany and Rome, while stove fitters and chocolate manufacturers went to Austria and Hungary.  The construction of the bridge over the Maggia in 1815, the road to Ascona and [[Golino]] in 1824-25 and Maggia river correction in 1890, allowed development in the village.  Beginning in the 20th Century the parish house and school were built.  Between 1941\u201347, Polish and Ukrainian soldiers were interned in the district of Arbigo.  The soldiers helped build the road from Arcegno to Golino.  In 1949-50 a warehouse was converted into a barracks (infantry until 1973, then paramedics).  The machine factory Agie opened in Losono in 1957, which contributed to the emergence of a major industrial area in the region.  After 1960, Losone developed more and more into a residential community.  In 1976, the new education center was dedicated.  In 1982, a nursing home opened.  Between 1940-80 Losone recorded the strongest population growth of all of the municipalities in the [[Sopraceneri]].  More recently, tourism has developed including a golf course, that opened in 1999 in Gerre.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n==Geography==\nLosone has an area, {{as of|1997|lc=on}}, of {{convert|9.53|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

In 1934 and again in 1970-73 grave goods from the 1st to 4th Centuries were found.  There are also traces of a further use of the grave yard in the 6th Century as well.  The modern municipality of Losone is first mentioned in 1061 as ''Loxono'' though this is from a 1402 copy of the original.  In 1200 it was mentioned as ''de losono''.<ref name=HDS/>   During the [[Middle Ages]] the settlement or ''borgo'' included; the so-called Bassa Losone, Arcegno and until 1807, Vosa im Onsernonetal.  It formed a ''[[B\u00fcrgergemeinde|Vicinanza]]'' in the [[parish]] of Locarno and had its own statutes and laws.  The status of an independent ''Vicinanza'' was confirmed in 1734.  Losone owned rights to alpine pastures in the valleys of Bosco/Gurin, Onsernone and Vigezzo.  The people paid to the nobles of Locarno a [[tithe]] on [[vineyard]]s and grain.  In 1799, Losone opposed the [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] authorities who wanted to create a political municipality.  Even after it became a political municipality in 1803, the ''Vicinanza'' played an important political and economic role.<ref name=HDS/>\n[[File:Losone San Rocco 060415.jpg|thumb|150px|left|S. Rocco Church]]\nThe [[parish church]] of S. Lorenzo is first mentioned in 1243, though it is older than that.  It separated, some time before 1580, from the mother church of San Vittore in [[Muralto]] to form a [[parish]].  In 1747 the church was granted a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Roman Catholic hierarchies|rector]].\n\nThe local economy traditionally relied on agriculture and quarries.  During the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Ancien R\u00e9gime]] many of residents emigrated for jobs.  [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|Grinders]], [[pewter]] workers and customs officers moved from Losone to Tuscany and Rome, while stove fitters and chocolate manufacturers went to Austria and Hungary.  The construction of the bridge over the Maggia in 1815, the road to Ascona and [[Golino]] in 1824-25 and Maggia river correction in 1890, allowed development in the village.  Beginning in the 20th Century the parish house and school were built.  Between 1941-47, Polish and Ukrainian soldiers were interned in the district of Arbigo.  The soldiers helped build the road from Arcegno to Golino.  In 1949-50 a warehouse was converted into a barracks (infantry until 1973, then paramedics).  The machine factory Agie opened in Losono in 1957, which contributed to the emergence of a major industrial area in the region.  After 1960, Losone developed more and more into a residential community.  In 1976, the new education center was dedicated.  In 1982, a nursing home opened.  Between 1940-80 Losone recorded the strongest population growth of all of the municipalities in the [[Sopraceneri]].  More recently, tourism has developed including a golf course, that opened in 1999 in Gerre.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n==Geography==\nLosone has an area, {{as of|1997|lc=on}}, of {{convert|9.53|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

Founded by [[Wayne Lytle]], it is incorporated in [[New York (state)|New York]], with offices in [[Texas]] and [[California]]. The initial name of the company was '''Visual Music''', but changed to Animusic in 1995.\n\nThe company is known for its ''Animusic'' compilations of computer-generated animations, based on MIDI events processed to simultaneously drive the music and on-screen action, leading to and corresponding to every sound.  The animated short \"Pipe Dream\" showed at [[SIGGRAPH]]'s Electronic Theater in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/siggraph-2001-computer-animation-festival-digital-odyssey|title=The SIGGRAPH 2001 Computer Animation Festival: A Digital Odyssey|website=Animation World Network|accessdate=Aug 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many other music visualizations, the music drives the animation. While other productions may animate figures or characters to the music, the animated models in ''Animusic'' are created first, and are then programmed to follow what the music \"tells them\" to. 'Solo cams' featured on the ''Animusic'' DVD shows how each instrument plays through a piece of music from beginning to end.\n\nMany of the instruments appear to be [[robot]]ic or play themselves using seemingly curious methods to produce and visualize the original compositions. The animations typically feature dramatically-lit rooms or landscapes.\n\nThe music of ''Animusic'' is principally pop-rock based, consisting of straightforward sequences of triggered samples and digital patches mostly played \"dry\" (with few [[:Category:Audio effects|effects]]). There are no [[lyrics]] or voices, save for the occasional [[Choir|chorus]] [[synthesizer]]. According to the director's comments on ''Animusic 2'', most instrument sounds are generated with software synthesizers on a music workstation (see [[Animusic#Software programs|Software Programs]] for more info). Many sounds resemble stock patches available on digital keyboards, subjected to some manipulation, such as pitch or playback speed, to enhance the appeal of their [[timbre]].\n\n==Compilations==\n{{As of|2017}}, three video albums have been released:\n\n*''Animusic: A Computer Animation Video Album''\n*''Animusic 2: A New Computer Animation Video Album''\n*''Animusic HD: Stunning Computer-Animated Music''\n\nAll Animusic DVDs are set to [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 0]], meaning they are playable in all [[DVD player]]s worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animusic.com/support/#q06|title=Animusic &#124; Support &#124; 6|accessdate=2012-08-09}}</ref>\n\n''Animusic'' was released in 2001 on VHS, and later [[DVD]], with a special edition DVD being released later, in 2004.

The flying percussion instruments move aside as the choir lasers solve the puzzle to open the ship's doors and for the grand finale, as the white fireworks pop up, all the moving instruments fly into the starry sky far away.\n\n===Animusic: A Computer Animation Video Album===\nTrack listing:\n\n#'''Future Retro''' (4:45)\n#*BPM=112\n<!-- This file appears to not exist:\n[[File:Future Retro.jpg|thumb|350px|right|]] -->\n#*Instruments in the order they're presented:\n#**Triple-Necked Rock Electric Guitar \u2013 a combination of a\n#***2-stringed [[bass guitar]]\n#***Synth Bass pulse ring\n#***Blue bass lasers\n#***[[Pan flute|Pan Flute]]\n#***3-stringed [[Jazz guitar|electric jazz guitar]]\n#***4-stringed [[electric guitar]] ([[Distortion (music)|overdriven]])\n#***Green [[power chord]] laser\n#**[[Percussion instrument|Percussion]] including a [[drum kit]] (1 hi-hat, 1 ride cymbal, 2 splash cymbals, 3 crash cymbals, a bass drum, a snare, 2 congas, and 8 toms), [[vibraphone]] and [[gong]]\n#**Four Red [[Synthesizer|synth]] Sawtooth Lead Lasers\n#**Violet Chorus Beams\n#* The bands of the Rock 'n' Roll in a Heavy metal.

The [[gold]]en vibraphone fountain now glows orange when struck instead of white. The back wall from the first animation has been removed to reveal a large empty space filled with pipes. The tubular bells also have a little more detail, partially due to the fact that they spend more time onscreen.\n#'''Fiber Bundles'''\n#*BPM=112\n#*Instruments in the order they're presented:\n#**Green [[Bass (sound)|Bass]] Chorus Synth\n#**White Echo light [[Synthesizer|Synth]] Pulses\n#**Violet Synth [[Bass (sound)|Bass]]\n#**Electric [[Percussion instrument|drum set]]\n#**Red [[Synthesizer|Synth]] Lead\n#**Yellow treble Chorus [[Synthesizer|Synth]]\n#**Blue-green Synthesizer Flash light Pulses\n#*Towards the end of this piece's commentary on the DVD, Wayne Lytle remarks that the music in the [[Ratchet & Clank (series)|Ratchet & Clank series]], written by [[David Bergeaud]], may have had some influence over this piece.\n#'''Gyro Drums'''\n#*BPM=80, 110, 180, 140, 145\n#*Instruments in the order they're presented:\n#**[[Drum kit]]\n#***Four [[snare drum]]s\n#***Four [[bass drums]]\n#***Four [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]]\n#***Seven [[tom-toms]]\n#***Six [[bongos]]\n#***Eight buzz [[synthesizer]]s (concealed at first)\n#***Eight [[cymbals]] \u2013 four crashes, two rides, one splash and one China\n#**Second [[Drum kit]]\n#***Eight [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]]\n#***Two [[cowbell]]s\n#***Two [[Woodblock (instrument)|woodblocks]]\n#***Two [[timbales]]\n#***Four [[bongos]]\n#***Eight [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]]\n#***Four [[cymbals]] \u2013 Two rides and two splashes\n#**Third [[drum kit]]\n#***Four [[gongs]]\n#***Four [[ride cymbal]]s\n#***Four [[bass drum]]s\n#***52 [[tom-toms]]\n#**Fourth [[drum kit]]\n#***Eight [[maraca]]s\n#***Eight [[cabasa]]\n#***Four [[bass drum]]s\n#***Eight [[snare drum]]s\n#***Four [[Crash cymbals]]\n#***Four [[Hi-hat (instrument)|Hi-hats]]\n#**171 drums, cymbals, etc. in total.\n#*There are three robotic drummer players in this animation.

Founded by [[Wayne Lytle]], it is incorporated in [[New York (state)|New York]], with offices in [[Texas]] and [[California]]. The initial name of the company was '''Visual Music''', but changed to Animusic in 1995.\n\nThe company is known for its ''Animusic'' compilations of computer-generated animations, based on MIDI events processed to simultaneously drive the music and on-screen action, leading to and corresponding to every sound.  The animated short \"Pipe Dream\" showed at [[SIGGRAPH]]'s Electronic Theater in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/siggraph-2001-computer-animation-festival-digital-odyssey|title=The SIGGRAPH 2001 Computer Animation Festival: A Digital Odyssey|website=Animation World Network|accessdate=Aug 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many other music visualizations, the music drives the animation. While other productions may animate figures or characters to the music, the animated models in ''Animusic'' are created first, and are then programmed to follow what the music \"tells them\" to. 'Solo cams' featured on the ''Animusic'' DVD shows how each instrument plays through a piece of music from beginning to end.\n\nMany of the instruments appear to be [[robot]]ic or play themselves using seemingly curious methods to produce and visualize the original compositions. The animations typically feature dramatically-lit rooms or landscapes.\n\nThe music of ''Animusic'' is principally pop-rock based, consisting of straightforward sequences of triggered samples and digital patches mostly played \"dry\" (with few [[:Category:Audio effects|effects]]). There are no [[lyrics]] or voices, save for the occasional [[Choir|chorus]] [[synthesizer]]. According to the director's comments on ''Animusic 2'', most instrument sounds are generated with software synthesizers on a music workstation (see [[Animusic#Software programs|Software Programs]] for more info). Many sounds resemble stock patches available on digital keyboards, subjected to some manipulation, such as pitch or playback speed, to enhance the appeal of their [[timbre]].\n\n==Compilations==\n{{As of|2017}}, three video albums have been released:\n\n*''Animusic: A Computer Animation Video Album''\n*''Animusic 2: A New Computer Animation Video Album''\n*''Animusic HD: Stunning Computer-Animated Music''\n\nAll Animusic DVDs are set to [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 0]], meaning they are playable in all [[DVD player]]s worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animusic.com/support/#q06|title=Animusic &#124; Support &#124; 6|accessdate=2012-08-09}}</ref>\n\n''Animusic'' was released in 2001 on VHS, and later [[DVD]], with a special edition DVD being released later, in 2004.

A two-armed snare drum with a cowbell on top and a medium wheel below comes out of its doors and joins its bass drum friend for a beat. As the walls begin to open, their one-armed friend the crash cymbal joins in as well and the percussion instruments get in their positions in front of the musical light/laser machine that first plays the bass lights with all the lasers joining in with harmony. A group of these instruments continue playing as they move towards the doors and the yellow laser, along with one of the red ones, opens the doors with all the airplane tom-toms and the helicopter clash cymbals taking off for the percussive solo pattern.

The Blue robot and the Red robot played together.\n#*The spaceship whirs throughout the piece, although not heard during the music itself, but at the beginning and end.\n#'''Pogo Sticks'''\n#*BPM=107\n#*Instruments in the order they're presented:\n#**Two hammered [[chapman stick]]s (one lead, one backup)\n#**Hammered [[bass guitar]] (an updated version from 'Stick Figures'; the bass now has two strings plus the small [[wheel]]s and is in motion)\n#**A two-part [[drum kit]], including:\n#***A [[bass drum]], 2 toms, and a [[snare drum]]\n#***2 [[cymbal]]s, 3 [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]] and a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]\n#**Two [[xylophone]]s\n#***The Gold [[Marimba]]\n#***The Blue [[Metallophone]]\n#*It has been revealed that the stick bass has \"cousins,\" which are the hammered guitars. His \"friends\" are the drum kit playing sticks and the two stick xylophones, one as a marimba and another as a metallophone. They also have green lights that [[Chemiluminescence|glow]] when they go through tunnels. Throughout the performance, they travel around the wooden course at sunset, stopping at stages intermittently.\n#*This animation has actually been evolved from the \"Stick Figures\" animation from the first ''Animusic''. On the stills seen on the DVD, it is revealed that the instruments are actually the original stick bass, with appropriate changes. The \"Stick Figures\" stage was copied several times and appears as the stages the band stops on.\n#'''Resonant Chamber'''\n#*BPM=120, 155,180\n#*Instruments in the order they're presented:\n#**Eight-stringed [[Classical guitar]]\n#**Seven-string [[Autoharp]]\n#**Two-string [[bass guitar]]\n#**Four-stringed tapping [[Guitar]]\n#**Two-string [[Guitar]]\n#**Three-stringed [[mandolin]]\n#*Across the circle-shaped [[resonator]] are the strings of the classical guitar and a bass guitar which cross each other.\n#*In this animation, it can be noted that there is only one dark sky with four windows and four different moons. One of them is the thick [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]], another is the [[full moon]], third is the [[Lunar phase|waning gibbous]] and the last one is the thin crescent moon. Inside the room, there are four [[lantern]]s already lit up.\n#'''Cathedral Pictures''' (based on selections from the 1971 [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] [[Pictures at an Exhibition (Emerson, Lake & Palmer album)|adaptation]] of ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]])\n#*Instruments in the order they're presented:\n#**[[Trumpet]] \n#**[[Percussion instrument]], including a [[drum kit]] (6 toms, 3 crash cymbals, 1 ride cymbal, a snare, 2 bass drums, and a hi-hat) and [[gong]]s\n#**[[pipe organ|Pipe Organ]] \n#**One-string [[Bass guitar]]\n#**Large Arc [[Harpsichord]] (hammered string)\n#**Light-emitting [[Clarinet]] \n#**Large Arc [[Xylophone]] \n#**[[Tuba]] \n#**Pipe organ [[expression pedal|expression louvres]] ([[synthesizer|synthesized]] tone) \n#**Lime [[Electric arc]] sound ([[synthesizer|synthesized]] tone) Laser \n#**Light-emitting [[Flute]] \n#**[[Pyrotechnics]] \n#*This animation performance plays a medley of three selected tunes written by Mussorgsky in Lytle's arrangement. They are \"Promenade\", \"Hut of Baba-Yaga\" and \"The Great Gate of Kiev\". In front of the robotic drummer is a drum kit with two [[bass drum]]s. It also demonstrates a [[Drum roll|drumroll]] on the snare drum in transmission from the \"Hut of Baba Yaga\" to the \"Great Gate of Kiev\".\n#'''Pipe Dream 2'''\n#*BPM=140\n#*Instruments in the order they're presented: (the set is used in Pipe Dream in the first ''Animusic'', but is aged and dented here)\n#**[[Acoustic guitar]]/[[Bongo drum|Bongo]] double instrument\n#**[[Banjo]]/[[Bongo drum|Bongo]] double instrument\n#**[[Percussion instrument|Percussion]], including:\n#***A [[drum kit]]\n#***A circular [[vibraphone]] fountain\n#***[[Tubular bell]]s\n#***A Slide-bar [[Marimba]]\n#*To contrast the two different performances on this set, the Acoustic Guitar/Bongo double instrument next to the wall is lit by a blue light in the second version, as opposed to a magenta light in the first version. The [[gold]]en vibraphone fountain now glows orange when struck instead of white. The back wall from the first animation has been removed to reveal a large empty space filled with pipes. The tubular bells also have a little more detail, partially due to the fact that they spend more time onscreen.\n#'''Fiber Bundles'''\n#*BPM=112\n#*Instruments in the order they're presented:\n#**Green [[Bass (sound)|Bass]] Chorus Synth\n#**White Echo light [[Synthesizer|Synth]] Pulses\n#**Violet Synth [[Bass (sound)|Bass]]\n#**Electric [[Percussion instrument|drum set]]\n#**Red [[Synthesizer|Synth]] Lead\n#**Yellow treble Chorus [[Synthesizer|Synth]]\n#**Blue-green Synthesizer Flash light Pulses\n#*Towards the end of this piece's commentary on the DVD, Wayne Lytle remarks that the music in the [[Ratchet & Clank (series)|Ratchet & Clank series]], written by [[David Bergeaud]], may have had some influence over this piece.\n#'''Gyro Drums'''\n#*BPM=80, 110, 180, 140, 145\n#*Instruments in the order they're presented:\n#**[[Drum kit]]\n#***Four [[snare drum]]s\n#***Four [[bass drums]]\n#***Four [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]]\n#***Seven [[tom-toms]]\n#***Six [[bongos]]\n#***Eight buzz [[synthesizer]]s (concealed at first)\n#***Eight [[cymbals]] \u2013 four crashes, two rides, one splash and one China\n#**Second [[Drum kit]]\n#***Eight [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]]\n#***Two [[cowbell]]s\n#***Two [[Woodblock (instrument)|woodblocks]]\n#***Two [[timbales]]\n#***Four [[bongos]]\n#***Eight [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]]\n#***Four [[cymbals]] \u2013 Two rides and two splashes\n#**Third [[drum kit]]\n#***Four [[gongs]]\n#***Four [[ride cymbal]]s\n#***Four [[bass drum]]s\n#***52 [[tom-toms]]\n#**Fourth [[drum kit]]\n#***Eight [[maraca]]s\n#***Eight [[cabasa]]\n#***Four [[bass drum]]s\n#***Eight [[snare drum]]s\n#***Four [[Crash cymbals]]\n#***Four [[Hi-hat (instrument)|Hi-hats]]\n#**171 drums, cymbals, etc. in total.\n#*There are three robotic drummer players in this animation.

The performance starts with the blue chorus beams appearing to trigger the transformation of the pyramid into the musical temple. At least three other planets or moons can be seen in the sky, one of which bears a strong resemblance to the planet [[Jupiter]]. At the end, the soundings of gongs mark the reversal of the initial transformation, as the doorway-like structure retracts. <!-- I think that the same tune is used for the initial transformation and reversal, but could someone else please verify this? -->\n\n====Animusic 2 audio CD bonus tracks====\nThe bonus audio tracks on this CD consist of reduced versions of Heavy Light and Fiber Bundles:\n\n#Heavy Light \u2013 Drum/Bass Submix ([http://www.animusic.com/audio/Animusic2-HeavyLight-submix.mp3 sample])\n#Fiber Bundles \u2013 Drum/Bass Submix ([http://www.animusic.com/audio/Animusic2-FiberBundles-submix1.mp3 sample])\n#Fiber Bundles \u2013 Synth/Ambient Submix ([http://www.animusic.com/audio/Animusic2-FiberBundles-submix2.mp3 sample])\n\n===Animusic 3: The Next Computer Animation Video Album===\nAnimusic has been working on the third volume of the ''Animusic'' series for over 10 years.
