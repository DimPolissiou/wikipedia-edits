He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches.

The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. These effort to grow the game in the area ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in Te Puke and then again in the return match in Tauranga.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn a 1921 match for Tauranga Iles scored a try against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He also played for Tauranga against Te Puke and despite recently joining the rugby code was named captain\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kusabs' Cup Match Next Saturday\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7710\n| date = 1921-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210602.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga made history of sorts by playing in the first ever rugby league game in Te Puke<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid.

By then, the number of United States ground forces in South Vietnam had fallen to 65,000 from an all-time high of 543,000 in 1969, and the North Vietnamese correctly anticipated that the US was unwilling to commit ground troops again. An aerial armada consisting of [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[B-52 Stratofortress]]es, [[F-4 Phantom II]]s, [[Cessna A-37 Dragonfly|A-37 Dragonflies]] and [[US Navy]] planes from four [[aircraft carrier]] wings and some [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] (VNAF) fighters, however, were at hand to provide strong and at times crucial air-support.\n\nOne of the main attacks of the offensive took place north of Saigon, where three divisions of North Vietnamese [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) troops from base areas inside [[Cambodia]] launched a full-scale invasion starting on April 2, 1972. Quickly overrunning South Vietnamese defensive outposts, the North Vietnamese rolled down Highway 13 towards Saigon.\n\n[[File:An Loc2.jpg|250px|thumb|Panoramic view of An Loc, Vietnam]]\n\nThe ARVN took a stand at An L\u1ed9c, led by CG Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Minh, which was shortly surrounded by PAVN troops. The North Vietnamese forces, for the first time supported by heavy tanks, began their assault on April 13, 1972. A three-day all-out attack failed, after which the battle turned into a prolonged siege with shifting attacks and counter-attacks.  All the while, the town was turned into rubble. Although the North Vietnamese on several occasions breached the defenses, they never managed to deal the defenders a knock-out blow, and An L\u1ed9c remained in the hands of the South Vietnamese. By July, the fighting had subsided and An L\u1ed9c was relieved on July 11.\n\nAlthough the ARVN performed well in some regards in An L\u1ed9c, USAF air-support and air-borne supplies and reinforcements were key in preventing the fall of the town to the North Vietnamese. As such, the battle failed to convince US policymakers that the South Vietnamese could continue the war on their own. In his memoirs, US [[Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] notes that the South Vietnamese Army never managed to reopen the road into An L\u1ed9c.  The battle for An L\u1ed9c (Easter Offensive) interrupted the [[Paris Peace Talks]].  [[Operation Linebacker I]] brought the communists back to the negotiations.\n\nThree historical figures are linked to An L\u1ed9c. Air Force pilot First Lieutenant [[Michael Blassie]] died near An L\u1ed9c when his A-37B went down on May 11, 1972.  He had been buried in the [[Tomb of the Unknowns]] from 1984 to 1998 as the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Service Member]] from the Vietnam War, before positive identification was obtained through DNA evidence. Colonel [[William Nolde]], the last recorded American combat casualty of the conflict, fell here on January 27, 1973.  The ARVN did have a hero in Brigadier General [[L\u00ea V\u0103n H\u01b0ng]] (1933\u20131975), whose remark \"If I'm still alive, An L\u1ed9c still stands\" rallied the troops.  His forces firmly held the city of An L\u1ed9c under fierce enemy attacks that lasted two months.  At the end of the war, General H\u01b0ng was by then his last military assignment as deputy commander of the [[IV Corps (South Vietnam)|IV Corps]] (known as Military Region 4) at [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]]. In the last weeks of the Republic of Vietnam, General L\u00ea V\u0103n H\u01b0ng stabilized the firm control on his ARVN soldiers and officers to prevent the VC taking over C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1. He and the commander, General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Khoa Nam]], rather than fleeing the country or surrendering to the communists, committed suicide on April 30, 1975 at C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 after hearing the order to lay down their arms by General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]], who had been President of the [[Republic of Vietnam]] for just three days. For some South Vietnamese, this month is now known as \"Cruel April\", and the Communist North Vietnamese finally achieved what they sought in their 1972 [[Easter Offensive]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n*An L\u1ed9c is mentioned in the epilogue of ''[[American Graffiti]]'', which states that \"Terry 'Toad' Fields was reported missing in action near An L\u1ed9c in December 1965.\"  This is later expanded upon in the sequel, ''[[More American Graffiti]]''. \n*An L\u1ed9c is also mentioned in ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'', as Sgt Major Dickerson requests activity on the road to An L\u1ed9c for the trip that Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) and Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker) are taking to supposedly \"interview\" troops in the field.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Battle of An L\u1ed9c]]\n*[[Vietnam War]]\n*[[South Vietnam]]\n*[[Vietnam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.anloc.org/ The Battle of An Loc] - Battle Overview, Photos, Personal Accounts and Links.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515050059/http://www.vnafmamn.com/Valiant_Anloc.html Battle of An Loc (Valiant Binh Long)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070609183306/http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/willbanks/willbanks.asp Battle of An Loc] - by Lieutenant Colonel James H.

in [[Thailand]]. It is on the east coast of the [[Gulf of Thailand]], about {{convert|100|km}} southeast of [[Bangkok]], within, but not part of, [[Bang Lamung District]] in the province of [[Chonburi Province|Chonburi]]. Pattaya City ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32}}, {{RTGS|''Mueang Phatthaya''}}) is a self-governing municipal area which covers [[tambon]]s Nong Prue and Na Klua and parts of Huai Yai and Nong Pla Lai. The city is in the industrial [[Eastern Seaboard of Thailand|Eastern Seaboard]] zone, along with [[Si Racha]], [[Laem Chabang]], and [[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]]. Pattaya is at the center of the Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area\u2014a [[wikt:conurbation|conurbation]] in Chonburi Province\u2014with a population of roughly 1,000,000.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pattaya,_Thailand_Skyline.jpg|thumb|left|Pattaya skyline]]\n\nThe name ''Pattaya'' evolved from the march of [[Phraya]] Tak (later [[King Taksin]]) and his army from [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province|Ayutthaya]] to [[Chanthaburi Province|Chanthaburi]], which took place before the fall of the former capital to [[Burma|Burmese]] invaders in 1767. When his army arrived in the vicinity of what is now Pattaya, Phraya Tak encountered the troops of a local leader named Nai Klom, who tried to intercept him. When the two met face to face, Nai Klom was impressed by Phraya Tak's dignified manner and his army's strict discipline. He surrendered without a fight and joined his forces. The place the armies confronted each other was thereafter known as \"Thap Phraya\", which means the \"army of the Phraya\". This later became Pattaya, the name of the wind blowing from the south-west to the north-east at the beginning of the rainy season.\n\nPattaya was a fishing village until the 1960s. Tourism began during the [[Vietnam War]], when American servicemen began arriving on [[R&R (military)|R&R]] (rest and relaxation). One large group who arrived from a base in [[Nakhon Ratchasima|Korat]] on 29 June 1959 and rented houses from Phraya Sunthorn at the south end of the beach, on what is now known as the \"Strip\", are credited with recommending Pattaya, whose fame spread by [[word of mouth]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schauseil|first1=Jan|title=Sattahip and the history of GIs coming to

census 2010 (National Statistics Office).<ref>http://citypopulation.de/Thailand-MunAreas.html</ref> Most of these people counted are Thai, with most migrant populations not recognized, although the details are quite complex as there are even indigenous Thais without nationality, and migrant workers have since been largely regularized (albeit with due foreign pressure).  Therefore, the census population even does not represent the total figure.  As for Thai nationals and legal permanent residents (very few) registering the city as their hometown, the provincial authority logged population was 107,944 in 2010, modestly rising to 119,530 by 2019.<ref name=\"TDD\"/> As with the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]], registered population figure issued by a different agency than the National Statistics Office hardly captures the scope of the urban transformation that has occurred over the time span \u2013 the economy is dependent on the large numbers of casual Thai workers who work in the city yet remain registered in their hometowns, there is much employment turnover and to and from the capital, as well as seasonal farm migration.  Migrant workers from neighboring nations, and many long-term [[expatriate]]s who reside in the city as retirees or self-employed or contracted are traditionally not counted.  There has never been a reliably published figure for total population, but its thought to be quite large (on the order of half a million people) given the ubiquity and sheer number of migrant workers taking place of Thai labor.  Pattaya city excludes some nearby areas like [[Nong Prue]] (73,901 people in 2010 census) and Huay Yai.\n\nPattaya additionally has massive population inflow from short stay tourism, with its 2000 hotels and 136,000 rooms available as of 2015.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=Bangkok Post | url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/chinese-put-squeeze-on-pattaya-hotels/622728 | title=Chinese put squeeze on Pattaya's hotels  | date=15 July 2015 | accessdate=12 March 2018 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nDue to the tourist industry, many people from the north-east (known as [[Isan]], the poorest region of Thailand) have come to work in Pattaya, and are counted for census purposes in their hometowns. A majority of these northeast workers fulfill positions in the Go-Go bar industry, the pay they can earn is far more than that in their home region of Isaan.\n\nA growing community of foreign [[Pensioner|retirees]] live in Pattaya. Thailand immigration has a special visa category for foreigners over age 50 who wish to retire in Thailand. Pattaya is attractive to many retirees from other countries not only because of its climate and lifestyle, but also because living costs are lower than in many countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2020 }}\n{{wide image|File:Pattaya Panorama.jpg|1024px|align-cap=center|Pattaya from Pratumnak Hill}}\n\n== Physical geography ==\n[[File:AmphoePattaya 2004.PNG|thumb|left|Mueang Pattaya, Bang Lamung District]]\n\nPattaya, on the Gulf of Thailand, is approximately {{convert|160|km}} south of the city of Bangkok in [[Bang Lamung District]], [[Chonburi Province]].\n\nThe city of Pattaya is a special municipal area which covers the whole ''tambon'' [[Nong Prue]] (Nongprue) and [[Na Kluea]] (Naklua) and parts of [[Huai Yai]] and [[Nong Pla Lai]].  [[Bang Lamung township]] which forms the northern border of Pattaya covers parts of the ''tambon'' Bang Lamung (Banglamung), [[Nong Pla Lai]] and [[Takhian Tia]]. Bang Sali is on the southern border of Pattaya.\n\n\"Greater Pattaya\" occupies most of the coastline of Banglamung (one of the eleven districts that make up Chonburi Province). It is divided into a larger northern section which spans the areas to the east of Naklua Beach (the most northern beach) and Pattaya Beach (the main beach) plus Pratamnak Hill (often called \"Buddha Hill\" because of the temples on top of the hill) headland immediately south of Pattaya Beach, and a smaller southern section covering the area to the east of Jomtien Beach (directly south of Pratamnak Hill).\n\n=== Beaches and islands ===\n{{wide image|Pattaya_Bay_Panorama.jpg|1050px|align-cap=center|The Pattaya Bay area is one of Asia's largest beach resorts and the second most visited city in Thailand, after Bangkok.

Pattaya Beach lies parallel to the city centre, and runs from Pattaya Nuea south to [[Walking Street, Pattaya|Walking Street]], about 2.7&nbsp;km long. The beach, which used to be 35&nbsp;m wide, suffers from erosion and in some places was reduced to a width of only two to three meters. A 429 million [[Thai baht|baht]] beach restoration scheme was implemented in 2018. It will take 360,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> of sand from Ko Rang Kwian offshore to increase the beach width to 50&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Restored Pattaya beach lures tourists |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1516086/restored-pattaya-beach-lures-tourists |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=5 August 2018}}</ref> Without intervention Pattaya will likely see its beaches disappear in roughly ten years according to [[Chulalongkorn University]] researchers. Within a month of the completion of the restoration of the first 400&nbsp;m of Pattaya Beach, the work was \"seriously damaged\" by flooding.

Pattaya Park and Pattaya tower are at the south end of Pratumnak and the Pattaya Exhibition And Convention Hall (P.E.A.C.H), is positioned at the north end of Pratumnak. In recent years, Pratumnak has gained in popularity because of its more natural environment, nicer beaches, and its convenient location between Jomtien and Pattaya city.\n\n[[Jomtien]] is divided from Pattaya by Thepprasit Road, the southern route into Pattaya city. It consists of high-rise condominiums, beach side hotels, bungalow complexes, shops, bars, and restaurants.\n\n[[File:US Navy 020528-N-0401E-003 Cobra Gold - amphibious landing.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Ko Khram]]'s shore and adjacent islets during a combined amphibious landing force exercise [[Cobra Gold]].]]\nOffshore islands include three \"near islands\": [[Ko Lan]] (main island), [[Ko Lan|Ko Sak]], and [[Ko Lan|Ko Krok]], {{convert|7|km}} from the shore of Pattaya.

They judged water quality near Na Klua in North Pattaya, South Pattaya, Ko Lan, and Jomtien Beach as \"fairly good\". The city has considered expanding two water management plants to increase capacity for better treatment of wastewater prior to discharge into the ocean. The water treatment plant in Soi Wat Nongyai after expansion would be able to treat around 130,000 cubic metres of waste water a day, up from 80,000 cubic metres at present.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pupattanapong|first1=Chaiyot|title=Pattaya sea water quality gets 'poor' grade|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1015553/pattaya-sea-water-quality-gets-poor-grade|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-06-21}}</ref> The expansion was never implemented.<ref name=BP-20181123/>\n\nIn November 2018, the Pattaya City Council approved 188 million [[Thai baht|baht]] for the repair of its six wastewater treatment plants. Installed in 2000, the plants can accommodate 65,000 m<sup>3</sup> of wastewater per day. More than a third of plant equipment was found to be 40\u201350 percent worn out. The system treats waste from a 36&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> portion of Pattaya, or 68 percent of its urban area. Earlier plans to increase treatment capacity to 135,000 m<sup>3</sup> were never implemented and existing plants were allowed to fall into disrepair. Pattaya uses more than 200,000 m<sup>3</sup> of water a day, but claims to only discharge about 70,000 m<sup>3</sup> a day. The discrepancy is unexplained. Once treated, there are no tests to measure water quality before it is dumped back into the sea, which may account for foul water discharges.<ref name=BP-20181123>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Wastewater stations to get B188m |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1580522/wastewater-stations-to-get-b188m |accessdate=2018-11-26 |work=Bangkok Post |date=2018-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Hilton Pattaya Pool dusk view 201801.jpg|thumb|Hotel overlooking Pattaya Bay]]\n\nPattaya is at the center of Thailand's [[Eastern Economic Corridor]] (EEC). Investments totaling more than 1.5 trillion baht (US$45 billion) are flowing into EEC infrastructure projects: airports, deep-sea ports, high-speed railways, autoroutes. The result will enhance Pattaya's accessibility. According to the [[Thai Chamber of Commerce]] (TCC) the EEC investments, the [[U-Tapao International Airport]] and the [[High-speed rail in Thailand|high-speed train]] that will link three major airports to Pattaya, will make Pattaya the heart of the eastern region. The TCC view is that, \"Plenty of attractions...will lure lots more foreign and domestic tourists in the future.\" Better connectivity will reduce both the cost and time to travel to Pattaya, with the TCC estimating the number of tourists visiting the EEC region to rise to 46.7 million over the next few years, one and half times the current 29.8 million visitors. Pattaya projects include developing a tram in the city and building a bigger cruise terminal, as well as new tourist attractions: a water park, an ice dome, cultural markets, Thai boxing gyms, theaters, and conference halls. All are under development. \"We aimed to get rid of the previous [seedy] image of Pattaya and try to promote a new image to show that Pattaya is a place for everyone with diversity of new tourist attractions,\" said an official of the [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] (TAT). He said that the EEC would make Pattaya more competitive compared with other popular Thai beach destinations such as [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] and [[Ko Samui]], with cheaper transport costs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phoonphongphiphat |first1=Apornrath |title=Thai businesses to revitalize Pattaya tourism via economic zone |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Trends/Thai-businesses-to-revitalize-Pattaya-tourism-via-economic-zone |accessdate=7 August 2018 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=6 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pattaya-11.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Shopping mall in Pattaya]]\n[[File:Pattaya in daytime June 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Central Pattaya]]\nFourteen million visitors in 2018 contributed 239 billion [[Thai baht|baht]] to the city's treasury.

It is on the east coast of the [[Gulf of Thailand]], about {{convert|100|km}} southeast of [[Bangkok]], within, but not part of, [[Bang Lamung District]] in the province of [[Chonburi Province|Chonburi]].

The city is in the industrial [[Eastern Seaboard of Thailand|Eastern Seaboard]] zone, along with [[Si Racha]], [[Laem Chabang]], and [[Chonburi (city)|Chonburi]]. Pattaya is at the center of the Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area\u2014a [[wikt:conurbation|conurbation]] in Chonburi Province\u2014with a population of roughly 1,000,000.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pattaya,_Thailand_Skyline.jpg|thumb|left|Pattaya skyline]]\n\nThe name ''Pattaya'' evolved from the march of [[Phraya]] Tak (later [[King Taksin]]) and his army from [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province|Ayutthaya]] to [[Chanthaburi Province|Chanthaburi]], which took place before the fall of the former capital to [[Burma|Burmese]] invaders in 1767. When his army arrived in the vicinity of what is now Pattaya, Phraya Tak encountered the troops of a local leader named Nai Klom, who tried to intercept him. When the two met face to face, Nai Klom was impressed by Phraya Tak's dignified manner and his army's strict discipline. He surrendered without a fight and joined his forces. The place the armies confronted each other was thereafter known as \"Thap Phraya\", which means the \"army of the Phraya\". This later became Pattaya, the name of the wind blowing from the south-west to the north-east at the beginning of the rainy season.\n\nPattaya was a fishing village until the 1960s. Tourism began during the [[Vietnam War]], when American servicemen began arriving on [[R&R (military)|R&R]] (rest and relaxation). One large group who arrived from a base in [[Nakhon Ratchasima|Korat]] on 29 June 1959 and rented houses from Phraya Sunthorn at the south end of the beach, on what is now known as the \"Strip\", are credited with recommending Pattaya, whose fame spread by [[word of mouth]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schauseil|first1=Jan|title=Sattahip and the history of GIs coming to

census 2010 (National Statistics Office).<ref>http://citypopulation.de/Thailand-MunAreas.html</ref> Most of these people counted are Thai, with most migrant populations not recognized, although the details are quite complex as there are even indigenous Thais without nationality, and migrant workers have since been largely regularized (albeit with due foreign pressure).  Therefore, the census population even does not represent the total figure.  As for Thai nationals and legal permanent residents (very few) registering the city as their hometown, the provincial authority logged population was 107,944 in 2010, modestly rising to 119,530 by 2019.<ref name=\"TDD\"/> As with the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]], registered population figure issued by a different agency than the National Statistics Office hardly captures the scope of the urban transformation that has occurred over the time span \u2013 the economy is dependent on the large numbers of casual Thai workers who work in the city yet remain registered in their hometowns, there is much employment turnover and to and from the capital, as well as seasonal farm migration.  Migrant workers from neighboring nations, and many long-term [[expatriate]]s who reside in the city as retirees or self-employed or contracted are traditionally not counted.  There has never been a reliably published figure for total population, but its thought to be quite large (on the order of half a million people) given the ubiquity and sheer number of migrant workers taking place of Thai labor.  Pattaya city excludes some nearby areas like [[Nong Prue]] (73,901 people in 2010 census) and Huay Yai.\n\nPattaya additionally has massive population inflow from short stay tourism, with its 2000 hotels and 136,000 rooms available as of 2015.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=Bangkok Post | url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/chinese-put-squeeze-on-pattaya-hotels/622728 | title=Chinese put squeeze on Pattaya's hotels  | date=15 July 2015 | accessdate=12 March 2018 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nDue to the tourist industry, many people from the north-east (known as [[Isan]], the poorest region of Thailand) have come to work in Pattaya, and are counted for census purposes in their hometowns. A majority of these northeast workers fulfill positions in the Go-Go bar industry, the pay they can earn is far more than that in their home region of Isaan.\n\nA growing community of foreign [[Pensioner|retirees]] live in Pattaya. Thailand immigration has a special visa category for foreigners over age 50 who wish to retire in Thailand. Pattaya is attractive to many retirees from other countries not only because of its climate and lifestyle, but also because living costs are lower than in many countries.{{citation needed|date=February 2020 }}\n{{wide image|File:Pattaya Panorama.jpg|1024px|align-cap=center|Pattaya from Pratumnak Hill}}\n\n== Physical geography ==\n[[File:AmphoePattaya 2004.PNG|thumb|left|Mueang Pattaya, Bang Lamung District]]\n\nPattaya, on the Gulf of Thailand, is approximately {{convert|160|km}} south of the city of Bangkok in [[Bang Lamung District]], [[Chonburi Province]].\n\nThe city of Pattaya is a special municipal area which covers the whole ''tambon'' [[Nong Prue]] (Nongprue) and [[Na Kluea]] (Naklua) and parts of [[Huai Yai]] and [[Nong Pla Lai]].  [[Bang Lamung township]] which forms the northern border of Pattaya covers parts of the ''tambon'' Bang Lamung (Banglamung), [[Nong Pla Lai]] and [[Takhian Tia]]. Bang Sali is on the southern border of Pattaya.\n\n\"Greater Pattaya\" occupies most of the coastline of Banglamung (one of the eleven districts that make up Chonburi Province). It is divided into a larger northern section which spans the areas to the east of Naklua Beach (the most northern beach) and Pattaya Beach (the main beach) plus Pratamnak Hill (often called \"Buddha Hill\" because of the temples on top of the hill) headland immediately south of Pattaya Beach, and a smaller southern section covering the area to the east of Jomtien Beach (directly south of Pratamnak Hill).\n\n=== Beaches and islands ===\n{{wide image|Pattaya_Bay_Panorama.jpg|1050px|align-cap=center|The Pattaya Bay area is one of Asia's largest beach resorts and the second most visited city in Thailand, after Bangkok.

Pattaya Beach lies parallel to the city centre, and runs from Pattaya Nuea south to [[Walking Street, Pattaya|Walking Street]], about 2.7&nbsp;km long. The beach, which used to be 35&nbsp;m wide, suffers from erosion and in some places was reduced to a width of only two to three meters. A 429 million [[Thai baht|baht]] beach restoration scheme was implemented in 2018. It will take 360,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> of sand from Ko Rang Kwian offshore to increase the beach width to 50&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Restored Pattaya beach lures tourists |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1516086/restored-pattaya-beach-lures-tourists |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=5 August 2018}}</ref> Without intervention Pattaya will likely see its beaches disappear in roughly ten years according to [[Chulalongkorn University]] researchers. Within a month of the completion of the restoration of the first 400&nbsp;m of Pattaya Beach, the work was \"seriously damaged\" by flooding.

Pattaya Park and Pattaya tower are at the south end of Pratumnak and the Pattaya Exhibition And Convention Hall (P.E.A.C.H), is positioned at the north end of Pratumnak. In recent years, Pratumnak has gained in popularity because of its more natural environment, nicer beaches, and its convenient location between Jomtien and Pattaya city.\n\n[[Jomtien]] is divided from Pattaya by Thepprasit Road, the southern route into Pattaya city. It consists of high-rise condominiums, beach side hotels, bungalow complexes, shops, bars, and restaurants.\n\n[[File:US Navy 020528-N-0401E-003 Cobra Gold - amphibious landing.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Ko Khram]]'s shore and adjacent islets during a combined amphibious landing force exercise [[Cobra Gold]].]]\nOffshore islands include three \"near islands\": [[Ko Lan]] (main island), [[Ko Lan|Ko Sak]], and [[Ko Lan|Ko Krok]], {{convert|7|km}} from the shore of Pattaya.

City officials blamed the incident on broken pumps and Pattaya's poorly maintained sewage-treatment plant. The environmental ministry declared it would step up enforcement of pollution laws and push Pattaya for better wastewater-treatment efficiency. According to the ministry, Pattaya has 1,047 identified sources of sewage and garbage pollution, the number increasing as the city grows.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Homklin|first1=Jetsada|title=Pattaya sewage problem in government crosshairs| url=http://www.pattayamail.com/news/pattaya-sewage-problem-government-crosshairs-186138|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=Pattaya Mail|date=2017-09-16}}</ref> The sea water along central Pattaya beaches is of poor quality even in the absence of sewage spills and \"could endanger human and marine life\", the regional environmental office has said. They deemed sea water quality near central Pattaya beaches as \"poor\" and deteriorating. They judged water quality near Na Klua in North Pattaya, South Pattaya, Ko Lan, and Jomtien Beach as \"fairly good\". The city has considered expanding two water management plants to increase capacity for better treatment of wastewater prior to discharge into the ocean. The water treatment plant in Soi Wat Nongyai after expansion would be able to treat around 130,000 cubic metres of waste water a day, up from 80,000 cubic metres at present.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pupattanapong|first1=Chaiyot|title=Pattaya sea water quality gets 'poor' grade|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1015553/pattaya-sea-water-quality-gets-poor-grade|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-06-21}}</ref> The expansion was never implemented.<ref name=BP-20181123/>\n\nIn November 2018, the Pattaya City Council approved 188 million [[Thai baht|baht]] for the repair of its six wastewater treatment plants. Installed in 2000, the plants can accommodate 65,000 m<sup>3</sup> of wastewater per day. More than a third of plant equipment was found to be 40\u201350 percent worn out. The system treats waste from a 36&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> portion of Pattaya, or 68 percent of its urban area. Earlier plans to increase treatment capacity to 135,000 m<sup>3</sup> were never implemented and existing plants were allowed to fall into disrepair. Pattaya uses more than 200,000 m<sup>3</sup> of water a day, but claims to only discharge about 70,000 m<sup>3</sup> a day. The discrepancy is unexplained. Once treated, there are no tests to measure water quality before it is dumped back into the sea, which may account for foul water discharges.<ref name=BP-20181123>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Wastewater stations to get B188m |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1580522/wastewater-stations-to-get-b188m |accessdate=2018-11-26 |work=Bangkok Post |date=2018-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Hilton Pattaya Pool dusk view 201801.jpg|thumb|Hotel overlooking Pattaya Bay]]\n\nPattaya is at the center of Thailand's [[Eastern Economic Corridor]] (EEC). Investments totaling more than 1.5 trillion baht (US$45 billion) are flowing into EEC infrastructure projects: airports, deep-sea ports, high-speed railways, autoroutes. The result will enhance Pattaya's accessibility. According to the [[Thai Chamber of Commerce]] (TCC) the EEC investments, the [[U-Tapao International Airport]] and the [[High-speed rail in Thailand|high-speed train]] that will link three major airports to Pattaya, will make Pattaya the heart of the eastern region. The TCC view is that, \"Plenty of attractions...will lure lots more foreign and domestic tourists in the future.\" Better connectivity will reduce both the cost and time to travel to Pattaya, with the TCC estimating the number of tourists visiting the EEC region to rise to 46.7 million over the next few years, one and half times the current 29.8 million visitors. Pattaya projects include developing a tram in the city and building a bigger cruise terminal, as well as new tourist attractions: a water park, an ice dome, cultural markets, Thai boxing gyms, theaters, and conference halls. All are under development. \"We aimed to get rid of the previous [seedy] image of Pattaya and try to promote a new image to show that Pattaya is a place for everyone with diversity of new tourist attractions,\" said an official of the [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] (TAT). He said that the EEC would make Pattaya more competitive compared with other popular Thai beach destinations such as [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] and [[Ko Samui]], with cheaper transport costs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phoonphongphiphat |first1=Apornrath |title=Thai businesses to revitalize Pattaya tourism via economic zone |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Trends/Thai-businesses-to-revitalize-Pattaya-tourism-via-economic-zone |accessdate=7 August 2018 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=6 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pattaya-11.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Shopping mall in Pattaya]]\n[[File:Pattaya in daytime June 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Central Pattaya]]\nFourteen million visitors in 2018 contributed 239 billion [[Thai baht|baht]] to the city's treasury.

advertising]] of drugs.<ref name=statmarketing/><ref name=mmm/>\n\nThe first television commercial for a drug was aired in the US in 1983 by [[Boots UK|Boots]], and sparked controversy. The FDA responded with strong regulation requiring disclosure of side effects and other information. These rules made pharmaceutical manufacturers balk at spending money on ads that had to highlight negative aspects.<ref name=statmarketing>{{Cite news|url=https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/11/untold-story-tvs-first-prescription-drug-ad/|title=The untold story of TV's first prescription drug ad|date=2015-12-11|work=STAT|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the marketing team for Claritin at Schering-Plough found a way around these rules. They created [[brand awareness]] commercials that never actually said what the drug was for, but instead showed sunny images, and the [[voiceover]] said things like \"At last, a clear day is here\" and \"It's time for Claritin\" and repeatedly told viewers to \"ask your doctor\" about Claritin.<ref name=statmarketing/><ref name=mmm/>   The first ads succeeded in making people aware of the brand and increased prescriptions, which led Schering-Plough and others to aggressively pursue the advertising strategy.<ref name=mmm>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmm-online.com/features/dtc-the-first-10-years/article/24443/|title=DTC: The first 10 years|date=2007-04-01|work=MM&M|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis trend, along with advice from its attorneys that it could not win a [[First Amendment]] case on the issue, led the FDA to issue new rules for TV commercials in 1997.<ref name=statmarketing/> Instead of including the \"brief summary\" that took up a full page in magazine ads and would take too long to explain in a TV commercial, drug makers were allowed to refer viewers to print ads, 1-800 numbers, or websites, and urge people to talk to their doctor if they wanted additional information.<ref name=statmarketing/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/news/ten-years-direct-consumer-drug-advertising/112215/|title=Ten Years Later: Direct to Consumer Drug Advertising|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSchering-Plough invested $322 million in Claritin direct-to-consumer advertising in 1998 and 1999, far more than any other brand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/11/magazine/the-claritin-effect-prescription-for-profit.html|title=The Claritin Effect; Prescription for Profit|last=Hall|first=Stephen S.|date=2001-03-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Overall, spending on direct-to-consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry rose from $360 million in 1995 to $1.3 billion in 1998, and by 2006, was $5 billion.<ref name=statmarketing/>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Benzocycloheptenes]]\n* [[Azatadine]] (loratidine minus chlorine atom and ester)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web | url = https://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/name/loratadine | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine | work = Drug Information Portal | title = Loratadine }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070625170636/http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/lorat.htm Claritin (loratadine) drug description]&nbsp;\u2013 RxList (Internet Drug Index)\n\n{{Schering-Plough|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Antihistamines}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = [[Pharmacodynamics]]\n| titlestyle = background:#ccccff\n| list1 = \n{{Histamine receptor modulators}}\n{{PAF receptor modulators}}\n{{Xenobiotic-sensing receptor modulators}}\n}}\n{{Tricyclics}}\n{{portal bar|Pharmacy and pharmacology|Medicine}}\n\n[[Category:H1 receptor antagonists]]\n[[Category:Bayer brands]]\n[[Category:Carbamates]]\n[[Category:Schering-Plough brands]]\n[[Category:Merck & Co. brands]]\n[[Category:Wyeth brands]]\n[[Category:Pfizer brands]]\n[[Category:Piperidines]]\n[[Category:Chloroarenes]]\n[[Category:Benzocycloheptapyridines]]\n[[Category:Peripherally selective drugs]]\n[[Category:World Health Organization essential medicines]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n[[Category:1988 introductions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Medication used to treat allergies}}\n{{Drugbox\n| Verifiedfields = changed\n| verifiedrevid = 408580634\n| drug_name = \n| IUPAC_name = Ethyl 4-(8-chloro-5,6-dihydro-11H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[1,2-b]pyridin-11-ylidene)-1-piperidinecarboxylate\n| image = Loratadine.svg\n| image2 = Loratadine -
