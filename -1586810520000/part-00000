The party ends with Daisy driving Gatsby out of New York City in Gatsby's car, while Tom leaves with Nick and Jordan. Tom's mistress Myrtle Wilson, who earlier had a falling out with Tom, runs in front of Gatsby's car in hopes of reconciling with Tom. Daisy does not see her until it is too late, and runs her over. Daisy, panicked, drives away from the scene of the accident. In her home in East Egg, Gatsby assures her that he will take the blame. Tom tells George, Myrtle's husband, that it was Gatsby that killed Myrtle. George goes to Gatsby's home in West Egg and shoots Gatsby dead before turning the gun on himself. After Gatsby's murder, Daisy, Tom, and their daughter leave East Egg, having no forwarding address.\n\n=== Film and other adaptations ===\n[[Image:Lois_Wilson_(actress)_by_Edwin_Bower_Hesser.jpg|thumb|right|150px|link=Lois Wilson (actress)|Actress [[Lois Wilson (actress)|Lois Wilson]] portrayed Daisy in the [[The Great Gatsby (1926 film)|1926 film version]].]]\nThe [[The Great Gatsby (1926 film)|first adaptation of ''The Great Gatsby'']] was a silent film produced in 1926 and featured [[Lois Wilson (actress)|Lois Wilson]] as Daisy.

She fakes ignorance when speaking in Tom's presence but then reveals her actual feelings to Nick, including the fact that she had hoped her daughter would be unintelligent. From this, it is implied that her mannerisms are not some mere attempt at fooling those around her but actually contribute to an ongoing effort to serve as a role model toward her daughter and be directly responsible for her not learning much and becoming the \"beautiful little fool\" that she had aspired to have for a child. Daisy's motivations in wanting this are revealed by her to be that of hoping that her daughter is spared the unpleasant events that can occur in one's life and rooted in her view that she will not be affected by the emotional pain of her life as in being moronic, she cannot understand the events transpiring around her.\n\nThough she is faithful to her husband in the years of their marriage leading up to Gatsby's return, she jumps nearly instantly at the chance of being able to have an affair with Gatsby. While it appears at first that this is a mere relationship of lust between two former lovers that are seeking to reignite an old flame, it is later revealed by Daisy's words to Tom after he learns of the relationship that she went along with it due to her feeling of neglect by her husband. Not only did her neglect drive her to the point of breaking a vow, but so did her ambitions to have an actual fulfilling relationship for the first time since shortly after she married, as Daisy reveals the lack of intimacy between her and Tom, further evidenced by his continued decline to show her any type of consideration in their shared appearances. Daisy's reluctance to accept Tom's claims of remorse demonstrate that her trust is not earned easily and the fact that she continues seeing Gatsby following this proves that she was not as concerned with the consequences of her cheating than that of her happiness.\n\nLooking at Daisy's character, one can see she did care for Gatsby, though maybe not as much as she ended up caring for Tom. Daisy was important to Gatsby because Daisy made Gatsby feel loved. Though no matter what Gatsby did to win Daisy's affection, she married Tom and remained married to him despite Gatsby's pursuit of her. \u201c[Gatsby\u2019s] efforts to attain Daisy\u2026are no more successful, as she abandons him and he realizes too late that he has set his sights on the wrong goal.\u201d <ref>Comeau, Patrice, \"Boats Against the Current: The American Dream as Death Denial in F.

After Gatsby started attending [[Trinity College, Oxford]], Daisy sent him a letter revealing that she had married Tom Buchanan. During the marriage, Daisy gave birth to a daughter, Pammy, who Daisy had hoped would be \"a beautiful little fool.\" Daisy and her family settled in East Egg, a wealthy old money enclave on [[Long Island]].\n\nAfter her cousin [[Nick Carraway]] arrives in West Egg, the neighboring island, he meets Gatsby, who by now has become extremely wealthy.

Once the group reach the city, they throw a party that turns into a confrontation between Daisy, Tom and Gatsby. Though Gatsby insisted that Daisy never loved Tom, Daisy admits that she loves both Tom and Gatsby. The party ends with Daisy driving Gatsby out of New York City in Gatsby's car, while Tom leaves with Nick and Jordan. Tom's mistress Myrtle Wilson, who earlier had a falling out with Tom, runs in front of Gatsby's car in hopes of reconciling with Tom. Daisy does not see her until it is too late, and runs her over. Daisy, panicked, drives away from the scene of the accident. In her home in East Egg, Gatsby assures her that he will take the blame. Tom tells George, Myrtle's husband, that it was Gatsby that killed Myrtle. George goes to Gatsby's home in West Egg and shoots Gatsby dead before turning the gun on himself. After Gatsby's murder, Daisy, Tom, and their daughter leave East Egg, having no forwarding address.\n\n=== Film and other adaptations ===\n[[Image:Lois_Wilson_(actress)_by_Edwin_Bower_Hesser.jpg|thumb|right|150px|link=Lois Wilson (actress)|Actress [[Lois Wilson (actress)|Lois Wilson]] portrayed Daisy in the [[The Great Gatsby (1926 film)|1926 film version]].]]\nThe [[The Great Gatsby (1926 film)|first adaptation of ''The Great Gatsby'']] was a silent film produced in 1926 and featured [[Lois Wilson (actress)|Lois Wilson]] as Daisy.

She fakes ignorance when speaking in Tom's presence but then reveals her actual feelings to Nick, including the fact that she had hoped her daughter would be unintelligent. From this, it is implied that her mannerisms are not some mere attempt at fooling those around her but actually contribute to an ongoing effort to serve as a role model toward her daughter and be directly responsible for her not learning much and becoming the \"beautiful little fool\" that she had aspired to have for a child. Daisy's motivations in wanting this are revealed by her to be that of hoping that her daughter is spared the unpleasant events that can occur in one's life and rooted in her view that she will not be affected by the emotional pain of her life as in being moronic, she cannot understand the events transpiring around her.\n\nThough she is faithful to her husband in the years of their marriage leading up to Gatsby's return, she jumps nearly instantly at the chance of being able to have an affair with Gatsby. While it appears at first that this is a mere relationship of lust between two former lovers that are seeking to reignite an old flame, it is later revealed by Daisy's words to Tom after he learns of the relationship that she went along with it due to her feeling of neglect by her husband. Not only did her neglect drive her to the point of breaking a vow, but so did her ambitions to have an actual fulfilling relationship for the first time since shortly after she married, as Daisy reveals the lack of intimacy between her and Tom, further evidenced by his continued decline to show her any type of consideration in their shared appearances. Daisy's reluctance to accept Tom's claims of remorse demonstrate that her trust is not earned easily and the fact that she continues seeing Gatsby following this proves that she was not as concerned with the consequences of her cheating than that of her happiness.\n\nLooking at Daisy's character, one can see she did care for Gatsby, though maybe not as much as she ended up caring for Tom. Daisy was important to Gatsby because Daisy made Gatsby feel loved. Though no matter what Gatsby did to win Daisy's affection, she married Tom and remained married to him despite Gatsby's pursuit of her. \u201c[Gatsby\u2019s] efforts to attain Daisy\u2026are no more successful, as she abandons him and he realizes too late that he has set his sights on the wrong goal.\u201d <ref>Comeau, Patrice, \"Boats Against the Current: The American Dream as Death Denial in F.

One World Trade Center (WTC 1) the \"North Tower\" was hit at 8:46&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]] and [[structural integrity and failure|collapsed]] at 10:28&nbsp;a.m. Two World Trade Center (WTC 2) the \"South Tower\" was hit at 9:02&nbsp;a.m. and collapsed at 9:59&nbsp;a.m. The resulting debris severely damaged or destroyed more than a dozen other adjacent and nearby structures, ultimately leading to the collapse of [[7 World Trade Center#Original building (1987\u20132001)|Seven World Trade Center]] at 5:21&nbsp;p.m.\n\n[[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|A total of 2,763 people were killed]] in the collapses, including 2,192 [[civilian]]s, 343 [[firefighter]]s, and 71 [[law enforcement officer]]s as well as all the passengers and crew on the airplanes, which included 147 civilians and the ten hijackers.\n\nIn September 2005, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) published the results of [[NIST World Trade Center Disaster Investigation|its investigation into the collapse]]. The investigators did not find anything substandard in the design of the twin towers, noting that the severity of the attacks was beyond anything experienced in buildings in the past. They determined the fires to be the main cause of the collapses, finding that sagging floors pulled inward on the perimeter columns, causing them to bow and then to buckle. Once the upper section of the building began to move downwards, a total progressive collapse was unavoidable.\n\nThe cleanup of the [[World Trade Center site]] involved round-the-clock operations and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Some surrounding structures that were not hit by the airplanes still sustained significant damage, requiring them to be torn down. Demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings continued even as new construction proceeded on the Twin Towers' replacement, the new [[One World Trade Center]], which was opened in November 2014. \n\n==Background==\nUpon completion, the Twin Towers were briefly the tallest buildings in the world, and at the time of the terrorist attacks they were still in the top five.

As the North Tower had been struck directly midway into the structure, the three stairways in the tower core were all damaged or blocked by debris preventing escape to lower floors. In the South Tower, the impact was slightly off center to the central section of the tower and stairway A in the northwest portion of the central core was only partially blocked, and 14 to 18 civilians managed to escape from the point of aircraft impact and the floors above that. The exact numbers of who perished and where in some cases is not precisely known; however the National Institute of Standards and Technology report indicated that a total of 1,402 civilians perished at or above the impact point in the North Tower with hundreds estimated to have been killed at the moment of impact. In the South Tower, 614 civilians perished at the impacted floors and the floors above that. Fewer than 200 of the civilian fatalities occurred in the floors below the impact points but all 147 civilian passengers and crew on the two aircraft as well as all 10 terrorists perished, along with at least 18 people on the ground and in adjacent structures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/13/khalid.sheikh.mohammed/index.html|title=Accused 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed faces New York trial|date=November 13, 2009|work=Cabne News Network|access-date=August 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225172634/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/13/khalid.sheikh.mohammed/index.html|archive-date=December 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAll told, emergency personnel killed in the collapse included 343 [[New York City Fire Department]] (FDNY); and 71 law enforcement officers including 23 members of the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD), 37 members of the [[Port Authority Police Department]] (PAPD), five members of the [[New York State Office of Tax Enforcement]] (OTE), three officers of the [[New York State Office of Court Administration]] (OCA), one fire marshal of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) who had sworn law enforcement powers (and was also among the 343 FDNY members killed), one member of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and one member of the [[United States Secret Service]] (USSS). The total death toll for civilian and non-civilians is estimated to be 2,606 persons.\n\n==Collapse==\nThe destruction of the Twin Towers has been called \"the most infamous paradigm\" of [[progressive collapse]].<ref name=\"Bazant07\"/> They began with the local failure of a few structural components and progressed to encompass the whole of the structure.<ref name=\"Starossek2019d\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=1}}</ref> Such collapses are characterized by \"the separation of structural components (including non-load bearing elements), the release of gravitational energy, and the occurrence of impact forces.\" The vertical impact force supplies the propagating action, the principal forces are parallel, and the primary load transfer is serial.<ref name=\"Starossek2009b\" /> The key element in the structure that failed was constituted by the combined \"vertical load-bearing members of one entire storey.\" Excepting the top floors of the building, which would not have released sufficient gravitational energy to bring about a total collapse, the collapses could have begun with the failure of any story.<ref name=\"Starossek2019c\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=101-2}}</ref>\n\nUnder these conditions, the towers collapsed symmetrically and more or less straight down, though there was some tilting of the tops of the towers and a significant amount of fallout to the sides. In both cases, the section of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed, which allowed the floors above the impact zone to fall onto the undamaged structure below. As the collapse progressed, dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction, caused by the sudden rush of air from the upper levels.\n\nDuring each collapse, large portions of the perimeter columns and possibly the cores were left without any lateral support, causing them to fall laterally towards the outside, pushed by the increasing pile of rubble. The result was that the walls peeled off and separated away from the buildings by a large distance (about 500 feet in some cases), hitting other neighboring buildings, and starting fires that would later lead to the collapse of Building 7. Some connections broke as the bolts snapped, leaving many panels randomly scattered.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hamburger|first=Ronald|title=World Trade Center Building Performance Study|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|pages=2\u201327 & 2\u201335|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch2.pdf|access-date=2006-07-27|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527193541/http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch2.pdf|archive-date=May 27, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The first fragments of the outer walls of the collapsed North Tower struck the ground 11 seconds after the collapse started, and parts of the South Tower after 9 seconds. The lower portions of both buildings' cores (60 stories of WTC 1 and 40 stories of WTC 2) remained standing for up to 25 seconds after the start of the initial collapse before they too collapsed.<ref name=\"NISTFAQ\"/>\n\n===Collapse initiation===\n[[File:NorthWTCcollapse.png|thumb|Simple representation of the collapse of the North Tower]]\nAfter the planes struck the buildings, but before the buildings collapsed, the cores of both towers consisted of three distinct sections. Above and below the impact floors, the cores consisted of what were essentially two rigid boxes; the steel in these sections was undamaged and had undergone no significant heating. The section between them, however, had sustained significant damage and, though they were not hot enough to melt it, the fires were weakening the structural steel.\n\nAs a result, the core columns were slowly being crushed, sustaining [[Deformation (engineering)|plastic]] and [[creep (deformation)|creep]] deformation from the weight of floors above. As the top section tried to move downward, however, the hat truss redistributed the load to the perimeter columns. Meanwhile, the perimeter columns and floors were also being weakened by the heat of the fires, and as the floors began to sag they pulled the exterior walls inwards. \"The ensuing loss in vertical load-carrying capacity was confined to a few storeys but extended over the entire cross section of each tower.\"<ref name=\"Starossek2009\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=12}}</ref> In the case of 2 WTC, the eastern face finally buckled, transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse. Later, the south wall of 1 WTC buckled in the same way, and with similar consequences.<ref>NIST report, p. 29</ref>\n\n===Total progressive collapse===\nStructural systems respond very differently to [[Structural load|static and dynamic loads]] and, while the towers were designed to support enormous weight under normal conditions, they provided little resistance to the moving mass of the section above the damaged floors. In both cases, the collapses began with the drop of the upper section through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or ten feet), yet a fall of only half a meter (about 20 inches) would have released the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.<ref name=\"BazantWhy\">{{Cite journal|last1=Ba\u017eant|first1=Z.

During the ''crush-down'' phase, the upper block destroyed the structure below in a progressive series of column failures roughly one story at a time. Each failure began with the impact of the upper block on the columns of the lower section, mediated by a growing layer of rubble consisting mainly of concrete from the floor slabs. The energy from each impact was \"reintroduced into the structure in [the] subsequent impact, ... concentrate[d] in the load-bearing elements directly affected by the impact.\"<ref name=\"Starossek2009b\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=13}}</ref> This buckled the columns of the story immediately beneath the advancing destruction down to the next point of lateral support, usually the floor trusses of the given story. After the columns buckled the block was once again unsupported and fell through the distance of that story, again impacting the columns of the story below, which then buckled in the same way.\n\nThis repeated until the upper block reached the ground and the ''crush-up'' phase began. Here, too, the columns buckled one story at a time, now starting from the bottom. As each story failed, the remaining block fell through the height of the story, onto the next one, which it also crushed, until the roof finally hit the ground.<ref name=\"Bazant07\"/> The process accelerated throughout, and by the end each story was being crushed in less than a tenth of a second.<ref name=\"BazantWhy\"/>\n\n===South Tower collapse===\n{{Main|World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)}}\n[[File:World Trade Center 3 After 9-11 Attacks With Original Building Locations.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Aerial view of the site after the collapse, with locations of the collapsed buildings outlined]]\nAs the fires continued to burn, occupants trapped in the upper floors of the South Tower provided information about conditions to [[9-1-1]] dispatchers.

This is because the fires were originally said to have \"melted\" the floors and columns.<ref>{{harvnb|Eagar|Musso|2001|p=8}}: \"The fire is the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse.

A significant portion of this fuel was consumed immediately in the ensuing fireballs. The remaining fuel is believed either to have flowed down through the buildings or to have burned off within a few minutes of the aircraft impact. The heat produced by this burning jet fuel does not by itself appear to have been sufficient to initiate the structural collapses. However, as the burning jet fuel spread across several floors of the buildings, it ignited much of the buildings\u2019 contents, causing simultaneous fires across several floors of both buildings. The heat output from these fires is estimated to have been comparable to the power produced by a large commercial power generating station.

But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near Column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, Column 79 soon buckled \u2013 pulling the East penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the entire building above to fall downward as a single unit.  From collapse timing measurements taken from a video of the north face of the building, NIST observed that the building's exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately 8 stories (32 meters, or 105 feet), noting \"the collapse time was approximately 40 percent longer than that of free fall for the first 18 stories of descent.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610|title=NIST NCSTAR 1A: Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=November 2008|pages=44\u201346|format=PDF|access-date=July 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121024658/http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610|archive-date=January 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.<ref name=\"ncstar1-a\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the old 7 World Trade Center is remarkable because it was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires.<ref name=\"nist-questions\" /> Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the twin towers, and urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered. Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST's recommendations is that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable.<ref name=\"ncstar1-a\"/>\n\n===Other investigations===\nIn 2003, Asif Usmani, Professor of Structural Engineering at [[University of Edinburgh]], published a paper with two colleagues. They provisionally concluded the fires alone, without any damage from the airplanes, could have been enough to bring down the buildings.

One World Trade Center (WTC 1) the \"North Tower\" was hit at 8:46&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]] and [[structural integrity and failure|collapsed]] at 10:28&nbsp;a.m. Two World Trade Center (WTC 2) the \"South Tower\" was hit at 9:02&nbsp;a.m. and collapsed at 9:59&nbsp;a.m. The resulting debris severely damaged or destroyed more than a dozen other adjacent and nearby structures, ultimately leading to the collapse of [[7 World Trade Center#Original building (1987\u20132001)|Seven World Trade Center]] at 5:21&nbsp;p.m.\n\n[[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|A total of 2,763 people were killed]] in the collapses, including 2,192 [[civilian]]s, 343 [[firefighter]]s, and 71 [[law enforcement officer]]s as well as all the passengers and crew on the airplanes, which included 147 civilians and the ten hijackers.\n\nIn September 2005, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) published the results of [[NIST World Trade Center Disaster Investigation|its investigation into the collapse]]. The investigators did not find anything substandard in the design of the twin towers, noting that the severity of the attacks was beyond anything experienced in buildings in the past. They determined the fires to be the main cause of the collapses, finding that sagging floors pulled inward on the perimeter columns, causing them to bow and then to buckle. Once the upper section of the building began to move downwards, a total progressive collapse was unavoidable.\n\nThe cleanup of the [[World Trade Center site]] involved round-the-clock operations and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Some surrounding structures that were not hit by the airplanes still sustained significant damage, requiring them to be torn down. Demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings continued even as new construction proceeded on the Twin Towers' replacement, the new [[One World Trade Center]], which was opened in November 2014. \n\n==Background==\nUpon completion, the Twin Towers were briefly the tallest buildings in the world, and at the time of the terrorist attacks they were still in the top five. One World Trade Center (WTC 1) the \"North Tower\" was, at {{convert|1368|ft}}, six feet taller than Two World Trade Center (WTC 2) the \"South Tower\", which stood {{convert|1362|ft|abbr=on}} tall. At the time of the attacks only the then recently completed [[Petronas Towers]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[Willis Tower]] (known then as the Sears Tower) in Chicago were taller.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Swanson|first1=Ana|title=Charted: The tallest buildings in the world for any year in history|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/11/charted-the-tallest-buildings-in-the-world-for-any-year-in-history/|accessdate=February 17, 2020|publisher=Washington Post|date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> Built with a novel design that maximized interior space, the towers had a high strength to weight ratio as they utilized a new [[Tube (structure)#Framed tube|\"framed tube\"]] design that required 40&nbsp;percent less steel than more traditional steel framed skyscrapers.<ref name=\"steel\">{{cite journal |author=American Iron and Steel Institute |title=The World Trade Center \u2013 New York City |journal=Contemporary Steel Design |volume=1 |year=1964 |publisher=American Iron and Steel Institute | issue=4}}</ref> In addition, atop WTC 1 stood a {{convert|362|foot|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} telecommunications antenna that was erected in 1978 bringing the total height of that tower to {{convert|1730|ft|m|abbr=on}}, though as a nonstructural addition, the antenna was not officially counted.\n\n===Structural design===\n{{see also|Construction of the World Trade Center}}\n[[File:Wtc floor truss system.png|right|thumb|Diagram showing floor truss system and concrete floor over steel pans]]\nThe towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans uninterrupted by columns or walls.

The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were therefore on {{convert|6.8|ft|m|adj=on}} centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the perimeter side and a channel welded to interior box columns on the core side. The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] dampers, which helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants.<ref name=\"NIST 1-1\"/> \n\nThe towers also incorporated a \"hat truss\" or \"outrigger truss\" located between the 107th and 110th floors, which consisted of six trusses along the long axis of core and four along the short axis.<ref name=\"NIST structure\"/> This truss system allowed optimized load redistribution of floor diaphragms between the perimeter and core, with improved performance between the different materials of flexible steel and rigid concrete allowing the moment frames to transfer sway into compression on the core, which also mostly supported the transmission tower. These trusses were installed in each building to support future transmission towers but only the north tower was ultimately fitted with one.<ref name=\"NIST structure\"/>\n\n===Evaluations for aircraft impact===\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|Aviation fueled fireball emerges from north side of WTC 2 immediately after impact.

Two of these jetliners, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and [[United Airlines Flight 175]], both [[Boeing 767]]s, were hijacked after takeoff from Boston's [[Logan International Airport]]. In its final moments, American Airlines Flight 11 flew south over [[Manhattan]] and crashed at roughly {{convert|440|mph|km/h}} into the north facade of the [[One World Trade Center#Original building (1970&ndash;2001)|North Tower]] (WTC 1) at 8:46&nbsp;am, impacting between the 93rd and 99th floors. Seventeen minutes later, United Airlines Flight 175 approached from the southwest, over [[New York Harbor]], and crashed into the south facade of the [[Two World Trade Center#Original building (1973\u20132001)|South Tower]] (WTC 2) at 9:02&nbsp;am between the 77th and 85th floors at {{convert|540|mph|km/h}}.\n\nIn addition to severing numerous load-bearing columns on the perimeter and inflicting other structural damage, the impacts ignited thousands of gallons of jet fuel, which in turn ignited office combustibles. About one third of the fuel was consumed in the initial impact and resulting fireball.<ref group=\"note\">According to [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) estimates, Flight 11 was carrying {{convert|10000|USgal|L}} of jet fuel when it hit the North Tower. {{convert|1500|USgal|L}} were consumed in the initial impact when the aircraft hit and a similar amount was consumed in the fireball outside the building. Approximately {{convert|7000|USgal|L}} burnt inside the office spaces igniting combustibles. Similarly, Flight 175 was carrying around {{convert|9100|USgal|L}} when it hit the South Tower. Up to {{convert|1500|USgal|L}} was instantly consumed in the initial fireball and up to {{convert|2275|USgal|L}} was consumed in the fireball outside the building. More than {{convert|5325|USgal|L}} was burnt in the office spaces.

As the North Tower had been struck directly midway into the structure, the three stairways in the tower core were all damaged or blocked by debris preventing escape to lower floors. In the South Tower, the impact was slightly off center to the central section of the tower and stairway A in the northwest portion of the central core was only partially blocked, and 14 to 18 civilians managed to escape from the point of aircraft impact and the floors above that. The exact numbers of who perished and where in some cases is not precisely known; however the National Institute of Standards and Technology report indicated that a total of 1,402 civilians perished at or above the impact point in the North Tower with hundreds estimated to have been killed at the moment of impact. In the South Tower, 614 civilians perished at the impacted floors and the floors above that. Fewer than 200 of the civilian fatalities occurred in the floors below the impact points but all 147 civilian passengers and crew on the two aircraft as well as all 10 terrorists perished, along with at least 18 people on the ground and in adjacent structures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/13/khalid.sheikh.mohammed/index.html|title=Accused 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed faces New York trial|date=November 13, 2009|work=Cabne News Network|access-date=August 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225172634/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/13/khalid.sheikh.mohammed/index.html|archive-date=December 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAll told, emergency personnel killed in the collapse included 343 [[New York City Fire Department]] (FDNY); and 71 law enforcement officers including 23 members of the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD), 37 members of the [[Port Authority Police Department]] (PAPD), five members of the [[New York State Office of Tax Enforcement]] (OTE), three officers of the [[New York State Office of Court Administration]] (OCA), one fire marshal of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) who had sworn law enforcement powers (and was also among the 343 FDNY members killed), one member of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and one member of the [[United States Secret Service]] (USSS). The total death toll for civilian and non-civilians is estimated to be 2,606 persons.\n\n==Collapse==\nThe destruction of Twin Towers has been called \"the most infamous paradigm\" of [[progressive collapse]].<ref name=\"Bazant07\"/> They began with the local failure of a few structural components and progressed to encompass the whole of the structure.<ref name=\"Starossek2019d\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=1}}</ref> Such collapses are characterized by \"the separation of structural components (including non-load bearing elements), the release of gravitational energy, and the occurrence of impact forces.\" The vertical impact force supplies the propagating action, the principal forces are parallel, and the primary load transfer is serial.<ref name=\"Starossek2009b\" /> The key element in the structure that failed was constituted by the combined \"vertical load-bearing members of one entire storey.\" Excepting the top floors of the building, which would not have released sufficient gravitational energy to bring about a total collapse, the collapses could have begun with the failure of any story.<ref name=\"Starossek2019c\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=101-2}}</ref>\n\nUnder these conditions, the towers collapsed symmetrically and more or less straight down, though there was some tilting of the tops of the towers and a significant amount of fallout to the sides. In both cases, the section of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed, which allowed the floors above the impact zone to fall onto the undamaged structure below. As the collapse progressed, dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction, caused by the sudden rush of air from the upper levels.\n\nDuring each collapse, large portions of the perimeter columns and possibly the cores were left without any lateral support, causing them to fall laterally towards the outside, pushed by the increasing pile of rubble. The result was that the walls peeled off and separated away from the buildings by a large distance (about 500 feet in some cases), hitting other neighboring buildings, and starting fires that would later lead to the collapse of Building 7. Some connections broke as the bolts snapped, leaving many panels randomly scattered.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hamburger|first=Ronald|title=World Trade Center Building Performance Study|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|pages=2\u201327 & 2\u201335|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch2.pdf|access-date=2006-07-27|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527193541/http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch2.pdf|archive-date=May 27, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The first fragments of the outer walls of the collapsed North Tower struck the ground 11 seconds after the collapse started, and parts of the South Tower after 9 seconds. The lower portions of both buildings' cores (60 stories of WTC 1 and 40 stories of WTC 2) remained standing for up to 25 seconds after the start of the initial collapse before they too collapsed.<ref name=\"NISTFAQ\"/>\n\n===Collapse initiation===\n[[File:NorthWTCcollapse.png|thumb|Simple representation of the collapse of the North Tower]]\nAfter the planes struck the buildings, but before the buildings collapsed, the cores of both towers consisted of three distinct sections. Above and below the impact floors, the cores consisted of what were essentially two rigid boxes; the steel in these sections was undamaged and had undergone no significant heating. The section between them, however, had sustained significant damage and, though they were not hot enough to melt it, the fires were weakening the structural steel.\n\nAs a result, the core columns were slowly being crushed, sustaining [[Deformation (engineering)|plastic]] and [[creep (deformation)|creep]] deformation from the weight of floors above. As the top section tried to move downward, however, the hat truss redistributed the load to the perimeter columns. Meanwhile, the perimeter columns and floors were also being weakened by the heat of the fires, and as the floors began to sag they pulled the exterior walls inwards. \"The ensuing loss in vertical load-carrying capacity was confined to a few storeys but extended over the entire cross section of each tower.\"<ref name=\"Starossek2009\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=12}}</ref> In the case of 2 WTC, the eastern face finally buckled, transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse. Later, the south wall of 1 WTC buckled in the same way, and with similar consequences.<ref>NIST report, p. 29</ref>\n\n===Total progressive collapse===\nStructural systems respond very differently to [[Structural load|static and dynamic loads]] and, while the towers were designed to support enormous weight under normal conditions, they provided little resistance to the moving mass of the section above the damaged floors. In both cases, the collapses began with the drop of the upper section through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or ten feet), yet a fall of only half a meter (about 20 inches) would have released the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.<ref name=\"BazantWhy\">{{Cite journal|last1=Ba\u017eant|first1=Z.

During the ''crush-down'' phase, the upper block destroyed the structure below in a progressive series of column failures roughly one story at a time. Each failure began with the impact of the upper block on the columns of the lower section, mediated by a growing layer of rubble consisting mainly of concrete from the floor slabs. The energy from each impact was \"reintroduced into the structure in [the] subsequent impact, ... concentrate[d] in the load-bearing elements directly affected by the impact.\"<ref name=\"Starossek2009b\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=13}}</ref> This buckled the columns of the story immediately beneath the advancing destruction down to the next point of lateral support, usually the floor trusses of the given story. After the columns buckled the block was once again unsupported and fell through the distance of that story, again impacting the columns of the story below, which then buckled in the same way.\n\nThis repeated until the upper block reached the ground and the ''crush-up'' phase began. Here, too, the columns buckled one story at a time, now starting from the bottom. As each story failed, the remaining block fell through the height of the story, onto the next one, which it also crushed, until the roof finally hit the ground.<ref name=\"Bazant07\"/> The process accelerated throughout, and by the end each story was being crushed in less than a tenth of a second.<ref name=\"BazantWhy\"/>\n\n===South Tower collapse===\n{{Main|World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)}}\n[[File:World Trade Center 3 After 9-11 Attacks With Original Building Locations.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Aerial view of the site after the collapse, with locations of the collapsed buildings outlined]]\nAs the fires continued to burn, occupants trapped in the upper floors of the South Tower provided information about conditions to [[9-1-1]] dispatchers.

Many structural engineers believe that the weak points\u2014the limiting factors on design allowables\u2014were the angle clips that held the floor joists between the columns on the perimeter wall and the core structure.\"</ref>\n{{quotation|The large quantity of jet fuel carried by each aircraft ignited upon impact into each building. A significant portion of this fuel was consumed immediately in the ensuing fireballs. The remaining fuel is believed either to have flowed down through the buildings or to have burned off within a few minutes of the aircraft impact. The heat produced by this burning jet fuel does not by itself appear to have been sufficient to initiate the structural collapses. However, as the burning jet fuel spread across several floors of the buildings, it ignited much of the buildings\u2019 contents, causing simultaneous fires across several floors of both buildings. The heat output from these fires is estimated to have been comparable to the power produced by a large commercial power generating station. Over a  period of many minutes, this heat induced additional stresses into the damaged structural frames while simultaneously softening and weakening these frames. This additional loading and the resulting damage were sufficient to induce the collapse of both structures.{{sfn|FEMA(403) Executive Summary|p=2}}}}\n\n===NIST report===\n{{main|The NIST World Trade Center Disaster Investigation}}\n[[Image:Remains of WTC1 and WTC2 after 9-11.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The outer shell of the South Tower (tower 2) of the WTC is still standing at right.

But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near Column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, Column 79 soon buckled \u2013 pulling the East penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the entire building above to fall downward as a single unit.  From collapse timing measurements taken from a video of the north face of the building, NIST observed that the building's exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately 8 stories (32 meters, or 105 feet), noting \"the collapse time was approximately 40 percent longer than that of free fall for the first 18 stories of descent.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610|title=NIST NCSTAR 1A: Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=November 2008|pages=44\u201346|format=PDF|access-date=July 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121024658/http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610|archive-date=January 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.<ref name=\"ncstar1-a\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the old 7 World Trade Center is remarkable because it was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires.<ref name=\"nist-questions\" /> Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the twin towers, and urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered. Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST's recommendations is that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable.<ref name=\"ncstar1-a\"/>\n\n===Other investigations===\nIn 2003, Asif Usmani, Professor of Structural Engineering at [[University of Edinburgh]], published a paper with two colleagues. They provisionally concluded the fires alone, without any damage from the airplanes, could have been enough to bring down the buildings.

At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.\n\n==Name==\nThough there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at [[Browndown Battery|Browndown (Stokes Bay)]] were used in the ITV series ''[[Bad Lads' Army]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gosport.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Gosport |work=A World History Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nThe district is currently run by the Gosport Borough Council. Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Party\n!Seats\n|-\n|Conservative\n|18\n|-\n|Liberal Democrat\n|14\n|-\n|Labour\n|2\n|}\n\n[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]].\n\n==Naval and military==\nUntil the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]]) and the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum<ref>{{cite web |title=The Diving Museum |url=http://www.divingmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> at [[Stokes Bay Lines|No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay]] which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.\n\nSeveral sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New [[Barracks]] (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS ''St George'' during the Second World War; closed 1991),<ref>{{cite web |title=New Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012070951/https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |archive-date=12 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Royal Clarence Yard|Royal Clarence]] [[Victualling Yard]] (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling]] facility, closed 1992) and [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a [[Royal Naval Hospital]] in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). [[Forton Barracks]] (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as {{HMS|St Vincent|Gosport shore establishment|6}} in 1923, closed 1969)<ref>{{cite web |title=Forton Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/fortonbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> was part-demolished and is now [[St Vincent College]].\n\nThere has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.\n\n====Graves of Turkish sailors 1850\u201351====\nIn November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, ''Mirat-\u0131 Zafer'' and ''Sirag-i Bahri Birik'', anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].\n\n====Preparations for the D Day Landings====\n[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]\nIn the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Gallery of historic buildings====\n\n=====Naval=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Naval Hospital Haslar - geograph.org.uk - 593470.jpg|Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar\nFile:St Vincent's College - geograph.org.uk - 1327446.jpg|Forton Barracks (Royal Marine Light Infantry; later [[HMS St Vincent (Gosport shore establishment)|HMS ''St Vincent'']])\nFile:Haslar Road - geograph.org.uk - 877388.jpg|[[Haslar]] Gunboat Yard and Admiralty Experimental Works (perimeter wall)\nFile:Gate to Clarence Yard - geograph.org.uk - 510.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence [[Victualling Yard]]\nFile:St Clarence Yard Gate Maintenance.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence Victualling Yards under Maintenance, 2019.\nFile:Priddy's Hard Building 2019.jpg|Offices & Storehouse, [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Military=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Fort Blockhouse 03.jpg|[[Fort Blockhouse]]\nFile:Moat around Fort Brockhurst (1) - geograph.org.uk - 1038063.jpg|[[Fort Brockhurst]], moat\nFile:Fort Grange-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704885.jpg|[[Fort Grange]]\nFile:Fort Rowner-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704877.jpg|[[Fort Rowner]], entrance\nFile:St.Georges Barracks - Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 814259.jpg|St George Barracks (Infantry)\nFile:Gosport Barracks geograph-4115962-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|St George Barracks, guardhouse\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.\n\nSouth of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.\n\nWest, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.\n\nIn the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.\n\nThere are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the [[Borough of Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.\n\nGosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.\n\nAn extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.\n\nThe trackbed of the former Gosport \u2013 Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>\n\nBeing a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.\n\nThe station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route. However, due to Government refusal to fund the scheme, it was formally abandoned in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |title=Tram scheme to be formally abandoned |publisher=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112031656/http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |archivedate=12 January 2007 }}</ref> During 2010, construction started on the same route to provide a rapid bus route between the Holbrook area of Gosport and the town of Fareham. Now completed, regular service buses between Gosport and Fareham divert onto the new route avoiding lengthy queues on the A32 and speeding up commuting time between the towns for bus passengers.\n\n==Present day==\n[[File:Forton Bridge 2019.jpg|thumb|Forton Lake Millennium Bridge 2019]]\n\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] recorded 54,854 people in Gosport of working age between the ages of 16 and 74.

A central exhibition explains Palmerston's plans to defend the key naval port. Nearby is the Gosport Aviation Heritage Museum, dedicated to the development of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The fort is owned by [[English Heritage]].\n\nGosport is also home to [[Little Woodham]], aka \"The 1642 Living History Village\".

At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.\n\n==Name==\nThough there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at [[Browndown Battery|Browndown (Stokes Bay)]] were used in the ITV series ''[[Bad Lads' Army]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gosport.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Gosport |work=A World History Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nThe district is currently run by the Gosport Borough Council. Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Party\n!Seats\n|-\n|Conservative\n|18\n|-\n|Liberal Democrat\n|14\n|-\n|Labour\n|2\n|}\n\n[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]].\n\n==Naval and military==\nUntil the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]]) and the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum<ref>{{cite web |title=The Diving Museum |url=http://www.divingmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> at [[Stokes Bay Lines|No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay]] which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.\n\nSeveral sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New [[Barracks]] (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS ''St George'' during the Second World War; closed 1991),<ref>{{cite web |title=New Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012070951/https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |archive-date=12 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Royal Clarence Yard|Royal Clarence]] [[Victualling Yard]] (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling]] facility, closed 1992) and [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a [[Royal Naval Hospital]] in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). [[Forton Barracks]] (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as {{HMS|St Vincent|Gosport shore establishment|6}} in 1923, closed 1969)<ref>{{cite web |title=Forton Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/fortonbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> was part-demolished and is now [[St Vincent College]].\n\nThere has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.\n\n====Graves of Turkish sailors 1850\u201351====\nIn November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, ''Mirat-\u0131 Zafer'' and ''Sirag-i Bahri Birik'', anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].\n\n====Preparations for the D Day Landings====\n[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]\nIn the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Gallery of historic buildings====\n\n=====Naval=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Naval Hospital Haslar - geograph.org.uk - 593470.jpg|Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar\nFile:St Vincent's College - geograph.org.uk - 1327446.jpg|Forton Barracks (Royal Marine Light Infantry; later [[HMS St Vincent (Gosport shore establishment)|HMS ''St Vincent'']])\nFile:Haslar Road - geograph.org.uk - 877388.jpg|[[Haslar]] Gunboat Yard and Admiralty Experimental Works (perimeter wall)\nFile:Gate to Clarence Yard - geograph.org.uk - 510.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence [[Victualling Yard]]\nFile:St Clarence Yard Gate Maintenance.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence Victualling Yards under Maintenance, 2019.\nFile:Priddy's Hard Building 2019.jpg|Offices & Storehouse, [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Military=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Fort Blockhouse 03.jpg|[[Fort Blockhouse]]\nFile:Moat around Fort Brockhurst (1) - geograph.org.uk - 1038063.jpg|[[Fort Brockhurst]], moat\nFile:Fort Grange-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704885.jpg|[[Fort Grange]]\nFile:Fort Rowner-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704877.jpg|[[Fort Rowner]], entrance\nFile:St.Georges Barracks - Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 814259.jpg|St George Barracks (Infantry)\nFile:Gosport Barracks geograph-4115962-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|St George Barracks, guardhouse\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.\n\nSouth of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.\n\nWest, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.\n\nIn the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.\n\nThere are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the [[Borough of Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.\n\nGosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.\n\nAn extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.\n\nThe trackbed of the former Gosport \u2013 Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>\n\nBeing a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.\n\nThe station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route. However, due to Government refusal to fund the scheme, it was formally abandoned in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |title=Tram scheme to be formally abandoned |publisher=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112031656/http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |archivedate=12 January 2007 }}</ref> During 2010, construction started on the same route to provide a rapid bus route between the Holbrook area of Gosport and the town of Fareham. Now completed, regular service buses between Gosport and Fareham divert onto the new route avoiding lengthy queues on the A32 and speeding up commuting time between the towns for bus passengers.\n\n==Present day==\n[[File:Forton Bridge 2019.jpg|thumb|Forton Lake Millennium Bridge 2019]]\n\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] recorded 54,854 people in Gosport of working age between the ages of 16 and 74.
