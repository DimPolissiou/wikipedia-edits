Kevin Garvey Jr. is the [[chief of police]]. His wife, Laurie, has joined the Guilty Remnant. Their son, Tommy, has left home to become a member for Holy Wayne, and their daughter, Jill, is [[acting out]].<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Meanwhile, grieving widow Nora Durst and her brother, Reverend Matt Jamison, struggle to deal with their respective traumas while adjusting to life post-Departure. It also follows Meg Abbott, a woman who is slowly seduced by the Mapleton faction of the Guilty Remnant, led by Patti Levin. These characters' lives intertwine and collide as they find themselves in the middle of an ongoing conflict between the Guilty Remnant and the townspeople of Mapleton.\n\nIn the second season, the location shifts from Mapleton to the fictional town of Jarden, [[Texas]], where not a single citizen was lost in the Sudden Departure. The Murphy family becomes a key focal point of the season. The patriarch, John, is the chief firefighter of the town. His wife, Erika, is a doctor. Their son, Michael, is a priest and their daughter, Evie, is a high school student with [[epilepsy]]. The Garvey family, Nora, and Matt move to Jarden at a time which coincides with an incident that leads to the disappearance of three young girls, followed by mass panic and chaos that threatens the town's safety and forces the Garvey and Murphy families to confront their inner demons.\n\nThe third and final season unfolds three years later, in 2018, starting 14 days before the seventh anniversary of the Sudden Departure. The setting of third season moves between Jarden and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], as most of the lead characters\u2014particularly the Garvey and Murphy families\u2014undergo emotional journeys that make them reflect upon their lives, their beliefs and the events they have encountered in the previous two seasons. Kevin's father, the mentally ill former chief of police of Mapleton is also a main focus in the final season as he embarks on a spiritual journey to fulfill a cryptic purpose, and eventually crosses paths with the other members of the Murphy and Garvey families.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n*[[Justin Theroux]] as Kevin Garvey, initially Mapleton's chief of police and a father of two, who is trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy in this new world.\n*[[Amy Brenneman]] as Lorelei \"Laurie\" Garvey, Kevin's wife, who left her life behind to join a mysterious cult called the Guilty Remnant.\n*[[Christopher Eccleston]] as Matt Jamison, a former reverend and current editor of a self-published tabloid that outs sinners.

These characters' lives intertwine and collide as they find themselves in the middle of an ongoing conflict between the Guilty Remnant and the townspeople of Mapleton.\n\nIn the second season, the location shifts from Mapleton to the fictional town of Jarden, [[Texas]], where not a single citizen was lost in the Sudden Departure. The Murphy family becomes a key focal point of the season. The patriarch, John, is the chief firefighter of the town. His wife, Erika, is a doctor. Their son, Michael, is a priest and their daughter, Evie, is a high school student with [[epilepsy]]. The Garvey family, Nora, and Matt move to Jarden at a time which coincides with an incident that leads to the disappearance of three young girls, followed by mass panic and chaos that threatens the town's safety and forces the Garvey and Murphy families to confront their inner demons.\n\nThe third and final season unfolds three years later, in 2018, starting 14 days before the seventh anniversary of the Sudden Departure. The setting of third season moves between Jarden and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], as most of the lead characters\u2014particularly the Garvey and Murphy families\u2014undergo emotional journeys that make them reflect upon their lives, their beliefs and the events they have encountered in the previous two seasons. Kevin's father, the mentally ill former chief of police of Mapleton is also a main focus in the final season as he embarks on a spiritual journey to fulfill a cryptic purpose, and eventually crosses paths with the other members of the Murphy and Garvey families.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n*[[Justin Theroux]] as Kevin Garvey, initially Mapleton's chief of police and a father of two, who is trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy in this new world.\n*[[Amy Brenneman]] as Lorelei \"Laurie\" Garvey, Kevin's wife, who left her life behind to join a mysterious cult called the Guilty Remnant.\n*[[Christopher Eccleston]] as Matt Jamison, a former reverend and current editor of a self-published tabloid that outs sinners.

[[Loren Bouchard]] described their ethnicity as:\n\n{{cquote|For better, for worse we gave <nowiki>[</nowiki>the main characters<nowiki>]</nowiki> the name Belcher so at least one of Bob's parents hails from some French or French-Canadian lineage. But in a perfect world, we'd have the show about a sort of Greek-Armenian-Italian-Jewish-German polyglot.<ref>http://www.tvguide.com/News/Bobs-Burgers-Kind-1027563.aspx</ref>}}\n\nThe Belcher family consists of:\n\n===Bob Belcher===\n*Voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]\n{{anchor|Bob Belcher}}'''Robert \"Bob\" Belcher, Jr.''' \u2013 Bob Belcher is the main character of the series. He is the son of Robert Belcher, Sr. (nicknamed \"Big Bob\"), the husband of Linda, and the father of Tina, Gene, and Louise. He is a third-generation restaurateur and currently the proprietor of his eponymous burger restaurant (Bob's Burgers) in a shore town. The Season 5 episode \"[[Father of the Bob]]\" begins with a flashback set 30 years prior in which a young Bob states that he is 14 years old, making him 44 until the episode The Laser-inth in which he turns 45 and then again in the episode Are You There Bob? It's Me, Birthday where he turns 46 years old. Bob is a tall, paunchy and swarthy chef, he has a receding hairline and a bushy mustache. It is also mentioned in the episode that Bob's mother had died sometime prior to the series' beginning. Bob has a tendency to entertain himself by having conversations with inanimate objects, mainly food, and then speak back as the inanimate object, usually in a high, squeaky voice. He also enjoys making puns, utilizing this talent to name his burger specials (e.g. \"If Looks Could Kale\", \"She's A Super Leek\", \"The Cauliflower's Cumin from Inside the House\", etc.). As revealed in \"[[Bob Fires the Kids]]\", his childhood has been described as \"crappy,\" as his father discouraged play. While poor with business management, and cursed with an unlucky streak, his skills at burger cooking have been shown to be excellent, to the point where he has been referred to as a \"beef artist\" by Mr. Fischoeder. His primary business rival is Jimmy Pesto who owns an Italian restaurant (Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria) across the street from Bob's Burgers. He is 6'1.\n\nAs shown in the flashback during \"[[Father of the Bob]],\" the \"Burger of the Day\" special stems from an incident in which he customized a burger by adding chives and sour cream to it, calling it \"Baby You Can Chive My Car.\" He tried to serve it to one of Big Bob's regular customers who normally ordered a [[tuna melt]], but Big Bob threw the burger away in front of the whole diner. Ten years later, still resentful over not being allowed to cook the way he wanted, Bob turned down Big Bob's offer of a partnership in the diner and opened his own restaurant.\n\nBob prides himself on giving the customer a quality meal and goes the extra mile to ensure that, choosing fresh ingredients he gets from the local farmer's markets and co-ops. His biggest accomplishment is the 'Meatsiah', a concoction that consists of a [[steak tartare]] center with a medium-well cooked burger surrounding it and a [[beef Wellington|burger Wellington]] surrounding the burger. Bob is allergic to shellfish, particularly [[lobster]], as it causes his face to swell any time he eats it. This is a problem, as the sea town the Belchers live in has an annual lobster festival (which Bob hates because it takes away from his business). Bob, along with Linda, enjoys drinking and many of the episode gags involve Bob or Linda getting drunk, usual from [[wine]]. Bob also has a tendency to take mind-altering substances such as [[crack cocaine|crack]] in \"[[Sheesh! Cab, Bob?]]\", [[absinthe]] in \"[[An Indecent Thanksgiving Proposal]]\", pain relievers in \"[[Housetrap]]\", and his pain medication in \"[[Burgerboss]]\".\n\n===Linda Belcher===\n*Voiced by [[John Roberts (actor)|John Roberts]]\n{{anchor|Linda Belcher}}'''Linda Belcher''' \u2013 Linda Belcher is Bob's happy-go-lucky and supportive wife and the mother of Tina, Gene, and Louise. Prior to her marriage to Bob, she was engaged to Hugo, who is now a local health inspector (\"[[Human Flesh (Bob's Burgers)|Human Flesh]]\"). In the fifth-season episode \"Eat, Spray, Linda\" she turned 45 years old. She has also referred to herself as a \"pre-middle-aged mother\" (\"[[Lindapendent Woman]]\").\n\nLinda's attraction to Bob, whom she often refers to as \"Bobby\", is in part due to his passion for his work, and also due to his \"[[Tom Selleck]]ian\" mustache. She remains a loyal and devoted wife despite their frequent financial problems, and never having had a honeymoon or a day off in 10 years (\"[[Weekend at Mort's]]\"). She has a preference for mustaches, and says Bob \"made himself ugly\" when he shaved it off (\"[[Sheesh! Cab, Bob?]]\"). Her passions include singing, dinner theater, porcelain baby figurines, [[Tom Selleck]], nautically themed romance novels, and prenatal yoga. She handles the accounting for the restaurant, though her bookkeeping methods are overly complicated. She is fond of alcohol and is known to say that \"Mommy doesn't get drunk; she just has fun.\"\n\nLinda is extroverted, has a thick [[New Jersey accent]], and is fond of tackling problems using unconventional methods, though her methods are frequently over-optimistic and things sometimes go awry. She often encourages her kids to engage in behavior that Bob finds annoying, and though she wants what's best for her kids, she tends to be scatter-brained. Bob has described her as a \"pushover\" because she allows people (the kids) to take advantage of her. She has a contentious relationship with Louise and often misunderstands her, even once organizing a slumber party for Louise against her will. She is a talented lyricist, as shown in \"Lil Hard Dad\". She has a tendency to spontaneously burst into song, a trait she shares with her voice actor John Roberts. Many of the songs she is known for are improvised by Roberts, including her \"Thanksgiving Song\", \"Dish-a-Dee-Doo\" (a jazzy ditty sung while washing the dishes, as seen in \"[[Mother Daughter Laser Razor]]\"), and a hair-braiding ditty that references the late [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]]. Her songs are frequently remade and set to music for the episode's end credits. She is 5'9.\n\n===Tina Belcher===\n*Voiced by [[Dan Mintz]]\n'''Tina Ruth Belcher''' is the eldest Belcher child. She generally speaks in a low, monotone voice, wears glasses, works part-time at the family restaurant, and is often the voice of reason among the Belcher children. However, it is made quite clear Tina's own characteristics rival those of her siblings. She is trying to come to grips with her entry into adulthood, and claims to have a complicated relationship with [[zombies]]. Despite seeming reticent and shy around her peers, Tina has an active social and romantic life. She has an on-again off-again relationship with Jimmy Jr., and has dated, kissed, or flirted with several other boys. She is obsessed with horses, boys (particularly Jimmy Jr.), and [[buttocks]]; in various episodes she writes in her journal about touching people's butts, which, to her, is the height of sexual contact. According to her siblings,<ref>{{cite episode |season=2 |series=Bob's Burgers |title=Bad Tina}}</ref> Tina has written erotic fanfiction of several television shows and movies and has moved on to \"erotic friend fiction\", in which she uses real-life people. She is a member of the Hormone-iums, a musical revue at Wagstaff that sings songs about puberty, and was formerly a member of the Thundergirls, a [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scout]]-like organization. Tina was aged 12 in early episodes and now 13 since the episode \"[[Sheesh! Cab, Bob?]]\". She is generally soft-spoken and reserved, often in contrast to her more strident siblings. In the show's early developmental stages, the eldest Belcher child was originally written as a boy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://longislandweekly.com/extended-q-cast-bobs-burgers/|title=Extended Q-and-A With The Cast Of 'Bob's Burgers' \u2013 Long Island Weekly|website=longislandweekly.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref> named Daniel Belcher, who was also voiced by Mintz, whose personality in the never-broadcast pilot is said to have been similar to that of Tina's. She is also shown to have difficulties with her schoolwork, although being a hard worker, as shown in \"[[Can't Buy Me Math]]\" when she is put into remedial math and \"[[Bob and Deliver]]\" when guidance counselor Mr. Frond refers to her as a \"dum-dum\". She is 4'9.\n\n===Gene Belcher{{anchor|Gene}}===\n*Voiced by [[Eugene Mirman]]\n'''Eugene \"Gene\" Belcher''' is the middle child and only son in the family, revealed to be 11 years old in season 3.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Bob's Burgers |title=[[Full Bars]] |season=3 |number=24 |date=7 October 2012}}</ref> Like Linda, he has an upbeat and enthusiastic attitude about almost everything; however, he closely resembles Bob and has inherited his lobster allergy. He often promotes the restaurant by wearing a burger costume, which he uses to run in a mascot race in the season 1 episode \"[[Torpedo (Bob's Burgers)|Torpedo]]\" and using a toy megaphone to hand out samples. In \"[[It Snakes a Village]]\", it is shown that he suffers from [[ophidiophobia]]. Gene has a variety of interests and hobbies, with his most well-known being food and music. Though he has no training, he occasionally demonstrates great skill in music and aspires to be a [[musician]]; he enjoys playing a Casio-type [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and makes fart sounds using it and creates an elaborate love duet in \"[[Topsy (Bob's Burgers)|Topsy]]\" as well as a one-man show in \"[[Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl]].\" Despite this, Gene is not without his flaws, namely a tendency to be easily distracted, which the family refers to as \"Gene-ing out\" in \"[[Best Burger]]\", but he is loving and loyal toward his family. He is also unathletic, as seen in several episodes including \"[[Synchronized Swimming (Bob's Burgers)|Synchronized Swimming]]\", when he has trouble opening a door which Tina then opens with ease and \"[[Spaghetti Western and Meatballs]]\", when he runs away from a fight in fear. He is 4'4.\n\n===Louise Belcher===\n*Voiced by [[Kristen Schaal]]\n'''Louise  Belcher''' is the youngest child of the Belcher family and is revealed to be 9 years old in season 1<ref>{{cite episode |series=Bob's Burgers |title=\"[[Torpedo (Bob's Burgers)|Torpedo]]\" |season=1 |number=13 |date=22 May 2011}}</ref> and is still 9 by Christmas five seasons later.<ref>{{cite episode |title=[[Nice-Capades]] |series=Bob's Burgers |season=6 |date=15 November 2015 |number=93 |first=Louise |last=Belcher |quote=You got to be ten to get a shark, is that it? Okay, I can wait, starter shark, love it. Next year though, I want a great white}}</ref> In spite of being the youngest, she usually dominates her two older siblings by \"wear[ing] down [their] self esteem over a period of years.\" Precociously intelligent, manipulative, and aggressive (even towards adults), she is more than willing to exploit people if there is anything to be gained, and has a history of gaslighting her siblings, especially Tina. She has an offbeat and dark sense of humor and [[lockpicking|picks locks]] as a hobby. She tends to be very loud and often shouts at the top of her lungs to get her points across. Louise always wears her signature pink hat with bunny ears, regardless of the time of day or situation; to date, viewers have never seen her uncovered head. She claims that she has \"a raging [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]] under here\" in the episode \"Synchronized Swimming\" when they try to make her take it off. In \"[[Ear-sy Rider]],\" when a high-schooler stole her hat from her, her head was off screen, then she wore a [[hoodie]] till she got it back. Louise is not immune to breaking her tough character persona, however: she called Bob \"daddy\" until she was eight, felt guilty about almost electrocuting her sister to death, still believes in [[Santa Claus]], has a disturbing crush on a boy-band member, and proclaims she does love her family in the face of death at the end of season 4. Since she was a baby, Louise has always liked Bob more than Linda, opting to spend more time with him as she finds him much more interesting; it can generally be assumed that Louise and Bob have a very strong relationship, although she is the most prone amongst her siblings to mock him. In \"[[Carpe Museum]]\", Louise accidentally reveals her plan to take over the family restaurant when Bob retires, after renaming it to \"Louise's Burgers.\" She is 4 feet tall.\n\n===Relatives of the Belcher family===\n* '''Gayle''' (voiced by [[Megan Mullally]]) \u2013 Linda's neurotic artist sister, the aunt of Tina, Gene and Louise and the sister-in-law of Bob. Bob dislikes her, much to Linda's consternation. She is desperately lonely and once fell in love with Bob because, Linda explains, she always wants what Linda has. However, men often take an interest in her, including Dr. Yap, Mort, Mr. Frond and Mr. Fischoeder. She loves cats and may suffer from some form of [[factitious disorder]], as she often fakes injuries. She is 42 years old.\n* '''Al''' (voiced by [[Sam Seder]]) \u2013 Linda's father, father-in-law of Bob, and the maternal grandfather of Tina, Gene and Louise. He rarely speaks, is hard of hearing, and wears a hearing aid. He accompanies Gloria everywhere. He has a fetish for the sound of popping balloons.\n* '''Gloria''' (voiced by [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]]) \u2013 Linda's mother, mother-in-law of Bob, and maternal grandmother of Tina, Gene and Louise. Bob doesn't like her very much and he always tries to hide from her when she and Al come over to visit. \n* '''Robert \"Big Bob\" Belcher, Sr.''' (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]] in \"Bob Fires the Kids,\" [[Bill Hader]] in \"Father of the Bob\") \u2013 Big Bob is Bob's father, the father-in-law of Linda, and the paternal grandfather of Tina, Gene, and Louise. Like his son, Big Bob is a restaurateur who owns his own business called \"Big Bob's Diner.\" In \"[[Bob Fires the Kids]]\", Bob mentions his father's diner was recently sold to a couple of ladies, who also found Bob's childhood toys hidden in the restaurant's wall, however, in \"[[Father of the Bob]]\" he is shown to still own and work at the diner. He's shown to be a tough loving father towards his own son, as shown in flashbacks. Since his pre-teens, Big Bob has been very controlling of Bob and has put him to work most of the time. He enjoys line-dancing, which he practices at the gay bar next to his diner.\n\n==Regular customers at Bob's Burgers==\nBob's Burgers features regular ups and downs in customer volume, but two loyal customers help keep the restaurant open.\n\n* '''Theodore \"Teddy\"''' (voiced by [[Larry Murphy (actor)|Larry Murphy]]) \u2013 Teddy is a talkative, kind hearted, burly [[General contractor|contractor]] who is a loyal and regular customer of Bob's Burgers. Although he is now overweight and bald, Teddy was attractive, had long blonde hair and was physically fit in his youth. He was attractive enough to be cast as a lifeguard in a 1980s exploitation movie ''The Deepening'', filmed at Wonder Wharf. However, an incident during filming took such a psychological toll on him that he resorted to overeating and gained a substantial amount of weight. Teddy is extremely fond of the Belchers and wants to be a part of the family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://longislandweekly.com/extended-q-cast-bobs-burgers/|title=Extended Q-and-A With The Cast Of 'Bob's Burgers' \u2013 Long Island Weekly|website=longislandweekly.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref> He considers Bob to be his \u201cbestie\u201d while Bob has mixed feelings. Teddy is divorced, lives alone and dates infrequently. He was once married to a woman named Denise who treated him poorly and cheated on him regularly (According to Teddy, he and Denise had a threesome with a man named Ray which consisted of him just watching Ray and Denise have sex). Denise was highly critical of Teddy and once told him his head looks like a butt which, he explained, is why he always wears a beanie. Their marriage ended when Denise left Teddy for a man who is interested in boats and owns a waterside bar called \u201cThe Schoon Hound\u201d where she works as a waitress. In the episode \u201cThanks-Hoarding\u201d, it is revealed that Teddy is a [[Compulsive hoarding|hoarder]] due to childhood trauma and develops intense body odor, which he calls \u201cpanic sweats\u201d when he becomes anxious. Long-winded at times, Teddy frequently tells needlessly detailed stories about mundane situations that usually bore the listener. While he is known to eat nearly anything that is offered to him (on one occasion, he ate a piece of a sponge {{proper name|Bob}} handed to him and, according to Linda, a receipt) Bob's hamburgers seem to be among his favorite foods. In the episode \"[[Friends with Burger-fits]]\", Teddy learns that his daily consumption of Bob's burgers and French fries has caused him to develop extremely high cholesterol. Generally mild mannered and affable, Teddy participates in on-going therapy sessions as he sometimes has angry, violent outbursts over minor incidents which he instantly regrets often causing him to burst into tears and apologize. He is 6 feet tall.\n* '''Mort''' (voiced by [[Andy Kindler]]) \u2013 Mort is a [[mortician]] and the owner of the \"It's Your Funeral\" [[funeral home]] next to the restaurant and also a regular customer of Bob's Burgers. He is a little odd and has a stereotypically morbid sense of humor. Mort is single, wears an obvious [[toupee]] and lives in a stylishly decorated apartment above his funeral home. He is good friends with Bob and Teddy and has cared for the Belcher children on occasion. He has also acted as the Belcher family driver when Tina crashed Bob's car. Mort has a generally good sense of humor about the macabre questions to which he is often subjected regarding his job. He is 5'7.\n\n==Pesto family==\n* '''Jimmy Pesto, Sr.''' (voiced by [[Jay Johnston]]) \u2013 Jimmy Pesto, Sr., real surname Poplopovich, is the antagonist of the series. He is the owner of the Italian themed restaurant across the street called \"Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria\", which is much more popular than \"Bob's Burgers\". Although of eastern European descent he goes by the Italian-sounding name of Pesto, presumably to increase the appeal of his restaurant; he and his family members are invariably referred to by the Pesto last name. He is the father of Jimmy Pesto, Jr., Andy, and Ollie, and is Bob's personal rival. Their feud often seems to border on stalking each other and occasionally descends into violence. Their families actually get along well and apart from a few isolated incidents, neither of their businesses actually endanger the other. This is in part because Bob's burgers are genuinely better than the food Jimmy serves, which is often described as being of sub par quality. In one episode where Jimmy tries to outdo Bob by serving burgers, he can be seen weeping in the middle of the night, knowing that the ruse won't last; in another episode, Jimmy competes in a burger cookoff against Bob and a celebrity chef and his \"Oregano Burger\" is poorly received. It is revealed in \"The Belchies\" that he and his children's mother are divorced; she has not yet been seen. It is revealed in \"Sheesh! Cab, Bob?\" that he is a [[diaper lover]], roleplaying under the name \"Baby Num-Nums\".\n* '''Jimmy Pesto, Jr.''' (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) \u2013 Almost always referred to as \"Jimmy Junior\", Jimmy Pesto, Jr. is the oldest son of Jimmy Pesto and speaks with a lisp. Jimmy works as the [[busboy]] at Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria. He is Tina's classmate, love interest and on-again, off-again boyfriend. Tina has a crush on him and tries her best to get his attention (slow dancing with him, forcibly sharing a pasta strand with him, etc.). He is close friends with Zeke, has a noticeable speech impediment, and loves dancing. He appears to be among the most popular students at Wagstaff Middle School, though many students turned against him in \"The Millie-Churian Candidate\" after Louise sabotaged his class president campaign. He is also prone to [[envy]]; in \"Stand By Gene\" he resents Gene for becoming friends with Zeke, and in \"Two for Tina\" he feuds with Tina's love interest Josh despite their on-and-off relationship. Jimmy has gone on dates with Tina, and Louise said they were dating, however Jimmy tends to forget this from time to time. Louise calls him \"brace face\" in \"The Belchies,\" implying he wears braces, but these are never seen, aside from in his fifth-grade school picture in \"The Millie-Churian Candidate\".\n* '''Andy and Ollie Pesto''' (voiced by [[Sarah Silverman]] and [[Laura Silverman]]) \u2013 Andy and Ollie Pesto are Jimmy Pesto, Sr.'s blonde twin sons who are the younger brothers of Jimmy Pesto, Jr. They are very childish and care for each other a lot, experiencing extreme anxiety whenever they must be separated \u2013 at one point they imply that their backpacks will miss each other when separated and are nearly run over because they were trying to carry each other across the street. They are classmates and good friends with Louise despite the rivalry between their fathers (as well as Louise's tendency to take advantage of them, such as in \"[[Art Crawl]]\"). Ollie and Andy's intense fondness for each other mimics that of Walter and Perry from Loren Bouchard's previous animated television series ''[[Home Movies (TV series)|Home Movies]]''.\n\n==Wagstaff School staff==\nThe following characters work at Wagstaff School:\n\n* '''Phillip Frond''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Mr. Frond is the \"self-certified\" school counselor of Wagstaff School. Bob describes him as a \"tall drink of annoying\", and he has stuffed dolls that he talks to as if they were real. He feels underused and underappreciated at the school, since nobody really likes him, due to his uptight and strict personality, and his advice is never sought after. He occasionally concocts harebrained schemes to advance his own career, which usually backfire spectacularly. He was born in 1971, making him 47 years old as of the episode The secret Ceramics Room of Secrets.\n* '''Coach Blevins''' (voiced by [[Larry Murphy (actor)|Larry Murphy]]) \u2013 Coach Blevins is the gym teacher who wears shatterproof goggles.

He breaks up with her at her birthday party after she interrupts one of his performances, and she retaliates by upstaging him by staging a musical based on the film ''Working Girl''. In \"The Gene & Courtney Show,\" they reconcile and appear to kindle a romance.

He owns or has a stake in just about everything on the harbor (and many things in town) including the Belcher and Pesto restaurants.

She also helps the kids look for a missing ring in \"The Ring (But Not Scary)\" and takes the whole Belcher family on a road trip to visit her ex-girlfriend in \"Just the Trip\".\n* '''Officer Julia''' (voiced by [[Jerry Minor]]) \u2013 Officer Julia is a local [[police officer]]. She acts tough with people she arrests. She appears mostly with Officer Cliffany.

Like Officer Julia, she was written out of the show after Season 1, though she has made some cameo appearances since then.\n* '''One Eyed Snakes''' \u2013 The One Eyed Snakes are a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]] who are good friends with the Belcher Family. The One Eyed Snakes was founded by Horny Dave and led by him until his death when his motorcycle collided with a semi-trailer truck.

The Belchers cause her show to be cancelled. Pam later gets a daytime court show called \"Pam's Court\" despite not being a real [[judge]]. Unlike Chuck, she does not harbor resentment toward the Belchers (likely because she doesn't have to put up with Chuck as much thanks to them). Despite initially keeping their divorce secret to the public, Pam harbors deep resentment toward Chuck. She claims that fame ruined their marriage. Pam is a binge drinker.\n* '''The Prince of Persuasia''' (voiced by [[Rob Huebel]]) \u2013 The Prince of Persuasia (also known as '''The Deuce''') is a \"love [[guru]],\" or more accurately a \"[[pick-up artist]]\" mentioned in the episode \"Dr. Yap\".

He uses a different alias/identity for each of these.\n* '''Randy Watkins''' (voiced by [[Paul F. Tompkins]]) \u2013 Randy is a jack-of-all-trades who alternately appears as a friend or enemy of the Belchers. He has held various [[Temporary work|odd-jobs]] in his appearances. In \"Sacred Cow,\" Randy worked as a [[Filmmaking|film maker]] who constantly makes Bob feel guilty about making burgers by putting a [[Cattle|cow]] next to his restaurant and convincing people not to eat there.

In \"Easy Commercial, Easy Gommercial,\" Randy helped the Belcher Family film their [[Super Bowl]] commercial.\n* '''Reggie''' (voiced by [[Eddie Pepitone]]) \u2013 The owner of Reggie's Deli. He appears to be a careless restaurateur, openly admitting to using stale bread.\n* '''Ron''' (voiced by [[Ron Lynch (comedian)|Ron Lynch]]) \u2013 Ron is Hugo's assistant, a trainee health inspector. Often quiet, he is willing to point out Hugo's malpractices when they go too far.\n* '''Samantha''' (voiced by [[Amy Sedaris]]) - Samantha appears in \"Weekend at Mort's\" where she is Mort's date after Gene, Louise, and Tina set up their date via a dating website for [[morticians]]. Mort and Samantha also go on a double date with Bob and Linda, but after Mort and Samantha bond so quickly, Linda gets jealous.\n* '''Sasho Whiteman''' (voiced by [[Jon Daly]]) \u2013 A resident of King's Head Island, appears in multiple episodes such as \"Speakeasy Rider\", where he is a member of the Kingshead Island Speeders.

He arrests Linda in \"My Fuzzy Valentine\" when she takes his gun in retaliation for his undermining her Speed Dating night. In spite of this, he has a fun-loving side and takes glee in telling his deepest, darkest secrets during speed dating; his partners happily oblige, indicating he might have a way with women. Gretchen is attracted to him. His last name is a reference to the movie Heat, where a detective played by Ted Levine bears the same last name \n* '''[[Speedo]] Guy''' (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) \u2013 A unnamed blonde man in a pink speedo and roller blades. He appears randomly in the series, often seen in background scenes in various episodes such as \"Burger Wars\"' and \"The Deepening.\"\n* '''[[Torpedo]] Jones''' (voiced by [[Robert Ben Garant]]) \u2013 Torpedo Jones is a former baseball player, and also happens to be Bob's idol. Although the final episode of season 1 (Torpedo) is based on him, his first appearance is in \"Lobsterfest\" where he can be seen in a crowd. Sadly though, Bob later realizes that his idol is not so great after all when he finds out he had been putting sticky substances on the [[baseball]].\n* '''Trev''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Trev is a [[bartender]] at Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria. He serves as Pesto's [[sycophant]], often laughing excessively at his terrible jokes.\n* '''Yuli the [[Security guard|Security Guard]]''' (voiced by [[Robert Smigel]]) \u2013 A security guard that works at Family Funtime in \"Burger Boss.\" In \"Adventures in Chinchilla-sitting,\" the security guard was seen working at the roller rink indicating that he is a [[freelancer]].

[[Loren Bouchard]] described their ethnicity as:\n\n{{cquote|For better, for worse we gave <nowiki>[</nowiki>the main characters<nowiki>]</nowiki> the name Belcher so at least one of Bob's parents hails from some French or French-Canadian lineage. But in a perfect world, we'd have the show about a sort of Greek-Armenian-Italian-Jewish-German polyglot.<ref>http://www.tvguide.com/News/Bobs-Burgers-Kind-1027563.aspx</ref>}}\n\nThe Belcher family consists of:\n\n===Bob Belcher===\n*Voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]\n{{anchor|Bob Belcher}}'''Robert \"Bob\" Belcher, Jr.''' \u2013 Bob Belcher is the main character of the series. He is the son of Robert Belcher, Sr. (nicknamed \"Big Bob\"), the husband of Linda, and the father of Tina, Gene, and Louise. He is a third-generation restaurateur and currently the proprietor of his eponymous burger restaurant (Bob's Burgers) in a shore town. The Season 5 episode \"[[Father of the Bob]]\" begins with a flashback set 30 years prior in which a young Bob states that he is 14 years old, making him 44 until the episode The Laser-inth in which he turns 45 and then again in the episode Are You There Bob? It's Me, Birthday where he turns 46 years old. Bob is a tall, paunchy and swarthy chef, he has a receding hairline and a bushy mustache. It is also mentioned in the episode that Bob's mother had died sometime prior to the series' beginning. Bob has a tendency to entertain himself by having conversations with inanimate objects, mainly food, and then speak back as the inanimate object, usually in a high, squeaky voice. He also enjoys making puns, utilizing this talent to name his burger specials (e.g. \"If Looks Could Kale\", \"She's A Super Leek\", \"The Cauliflower's Cumin from Inside the House\", etc.). As revealed in \"[[Bob Fires the Kids]]\", his childhood has been described as \"crappy,\" as his father discouraged play. While poor with business management, and cursed with an unlucky streak, his skills at burger cooking have been shown to be excellent, to the point where he has been referred to as a \"beef artist\" by Mr. Fischoeder. His primary business rival is Jimmy Pesto who owns an Italian restaurant (Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria) across the street from Bob's Burgers. He is 6'1.\n\nAs shown in the flashback during \"[[Father of the Bob]],\" the \"Burger of the Day\" special stems from an incident in which he customized a burger by adding chives and sour cream to it, calling it \"Baby You Can Chive My Car.\" He tried to serve it to one of Big Bob's regular customers who normally ordered a [[tuna melt]], but Big Bob threw the burger away in front of the whole diner. Ten years later, still resentful over not being allowed to cook the way he wanted, Bob turned down Big Bob's offer of a partnership in the diner and opened his own restaurant.\n\nBob prides himself on giving the customer a quality meal and goes the extra mile to ensure that, choosing fresh ingredients he gets from the local farmer's markets and co-ops. His biggest accomplishment is the 'Meatsiah', a concoction that consists of a [[steak tartare]] center with a medium-well cooked burger surrounding it and a [[beef Wellington|burger Wellington]] surrounding the burger. Bob is allergic to shellfish, particularly [[lobster]], as it causes his face to swell any time he eats it. This is a problem, as the sea town the Belchers live in has an annual lobster festival (which Bob hates because it takes away from his business). Bob, along with Linda, enjoys drinking and many of the episode gags involve Bob or Linda getting drunk, usual from [[wine]]. Bob also has a tendency to take mind-altering substances such as [[crack cocaine|crack]] in \"[[Sheesh! Cab, Bob?]]\", [[absinthe]] in \"[[An Indecent Thanksgiving Proposal]]\", pain relievers in \"[[Housetrap]]\", and his pain medication in \"[[Burgerboss]]\".\n\n===Linda Belcher===\n*Voiced by [[John Roberts (actor)|John Roberts]]\n{{anchor|Linda Belcher}}'''Linda Belcher''' \u2013 Linda Belcher is Bob's happy-go-lucky and supportive wife and the mother of Tina, Gene, and Louise. Prior to her marriage to Bob, she was engaged to Hugo, who is now a local health inspector (\"[[Human Flesh (Bob's Burgers)|Human Flesh]]\"). In the fifth-season episode \"Eat, Spray, Linda\" she turned 45 years old. She has also referred to herself as a \"pre-middle-aged mother\" (\"[[Lindapendent Woman]]\").\n\nLinda's attraction to Bob, whom she often refers to as \"Bobby\", is in part due to his passion for his work, and also due to his \"[[Tom Selleck]]ian\" mustache. She remains a loyal and devoted wife despite their frequent financial problems, and never having had a honeymoon or a day off in 10 years (\"[[Weekend at Mort's]]\"). She has a preference for mustaches, and says Bob \"made himself ugly\" when he shaved it off (\"[[Sheesh! Cab, Bob?]]\"). Her passions include singing, dinner theater, porcelain baby figurines, [[Tom Selleck]], nautically themed romance novels, and prenatal yoga. She handles the accounting for the restaurant, though her bookkeeping methods are overly complicated. She is fond of alcohol and is known to say that \"Mommy doesn't get drunk; she just has fun.\"\n\nLinda is extroverted, has a thick [[New Jersey accent]], and is fond of tackling problems using unconventional methods, though her methods are frequently over-optimistic and things sometimes go awry. She often encourages her kids to engage in behavior that Bob finds annoying, and though she wants what's best for her kids, she tends to be scatter-brained. Bob has described her as a \"pushover\" because she allows people (the kids) to take advantage of her. She has a contentious relationship with Louise and often misunderstands her, even once organizing a slumber party for Louise against her will. She is a talented lyricist, as shown in \"Lil Hard Dad\". She has a tendency to spontaneously burst into song, a trait she shares with her voice actor John Roberts. Many of the songs she is known for are improvised by Roberts, including her \"Thanksgiving Song\", \"Dish-a-Dee-Doo\" (a jazzy ditty sung while washing the dishes, as seen in \"[[Mother Daughter Laser Razor]]\"), and a hair-braiding ditty that references the late [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]]. Her songs are frequently remade and set to music for the episode's end credits. She is 5'9.\n\n===Tina Belcher===\n*Voiced by [[Dan Mintz]]\n'''Tina Ruth Belcher''' is the eldest Belcher child. She generally speaks in a low, monotone voice, wears glasses, works part-time at the family restaurant, and is often the voice of reason among the Belcher children. However, it is made quite clear Tina's own characteristics rival those of her siblings. She is trying to come to grips with her entry into adulthood, and claims to have a complicated relationship with [[zombies]]. Despite seeming reticent and shy around her peers, Tina has an active social and romantic life. She has an on-again off-again relationship with Jimmy Jr., and has dated, kissed, or flirted with several other boys. She is obsessed with horses, boys (particularly Jimmy Jr.), and [[buttocks]]; in various episodes she writes in her journal about touching people's butts, which, to her, is the height of sexual contact. According to her siblings,<ref>{{cite episode |season=2 |series=Bob's Burgers |title=Bad Tina}}</ref> Tina has written erotic fanfiction of several television shows and movies and has moved on to \"erotic friend fiction\", in which she uses real-life people. She is a member of the Hormone-iums, a musical revue at Wagstaff that sings songs about puberty, and was formerly a member of the Thundergirls, a [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scout]]-like organization. Tina was aged 12 in early episodes and now 13 since the episode \"[[Sheesh! Cab, Bob?]]\". She is generally soft-spoken and reserved, often in contrast to her more strident siblings. In the show's early developmental stages, the eldest Belcher child was originally written as a boy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://longislandweekly.com/extended-q-cast-bobs-burgers/|title=Extended Q-and-A With The Cast Of 'Bob's Burgers' \u2013 Long Island Weekly|website=longislandweekly.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref> named Daniel Belcher, who was also voiced by Mintz, whose personality in the never-broadcast pilot is said to have been similar to that of Tina's. She is also shown to have difficulties with her schoolwork, although being a hard worker, as shown in \"[[Can't Buy Me Math]]\" when she is put into remedial math and \"[[Bob and Deliver]]\" when guidance counselor Mr. Frond refers to her as a \"dum-dum\". She is 4'9.\n\n===Gene Belcher{{anchor|Gene}}===\n*Voiced by [[Eugene Mirman]]\n'''Eugene \"Gene\" Belcher''' is the middle child and only son in the family, revealed to be 11 years old in season 3.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Bob's Burgers |title=[[Full Bars]] |season=3 |number=24 |date=7 October 2012}}</ref> Like Linda, he has an upbeat and enthusiastic attitude about almost everything; however, he closely resembles Bob and has inherited his lobster allergy. He often promotes the restaurant by wearing a burger costume, which he uses to run in a mascot race in the season 1 episode \"[[Torpedo (Bob's Burgers)|Torpedo]]\" and using a toy megaphone to hand out samples. In \"[[It Snakes a Village]]\", it is shown that he suffers from [[ophidiophobia]]. Gene has a variety of interests and hobbies, with his most well-known being food and music. Though he has no training, he occasionally demonstrates great skill in music and aspires to be a [[musician]]; he enjoys playing a Casio-type [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and makes fart sounds using it and creates an elaborate love duet in \"[[Topsy (Bob's Burgers)|Topsy]]\" as well as a one-man show in \"[[Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl]].\" Despite this, Gene is not without his flaws, namely a tendency to be easily distracted, which the family refers to as \"Gene-ing out\" in \"[[Best Burger]]\", but he is loving and loyal toward his family. He is also unathletic, as seen in several episodes including \"[[Synchronized Swimming (Bob's Burgers)|Synchronized Swimming]]\", when he has trouble opening a door which Tina then opens with ease and \"[[Spaghetti Western and Meatballs]]\", when he runs away from a fight in fear. He is 4'4.\n\n===Louise Belcher===\n*Voiced by [[Kristen Schaal]]\n'''Louise  Belcher''' is the youngest child of the Belcher family and is revealed to be 9 years old in season 1<ref>{{cite episode |series=Bob's Burgers |title=\"[[Torpedo (Bob's Burgers)|Torpedo]]\" |season=1 |number=13 |date=22 May 2011}}</ref> and is still 9 by Christmas five seasons later.<ref>{{cite episode |title=[[Nice-Capades]] |series=Bob's Burgers |season=6 |date=15 November 2015 |number=93 |first=Louise |last=Belcher |quote=You got to be ten to get a shark, is that it? Okay, I can wait, starter shark, love it. Next year though, I want a great white}}</ref> In spite of being the youngest, she usually dominates her two older siblings by \"wear[ing] down [their] self esteem over a period of years.\" Precociously intelligent, manipulative, and aggressive (even towards adults), she is more than willing to exploit people if there is anything to be gained, and has a history of gaslighting her siblings, especially Tina. She has an offbeat and dark sense of humor and [[lockpicking|picks locks]] as a hobby. She tends to be very loud and often shouts at the top of her lungs to get her points across. Louise always wears her signature pink hat with bunny ears, regardless of the time of day or situation; to date, viewers have never seen her uncovered head. She claims that she has \"a raging [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]] under here\" in the episode \"Synchronized Swimming\" when they try to make her take it off. In \"[[Ear-sy Rider]],\" when a high-schooler stole her hat from her, her head was off screen, then she wore a [[hoodie]] till she got it back. Louise is not immune to breaking her tough character persona, however: she called Bob \"daddy\" until she was eight, felt guilty about almost electrocuting her sister to death, still believes in [[Santa Claus]], has a disturbing crush on a boy-band member, and proclaims she does love her family in the face of death at the end of season 4. Since she was a baby, Louise has always liked Bob more than Linda, opting to spend more time with him as she finds him much more interesting; it can generally be assumed that Louise and Bob have a very strong relationship, although she is the most prone amongst her siblings to mock him. In \"[[Carpe Museum]]\", Louise accidentally reveals her plan to take over the family restaurant when Bob retires, after renaming it to \"Louise's Burgers.\" She is 4 feet tall.\n\n===Relatives of the Belcher family===\n* '''Gayle''' (voiced by [[Megan Mullally]]) \u2013 Linda's neurotic artist sister, the aunt of Tina, Gene and Louise and the sister-in-law of Bob. Bob dislikes her, much to Linda's consternation. She is desperately lonely and once fell in love with Bob because, Linda explains, she always wants what Linda has. However, men often take an interest in her, including Dr. Yap, Mort, Mr. Frond and Mr. Fischoeder. She loves cats and may suffer from some form of [[factitious disorder]], as she often fakes injuries. She is 42 years old.\n* '''Al''' (voiced by [[Sam Seder]]) \u2013 Linda's father, father-in-law of Bob, and the maternal grandfather of Tina, Gene and Louise. He rarely speaks, is hard of hearing, and wears a hearing aid. He accompanies Gloria everywhere.

Bob doesn't like her very much and he always tries to hide from her when she and Al come over to visit. \n* '''Robert \"Big Bob\" Belcher, Sr.''' (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]] in \"Bob Fires the Kids,\" [[Bill Hader]] in \"Father of the Bob\") \u2013 Big Bob is Bob's father, the father-in-law of Linda, and the paternal grandfather of Tina, Gene, and Louise. Like his son, Big Bob is a restaurateur who owns his own business called \"Big Bob's Diner.\" In \"[[Bob Fires the Kids]]\", Bob mentions his father's diner was recently sold to a couple of ladies, who also found Bob's childhood toys hidden in the restaurant's wall, however, in \"[[Father of the Bob]]\" he is shown to still own and work at the diner. He's shown to be a tough loving father towards his own son, as shown in flashbacks. Since his pre-teens, Big Bob has been very controlling of Bob and has put him to work most of the time. He enjoys line-dancing, which he practices at the gay bar next to his diner.\n\n==Regular customers at Bob's Burgers==\nBob's Burgers features regular ups and downs in customer volume, but two loyal customers help keep the restaurant open.\n\n* '''Theodore \"Teddy\"''' (voiced by [[Larry Murphy (actor)|Larry Murphy]]) \u2013 Teddy is a talkative, kind hearted, burly [[General contractor|contractor]] who is a loyal and regular customer of Bob's Burgers. Although he is now overweight and bald, Teddy was attractive, had long blonde hair and was physically fit in his youth. He was attractive enough to be cast as a lifeguard in a 1980s exploitation movie ''The Deepening'', filmed at Wonder Wharf. However, an incident during filming took such a psychological toll on him that he resorted to overeating and gained a substantial amount of weight. Teddy is extremely fond of the Belchers and wants to be a part of the family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://longislandweekly.com/extended-q-cast-bobs-burgers/|title=Extended Q-and-A With The Cast Of 'Bob's Burgers' \u2013 Long Island Weekly|website=longislandweekly.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref> He considers Bob to be his \u201cbestie\u201d while Bob has mixed feelings. Teddy is divorced, lives alone and dates infrequently. He was once married to a woman named Denise who treated him poorly and cheated on him regularly (According to Teddy, he and Denise had a threesome with a man named Ray which consisted of him just watching Ray and Denise have sex). Denise was highly critical of Teddy and once told him his head looks like a butt which, he explained, is why he always wears a beanie. Their marriage ended when Denise left Teddy for a man who is interested in boats and owns a waterside bar called \u201cThe Schoon Hound\u201d where she works as a waitress. In the episode \u201cThanks-Hoarding\u201d, it is revealed that Teddy is a [[Compulsive hoarding|hoarder]] due to childhood trauma and develops intense body odor, which he calls \u201cpanic sweats\u201d when he becomes anxious. Long-winded at times, Teddy frequently tells needlessly detailed stories about mundane situations that usually bore the listener. While he is known to eat nearly anything that is offered to him (on one occasion, he ate a piece of a sponge {{proper name|Bob}} handed to him and, according to Linda, a receipt) Bob's hamburgers seem to be among his favorite foods. In the episode \"[[Friends with Burger-fits]]\", Teddy learns that his daily consumption of Bob's burgers and French fries has caused him to develop extremely high cholesterol. Generally mild mannered and affable, Teddy participates in on-going therapy sessions as he sometimes has angry, violent outbursts over minor incidents which he instantly regrets often causing him to burst into tears and apologize. He is 6 feet tall.\n* '''Mort''' (voiced by [[Andy Kindler]]) \u2013 Mort is a [[mortician]] and the owner of the \"It's Your Funeral\" [[funeral home]] next to the restaurant and also a regular customer of Bob's Burgers.

He is good friends with Bob and Teddy and has cared for the Belcher children on occasion. He has also acted as the Belcher family driver when Tina crashed Bob's car. Mort has a generally good sense of humor about the macabre questions to which he is often subjected regarding his job. He is 5'7.\n\n==Pesto family==\n* '''Jimmy Pesto, Sr.''' (voiced by [[Jay Johnston]]) \u2013 Jimmy Pesto, Sr., real surname Poplopovich, is the antagonist of the series. He is the owner of the Italian themed restaurant across the street called \"Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria\", which is much more popular than \"Bob's Burgers\". Although of eastern European descent he goes by the Italian-sounding name of Pesto, presumably to increase the appeal of his restaurant; he and his family members are invariably referred to by the Pesto last name. He is the father of Jimmy Pesto, Jr., Andy, and Ollie, and is Bob's personal rival. Their feud often seems to border on stalking each other and occasionally descends into violence. Their families actually get along well and apart from a few isolated incidents, neither of their businesses actually endanger the other. This is in part because Bob's burgers are genuinely better than the food Jimmy serves, which is often described as being of sub par quality. In one episode where Jimmy tries to outdo Bob by serving burgers, he can be seen weeping in the middle of the night, knowing that the ruse won't last; in another episode, Jimmy competes in a burger cookoff against Bob and a celebrity chef and his \"Oregano Burger\" is poorly received. It is revealed in \"The Belchies\" that he and his children's mother are divorced; she has not yet been seen. It is revealed in \"Sheesh! Cab, Bob?\" that he is a [[diaper lover]], roleplaying under the name \"Baby Num-Nums\".\n* '''Jimmy Pesto, Jr.''' (voiced by [[H.

Tina has a crush on him and tries her best to get his attention (slow dancing with him, forcibly sharing a pasta strand with him, etc.). He is close friends with Zeke, has a noticeable speech impediment, and loves dancing. He appears to be among the most popular students at Wagstaff Middle School, though many students turned against him in \"The Millie-Churian Candidate\" after Louise sabotaged his class president campaign. He is also prone to [[envy]]; in \"Stand By Gene\" he resents Gene for becoming friends with Zeke, and in \"Two for Tina\" he feuds with Tina's love interest Josh despite their on-and-off relationship. Jimmy has gone on dates with Tina, and Louise said they were dating, however Jimmy tends to forget this from time to time. Louise calls him \"brace face\" in \"The Belchies,\" implying he wears braces, but these are never seen, aside from in his fifth-grade school picture in \"The Millie-Churian Candidate\".\n* '''Andy and Ollie Pesto''' (voiced by [[Sarah Silverman]] and [[Laura Silverman]]) \u2013 Andy and Ollie Pesto are Jimmy Pesto, Sr.'s blonde twin sons who are the younger brothers of Jimmy Pesto, Jr. They are very childish and care for each other a lot, experiencing extreme anxiety whenever they must be separated \u2013 at one point they imply that their backpacks will miss each other when separated and are nearly run over because they were trying to carry each other across the street. They are classmates and good friends with Louise despite the rivalry between their fathers (as well as Louise's tendency to take advantage of them, such as in \"[[Art Crawl]]\"). Ollie and Andy's intense fondness for each other mimics that of Walter and Perry from Loren Bouchard's previous animated television series ''[[Home Movies (TV series)|Home Movies]]''.\n\n==Wagstaff School staff==\nThe following characters work at Wagstaff School:\n\n* '''Phillip Frond''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Mr. Frond is the \"self-certified\" school counselor of Wagstaff School.

Pam is a binge drinker.\n* '''The Prince of Persuasia''' (voiced by [[Rob Huebel]]) \u2013 The Prince of Persuasia (also known as '''The Deuce''') is a \"love [[guru]],\" or more accurately a \"[[pick-up artist]]\" mentioned in the episode \"Dr. Yap\". Dr. Yap himself is a graduate of the prince's three-step program known as \"The Persuasion Arts: The Ancient Art of Picking Up Women.\" Yap describes the prince to Bob saying: \"He's a [[prophet]], and for 3 payments of $900 he can be your best friend.\" In the subsequent episode \"The Unnatural\", it was revealed that he also operates several other instructional businesses, including baseball coaching, close-up magic, and inkjet printer repair. He uses a different alias/identity for each of these.\n* '''Randy Watkins''' (voiced by [[Paul F. Tompkins]]) \u2013 Randy is a jack-of-all-trades who alternately appears as a friend or enemy of the Belchers. He has held various [[Temporary work|odd-jobs]] in his appearances. In \"Sacred Cow,\" Randy worked as a [[Filmmaking|film maker]] who constantly makes Bob feel guilty about making burgers by putting a [[Cattle|cow]] next to his restaurant and convincing people not to eat there. In \"Food Truckin',\" Randy worked as a [[food truck]] [[Catering|caterer]]. In \"Easy Commercial, Easy Gommercial,\" Randy helped the Belcher Family film their [[Super Bowl]] commercial.\n* '''Reggie''' (voiced by [[Eddie Pepitone]]) \u2013 The owner of Reggie's Deli. He appears to be a careless restaurateur, openly admitting to using stale bread.\n* '''Ron''' (voiced by [[Ron Lynch (comedian)|Ron Lynch]]) \u2013 Ron is Hugo's assistant, a trainee health inspector. Often quiet, he is willing to point out Hugo's malpractices when they go too far.\n* '''Samantha''' (voiced by [[Amy Sedaris]]) - Samantha appears in \"Weekend at Mort's\" where she is Mort's date after Gene, Louise, and Tina set up their date via a dating website for [[morticians]]. Mort and Samantha also go on a double date with Bob and Linda, but after Mort and Samantha bond so quickly, Linda gets jealous.\n* '''Sasho Whiteman''' (voiced by [[Jon Daly]]) \u2013 A resident of King's Head Island, appears in multiple episodes such as \"Speakeasy Rider\", where he is a member of the Kingshead Island Speeders. Sasho also appears in \"Ain't Miss Debatin'\" where he is the top debater for his schools team. His last appearance is in \"House of 1000 Bounces\" where he helps Louise, Gene, Tina, and Regular Sized Rudy steal his little cousin Dahilia Whiteman's bounce house.\n* '''Sergeant Bosco''' (voiced by [[Gary Cole]]) \u2013 An authoritarian, no-nonsense [[Sergeant|police sergeant]]. He arrests Linda in \"My Fuzzy Valentine\" when she takes his gun in retaliation for his undermining her Speed Dating night. In spite of this, he has a fun-loving side and takes glee in telling his deepest, darkest secrets during speed dating; his partners happily oblige, indicating he might have a way with women. Gretchen is attracted to him. His last name is a reference to the movie Heat, where a detective played by Ted Levine bears the same last name \n* '''[[Speedo]] Guy''' (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) \u2013 A unnamed blonde man in a pink speedo and roller blades. He appears randomly in the series, often seen in background scenes in various episodes such as \"Burger Wars\"' and \"The Deepening.\"\n* '''[[Torpedo]] Jones''' (voiced by [[Robert Ben Garant]]) \u2013 Torpedo Jones is a former baseball player, and also happens to be Bob's idol. Although the final episode of season 1 (Torpedo) is based on him, his first appearance is in \"Lobsterfest\" where he can be seen in a crowd. Sadly though, Bob later realizes that his idol is not so great after all when he finds out he had been putting sticky substances on the [[baseball]].\n* '''Trev''' (voiced by [[David Herman]]) \u2013 Trev is a [[bartender]] at Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria. He serves as Pesto's [[sycophant]], often laughing excessively at his terrible jokes.\n* '''Yuli the [[Security guard|Security Guard]]''' (voiced by [[Robert Smigel]]) \u2013 A security guard that works at Family Funtime in \"Burger Boss.\" In \"Adventures in Chinchilla-sitting,\" the security guard was seen working at the roller rink indicating that he is a [[freelancer]]. In \"Ex Mach Tina\", he works as a nighttime security guard for Wagstaff.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Bob's Burgers}}\n\n[[Category:Bob's Burgers]]\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television animation|Bob's Burgers]]\n", "name_user": "ClaytonGrey", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bob%27s_Burgers_characters"}

The game features a single player (the \"1\") competing against 100 other contestants (known as \"the Mob\") in a trivia match. The 1 earns prize money depending on how many Mob members he or she has eliminated from the game, but loses all winnings with an incorrect answer at any point. The host of the original NBC version was [[Bob Saget]], while [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] hosted the GSN revival.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game is played with the main contestant acting as the \"1\" answering questions against 100 other people collectively known as the \"Mob\", for the top prize of $1,000,000 ($50,000 or $100,000 in the GSN revival). The contestant's goal must be the last player standing, and by eliminating all 100 members of the Mob by correctly answering general-knowledge questions in succession.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\nTo begin the game, a multiple-choice question is revealed with three options, with one being the correct answer. Once all of the Mob members have locked in their answers, the contestant is given the opportunity to answer the question. If the contestant is correct, all Mob members who answered incorrectly are eliminated from the game, bringing the \"1\" closer to winning the game. The amount of money in the contestant's bank also increases by an amount dependent on the number of mob members eliminated in that question (season 1), or at a level per every 10 mobs eliminated (season 2). If the contestant eliminates all 100 mob members, his or her winnings was augmented to the top prize . \n\nAfter every correct answer, the contestant is given the choice to either walk away with the money he or she has earned or continue playing. In conjunction with the various changes made in the sixth episode, the contestant could now only walk away after correctly answering the third question, the fifth question, and every question thereafter. If the \"1\" continues and misses the question, the game ends and the contestant won nothing, while any surviving Mob members who answered the last question correctly evenly split the \"1\"'s winnings accumulated up to that point in the game.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\n===Helps===\nTo assist the main contestant, assistance from the mob is offered in the form of \"helps\". Originally there were two helps, which could only be used in order.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\">{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|season=1|number=1|network=NBC|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Starting with the sixth episode, a third option was added, the three helps were given names, and contestants could choose any of the three at any point in the game. The helps were, in order:<ref name=\"NBC Rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Casting/Applications/1v100_rules.pdf|title=''1 vs 100'' Official Rules|work=NBC.com|publisher=NBC Universal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422021424/http://www.nbc.com/Casting/Applications/1v100_rules.pdf|archivedate=April 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\n*\"Poll The Mob\": Originally known as the first help, the contestant selects one of the three answers to get more information about. The number of Mob members who chose that answer is revealed, and the contestant chooses one of the revealed mob members to discuss his or her response.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/>\n*\"Ask The Mob\": Originally known as the second help, two Mob members are randomly selected: one who answered correctly and one who answered incorrectly. Each explains his or her decision to the contestant, which in turn eliminates the third choice from consideration.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/>\n*\"Trust The Mob\" (added in episode six): The contestant is automatically committed to the answer chosen most frequently by the Mob.<ref name=\"Season1Ep6\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=December 1, 2006|season=1|number=6}}</ref>\n\nAfter reaching a certain point in the game, contestants can be given a \"Sneak Peek\" which allows the contestant to see their next question (but not the three answers) before deciding whether or not to answer the next question. In season one, it was used when a player eliminated 90 or more members of the mob;<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/> it eventually became available once a contestant used all his or her helps in season two.<ref>{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=January 25, 2008|season=2|number=4}}</ref>\n\n===Payout structure===\nOriginally, contestants were awarded a cumulative amount of money after each individual question for each Mob member eliminated; this amount increased with each question as the game went on. For example, a contestant who eliminated eight Mob members on his or her second question would be awarded $500 per member, adding up to $4,000 to add to his or her total.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/> The payout structure was tweaked slightly prior to the third episode of the season<ref name=\"Season1Ep3\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=October 27, 2006|season=1|number=3}}</ref> and changed once again on the sixth episode in conjunction with introduction of the \"Trust the Mob\" help.<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/><ref name=\"Season1Ep6\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Question\n! colspan=\"3\"| Value\n|-\n!

The game features a single player (the \"1\") competing against 100 other contestants (known as \"the Mob\") in a trivia match. The 1 earns prize money depending on how many Mob members he or she has eliminated from the game, but loses all winnings with an incorrect answer at any point. The host of the original NBC version was [[Bob Saget]], while [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] hosted the GSN revival.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game is played with the main contestant acting as the \"1\" answering questions against 100 other people collectively known as the \"Mob\". To win the game outright, the contestant must be the last player standing, having eliminated all 100 members of the Mob by answering general-knowledge questions correctly.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\nTo begin the game, a multiple-choice question is revealed with three options: one correct and two incorrect. Once all of the Mob members have locked in their answers, the contestant is given the opportunity to answer the question. If the contestant is correct, all Mob members who answered incorrectly are eliminated from the game. The amount of money in the contestant's bank also increases by an amount dependent on the number of mob members eliminated in that question. If the contestant eliminates all 100 mob members, he or she wins $1,000,000; if at any time the contestant is incorrect, the game ends and the contestant leaves with nothing. In this case, the remaining Mob members who answered the question correctly evenly split the losing contestant's winnings accumulated up to that point in the game.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\nAfter every correct answer, the contestant is given the choice to either walk away with the money he or she has earned or continue playing. In conjunction with the various changes made in the sixth episode, the contestant could now only walk away after correctly answering the third question, the fifth question, and every question thereafter.\n\n===Helps===\nTo assist the main contestant, assistance from the mob is offered in the form of \"helps\". Originally there were two helps, which could only be used in order.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\">{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|season=1|number=1|network=NBC|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Starting with the sixth episode, a third option was added, the three helps were given names, and contestants could choose any of the three at any point in the game.<ref name=\"NBC Rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Casting/Applications/1v100_rules.pdf|title=''1 vs 100'' Official Rules|work=NBC.com|publisher=NBC Universal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422021424/http://www.nbc.com/Casting/Applications/1v100_rules.pdf|archivedate=April 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe first help was originally \"Poll The Mob\", where the contestant selects one of the three answers to get more information about. The number of Mob members who chose that answer is revealed, and the contestant chooses one of the revealed mob members to discuss his or her response.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/> \"Ask The Mob\" was originally the second help, in which two Mob members are randomly selected: one who answered correctly and one who answered incorrectly. Each explains his or her decision to the contestant, which in turn eliminates the third choice from consideration.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/> A third help, \"Trust The Mob\", was added in the series' sixth episode. For this help, the contestant is automatically committed to the most popular answer given by the Mob.<ref name=\"Season1Ep6\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=December 1, 2006|season=1|number=6}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, after reaching a certain point in the game, contestants can be given a \"Sneak Peek\" which allows the contestant to see their next question (but not the three answers) before deciding whether or not to answer the next question. In season one, it was used when a player eliminated 90 or more members of the mob;<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/> it eventually became available once a contestant used all his or her helps in season two.<ref>{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=January 25, 2008|season=2|number=4}}</ref>\n\n===Payout structure===\nOriginally, contestants were awarded a cumulative amount of money after each individual question for each Mob member eliminated; this amount increased with each question as the game went on. For example, a contestant who eliminated eight Mob members on his or her second question would be awarded $500 per member, adding up to $4,000 to add to his or her total.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/> The payout structure was tweaked slightly prior to the third episode of the season<ref name=\"Season1Ep3\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=October 27, 2006|season=1|number=3}}</ref> and changed once again on the sixth episode in conjunction with introduction of the \"Trust the Mob\" help.<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/><ref name=\"Season1Ep6\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Question\n! colspan=\"3\"| Value\n|-\n!

Founded in 1978 by a small group of engineers at the [[ESOC|European Space Operations Centre (ESOC)]] in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]], VEGA presently works with various space agencies, satellite operators and manufacturers around the world. It works with the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and ESOC in [[Germany]], [[European Space Research and Technology Centre]] (ESTEC) in [[Noordwijk]], the [[Netherlands]], [[ESA Centre for Earth Observation]] (ESRIN) in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], and [[European Space Astronomy Centre]] (ESAC) in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].\n \nSince 1978, VEGA has worked on almost every ESA mission and many other European and international programmes, including [[Mars Express]], the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)]] for the [[International Space Station|International Space Station (ISS)]], the Eumetsat Polar System, and the [[Ground Segment]] Development for ADEN. On 1 January 2011, VEGA Space Ltd became a part of [[Telespazio]], the [[Rome]]-based space systems services [[joint venture]] between the French defense electronics specialist [[Thales Group]] and the Italian aerospace group [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]], formerly known as [[Finmeccanica]]. Telespazio VEGA is an active member of [[UKspace]], the trade association for Britain's space industry, and is heavily involved with the [[International Space Innovation Centre]] based in [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus|Harwell]].\n\n==History==\nDuring 1978, VEGA was established by a small group of engineers at the [[European Space Operations Centre]] in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]].<ref name = \"milestones\"/> The company had been setup to fulfil the first operations engineering frame contract, which had been competitively bid for and awarded, to provide satellite operations support for several [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) missions.

During 1991, VEGA launched on-site operations at the [[European Space Research and Technology Centre]] (ESTEC) in the [[Netherlands]].<ref name = \"milestones\"/>\n\nDuring 1992, VEGA became a [[public limited company]] following an [[initial public offering]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref name = \"milestones\"/> In the following year, it started providing support for the ESA's Earth Observation Directorate. During 1994, VEGA was awarded its first contract for a simulation-based training system for the [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier]]; it also established a presence at the [[European Space Astronomy Centre]] (ESAC).<ref name = \"milestones\"/>\n\nDuring 1996, VEGA acquires the automation and control engineering business ''Selmers''.<ref name = \"milestones\"/> The firm's UK offices were located to [[Welwyn Garden City]], Hertfordshire, in the following year. During 2004, VEGA acquired the German space ground systems specialist ''Anite Systems GmbH''.

Throughout much of the company's existence, it was a [[nationalisation|state-owned]] entity. On 31 March 1958, the airline performed its scheduled service, flying a leased [[Vickers Viscount]] from Vienna to [[Zurich]] and [[London]]; it subsequently purchased its own Viscount fleet. On 18 February 1963, Austrian ordered its first [[jet propulsion|jet-powered]] airliner, the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]]. It subsequently introduced various models and derivatives of the [[Douglas DC-9]] jetliner; by the end of 1971, Austrian was an all-jet operator. During the 1980s, it introduced the DC-9-80, otherwise known as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]], to its fleet. Various airliners produced by [[Airbus]], [[Boeing]], [[Fokker]] and other manufacturers were introduced across the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the airline sought out new strategic alliances, as well to expand its presence in the long-haul market, launching new services to [[China]] and [[South Africa]]. In 2000, Austrian became a member of [[Star Alliance]]; a few years prior, it had also joined the [[Qualiflyer Group]]. During the 2000s, the airline expanded through the acquisitions of [[Rheintalflug]] and [[Lauda Air]] and adopted the shortened ''Austrian'' name in 2003. Throughout the 2000s, Austrian sustained several years of losses; during 2008, the airline's then-owner, the Austrian government, was advised to [[privatisation|privatise]] Austrian via its sale to a foreign company. During 2009, the Lufthansa Group purchased Austrian after receiving approval from the [[European Commission]] following an investigation into the [[Request for tender|tender]]ing process.\n\nFollowing its privatisation, both fleet expansion and cost-saving initiatives were enacted as the business was restructured; visible changes included route alterations, a new corporate design, and a revised aircraft livery. Following labour disputes over several of the cost cutting measures, all Austrian Airlines' flights were transferred on 1 July 2012 to its subsidiary, [[Tyrolean Airways]], which operated under the Austrian name. On 1 April 2015, after a new labour agreement had been reached, all flights transferred back to Austrian, and Tyrolean Airways was merged into its parent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starallianceemployees.com/no_cache/news/latest-news/news-details/article/tyrolean-to-merge-with-austrian-airlines-next-spring.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=28 |title=Tyrolean to merge with Austrian Airlines next spring |accessdate=24 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206144334/http://www.starallianceemployees.com/no_cache/news/latest-news/news-details/article/tyrolean-to-merge-with-austrian-airlines-next-spring.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=28 |archivedate=6 February 2015 }}</ref> During the late 2010s, restructuring of both its fleet and route network continued.

He participated in the newly-formed Austrian Airlines ([[German language|German]]: ''\u00d6sterreichische Luftverkehrs [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]'') with one percent, with the remaining shares going to the Austrian railway transportation company (50%) and the Junkers-Werke (49%).{{CN|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe company's initial fleet consisted of [[Junkers F 13]]s. On 14 May 1923, the first flight performed by the fledging airline was conducted between Vienna and Munich, piloted by Hans Baur.<ref name = \"official 1920s\">{{cite web |url = https://family.austrian.com/en/teens-en/experience-austrian/austrian-airlines-en/stories/it-all-started-in-the-1920s/ |title = It all started in the 1920s |publisher = family.austrian.com |accessdate = 21 April 2020}}</ref> The landing took place in Vienna [[Jedlesee]]; there occurred a conversion to float and the connecting flight to Budapest. The company was operated by Junkers Trans European Union. Its destinations included Munich, Budapest, Nuremberg, Graz, Klagenfurt, and St. Wolfgang. Some targets in Austria were served with seaplanes. The union was dissolved in September 1926.{{CN|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom 1927, the company procured new aircraft with support from the government. Dring the same year, it formed an operating partnership agreement with Deutsche Luft Hansa. Line connections were planned and operated jointly by the two companies, while a route network to Berlin, Budapest, and Milan Vienna was created. In 1932, Luft Hansa Junkers held a 49% interest in the company. After recovering from the global economic fallout from the [[Great Depression]], the firm's fleet was expanded via the addition of several Junkers Ju 52/3 m. The rapid growth of the firm throughout the 1930s led to it becoming the fourth-largest airline in Europe at one point.<ref name = \"official history\">{{cite web |url = https://www.austrianairlines.ag/AustrianAirlinesGroup/Profil/OurHistory.aspx?sc_lang=en |title = The History and Development of Austrian Airlines |publisher = Austrian Airlines |accessdate = 21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the company began planning routes to Rome, Paris, and London, using a fleet of [[Junkers Ju 90]] aircraft. Following the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany]] in March 1938, these plans were promptly abandoned. From 1 January 1939, the airline was fully under the control of Lufthansa.

During the late 1990s, Austrian Airlines developed an appetite for acquisitions; during March 1997, it bought a 35 percent stake in [[Lauda Air]] while an 85.7 percent shareholding in [[Tyrolean Airways]] was acquired in December of that year.<ref name = \"official history\"/> Two years later, the airline wholly-acquired Tyrolean Airways, making it a [[subsidiary]] During 1999, Austrian Airlines launched the ability for customers to book flights via the internet.<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nOn 26 March 2000, Austrian became a member of [[Star Alliance]].<ref name = \"official history\"/> During January 2001, it acquired a majority of the shares in Lauda Air; one months later, the airline also bought all of the shares in [[Rheintalflug]].<ref name = \"official history\"/> Austrian Airlines' operating name was shortened to ''Austrian'' in September 2003, it also renamed its three constituent carriers during this rebranding.<ref name=\"FI\"/> On 1 October 2004, the flight operations departments of Austrian and Lauda Air were merged into a single unit, leaving Lauda Air as a brand name only for charter flights.

Many long-haul destinations were cancelled, such as Sydney via Kuala Lumpur, Melbourne via Singapore, Kathmandu or Shanghai. Three remaining Fokker 70s were sent to Tyrolean Airways. It was also decided to abandon the long-haul Airbus planes, consisting of four [[Airbus A340]]s and four [[Airbus A330]]s, to standardise the fleet in favour of [[Boeing 777]]s and [[Boeing 767]]s. Austrian Airlines removed complimentary in-flight meals and alcoholic drinks on short-haul services, introducing what was called a \"Self Select Bistro Service\", except on flights from London and any flights above 100 minutes in duration.<ref>[http://www.airreview.com/Austrian/index.htm Austrian Airlines inflight meals] Airreview, 18 Jan 2012</ref> Head office moved from [[Oberlaa]] to [[Vienna Airport]] in 2007, whereas headquarters remained in Vienna.\n\nAfter recording a small profit of \u20ac3.3 million in 2007, financial guidance for 2008 had to be changed negatively several times, to a loss of \u20ac475 million expected as of the end of November.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/433795/index.do |title=AUA am Boden: 475 Millionen Verlust \u00ab |publisher=Diepresse.com |date= |accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Privatization and takeover by Lufthansa ===\nIn June 2008, [[Merrill Lynch]] advised the Austrian government to sell the airline to a foreign company.

Since joining [[Star Alliance]], a few aeroplanes have flown with Star Alliance markings. For the [[Mozart]] year in 2006, an [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] was decorated in a Mozart design, and an [[Airbus A340-300]] was coated with an ''hommage'' to the [[Vienna Philharmonic|Vienna Philharmonic orchestra]]. A [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-600]] was given a glacier look for a Tyrol advertisement. Three designs were put on aeroplanes to mark [[Euro 2008]]. An Airbus A320 was given a retro livery to mark the company's 50th anniversary. Austrian's slogan is \"the charming way to fly\".\n\n==Destinations==\n{{main|List of Austrian Airlines destinations}}\n\n===Route development===\nIn 2006, Austrian decided to retire its A330 and A340 fleet, which consisted of four Airbus A330-200s, two Airbus A340-200s, and two Airbus A340-300s. These aircraft were sold to [[TAP Air Portugal]], [[Swiss International Air Lines|SWISS]], and the French Air Force. As a result of having less long haul capacity, Austrian suspended some of its long-haul flights to East Asia. Flights to [[Shanghai]] (resumed 2016), [[Phuket]], [[Mauritius]], [[Colombo]], [[Mal\u00e9]], and [[Kathmandu]] ended in 2007.<ref name=\"AW\"/>\n\nBoth Australia routes - Melbourne via Singapore and Sydney via Kuala Lumpur - were terminated in March 2007, ending operations on the [[Kangaroo Route]].

Throughout much of the company's existence, it was a [[nationalisation|state-owned]] entity. On 31 March 1958, the airline performed its scheduled service, flying a leased [[Vickers Viscount]] from Vienna to [[Zurich]] and [[London]]; it subsequently purchased its own Viscount fleet. On 18 February 1963, Austrian ordered its first [[jet propulsion|jet-powered]] airliner, the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]]. It subsequently introduced various models and derivatives of the [[Douglas DC-9]] jetliner; by the end of 1971, Austrian was an all-jet operator. During the 1980s, it introduced the DC-9-80, otherwise known as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]], to its fleet. Various airliners produced by [[Airbus]], [[Boeing]], [[Fokker]] and other manufacturers were introduced across the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the airline sought out new strategic alliances, as well to expand its presence in the long-haul market, launching new services to [[China]] and [[South Africa]]. In 2000, Austrian became a member of [[Star Alliance]]; a few years prior, it had also joined the [[Qualiflyer Group]]. During the 2000s, the airline expanded through the acquisitions of [[Rheintalflug]] and [[Lauda Air]] and adopted the shortened ''Austrian'' name in 2003. Throughout the 2000s, Austrian sustained several years of losses; during 2008, the airline's then-owner, the Austrian government, was advised to [[privatisation|privatise]] Austrian via its sale to a foreign company. During 2009, the Lufthansa Group purchased Austrian after receiving approval from the [[European Commission]] following an investigation into the [[tender]]ing process.\n\nFollowing its privatisation, both fleet expansion and cost-saving initiatives were enacted as the business was restructured; visible changes included route alterations, a new corporate design, and a revised aircraft livery. Following labour disputes over several of the cost cutting measures, all Austrian Airlines' flights were transferred on 1 July 2012 to its subsidiary, [[Tyrolean Airways]], which operated under the Austrian name. On 1 April 2015, after a new labour agreement had been reached, all flights transferred back to Austrian, and Tyrolean Airways was merged into its parent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starallianceemployees.com/no_cache/news/latest-news/news-details/article/tyrolean-to-merge-with-austrian-airlines-next-spring.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=28 |title=Tyrolean to merge with Austrian Airlines next spring |accessdate=24 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206144334/http://www.starallianceemployees.com/no_cache/news/latest-news/news-details/article/tyrolean-to-merge-with-austrian-airlines-next-spring.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=28 |archivedate=6 February 2015 }}</ref> During the late 2010s, restructuring of both its fleet and route network continued.

He participated in the newly-formed Austrian Airlines ([[German language|German]]: ''\u00d6sterreichische Luftverkehrs [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]'') with one percent, with the remaining shares going to the Austrian railway transportation company (50%) and the Junkers-Werke (49%).{{CN|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe company's initial fleet consisted of [[Junkers F 13]]s.

Some targets in Austria were served with seaplanes. The union was dissolved in September 1926.{{CN|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom 1927, the company procured new aircraft with support from the government. Dring the same year, it formed an operating partnership agreement with Deutsche Luft Hansa. Line connections were planned and operated jointly by the two companies, while a route network to Berlin, Budapest, and Milan Vienna was created. In 1932, Luft Hansa Junkers held a 49% interest in the company. After recovering from the global economic fallout from the [[Great Depression]], the firm's fleet was expanded via the addition of several Junkers Ju 52/3 m. The rapid growth of the firm throughout the 1930s led to it becoming the fourth-largest airline in Europe at one point.<ref name = \"official history\">{{cite web |url = https://www.austrianairlines.ag/AustrianAirlinesGroup/Profil/OurHistory.aspx?sc_lang=en |title = The History and Development of Austrian Airlines |publisher = Austrian Airlines |accessdate = 21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the company began planning routes to Rome, Paris, and London, using a fleet of [[Junkers Ju 90]] aircraft. Following the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany]] in March 1938, these plans were promptly abandoned. From 1 January 1939, the airline was fully under the control of Lufthansa.

Aircraft bellies were silver from the 1950s to 1980s, the upper part was white with the Austrian Airlines arrow and the text \"Austrian Airlines\" (until 1972, again from 1995 to 2003) or \"Austrian\" (1972\u20131995, from 2003 onwards).

When created in 1960 it was redolent of the shape of a flying bird; the design became more formal in 1972. As part of a rebranding exercise in 1995, the \"Chevron\" was placed on the red-white-red tail fin. In the new corporate design, in use since 2003, the old \"Chevron\" shape was used again, this time in a more modern style and with a [[drop shadow]] placed underneath.\n\nSeveral special colour schemes have been used throughout the decades. Since joining [[Star Alliance]], a few aeroplanes have flown with Star Alliance markings. For the [[Mozart]] year in 2006, an [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] was decorated in a Mozart design, and an [[Airbus A340-300]] was coated with an ''hommage'' to the [[Vienna Philharmonic|Vienna Philharmonic orchestra]]. A [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-600]] was given a glacier look for a Tyrol advertisement. Three designs were put on aeroplanes to mark [[Euro 2008]]. An Airbus A320 was given a retro livery to mark the company's 50th anniversary. Austrian's slogan is \"the charming way to fly\".\n\n==Destinations==\n{{main|List of Austrian Airlines destinations}}\n\n===Route development===\nIn 2006, Austrian decided to retire its A330 and A340 fleet, which consisted of four Airbus A330-200s, two Airbus A340-200s, and two Airbus A340-300s. These aircraft were sold to [[TAP Air Portugal]], [[Swiss International Air Lines|SWISS]], and the French Air Force. As a result of having less long haul capacity, Austrian suspended some of its long-haul flights to East Asia.
