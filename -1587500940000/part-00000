The Patriots compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC East|East]] division. The team plays its home games at [[Gillette Stadium]] in the town of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], which is located {{convert|28|mi|km}} southwest of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium.\n\nFounded in 1959 as the '''Boston Patriots''', an original member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), the team joined the NFL in the leagues' [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|1970 merger]], then changed its name when it [[relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Foxborough in 1971. The New England Patriots played their home games at [[Foxboro Stadium]] through 2001, then moved to Gillette Stadium at the start of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]]. The Patriots' [[Jets\u2013Patriots rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[New York Jets]] is considered one of the most bitter [[National Football League rivalries|rivalries]] in the NFL.\n\nSince the arrival of head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and [[quarterback]] [[Tom Brady]] in 2000, the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history, claiming 16 AFC East titles as part of 18 consecutive winning seasons since 2001. The franchise has since set numerous notable records, including most wins in a ten-year period (126, in 2003\u20132012), an undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007, the longest [[winning streak (sports)|winning streak]] consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history (a 21-game streak from October 2003 to October 2004), and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history (11 straight division titles from 2009 to 2019). The team owns the record for most [[Super Bowl]] appearances (nine) and wins (six) by a [[Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era|head coach\u2013quarterback tandem]], most conference championships overall (11), most Super Bowl appearances overall (11). The Patriots are tied with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] for the most Super Bowl wins (six), and with the [[Denver Broncos]] for the most Super Bowl losses (five). Following the 2019 season, Tom Brady left for the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].\n\n[[File:BostonCityhall.jpg|thumbnail|Patriot fans rally in front of [[Boston City Hall]] following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] championship]]\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{details|History of the New England Patriots}}\n[[File:New England Patriots logo old.svg|left|thumb|upright|\"Pat Patriot\" logo, used through 1992]]\nOn November 16, 1959, [[Boston]] business executive [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]] was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing [[American Football League]] (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice \u2013 and the one that Sullivan selected \u2013 was the \"Boston Patriots,\" with \"[[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]\" referring to those colonists of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] who rebelled against [[British Empire|British]] control during the [[American Revolution]] and in July [[1776]] declared the [[United States of America]] an independent nation. Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' developed the \"[[Pat Patriot]]\" logo.<ref name=\"PatsHistory\">{{cite web|title=Historical Dates \u2013 Patriots History|url=http://www.patriots.com/team/history/historical-dates|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Patriots.com|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=November 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606193041/http://www.patriots.com/team/history/historical-dates|archive-date=June 6, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Patriots struggled for most of their years in the AFL, and they never had a regular home stadium. [[Nickerson Field]], [[Harvard Stadium]], [[Fenway Park]], and [[Alumni Stadium]] all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League. They played in only one [[American Football League playoffs|AFL championship game]], following the [[1963 AFL season|1963 season]], in which they lost to the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] [[1963 American Football League Championship Game|51\u201310]].

They lost in the first round both times. In 1985, they returned to the playoffs, and made it all the way to [[Super Bowl XX]], which they lost to the [[Chicago Bears]] 46\u201310. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years. During the 1990 season, the Patriots went 1\u201315. They changed ownership three times in the ensuing 14 years, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by [[Victor Kiam]] in 1988, who sold the team to [[James Orthwein]] in 1992. Though Orthwein's period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former [[New York Giants]] coach [[Bill Parcells]] in 1993. Orthwein and his marketing team also commissioned the NFL to develop a new visual identity and logo, and changed their primary colors from the traditional red, white and blue to blue and silver for the team uniforms.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/20/sports/sp-plaschke20 |first=Bill |last=Plaschke |authorlink=Bill Plaschke |title=For this dandy doodle, designer was more like a 30-minute man |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 20, 2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref> Orthwein intended to move the team to his native [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] (where it would have been renamed as the '''[[St. Louis Stallions]]'''), but instead sold the team in 1994 for $175{{nbsp}}million to [[Robert Kraft]].<ref name=\"PatsHistory\" />\n\nSince then, the Patriots have sold out every home game in both [[Foxboro Stadium]] and [[Gillette Stadium]].<ref name=\"PatsHistory\" /> By 2009, the value of the franchise had increased by over $1{{nbsp}}billion, to a ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated value of $1.361{{nbsp}}billion, third highest in the NFL only behind the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Washington Redskins]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/30/football-values-09_New-England-Patriots_307338.html|title=#3 New England Patriots|work=[[Forbes]]|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/30/football-values-09_NFL-Team-Valuations_Rank.html|title=NFL Team Valuations|work=[[Forbes]]|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2011/09/07/the-nfls-most-valuable-teams/ | first = Kurt | last = Badenhausen | work = [[Forbes]] | date = September 7, 2011 | title = The NFL's Most Valuable Teams}}</ref> {{As of|2018|July|df=US}}, the Patriots are the sixth most valuable sports franchise in the world according to ''Forbes'' magazine with a value of $3.7{{nbsp}}billion.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/07/18/full-list-the-worlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams-of-2018/#592a64c66b0e | title = Full List: The World's 50 Most Valuable Sports Teams Of 2018 | first = Kurt | last = Badenhausen | work = [[Forbes]] | date = July 18, 2018 | accessdate = August 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nContinuing on as head coach under Kraft's ownership, Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including [[Super Bowl XXXI]], which they lost to the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] by a score of 35\u201321. [[Pete Carroll]], Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 and 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season.<ref name=\"PatsHistory\" />\n\nThe Patriots hired head coach [[Bill Belichick]], who had served as defensive coordinator under Parcells including during Super Bowl XXXI, in 2000. Their new home field, [[Gillette Stadium]], opened in [[2002 NFL season|2002]] to replace the aging Foxboro Stadium. Under Belichick and quarterback [[Tom Brady]], the Patriots consistently became one of the most dominant teams in the NFL, with many describing the team as a \"[[Brady\u2013Belichick era|dynasty]]\". Within the first few seasons of the 21st century, the team won three Super Bowls in four seasons ([[Super Bowl XXXVI|2001]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2003]], and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|2004]]), over the [[St. Louis Rams]], [[Carolina Panthers]], and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], respectively.

Team owner Billy Sullivan decided to put the new logo up to a vote against Pat Patriot with the fans at the September 23 home game against the [[Los Angeles Chargers|San Diego Chargers]], using a [[sound level meter]] to judge the crowd's reaction.

The all-blue \"Color Rush\" design became the primary home uniform, complete with updated block letters and numbers, and blue/red/white socks.

In 2002, NFL teams were allowed to add a permanent third jersey to be worn in a maximum of two games. The Patriots reintroduced a red jersey as their alternate, complemented with the old-style \"Pat Patriot\" helmet.<ref name=\"NESN\"/> In 2003, the Patriots changed their alternate to a silver jersey with blue pants. For this uniform, the \"Flying Elvis\" helmet was used.<ref name=\"NESN\"/> The uniform was identical to the white jersey with any areas of white replaced by silver. These uniforms were dropped after 2007. No alternate uniform was used in 2008. In 2009, the red alternate was reintroduced, again accompanied by the \"Pat Patriot\" helmet. An alternate white road jersey was also worn with the older helmet for one game, using red numbers, in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the AFL. The red alternate gained a blue outline around the numbers in 2010 and this was worn through 2012. The Patriots retired their alternate red uniforms in 2013, thanks to a new NFL rule outlawing throwback alternate helmets, and restricting teams to one helmet shell only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1779446-pat-patriot-rip-new-nfl-safety-rule-forbids-alternate-helmets|title=New NFL Safety Rule Forbids Alternate Helmets|date=September 18, 2013|website=Bleacher Report|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the Patriots took part in the [[NFL Color Rush]] program, wearing monochrome navy uniforms on September 22 against the [[Houston Texans]].<ref name=\"PatsColorRush\">{{cite news|last=Fiske|first=Angelique|title=Check out the 2016 Patriots Color Rush Jerseys|url=https://www.patriots.com/news/check-out-the-2016-patriots-color-rush-jerseys-270621|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Patriots.com|date=September 13, 2016|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref> The uniform tops were patterned after the 1980s Pat Patriot-era uniforms, while the pants featured thick white stripes with red accents.

The Patriots compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC East|East]] division. The team plays its home games at [[Gillette Stadium]] in the town of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], which is located {{convert|28|mi|km}} southwest of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium.\n\nFounded in 1959 as the '''Boston Patriots''', an original member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), the team joined the NFL in the leagues' [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|1970 merger]], then changed its name when it [[relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Foxborough in 1971. The New England Patriots played their home games at [[Foxboro Stadium]] through 2001, then moved to Gillette Stadium at the start of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]]. The Patriots' [[Jets\u2013Patriots rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[New York Jets]] is considered one of the most bitter [[National Football League rivalries|rivalries]] in the NFL.\n\nSince the arrival of head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and [[quarterback]] [[Tom Brady]] in 2000, the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history, claiming 16 AFC East titles as part of 18 consecutive winning seasons since 2001. The franchise has since set numerous notable records, including most wins in a ten-year period (126, in 2003\u20132012), an undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007, the longest [[winning streak (sports)|winning streak]] consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history (a 21-game streak from October 2003 to October 2004), and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history (11 straight division titles from 2009 to 2019). The team owns the record for most [[Super Bowl]] appearances (nine) and wins (six) by a [[Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era|head coach\u2013quarterback tandem]], most conference championships overall (11), most Super Bowl appearances overall (11). The Patriots are tied with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] for the most Super Bowl wins (six), and with the [[Denver Broncos]] for the most Super Bowl losses (five). Following the 2019 season, Tom Brady left for the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].\n\n[[File:BostonCityhall.jpg|thumbnail|Patriot fans rally in front of [[Boston City Hall]] following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] championship]]\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{details|History of the New England Patriots}}\n[[File:New England Patriots logo old.svg|left|thumb|upright|\"Pat Patriot\" logo, used through 1992]]\nOn November 16, 1959, [[Boston]] business executive [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]] was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing [[American Football League]] (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice \u2013 and the one that Sullivan selected \u2013 was the \"Boston Patriots,\" with \"[[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]\" referring to those colonists of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] who rebelled against [[British Empire|British]] control during the [[American Revolution]] and in July [[1776]] declared the [[United States of America]] an independent nation.

Under Belichick and quarterback [[Tom Brady]], the Patriots consistently became one of the most dominant teams in the NFL, with many describing the team as a \"[[Brady\u2013Belichick era|dynasty]]\". Within the first few seasons of the 21st century, the team won three Super Bowls in four seasons ([[Super Bowl XXXVI|2001]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2003]], and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|2004]]), over the [[St. Louis Rams]], [[Carolina Panthers]], and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], respectively.

In 2002, NFL teams were allowed to add a permanent third jersey to be worn in a maximum of two games. The Patriots reintroduced a red jersey as their alternate, complemented with the old-style \"Pat Patriot\" helmet.<ref name=\"NESN\"/> In 2003, the Patriots changed their alternate to a silver jersey with blue pants. For this uniform, the \"Flying Elvis\" helmet was used.<ref name=\"NESN\"/> The uniform was identical to the white jersey with any areas of white replaced by silver. These uniforms were dropped after 2007. No alternate uniform was used in 2008. In 2009, the red alternate was reintroduced, again accompanied by the \"Pat Patriot\" helmet.

RVs can range from the utilitarian \u2013 containing only sleeping quarters and basic cooking facilities \u2013 to the luxurious, with features like air conditioning (AC), water heaters, televisions and satellite receptors, and quartz countertops, for example.\n\nRVs can either be trailers (which are towed behind motor vehicles) or self-motorized.<ref><www.autotrader.ca/newsfeatures/20160728/beginners-guide-to-buying-an-rv/></ref> Most RVs are single-deck; however, double-deck RVs also exist. To allow a more compact size while in transit, larger RVs often have expandable sides (called slide-outs) or canopies.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\n\nAn early type of caravan is the horse-drawn [[covered wagon]], which from circa 1745 played a significant part in opening up of the interior of the [[North American]] continent to white settlement. By the 1920s the RV was well established in the United States, with RV camping clubs established across the country, despite the unpaved roads and limited camping facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm-aw.de/the-brief-history-of-rvs-in-america-and-the-world/ |title=The brief history of RVs in America and the world |website=WM-AW based upon RV/MH Heritage Foundation|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> Several companies began manufacturing [[house trailers]] (called ''trailer coaches'' at the time). [[Airstream]] is one such company. Until the 1950s, the RV industry was closely connected to the [[mobile home]] industry because most mobile homes were shorter than {{convert|9|m}} long, and thus easily transportable. During the 1950s, the RV and mobile home industries became separated and RV manufacturers began building self-contained motorhomes.\n\nIn Europe, [[wagon]]s built for accommodation (rather than just transporting people or goods) were developed in [[France]] around 1810. They were used in Britain by showmen and circus performers from the 1820s. [[Romani people]] only began living in caravans ([[Vardo (gypsy wagon)|vardos]]) circa 1850.\n\nIn Canada, the earliest motorhomes were built on car or truck bodies from about 1910.\n\nIn Australia, the earliest known motorhome was built in 1929. This motorhome is recognized as being the first motorized caravan in Australia and is currently located in the [[Goolwa, South Australia|Goolwa]] museum.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:1933 car&trailer.jpg|1933 car and tourist observation trailer\nFile:Hanomag-Henschel Orion.jpg|1970s Hanomag-Henschel Orion\nFile:DodgeMotorhome.jpg|1970s [[Travco|Dodge Travco]]\nFile:1973 GMC Motorhome.jpg|1973 [[GMC Motorhome]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Recreational vehicle industry ==\nIn U.S., about 85 percent of recreational vehicles sold are manufactured in [[Indiana]],<ref name=\"ReutersTariffs\"/> and roughly two-third of that production in the [[Elkhart County]], which calls itself \"the RV Capital of the World\", population 206,000. The industry has US$32.4 billion annual economic impact in Indiana, pays US$3.1 billion in taxes to the state and supports 126,140 jobs and US$7.8 billion in wages, according to the RV Industry Association.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Burris |first1=Alexandria |title=Recession fears are rising.

In the United States and Canada, travelling south each winter to a warmer climate is referred to as [[Snowbird (people)|snowbirding]]. In Australia, the slang term for a retired person who travels in a recreational vehicle is a \"grey nomad\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Grey+nomad|title=grey nomad|website=thefreedictionary.com}}</ref>\n\nSome owners fit [[solar panel]]s to the roof of their RV.<ref>{{citation|doi=10.1186/s40669-014-0001-z|url=https://www.academia.edu/17647723|title=Distributed manufacturing with 3-D printing: A case study of recreational vehicle solar photovoltaic mounting systems|journal=Journal of Frugal Innovation|volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2015|last1=Wittbrodt|first1=Ben|last2=Laureto|first2=John|last3=Tymrak|first3=Brennan|last4=Pearce|first4=Joshua M.|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nUsage of RVs is common at rural festivals such as [[Burning Man]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RVs|url=http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/rvs.html#.VFryGR_vaRs|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Moisture and condensation ===\n[[Moisture]] is not an uncommon problem in RVs. The main sources of moisture is breathing from the users of the van, as well as [[water vapor]] from any indoor cooking or drying of clothes. [[Rain|Rain water]] entering the RV can also sometimes be a cause of moisture.\n\nToo high [[humidity]] can result in a poor [[indoor air quality|indoor climate]]. In addition, the moisture will usually condensate on the windows since these usually are the coldest surfaces inside the vehicle. The condensation then tend to drip down onto the window frame, and can drip further into the wall in case the window frame is not sufficiently [[waterproof]], potentially causing a growth of [[Mold (fungus)|mold]].\n\nMeasures for bringing the moisture in an RV down are similar to those done for apartments, which are [[aeration]] and [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] combined with heating.

RVs can range from the utilitarian \u2013 containing only sleeping quarters and basic cooking facilities \u2013 to the luxurious, with features like air conditioning (AC), water heaters, televisions and satellite receptors, and quartz countertops, for example.\n\nRVs can either be trailers (which are towed behind motor vehicles) or self-motorized.<ref><www.autotrader.ca/newsfeatures/20160728/beginners-guide-to-buying-an-rv/></ref> Most RVs are single-deck; however, double-deck RVs also exist. To allow a more compact size while in transit, larger RVs often have expandable sides (called slide-outs) or canopies.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\n\nAn early type of caravan is the horse-drawn [[covered wagon]], which from circa 1745 played a significant part in opening up of the interior of the [[North American]] continent to white settlement. By the 1920s the RV was well established in the United States, with RV camping clubs established across the country, despite the unpaved roads and limited camping facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm-aw.de/the-brief-history-of-rvs-in-america-and-the-world/ |title=The brief history of RVs in America and the world |website=WM-AW based upon RV/MH Heritage Foundation|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> Several companies began manufacturing [[house trailers]] (called ''trailer coaches'' at the time). [[Airstream]] is one such company. Until the 1950s, the RV industry was closely connected to the [[mobile home]] industry because most mobile homes were shorter than {{convert|9|m}} long, and thus easily transportable. During the 1950s, the RV and mobile home industries became separated and RV manufacturers began building self-contained motorhomes.\n\nIn Europe, [[wagon]]s built for accommodation (rather than just transporting people or goods) were developed in [[France]] around 1810. They were used in Britain by showmen and circus performers from the 1820s. [[Romani people]] only began living in caravans ([[Vardo (gypsy wagon)|vardos]]) circa 1850.\n\nIn Canada, the earliest motorhomes were built on car or truck bodies from about 1910.\n\nIn Australia, the earliest known motorhome was built in 1929. This motorhome is recognized as being the first motorized caravan in Australia and is currently located in the [[Goolwa, South Australia|Goolwa]] museum.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:1933 car&trailer.jpg|1933 car and tourist observation trailer\nFile:Hanomag-Henschel Orion.jpg|1970s Hanomag-Henschel Orion\nFile:DodgeMotorhome.jpg|1970s [[Travco|Dodge Travco]]\nFile:1973 GMC Motorhome.jpg|1973 [[GMC Motorhome]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Recreational vehicle industry ==\nIn U.S., about 85 percent of recreational vehicles sold are manufactured in [[Indiana]],<ref name=\"ReutersTariffs\"/> and roughly two-third of that production in the [[Elkhart County]], which calls itself \"the RV Capital of the World\", population 206,000. The industry has US$32.4 billion annual economic impact in Indiana, pays US$3.1 billion in taxes to the state and supports 126,140 jobs and US$7.8 billion in wages, according to the RV Industry Association.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Burris |first1=Alexandria |title=Recession fears are rising.

In the United States and Canada, travelling south each winter to a warmer climate is referred to as [[Snowbird (people)|snowbirding]]. In Australia, the slang term for a retired person who travels in a recreational vehicle is a \"grey nomad\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Grey+nomad|title=grey nomad|website=thefreedictionary.com}}</ref>\n\nSome owners fit [[solar panel]]s to the roof of their RV.<ref>{{citation|doi=10.1186/s40669-014-0001-z|url=https://www.academia.edu/17647723|title=Distributed manufacturing with 3-D printing: A case study of recreational vehicle solar photovoltaic mounting systems|journal=Journal of Frugal Innovation|volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2015|last1=Wittbrodt|first1=Ben|last2=Laureto|first2=John|last3=Tymrak|first3=Brennan|last4=Pearce|first4=Joshua M.|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nUsage of RVs is common at rural festivals such as [[Burning Man]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RVs|url=http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/rvs.html#.VFryGR_vaRs|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Moisture and condensation ===\n[[Moisture]] is not an uncommon problem in RVs. The main sources of moisture is breathing from the users of the van, as well as [[water vapor]] from any indoor cooking or drying of clothes. [[Rain|Rain water]] entering the RV can also sometimes be a cause of moisture.\n\nToo high [[humidity]] can result in a poor [[indoor air quality|indoor climate]]. In addition, the moisture will usually condensate on the windows since these usually are the coldest surfaces inside the vehicle. The condensation then tend to drip down onto the window frame, and can drip further into the wall in case the window frame is not sufficiently [[waterproof]], potentially causing a growth of [[mold]].\n\nMeasures for bringing the moisture in an RV down are similar to those done for apartments, which are [[aeration]] and [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] combined with heating. Doing cooking and drying of clothes outdoors may also help. A [[dehumidifier]] can be put into the RV in order to lower the humidity, but will not remove the underlying cause and as such can often be viewed as a temporary solution. It should be mentioned that extra [[thermal insulation]] seldom is a practical solution in RVs, since there seldom is enough space to make the insulation thick enough to prevent condensation and associatied mold growth.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of 2016, the average age of a person owning a recreational vehicle in the United States was 45, with a three-year decrease since 2015.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schultz |first=E.J. |url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/young-wanderlust-life-rv-market/312766/ |title=Young Wanderlust Gives New Life to RV Market |work=[[Advertising Age]] |date=19 March 2018 |accessdate=20 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Fulltiming]]\n* [[Housetrucker]]\n* [[List of recreational vehicle manufacturers]]\n* [[List of recreational vehicles]]\n* [[Recreational vehicle terms]]\n* [[Rest area]]\n* [[RV park]]\n* [[Vardo (Romani wagon)]]\n* [[Vandwelling]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|first=JD|last=Gallant|year=2005|title=How to Select, Inspect, and Buy an RV|publisher=RV Consumer Group|isbn=1890049-9-05}}\n* {{cite book|first=Jayne|last=Freeman|year=2005|title=The Complete RV Handbook|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-144339-5}}\n* {{cite book|first=Bill|last=Moeller|year=2007|title=The Complete Book of Boondock RVing: Camping Off the Beaten Path|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-149065-8}}\n* {{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40#v=twopage&q&f=false|title=Hitting the Trail 1935 Style|magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date=July 1935|pages=40\u201342}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Recreational vehicles}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Recreational Vehicle}}\n[[Category:Recreational vehicles| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Articles with inconsistent citation formats]]\n[[Category:Camping]]\n\n[[chy:H\u00f3xov\u00e9stavest\u00f4tse]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle"}

It is even referred to as '''Coringa''' by the [[East India Company|Britishers]] because of the proximity of its [[Port|Sea Port]] to the [[Koringa River|river Koringa]].\n\nThe [[British East India Company]] also called it '''Cocanada''' when they established the first Canadian Baptist Mission. After [[Independence of India|Independence]], it finally got the name '''Kakinada'''. Some theories suggest Kakasura's losing his eye by an arrow of [[Lord Rama]] gave the name ''Kakinada'' or that ''Kaki Nandivada'' is derived from (''Kaka'', an [[Ikshvaku]] king) who built the town.

The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river. As the principal seaport on this coast, it soon became a large shipbuilding yard of some importance. In 1802 a dock was built for repair of [[Royal Navy]] and other vessels, it boasted the only wet dock between Bombay and Calcutta. \u2018\u2019Cape Cori, or Hope Island\u2019' as it was called was known internationally for shipbuilding and repairs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sankar|first1=K.N.

The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river.

{"title_page": "Justice delayed is justice denied", "text_new": "{{short description|Legal maxim}}\n'''\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"''' is a [[legal maxim]] meaning that if [[Legal remedy|legal redress]] or [[Equitable relief|equitable relief]] is available for a party that has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s, [[Judge|judge]]s, [[arbitrator]]s, [[administrative law judge]]s, [[commission]]s or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=''Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=''Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

He used as illustrated \"a synonym of delay\" which yielded only disastrous consequences for the participants. The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun. There is another well-known suit in Chancery, not yet decided, which was commenced before the close of the last century and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in costs.}}\n\nBased on an 1853 [[Letters of Charles Dickens|letter of Dickens]],<ref>{{cite book |first1=Graham, Editor |last1=Storey |first2=Kathleen, Editor |last2=Tillotson |first3=Angus, Editor |last3=Easson |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens, VII |year=1993 |pages=128-129}}</ref> the first of these cases has been identified<ref name=\"dunstan\">{{cite journal |last1=Dunstan  |first1=William |title=The Real Jarndyce and Jarndyce |work=The Dickensian |volume=93.441 |date=Spring, 1997 |page=27}}</ref><ref name=\"katz\">{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Leslie |title=''Bleak House'' in Australian Reasons for Judgment (July 21, 2017). |url= https://ssrn.com/abstract=1315862 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1315862|via=SSRN}}</ref> as the dispute over the will of [[Charles_Day_(boot_blacking_manufacturer)|Charles Day]], a boot blacking manufacturer who died in 1836.

It was located at the corner of New Jersey Avenue NW and C Street NW.<ref name=\"Union Station Opening page 2\">''Union Station Opening: Railroad Officials Decide on Dates for Using Terminal'' \u2013 The Washington Post \u2013 October 8, 1907 \u2013 page 2</ref>\n* [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station]] (1872\u20131907): [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]] (B&P) (a subsidiary of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]), the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]], and the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] all left from this train station. It was located at the corner of B Street NW (now [[Constitution Avenue]]) and 6th Street NW.<ref name=\"Union Station Opening page 2\" />\n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line ran east on D Street NE across North Capitol, then north on Delaware Avenue NE. It divided into two lines. The Metropolitan branch continued north on 1st Street NE, turning east on New York Ave NE and continuing north through [[Eckington (Washington, D.C.)|Eckington]]. The other line turned east onto I Street NE up to 7th Street NE where it headed back north on what is today West Virginia Avenue running next to the ''Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb'' now [[Gallaudet University]].<ref>Sanborn Map of Washington DC, 1903\u20131916 Vol. 2</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nWhen the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] announced in 1901 that they had agreed to build a new union station together, the city had two reasons to celebrate.<ref name=\"Union\">{{cite book|last=Wright|first=William|title=Now Arriving Washington: Union Station and Life in the Nation's Capital|year=2006|url=http://www.washingtonunionstation.com/chapters/Chapter1.pdf|format=PDF|page=54}}</ref> The decision meant that both railroads would soon remove their trackwork and terminals from the [[National Mall]]. Though changes there appeared only gradually, the consolidation of the depots allowed the creation of the Mall as it appears today. Secondly, the plan to bring all the city's railroads under one roof promised that Washington would finally have a station both large enough to handle large crowds and impressive enough to befit the city's role as the federal capital. The station was to be designed under the guidance of [[Daniel Burnham]], a famed Chicago architect and member of the U.S. Senate Park Commission, who in September 1901 wrote to the Commission's chairman, Sen. [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]], of the proposed project: \"The station and its surroundings should be treated in a monumental manner, as they will become the vestibule of the city of Washington, and as they will be in close proximity to the Capitol itself.\"{{sfn|Moore|1921|p=160}}\n\nAfter two years of complicated and sometimes contentious negotiations, Congress passed S. 4825 (58th-1st session) entitled \"An Act to provide a union railroad station in the District of Columbia\" which was signed into law by 26th President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on February 28, 1903.<ref>{{USStatute|57|122|32|909|1903|02|28|S|4825}}\n</ref> The Act authorized the [[Washington Terminal Company]] (which was to be jointly owned by the B&O and the PRR-controlled [[Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad]]) to construct a station \"monumental in character\" that would cost at least $4 million. (The main station building's actual cost eventually exceeded $5.9 million.) Including additional outlays for new terminal grades, approaches, bridges, viaducts, coach and freight yards, tunnels, shops, support buildings and other infrastructure, the total cost to the Terminal Company for all the improvements associated with Union Station exceeded $16 million. This cost was financed by $12 million in first mortgage bonds as well as advances by the owners which were repaid by stock and cash.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEach carrier also received $1.5 million in government funding to compensate them for the costs of eliminating grade crossings in the city. The only railroad station in the nation specifically authorized by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], the building was primarily designed by William Pierce Anderson of the Chicago architectural firm of [[Daniel Burnham|D.H. Burnham & Company]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Churella|2013|pp=738; 741\u2013745}}</ref>{{sfnp|Burgess|Kennedy|1949|p=499-500}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:The Proposed New Union Railway Depot, March 1902.png|A 1902 drawing of a proposal for the design of Union Station\nFile:Union Station Washington, D.C. 1906.tif|Union Station in 1906 before its opening.

The new depot would displace residents and impact the new neighborhoods east of the tracks.\n\nOn January 10, 1902, a meeting took place between the representatives of the railroads and those of the District of Columbia to present preliminary plans regarding the construction of the ''Union Depot'' (Union Station). The plan proposed creating tunnels under the tracks for K, L and M Street NE but that [[H Street]] would be closed. The street would be closed 300&nbsp;ft on both sides of Delaware Avenue (for a total of 600&nbsp;ft). If a tunnel was to be built for H Street NE, the cost would be an extra $10,000.<ref>''Plans for Union Depot'' - January 10, 1902 - The Washington Post - page 12</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 1902, the Northeast Washington Citizens' Association meeting at the [[Northeast Temple and Market Company#The Northeast Temple|Northeast Temple]] on H Street NE was outraged over this plan. Representatives of Congress and the Railroads were present to hear the opposition of the citizens present. The president of the Association that the Pennsylvania Railroad controlled Congress and a member of the Association threatened to take them to court. The loss of a major access road to downtown for the residents of Northeast, the loss of millions of dollars of business properties and of the business it represents, the closure of a vital streetcar line used by commuters was unacceptable considering the cost of building an access across the tracks.<ref>''Against Union Depot: Northeast Citizens' Association Condemns Project'' - January 14, 1902 - The Washington Post - page 2</ref>\n\nAt the March 10, 1902 meeting, the President of the Association informed the audience that the District Commissioners was supportive of requests of the citizens of Washington, DC and that H Street would remain open with a 750&nbsp;ft tunnel running under the tracks.<ref>''Talked of Railroad Matters: Northeast Citizens' Association Discussed Proposed New Union Depot'' - The Washington Post - page 2</ref>\n\nThe Station and tracks took the place of over 100 houses in the heart of an impoverished neighborhood called \"[[Swampoodle, Washington, D.C.|Swampoodle]]\" where crime was rampant. It was the end of a community but the beginning of a new era for Washington, DC. [[Tiber Creek]], which was prone to flooding, was put in a tunnel. Delaware Avenue disappeared from the map between Massachusetts Avenue and Florida Avenue under the tracks. Only a small section remains next to the tracks between L and M Streets NE.<ref>Department of Transportation Headquarters: Environmental Impact Statement, GSA June 2000</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Baist's real estate atlas of surveys of Washington, District of Columbia - Plate 12.tif|Map showing the impact of the railway tracks\nFile:Baist's real estate atlas of surveys of Washington, District of Columbia - Plate 13.tif|Map showing the impact of Union Station\n</gallery>\n\n===Opening and operation===\nThe first B&O train to arrive with passengers was the ''Pittsburgh Express'', which did so at 6:50&nbsp;a.m. on October 27, 1907, while the first PRR train arrived three weeks later on November 17. The main building itself was completed in 1908. Of its 32 station tracks, 20 enter from the northeast and terminate at the station's headhouse. The remaining 12 tracks enter below ground level from the south via a 4,033-foot twin-tube tunnel passing under Capitol Hill and an 898-foot long subway under Massachusetts Avenue which allow through traffic direct access to the rail networks both north and south of the city.{{sfnp|Burgess|Kennedy|1949|p=500}}<ref>Abbey, Wallace W. \"Where the Nation Comes to Washington\" ; [http://centpacrr.com/Union_Station_DC_Tracks.jpg track diagram].

Provided with a separate entrance, the suite (which was first used by 27th  President [[William Howard Taft]] in 1909) was also meant to safeguard the Chief Executive during his travels in an effort to prevent a repeat of the July 1881 assassination of 20th President [[James A.

When the engineer tried to apply the [[Train brakes|trainline brakes]] two miles out of the platforms, he discovered that he only had engine brakes. A switchman on the approach to the station noticed the runaway train and telephoned a warning to the station, as the train coasted downhill into track 16. The [[GG1]] locomotive, No. 4876, hit the [[bumper block]] at about {{convert|35|mph|km/h}}, jumped onto the platform, destroyed the stationmaster's office at the end of the track, took out a newsstand, and was on its way to crashing through the wall into the Great Hall. Just then, the floor of the terminal, having never been designed to carry the weight of a locomotive, gave way, dropping the engine into the basement. The {{convert|447,000|lb|kg|sigfig=4|adj=on}} [[electric locomotive]] fell into about the center of what is now the [[food court]]. Remarkably, no one was killed, and passengers in the rear cars thought that they had only had a rough stop. An investigation revealed that an anglecock on the brakeline had been closed, probably by an [[icicle]] knocked from an overhead bridge. The accident inspired the finale of the [[1976 in film|1976 film]] ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]''.<ref>Cooper, Rachel. ''Union Station in Washington, D.C.''

[[Classical architecture|Classical]] elements included the [[Arch of Constantine]] (exterior, main fa\u00e7ade) and the great vaulted spaces of the [[Baths of Diocletian]] (interior); prominent siting at the intersection of two of [[Pierre L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]]'s avenues, with an orientation that faced the [[United States Capitol]] just five blocks away; a massive scale, including a fa\u00e7ade stretching more than {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} and a waiting room ceiling {{convert|96|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the floor; stone inscriptions and [[allegorical sculpture]] in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]]; expensive materials such as marble, [[gold leaf]], and white granite from a previously unused quarry.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the [[Attic style|Attic]] block, above the main cornice of the central block, stand six colossal statues (modeled on the [[Dacia]]n prisoners of the Arch of Constantine) created by [[Louis St. Gaudens]].

He linked the monumental end pavilions with long arcades enclosing [[loggia]]s in a long series of bays that were vaulted with the lightweight fireproof [[Guastavino tile]]s favored by American Beaux-Arts architects. The final aspect owed much to the Court of Heroes at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893 in Chicago, where Burnham had been coordinating architect.  The setting of Union Station's fa\u00e7ade at the focus of converging avenues in a park-like green setting is one of the few executed achievements of the [[City Beautiful]] movement: elite city planning that was based on the \"goosefoot\" (''patte d'oie'') of formal garden plans made by [[Baroque]] designers such as [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe station held a full range of dining rooms and other services, including [[barber]] shops and a mortuary.

A nearby [[Washington Metro]] [[Union Station (Washington Metro)|station]] connects to the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]].\n\nThe station's tracks are split between a ground level and a lower level. The ground level contains tracks 7\u201320 (tracks 1-6 no longer exist), which are served by high-level [[bay platform]]s at the door level of most trains. These tracks are used by all MARC commuter rail services, all Amtrak ''Acela Express'' trains, the Amtrak ''Capitol Limited,'' and some Amtrak ''Northeast Regional'' trains that terminate at the station. All of the tracks on this level terminate at the station and are only used by trains arriving from and departing to the north.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe lower level contains tracks 22\u201329, which are served by low-level platforms at the track level. These platforms are served by all VRE trains, all Amtrak long-distance trains that serve the station except for the ''Capitol Limited'', and some Amtrak ''Northeast Regional'' trains that continue south to Virginia. Unlike the tracks on the upper level, the lower level tracks run through under the station building and Capitol Hill via the [[First Street Tunnel|First Street tunnel]]. Electrification ends at the station, and all trains continuing south through the tunnel must have their electric engines swapped out for diesel locomotives. For example, when a southbound ''Northeast Regional'' train arrives on a lower level platform on its way to [[Newport News (Amtrak station)|Newport News, Virginia]], its [[Siemens ACS-64]] electric engine is removed and set aside. A [[GE Genesis]] diesel engine that was earlier removed from a northbound train is coupled to the front of the southbound, and it continues through the tunnel toward Virginia. The ACS-64 is readied for a ''Northeast Regional'' arriving from [[Alexandria Union Station|Alexandria]], and once coupled pulls the train toward Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York or Boston.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Metrorail station is underground beneath the western side of the building.

It was located at the corner of New Jersey Avenue NW and C Street NW.<ref name=\"Union Station Opening page 2\">''Union Station Opening: Railroad Officials Decide on Dates for Using Terminal'' \u2013 The Washington Post \u2013 October 8, 1907 \u2013 page 2</ref>\n* [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station]] (1872\u20131907): [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]] (B&P) (a subsidiary of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]), the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]], and the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] all left from this train station. It was located at the corner of B Street NW (now [[Constitution Avenue]]) and 6th Street NW.<ref name=\"Union Station Opening page 2\" />\n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line ran east on D Street NE across North Capitol, then north on Delaware Avenue NE. It divided into two lines. The Metropolitan branch continued north on 1st Street NE, turning east on New York Ave NE and continuing north through [[Eckington (Washington, D.C.)|Eckington]]. The other line turned east onto I Street NE up to 7th Street NE where it headed back north on what is today West Virginia Avenue running next to the ''Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb'' now [[Gallaudet University]].<ref>Sanborn Map of Washington DC, 1903\u20131916 Vol. 2</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nWhen the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] announced in 1901 that they had agreed to build a new union station together, the city had two reasons to celebrate.<ref name=\"Union\">{{cite book|last=Wright|first=William|title=Now Arriving Washington: Union Station and Life in the Nation's Capital|year=2006|url=http://www.washingtonunionstation.com/chapters/Chapter1.pdf|format=PDF|page=54}}</ref> The decision meant that both railroads would soon remove their trackwork and terminals from the [[National Mall]]. Though changes there appeared only gradually, the consolidation of the depots allowed the creation of the Mall as it appears today. Secondly, the plan to bring all the city's railroads under one roof promised that Washington would finally have a station both large enough to handle large crowds and impressive enough to befit the city's role as the federal capital. The station was to be designed under the guidance of [[Daniel Burnham]], a famed Chicago architect and member of the U.S. Senate Park Commission, who in September 1901 wrote to the Commission's chairman, Sen. [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]], of the proposed project: \"The station and its surroundings should be treated in a monumental manner, as they will become the vestibule of the city of Washington, and as they will be in close proximity to the Capitol itself.\"{{sfn|Moore|1921|p=160}}\n\nAfter two years of complicated and sometimes contentious negotiations, Congress passed S. 4825 (58th-1st session) entitled \"An Act to provide a union railroad station in the District of Columbia\" which was signed into law by 26th President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on February 28, 1903.<ref>{{USStatute|57|122|32|909|1903|02|28|S|4825}}\n</ref> The Act authorized the [[Washington Terminal Company]] (which was to be jointly owned by the B&O and the PRR-controlled [[Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad]]) to construct a station \"monumental in character\" that would cost at least $4 million. (The main station building's actual cost eventually exceeded $5.9 million.) Including additional outlays for new terminal grades, approaches, bridges, viaducts, coach and freight yards, tunnels, shops, support buildings and other infrastructure, the total cost to the Terminal Company for all the improvements associated with Union Station exceeded $16 million. This cost was financed by $12 million in first mortgage bonds as well as advances by the owners which were repaid by stock and cash.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEach carrier also received $1.5 million in government funding to compensate them for the costs of eliminating grade crossings in the city. The only railroad station in the nation specifically authorized by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], the building was primarily designed by William Pierce Anderson of the Chicago architectural firm of [[Daniel Burnham|D.H. Burnham & Company]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Churella|2013|pp=738; 741\u2013745}}</ref>{{sfnp|Burgess|Kennedy|1949|p=499-500}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:The Proposed New Union Railway Depot, March 1902.png|A 1902 drawing of a proposal for the design of Union Station\nFile:Union Station Washington, D.C. 1906.tif|Union Station in 1906 before its opening.

The new depot would displace residents and impact the new neighborhoods east of the tracks.\n\nOn January 10, 1902, a meeting took place between the representatives of the railroads and those of the District of Columbia to present preliminary plans regarding the construction of the ''Union Depot'' (Union Station). The plan proposed creating tunnels under the tracks for K, L and M Street NE but that [[H Street]] would be closed. The street would be closed 300&nbsp;ft on both sides of Delaware Avenue (for a total of 600&nbsp;ft). If a tunnel was to be built for H Street NE, the cost would be an extra $10,000.<ref>''Plans for Union Depot'' - January 10, 1902 - The Washington Post - page 12</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 1902, the Northeast Washington Citizens' Association meeting at the [[Northeast Temple and Market Company#The Northeast Temple|Northeast Temple]] on H Street NE was outraged over this plan. Representatives of Congress and the Railroads were present to hear the opposition of the citizens present. The president of the Association that the Pennsylvania Railroad controlled Congress and a member of the Association threatened to take them to court. The loss of a major access road to downtown for the residents of Northeast, the loss of millions of dollars of business properties and of the business it represents, the closure of a vital streetcar line used by commuters was unacceptable considering the cost of building an access across the tracks.<ref>''Against Union Depot: Northeast Citizens' Association Condemns Project'' - January 14, 1902 - The Washington Post - page 2</ref>\n\nAt the March 10, 1902 meeting, the President of the Association informed the audience that the District Commissioners was supportive of requests of the citizens of Washington, DC and that H Street would remain open with a 750&nbsp;ft tunnel running under the tracks.<ref>''Talked of Railroad Matters: Northeast Citizens' Association Discussed Proposed New Union Depot'' - The Washington Post - page 2</ref>\n\nThe Station and tracks took the place of over 100 houses in the heart of an impoverished neighborhood called \"[[Swampoodle, Washington, D.C.|Swampoodle]]\" where crime was rampant. It was the end of a community but the beginning of a new era for Washington, DC. [[Tiber Creek]], which was prone to flooding, was put in a tunnel. Delaware Avenue disappeared from the map between Massachusetts Avenue and Florida Avenue under the tracks. Only a small section remains next to the tracks between L and M Streets NE.<ref>Department of Transportation Headquarters: Environmental Impact Statement, GSA June 2000</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Baist's real estate atlas of surveys of Washington, District of Columbia - Plate 12.tif|Map showing the impact of the railway tracks\nFile:Baist's real estate atlas of surveys of Washington, District of Columbia - Plate 13.tif|Map showing the impact of Union Station\n</gallery>\n\n===Opening and operation===\nThe first B&O train to arrive with passengers was the ''Pittsburgh Express'', which did so at 6:50&nbsp;a.m. on October 27, 1907, while the first PRR train arrived three weeks later on November 17. The main building itself was completed in 1908. Of its 32 station tracks, 20 enter from the northeast and terminate at the station's headhouse. The remaining 12 tracks enter below ground level from the south via a 4,033-foot twin-tube tunnel passing under Capitol Hill and an 898-foot long subway under Massachusetts Avenue which allow through traffic direct access to the rail networks both north and south of the city.{{sfnp|Burgess|Kennedy|1949|p=500}}<ref>Abbey, Wallace W. \"Where the Nation Comes to Washington\" ; [http://centpacrr.com/Union_Station_DC_Tracks.jpg track diagram].

Provided with a separate entrance, the suite (which was first used by 27th  President [[William Howard Taft]] in 1909) was also meant to safeguard the Chief Executive during his travels in an effort to prevent a repeat of the July 1881 assassination of 20th President [[James A.

When the engineer tried to apply the [[Train brakes|trainline brakes]] two miles out of the platforms, he discovered that he only had engine brakes. A switchman on the approach to the station noticed the runaway train and telephoned a warning to the station, as the train coasted downhill into track 16. The [[GG1]] locomotive, No. 4876, hit the [[bumper block]] at about {{convert|35|mph|km/h}}, jumped onto the platform, destroyed the stationmaster's office at the end of the track, took out a newsstand, and was on its way to crashing through the wall into the Great Hall. Just then, the floor of the terminal, having never been designed to carry the weight of a locomotive, gave way, dropping the engine into the basement. The {{convert|447,000|lb|kg|sigfig=4|adj=on}} [[electric locomotive]] fell into about the center of what is now the [[food court]]. Remarkably, no one was killed, and passengers in the rear cars thought that they had only had a rough stop. An investigation revealed that an anglecock on the brakeline had been closed, probably by an [[icicle]] knocked from an overhead bridge. The accident inspired the finale of the [[1976 in film|1976 film]] ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]''.<ref>Cooper, Rachel. ''Union Station in Washington, D.C.''

The entire project was completed, save for the parking garage, and opening ceremonies were held on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] 1976.  Due to a lack of publicity and convenient parking, the [[National Visitor Center]] was never popular.

In 1988, [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] [[Elizabeth Dole]] awarded $70 million to the restoration effort. \"The Pit\" was transformed into a new basement level, and the Main Hall floor was refitted with marble.  While installing new [[HVAC]] systems, crews discovered antique items in shafts that had not been opened since the building's creation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===A new life===\nThe station reopened in its present form on September 29, 1988.<ref>[http://history.amtrak.com/archives/w.-graham-claytor-jr.-in-front-of-union-station Amtrak History and Archives].

The food court still retains the original arches under which the trains were parked as well as the track numbers on those arches. A variety of shops opened along the Concourse and Main Hall, and a new [[Amtrak]] terminal at the back behind the original Concourse. Trains no longer enter the original Concourse but the original, decorative gates were relocated to the new passenger concourse. In 1994, this new passenger concourse was renamed to honor [[W. Graham Claytor Jr.|W. Graham Claytor, Jr.]], who served as Amtrak's president from 1982 to 1993. The decorative elements of the station were also restored.

Burnham]], assisted by [[Graham, Anderson, Probst & White|Pierce Anderson]], was inspired by a number of [[architectural style]]s. [[Classical architecture|Classical]] elements included the [[Arch of Constantine]] (exterior, main fa\u00e7ade) and the great vaulted spaces of the [[Baths of Diocletian]] (interior); prominent siting at the intersection of two of [[Pierre L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]]'s avenues, with an orientation that faced the [[United States Capitol]] just five blocks away; a massive scale, including a fa\u00e7ade stretching more than {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} and a waiting room ceiling {{convert|96|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the floor; stone inscriptions and [[allegorical sculpture]] in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]]; expensive materials such as marble, [[gold leaf]], and white granite from a previously unused quarry.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the [[Attic style|Attic]] block, above the main cornice of the central block, stand six colossal statues (modeled on the [[Dacia]]n prisoners of the Arch of Constantine) created by [[Louis St. Gaudens]]. These are entitled \"[[The Progress of Railroading]]\" and their iconography expresses the confident enthusiasm of the [[American Renaissance]] movement:\n* [[Prometheus]] (for Fire)\n* [[Thales]] (for Electricity)\n* [[Themis]] (for Freedom and Justice)\n* [[Apollo]] (for Imagination and Inspiration)\n* [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] (for Agriculture) \n* [[Archimedes]] (for Mechanics)\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:One of six allegorical statues by sculptor Louis St. Gaudens on the fa\u00e7ade of Union Station, Washington, D.C LCCN2011634754.tif|Prometheus (Fire)\nFile:One of six allegorical statues by sculptor Louis St. Gaudens that stand above the front fa\u00e7ade of Union Station, Washington, D.C LCCN2011634255.tif|Thales (Electricity)\nFile:Saint Gaudens' \"Agriculture,\" at Union Station, Washington, D.C LCCN2011631002.tif|Themis (Freedom and Justice)\nFile:Union Station statue, Ceres, Washington, D.C LCCN2010630343.tif|Ceres (Agricul-ture)\nFile:Louis St. Gaudens's allegorical Archimedes statue, representing the gift of mechanics, one of six on the parapet above the entrance to Washington D.C.'s Union Station LCCN2011634506.tif|Archimedes (Mechanics)\n</gallery>\n\nThe substitution of Agriculture for Commerce in a railroad station iconography vividly conveys the power of a specifically American [[lobbying]] bloc.\n\nSt. Gaudens also created the 26 [[centurion]]s for the station's main hall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nBurnham drew upon a tradition, launched with the 1837 [[Euston railway station]] in London, of treating the entrance to a major terminal as a [[triumphal arch]]. He linked the monumental end pavilions with long arcades enclosing [[loggia]]s in a long series of bays that were vaulted with the lightweight fireproof [[Guastavino tile]]s favored by American Beaux-Arts architects. The final aspect owed much to the Court of Heroes at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893 in Chicago, where Burnham had been coordinating architect.  The setting of Union Station's fa\u00e7ade at the focus of converging avenues in a park-like green setting is one of the few executed achievements of the [[City Beautiful]] movement: elite city planning that was based on the \"goosefoot\" (''patte d'oie'') of formal garden plans made by [[Baroque]] designers such as [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe station held a full range of dining rooms and other services, including [[barber]] shops and a mortuary.

From Union Station, Amtrak also operates long-distance service to the Southeast and Midwest, including many intermediate stops to destinations such as [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]], [[Charlotte station (Amtrak)|Charlotte]], [[New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal|New Orleans]], and [[Miami station (Amtrak)|Miami]].  In fiscal 2011, an average of more than 13,000 passengers boarded or got off Amtrak trains each day.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/998/601/Amtrak-National-Fact-Sheet-FY2015,0.pdf|title=Amtrak National Fact Sheet: FY2015|last=|first=|date=July 2016|website=|publisher=Amtrak|format=PDF|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref> It is also Amtrak's busiest train station that can handle the railroad's [[Superliner (railcar)|Superliner]] railcars.\n\nThe station is also the terminus for the [[MARC Train|MARC]] and [[Virginia Railway Express|VRE]] [[commuter train|commuter railways]], linking Washington to [[Maryland]] and [[West Virginia]] (MARC) and [[Northern Virginia]] (VRE). A nearby [[Washington Metro]] [[Union Station (Washington Metro)|station]] connects to the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]].\n\nThe station's tracks are split between a ground level and a lower level. The ground level contains tracks 7\u201320 (tracks 1-6 no longer exist), which are served by high-level [[bay platform]]s at the door level of most trains. These tracks are used by all MARC commuter rail services, all Amtrak ''Acela Express'' trains, the Amtrak ''Capitol Limited,'' and some Amtrak ''Northeast Regional'' trains that terminate at the station. All of the tracks on this level terminate at the station and are only used by trains arriving from and departing to the north.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe lower level contains tracks 22\u201329, which are served by low-level platforms at the track level. These platforms are served by all VRE trains, all Amtrak long-distance trains that serve the station except for the ''Capitol Limited'', and some Amtrak ''Northeast Regional'' trains that continue south to Virginia. Unlike the tracks on the upper level, the lower level tracks run through under the station building and Capitol Hill via the [[First Street Tunnel|First Street tunnel]]. Electrification ends at the station, and all trains continuing south through the tunnel must have their electric engines swapped out for diesel locomotives. For example, when a southbound ''Northeast Regional'' train arrives on a lower level platform on its way to [[Newport News (Amtrak station)|Newport News, Virginia]], its [[Siemens ACS-64]] electric engine is removed and set aside. A [[GE Genesis]] diesel engine that was earlier removed from a northbound train is coupled to the front of the southbound, and it continues through the tunnel toward Virginia. The ACS-64 is readied for a ''Northeast Regional'' arriving from [[Alexandria Union Station|Alexandria]], and once coupled pulls the train toward Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York or Boston.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Metrorail station is underground beneath the western side of the building. Entrances are located inside Union Station with direct access from the high-level MARC and Amtrak platforms, from the east side of First Street NE, or from just outside the station at Massachusetts Avenue NE, providing access to the main concourse.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/upload/evacuation/06.024.pdf |title=Station Vicinity Map: Union Station |website=WMATA |access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 1, 2011, [[John Porcari]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Transportation]], announced that Union Station would begin serving intercity buses operated by [[Greyhound Lines]], [[BoltBus]], [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]], and Washington Deluxe later that year from a new bus facility in the station's parking garage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Robert|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/union-station-to-become-intercity-bus-center/2011/07/29/gIQAFcPwjI_story.html|title=Union Station to become intercity bus center|work=PostLocal|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2011-07-30|accessdate=2011-08-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017060731/http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/union-station-to-become-intercity-bus-center/2011/07/29/gIQAFcPwjI_story.html|archivedate=2011-10-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>  By November 15, 2011,  BoltBus, Megabus, Tripper Bus, and Washington Deluxe were operating from the new facility.<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/officials-to-inaugurate-revamped-bus-departure-zone-at-washingtons-union-station/2011/11/15/gIQAZJwiNN_story.html|title=Officials to inaugurate revamped bus departure zone at Washington's Union Station|work=PostLocal|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2011-11-15|accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref> On September 26, 2012, Greyhound and [[Peter Pan Bus Lines]] relocated all of their Washington, D.C., operations to the facility.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CQKdnYsI?url=http://www.greyhound.com/en/newsroom/viewrelease.aspx?id=496|archivedate=2012-11-24|url=http://www.greyhound.com/en/newsroom/viewrelease.aspx?id=496&year=2012|title=Greyhound and Peter Pan Bus Lines Relocate all Washington, D.C., Service to Union Station|work=News Release|location=[[Dallas]], Texas|publisher=[[Greyhound Lines]]|date=2012-09-19|accessdate=2012-11-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> Buses of the [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]-Union Station route of the [[DC Circulator]] system stop within the facility every ten minutes during operating hours.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108162818/http://www.dccirculator.com/Home/BusRoutesandSchedules/GeorgetownUnionStation.aspx|archivedate=2012-11-08|url=http://www.dccirculator.com/home/busroutesandschedules/georgetownunionstation.aspx|title=Georgetown-Union Station|work=Bus Routes and Schedules|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[DC Circulator]]|accessdate=2012-11-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> As of 2017, [[OurBus]] now services Union Station, providing routes to Maryland, New Jersey, and New York.\n\nThe [[DC Streetcar]]'s [[H Street/Benning Road Line]] serves the station from a stop on the H Street Bridge (a.k.a. the \"Hopscotch Bridge\") directly north of the station.
