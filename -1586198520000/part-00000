In October 2012 Swedish television network [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] aired the first episode of the third season of ''[[S\u00e5 mycket b\u00e4ttre]]'' featuring Darin, a reality TV show in which each artist attempts to do their own version of another artists well-known songs, with each person getting an episode featuring all of their songs being performed by the other musicians. Darin performed six songs in the show: \"Stockholm\", \"En Apa Som Liknar Dig\", \"I Can't Get You Off My Mind\", \"Astrologen\", \"Magdalena\" and \"Seven Days a Week\". He broke the Swedish singles chart record and had 6 top 10 songs on [[iTunes]] at the same time.

On 21 November 2012 [[Sony Music]] Sweden released a collection of Darin's songs from his four albums released by Sony. ''[[Det b\u00e4sta av]]'' ''(The Best Of)'' features 16 tracks, some singles and some albums tracks.\n\n===2013: ''Exit''===\n[[Image:Cirkus2013.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Darin on tour in Stockholm in 2013.]]\nIn early 2013, Darin released his new album ''[[Exit (Darin album)|Exit]]'' which went straight to number one on the Swedish album chart and became his fifth number one album. Darin spent one to two months in the US working with worldwide known producers and songwriters such as [[Jim Beanz]], [[The Jackie Boyz]], [[Victoria Horn|Victoria \"Lady V\" Horn]] to make the album. ''Exit''  included the songs \"Nobody Knows\", \"Playing With Fire\", \"Check You Out\" and \"Before I Pass Out\", with the latter containing features from rapper [[Lil Jon]].\n\nIn 2013 a new single entitled \"[[So Yours]]\" was released in Europe due to a performance as the interval act during the second semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] in [[Malm\u00f6]] that was seen by approximately 108&nbsp;million viewers worldwide. The theme of the interval act was \"Swedish Pop Voices\". In March 2013 Darin announced via Twitter that he was in Los Angeles to record a music video for the international single.\n\nDuring the fall, Darin travelled to the Philippines to film the documentary ''En resa f\u00f6r livet'' together with SOS Children's Villages and three other artists, [[Eagle-Eye Cherry]], [[Sophie Zelmani]] and [[Uno Svenningsson]] to bring attention to the poverty in the country and also try to gain and collect as many sponsors as possible for the children in the children's villages. Darin and Eagle-Eye Cherry also wrote and sang the lead song \"Dream Away\" for the documentary that was aired on [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]].

He got inspired by recording a tribute song to [[Ted G\u00e4rdestad]] in the Atlantis-studio in Stockholm, where [[ABBA]] also recorded most of their albums and he wanted to record the same way they did.\nIn March 2015 Darin released his first single \"[[Ta mig tillbaka]]\" from his (then) upcoming Swedish album ''[[Fj\u00e4rilar i magen|Fj\u00e4rilar i Magen]]''. It was the first time he recorded a song with only acoustic instruments, which gave the production a different sound to what he had before. The lyrics was an autobiographical story about his childhood and growing up in the [[1990s]]. The single went 4x platinum and was the most streamed song in Swedish that year.\n\nThe album ''[[Fj\u00e4rilar i magen|Fj\u00e4rilar i Magen]]'' was released in September 2015 by Darin's own record company Dex Music and became his sixth number one album in Sweden. In 2015, Darin was signed by [[Sony Music]] for all the Asian countries, including the Middle East for his previous English album ''Exit''. \n\n=== 2017\u2013present: ''Tvillingen and new singles'' ===\nDarin continued to make music in Swedish and released his eighth studio album ''[[Tvillingen]]'', on 24 November 2017.

He got inspired by recording a tribute song to [[Ted G\u00e4rdestad]] in the Atlantis-studio in Stockholm, where [[ABBA]] also recorded most of their albums and he wanted to record the same way they did.\nIn March 2015 Darin released his first single \"[[Ta mig tillbaka]]\" from his (then) upcoming Swedish album ''[[Fj\u00e4rilar i magen|Fj\u00e4rilar i Magen]]''. It was the first time he recorded a song with only acoustic instruments, which gave the production a different sound to what he had before. The lyrics was an autobiographical story about his childhood and growing up in the [[1990s]]. The single went 4x platinum and was the most streamed song in Swedish that year.\n\nThe album ''[[Fj\u00e4rilar i magen|Fj\u00e4rilar i Magen]]'' was released in September 2015 by Darin's own record company Dex Music and became his sixth number one album in Sweden.

Kennelly began a string of successful visits to [[Teahupoo, Tahiti]] in 1998 when she won the Gotcha Black Pearl Women's Pro.

In addition to her win in Teahupoo at the Billabong Pro, she garnered victories at the Roxy Pro in Fiji and the Turtle Bay Pro in Hawaii as well as a 3rd-place finish at the Maui Billabong Pro. Her various top finishes won Kennelly the year's coveted [[Triple Crown of Surfing]]. Kennelly maintained a spot in the top 10 of the ASP rankings through 2007, with numerous top finishes and groundbreaking female performances.
