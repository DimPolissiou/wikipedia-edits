The two clubs in Sydney and London were among the biggest Dance music clubs in their respected countries.\n\n== Club openings ==\nThe Sydney Club was the first to open on 13 November 1998 by Antonio Zambarelli, Paul Collings, George Swanson and Ron McCulloch (Big Beat Australia) in Cockle Bay, Darling Harbour.<ref name=\"auto\"/> It was purposely built as a nightclub, and holding 2000 people, it is one of Australia\u2019s biggest regular house music venues. The interior was designed by Ron McCulloch, and it features a number of different spaces. The main dancefloor holds 700 people.<ref name=\"auto\"/> It cost {{A$|10 million}} to build.<ref>McDougall, Liam \"No place like Home for King of Clubs\". 1 April 2001 Scotland on Sunday p 8</ref>\n\nThe London Home Club (see full article [[Home (nightclub)]]) was a \"superclub\" in the middle of London on Leicester Square, opened in 1998. It had eight levels, and cost \u00a38.5m to build, after hard negotiations over building at the Leicester Square site.<ref>{{cite news | last=Askew | first=Kate | title=Busted Scot Buys Home | newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald | date=28 August 2001 | page=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=McDougall | first=Liam | title=No place like Home for King of Clubs | date=1 April 2001 | work=Scotland on Sunday | page=8}}</ref>\n\n== Closure of London Home and the collapse of Big Beat ==\nHowever, Home in London was shut by police only 2 years after its opening. It had its licence revoked by police because of evidence of obvious drug dealing in the premises, flagged by an undercover police operation which discovered \"open and serious Class A drug dealing and usage\".<ref>\"Home Nightclub Shut By Police\" BBC Entertainment http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1251385.stm</ref> At this stage, Home London was owned by Big Beats Pubs and Club Empire, it being jointly owned by Mr McCulloch, George Swanson (the former Whitbread director), and Royal Bank Development Capital.<ref>Tinning, William \"Beat goes off as nightclub group folds.\" The Herald 12 April 2001 p 10.</ref>\n\nThe closing of Home London affected the Big Beats company, which then went into receivership. While the licence was reinstated, it was too late for Big Beat. Big Beat\u2019s Home nightclubs assets were initially contracted by the receiver, KPMG, to be run by the Mean Fiddler business.<ref>Susie Mesure \"Big Beat venues go to Mean Fiddler\". The Independent - London 21 August 2001</ref> The London club was then purchased for \u00a320m by the Mean Fiddler business, owned by [[Vince Power|John Vincent Power]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.duedil.com/director/915669035/john-vincent-power|title=Mr John Vincent Power|publisher=DueDil}}</ref> However, Ron McCulloch, from Big Beat, then purchased the Sydney Home Club himself and moved to Australia <ref>Askew, Kate \"Busted Scot Buys Home\" ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 28 August 2001 P 25</ref><ref>War, Sharon and Davidson, Gina \"Nightclub tycoon beats a retreat\" 19 August 2001 Scotland on Sunday p 3</ref>\n\n== Continuation of Sydney Home ==\nSydney Home continued (and continues to this day). In the early 2000s it incorporated the successful [[Pitt Street, Sydney|Pitt Street]] club ''Sublime'' in the late 1990s, run by Simon Page. Simon brought the three nights that were being run at Sublime, ''Beatfix, Cargo'' and ''Voodoo'' and moved its DJs (including [[Peewee Ferris]], [[Nik Fish]], [[Craig Obey]], [[Bexta]] and [[Kate Monroe]]) into Home's Friday night. The Friday Sublime night has continued to run successfully since that time. After some arising family issues, Simon sold his interest to McCulloch. In 2005, Ron McCulloch sold the club back to Simon page for roughly what he had purchased it for.<ref>\"Home Nightclub, Turning a New Page\" http://www.inthemix.com.au/features/22172/Home_Nightclub_Turning_a_new_Page</ref> With the downturn from the peak of interest in dancemusic, and the return of an interest in rock, Sydney Home also expanded into rock music in 2006, hosting bands on Saturday nights, then followed by DJs.<ref>Creagh, Sunanda \"If this house is rockin\" The ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 5 May 2006 SMH p 12</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[List of electronic dance music venues]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Nightclubs]]\n[[Category:Drinking establishment chains]]\n[[Category:Nightclubs in Australia]]\n[[Category:Electronic dance music venues]]\n", "name_user": "I dream of horses", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_(nightclub_chain)"}

Philips and Co. This company became one of Manchester's leading commercial enterprises, specialising in the weaving of narrow tape. By the mid-nineteenth century the extended Philips family held properties and businesses throughout Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire along with the family seats in [[Heybridge and Heath House]], Staffordshire. Herbert was the third son and youngest child of Robert Philips and Laetitia n\u00e9e Hibbert.<ref>Family pedigree and archive</ref>\n\nHerbert Philips' father's first cousin was [[Mark Philips (politician)|Mark Philips]], the elected Member of Parliament for Manchester following the campaign for Manchester's enfranchisement by the 1832 Reform Act. Mark Philips was instrumental in the provision of public open spaces, leading in 1846 to the first public park in Manchester which still bears his name: [[Philips Park, Prestwich|Philips Park]].<ref>http://www.philipspark.org.uk/</ref>\n\n==Clean Air Provision==\nHerbert Philips retained this commitment for clean air provision for the masses with his establishment of the permanent society, \u2018The Committee for Securing Open Spaces for Recreation\u2019 of which he was the Chairman and Treasurer. Likewise he founded the \u2018Noxious Vapours Abatement Association\u2019 to promote the control of chemical and industrial smoke nuisances in Manchester and Salford which proved so harmful to vegetation within these open spaces.<ref>T.

This led to his involvement in the [[Manchester Women's Christian Temperance Association]] (MWCTA) which used the YMCA building for its committee meetings.\n\n==Christian Temperance==\nIn October 1889 it was reported in the ''Manchester Guardian'' that Herbert Philips Esq., J.P. of Sutton Oaks Macclesfield had presided over a Police Court Mission meeting at the [[YMCA]] on Peter Street and he reported that \u00a3700 had been raised and an inebriate's home at Ash Lodge, Halliwell Lane, Cheetham was being negotiated. He suggested that what was needed was to commit habitual offenders to such homes for a period of one to three years.<ref>He had offered the sum of \u00a3200 if a further \u00a3600 could be raised within six months. He further stated that under the Habitual Drunkards Act a person could sign away their liberty for up to 12 months.

His obituaries in the ''Manchester Guardian'' were numerous and extensive. The MWCTA memorial resolution stated their members,\n\n:'Greatly record the help and counsel so often received and so cheerfully accorded by him, their admiration for the steady and unostentatious support given to every cause which had for its aim the alleviation of suffering or the uplifting of the fallen, and especially for the way in which he championed the cause of the tortured and defenceless'.<ref>The Manchester Guardian 9 November 1905.

He was taken into a cottage nearby but died shortly afterwards without reaching his home.

In 1887, Atlantic Highlands was incorporated as a borough, containing {{convert|1.2|sqmi|km2}} of land bordering on the Raritan Bay.<ref name=Story/>\n\nMajor construction occurred from the 1880s through 1900. It included hotels, cottages, rooming houses, and private homes. A pier was built extending well into the bay to accommodate steamboats from New York City. The next twenty years saw rapid development within the community. A water and sewer system was constructed, cottages were erected, and the road system was completed. During this period of development a fire department was organized.\n\nA number of churches saw their beginning in the 1880s: the Central Baptist, First Presbyterian, [[Saint Agnes Catholic Church (Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey)|Saint Agnes Roman Catholic]], First Methodist, and Saint Paul Baptist Church.\n\nAtlantic Highlands became a haven for [[rum-running|bootleggers]] during [[Prohibition]].<ref name=KateRounds/>\n\nSteamer service was the most important transport during the formation of the borough, and continued through the 1940s.  In the 1890s, rail service came to Atlantic Highlands. This opened up Highlands and points south to vacationers. The 1920s saw 26 passenger trains daily passing through the Borough.  The [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] built a major pier at the end of First Avenue. Several trains at a time could continue to the end of the pier to offload [[steamboat]] passengers. From the 1910s through the 1940s, the steamers ''Sandy Hook'' and the ''Monmouth'' navigated the waters bringing businessmen and vacationers to Atlantic Highlands.\n\nThe Manhattan skyline can be seen from the borough's ridges and its shoreline. Pleasure, fishing and commuter boats sail from its harbor. The municipal harbor was built from 1938 through 1940 with municipal, state, and federal funds. It is the largest on the East Coast, home to 715 craft, including high-speed ferry service to New York City, which was introduced in 1986.<ref>Sauchelli, Dana; Fermino, Jennifer; and Sanderson, Bill.

A modern gaming computer is comparable to a mainstream computer with the addition of performance-oriented components, such as high-performance [[video card]]s and high core-count [[central processing unit]]s, that sacrifice power efficiency for raw performance. Gaying computers are often associated with [[enthusiast computing]] due to an overlap in interests; however, while a gaming computer is built to achieve performance for actual gayeplay, enthusiast PCs are built to maximize performance, using games as a real application [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]. Whereas enthusiast PCs are high-end by definition, gaming PCs can be subdivided into low-end, mid-range, and high-end markets. Video card manufacturers earn the bulk of their revenue from their low-end and mid-range offerings. Gaming PCs are often also suitable for other intensive tasks, like video editing.<ref>{{cite web |last=D. |first=Pablo |url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO/ |title=GPU battle: 4670 vs. 9600GSO |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2011-01-21 |publisher=[[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120224434/http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO |archive-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBecause of the large variety of parts that can go into a computer built to play video games, gaming computers are frequently custom-assembled, rather than pre-assembled, either by gaming and hardware enthusiasts or by companies that specialize in producing custom gaming machines. In order to generate interest, gaming computer manufacturers that sell complete systems often produce boutique models, allowing them to compete on aesthetic design in addition to the hardware inside.\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, gaming computers had several distinct hardware components that set them apart from a typical PC. The push for better graphics began with color fidelity, from display systems such as [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] eventually graduating to [[VGA]], which was adopted for the mass market. Gaming also led the push for the adoption of [[sound card]]s, a component that is now commonly integrated onto [[motherboard]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, several non-[[IBM PC compatible]] platforms gained a measure of popularity due to advanced graphics and sound capabilities, starting with the Atari 400/800 and the TI 99/4, and then continuing with others such as the [[Commodore 64]] and eventually the [[Amiga]]. [[Video game developer]]s of the time targeted these platforms for their games, though typically they would later port their games to the more common PC and Apple platforms as well. The [[MSX]] was also popular in Japan, where it preceded the [[video game console]] revolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Most Popular Computers in History|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/10-most-popular-computers-in-history.htm#page=3|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=Discovery|accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref> Japan also had several other popular gaming computers during the 1980s to early 1990s, including the very popular [[PC-88]] and [[PC-98]] as well as the powerful [[X68000]] and [[FM Towns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers.htm |title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\nBy 1993, PC-compatibles were the standard for gaming in the US.

This equipment is now commonly used by non-gamers with [[broadband Internet access]] to share the connection with multiple computers in the home. Like sound cards, network adapters are now commonly integrated onto motherboards.\n\nIn modern times, the primary difference between a gaming computer and a comparable mainstream PC is the inclusion of a performance-oriented [[video card]], which hosts a [[graphics processor]] and dedicated memory. These are generally a requirement to play modern games on the market.\n\nForays into [[physics processing]] have also been made, though with [[Nvidia]]'s buyout of [[PhysX]]<ref>{{cite web|title=NVIDIA completes Acquisition of AGEIA Technologies|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1202895129984.html|publisher=Nvidia Corporation|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>  and [[Intel]]'s buyout of [[Havok (software)|Havok]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Intel wreaks Havok for $110M|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/intel-wreaks-havok-for-110m/1100-6178911/|work=Gamespot.com|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> plans are that this functionality will be combined with existing CPU or GPU technologies.\n\n==Custom-built gaming computers==\nBy 2012, it had become increasingly popular for [[gamer]]s to custom-build their own PC, allowing for more budget control and easier upgradability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/dell_drop_kicks_proprietary_parts|title=Dell Drop Kicks Proprietary Parts|publisher=PCWorld|accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref> More often than not, it is possible to maximize performance for the best value when building a gaming computer. There are several components that must be considered when building a gaming computer, which include [[CPU]]s, [[RAM|memory]], a [[motherboard]], [[video card]]s, [[solid-state drive]]s, [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]], and [[Computer chassis|cases]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-a-gaming-pc-parts-youll-need-where-to-buy-them-2016-12/|title=Building your own gaming PC is incredibly rewarding \u2014 here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen building a custom-built gaming PC, builders usually turn to independent benchmarks to help make their hardware selection. Organizations such as [[AnandTech]] and [[Tom's Hardware Guide]] provide such benchmarks and hardware reviews. The benchmarks include ratings for PC components that are necessary to build a gaming computer. It is also crucial to consider [[computer cooling]], as this is required to remove the [[waste heat]] produced by a computer's components.\n\n===Video cards===\n[[File:NVIDIA-GTX-1070-FoundersEdition-FL.jpg|thumb|225px|An example of an [[NVIDIA]] GPU ([[GeForce 10 series]]).]]\nA [[video card]] is essential to any gaming computer, and connects to a motherboard using the [[PCI Express|Peripheral Component Interconnect Express]] (PCI Express or PCI-E). There are two major manufacturers of GPUs for a gaming computer, [[AMD]] and [[NVIDIA]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-graphics-cards/|title=The best graphics card|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> These companies provide GPUs which other companies, such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] and [[ASUS]], then design circuit boards and cooling shrouds for.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most video cards cost from $200 to $2,000. Modern consumer-grade CPUs often have on-[[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] [[Integrated graphics|integrated GPUs]]; however, these GPUs typically do not provide the adequate performance for playing graphics-intensive games, and are instead aimed primarily for less demanding workloads such as [[graphical user interface]] rendering for \"everyday\" tasks, video playback, and [[Casual game|light gaming]].\n\n===Processors===\nA major component of a gaming computer is the processor, or [[Central processing unit|CPU (central processing unit)]]. There are two major brands that manufacture CPUs, [[AMD]] and [[Intel]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-pc-gaming-cpus-processors/|title=The best PC gaming processor|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> As of 2019, most gaming computers are built with Intel's [[Ice Lake (microarchitecture)|Ice Lake]] or AMD's [[Zen 2|Ryzen 2]] CPUs.<ref name=\":1\" /> While a powerful CPU is important to avoid [[Bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]], after a certain level of CPU power, diminishing returns become evident if the PC is not being used for other, more CPU-intensive purposes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Motherboards===\n[[Motherboard]]s that are designed for gaming computers are differentiated from their normal counterparts by being created with case windows in mind; having more visually appealing designs, sturdier materials, and, in some models, built-in [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-gaming-motherboards/|title=The best gaming motherboards|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> They also have the capability to [[Overclocking|overclock]] certain models of CPUs, and an increased number of various connection ports.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Memory===\n[[Random-access memory]] (RAM) is one of the most important components for a gaming computer. Computers designed for playing games often are supplied with a high amount of RAM.\n\n==== DDR memory ====\n[[Double data rate|DDR]] (double data rate) [[Computer memory|memory]] is essential for any computer system. Adding more memory allows the CPU to address more data for it to quickly access instead of reading off a comparatively slow disk drive or [[solid-state storage device]]. [[DDR SDRAM]] also has much lower latency than its GDDR counterpart and much lower bandwidth as the CPU relies on being able to change small amounts of data quickly. The latest standard of DDR memory is DDR4L.\n\n==== GDDR memory ====\nGDDR (graphical double data rate) memory is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card and is built directly onto the card itself. The amount of RAM built onto a graphics card allows the GPU to quickly access data such as textures instead of reading from a much slower storage device. Having more GDDR memory allows the system to handle higher levels of [[spatial anti-aliasing]] and more complex textures. GDDR memory has a much higher latency when compared to DDR memory but also has a much larger bandwidth, thus allowing the GPU to deal with larger amounts of data at a slower rate when compared to a CPU. The latest revision of GDDR memory is GDDR6.\n\n==== High bandwidth memory (HBM) ====\n[[High Bandwidth Memory|HBM]] is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card, and is placed directly beside the GPU itself on the graphics card. This is different from standard GDDR as standard GDDR memory sits on the PCB of the graphics card. The main advantages of having the memory mounted so close to the GPU itself are as follows; reduced latency due to signals traveling a shorter distance, more bandwidth due to more space for data lanes, and decreased power consumption due to inherent differences to GDDR on the microscopic level. The latest revision of HBM is HBM2.\n\n===Solid-state drives===\n[[Solid-state drive]]s (SSD) are a newer form of data storage that is gaining in popularity. The more common and traditional [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) is still the more widely used, but many gaming enthusiasts are turning to SSDs in favor of the advantages they offer over HDDs. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, meaning they are less susceptible to shock and also run silently. SSDs also offer faster access time, as HDDs require time in order for the moving parts to speed up to operating specifications. An SSD can be 4 or 5 times faster than a traditional HDD. For an SSD, files open almost instantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |title=SSD Drive vs Hard Drive |publisher=Gaming Laptop |access-date=2015-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222141728/http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |archive-date=2015-02-22 |df= }}</ref> This means with an SSD, booting up a system and launching programs take less time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Santo |first=Joel |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404260,00.asp |title=Advantages/Disadvantages - SSD vs HDD: What's the Difference? |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> SSDs will increase the performance of a system by how often the game accesses the drive in order to load items from the game such as level files and texture images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |title=Computer memory articles for SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM from |publisher=Crucial.com |date= |access-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203003057/http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |archive-date=2014-02-03 |df= }}</ref> However, SSDs cost much more than HDDs do per gigabyte, meaning in terms of pure capacity, they are not as cost-effective. They also currently offer a lower common maximum capacity than HDDs.\n\n===Power supply units===\nAlthough occasionally overlooked, the power supply unit (PSU) is still an important component to consider. The wattage needed to run a system is dependent on the hardware, so often a PSU calculator is used to determine the wattage needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Power-Supply |title=How to Buy a Power Supply: 7 Steps (with Pictures) |publisher=wikiHow |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> In addition, future upgrades to a gaming rig will possibly require more power, and PSUs lose power as they age, so it is often a good idea to buy a PSU that has the capability of lasting through several years and upgrades. The PSU must also be compatible with the other hardware\npieces.\n\nThere are two types of PSUs, modular PSUs (MPSU) and non-modular PSUs. Non-modular PSUs come with fixed cables, meaning unused ones will be left unconnected. Modular power supplies have cables that are detachable so unused cables do not create excess clutter but are often more expensive than their non-modular counterparts.<ref name=\"support.nzxt.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://support.nzxt.com/hc/en-us/articles/202798380-Full-Vs-Semi-Vs-Non-Modular-What-Are-The-Differences-|title=Full Vs Semi Vs Non Modular.

The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling to what the original equipment manufacturer shipped their product with, most notably in the case of CPUs. Two types of mainstream cooling exist, [[air cooling]] and [[water cooling]]. Air cooling,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Jeremy|title=Air Cooling Vs Liquid Cooling|url=http://gamesngearselite.com/air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling/|website=Games and Gears Elite|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> the more common of the two, uses a heat sink often in conjunction with fans, heat pipes and/or vapor chambers to move heat away from the component and dissipate it into the air. Water cooling is somewhat more complex, it makes use of water blocks, radiators, pumps, tubing and optionally a reservoir. Water removes heat by running water through a block affixed to the component and then allowing the water time in the radiator in order to cool off. Fans are often used to increase a radiator's rate of heat dissipation. Watercooling is available as either a ready-to-use system (aio coolers) or as kits that need to be assembled and can be customized for expanding cooling capacity, cooling additional components or for aesthetic reasons.<ref name=\"CPU Cooling\">{{cite web|last1=Lloyd|first1=Chris|title=How do CPU coolers work?|url=http://www.techradar.com/au/news/computing-components/processors/how-do-cpu-coolers-work-721366|website=techradar|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Case===\nChoosing a computer case involves several considerations. For one, there is a large range of sizes. A larger gaming tower will allow for future upgrades and more movement. The case must also be compatible with the motherboard's form factor. Because games are oftentimes demanding on a system, one of the most important factors of choosing a case is cooling. In order to avoid the risk of overheating hardware, a computer case with good airflow and a quality fan will go a long way in ensuring proper cooling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/869-choosing-the-best-gaming-case |title=Picking the Best Gaming PC Case &#124; Gamers Nexus - Gaming PC Builds & Hardware Benchmarks |publisher=Gamers Nexus |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Other additional features such as fan speed controllers, filters for dust management, and clear side panels are all useful as well. Custom-building allows a builder to personalize their case if they so desire for aesthetic purposes. There are many designs for computer cases so the builder can choose to their liking.\n\n==Pre-built computers==\n[[File:Chillblast Fusion Tracer with green case lighting.jpg|thumb|An example of a pre-built gaming computer showing the case lighting used for the rig.]]\nWhile many \"advanced\" gamers build their gaming PCs themselves, some choose to go with pre-built or custom-built gaming PCs. These PCs can often be more expensive than building one's own, with higher premiums attached to high-end brands with varying levels of customer service.\n\nDifferent companies offer varying degrees of customization. While established gaming computers such as [[Alienware]] offer unique case designs and little customization from the user prior to purchase, other smaller firms allow a greater degree of customization and better value-for-money, often to the same extent as if the user were to build the computer themselves.\n\nThere are, however, drawbacks to building one's own computer. Assembling a computer means being personally responsible for any problems that may arise, both during the assembly phase, and after it is in regular use. Instead of using a single technical support hotline to cover the entire system, often one will have to deal with individual component manufacturers.\n\nDue to the wide inconsistencies in after-purchase support from component manufacturers, trying to get support can be a daunting task. Customer support is a major reason why even extreme gaming enthusiasts may look to a system integrator for their custom PC builds. There are many positive aspects in choosing to build one's own system, such as no longer being tied to specific configurations. Pricing on individual components is often better and thus can save quite a lot of money on a comparable pre-built system. Warranties are often included with the price of each individual piece of hardware when building a PC, whereas a prebuilt PC's warranty may cost an additional fee or maybe as little as 1 or 2 years for the entire system. Those who choose to build their own PC often seek help from an online community or forum in the absence of a consumer helpline.<ref>[http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/ Build Your Own PC]. PCMech. Retrieved on 2012-06-11.</ref>\n\nOne major drawback of buying a prebuilt gaming PC aside from the extra cost is that they are often built with a very powerful CPU, but with a relatively weak graphics card. This results in a \"gaming\" PC that performs poorly in gaming for the price paid. Most games today do not benefit much from having a very powerful CPU with more than 4 [[Multi-core processor|CPU cores]] and hyper-threading,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVl8Eupbr_E CPU Cores for Gaming: How many do you need? - Q1 2015 Update]</ref> but benefits greatly with a more powerful graphics card.\n\n==Gaming laptop computers==\n\nGaming [[laptop]]s such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] are the mobile equivalent of gaming desktops and are usually more expensive than their desktop counterparts. Currently, most gaming laptops like [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] feature more power-efficient versions of high-end desktop [[Video card|graphics card]]s, which nevertheless still significantly drain the battery, and necessitate more advanced systems. One recent development by [[Nvidia]] is [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] for laptops. Generally, gaming laptops are not considered \"rigs\" as the term can also refer to the physical size of the system. Modern gaming laptops can achieve respectable game performance, but never quite match desktops in a class to class comparison, and most do not feature upgradeable graphics cards.\n\nDue to the relatively small size that the hardware has to fit in, cooling the heat-intensive components is a major problem affecting the performance of such laptops, usually causing degraded value for money performance-wise. Attempts at using the same performance hardware as desktops usually end in a decreased clock frequency of graphics chips to reduce heat, causing the poor value for money.\n\nOne can find many value recommendations across the [[World Wide Web]] on [[website]]s like ''[[TechRadar]]'' or ''[[Tom's Hardware]]''.\n\nThe introduction of the [[Nvidia]] GTX 900M series of mobile GPUs in late 2014 represented a significant advancement from the previous 800M series, lessening the gap with desktop systems and making gaming laptops a more viable alternative to desktop PCs.\n\nA newer approach in the gaming PC industry is to create [[small form factor]] desktops that are more compact and easier to transport than a normal full-sized system.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{Portal bar|Video games|Electronics}}\n[[Category:Personal computing]]\n[[Category:Video game hardware]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{essay-like|date=June 2017}}\n{{tone|date=June 2017}}\n}}\n[[File:Gaming PC set up.jpg|thumb|350px|An example of a dedicated gaming-PC rig.]]\n{{Video Games}}\nA '''gaming computer''', also known as a '''gaming PC''' or '''gaming rig''', is a [[personal computer]] designed for playing [[video game]]s that require a high amount of [[computing]] power. A modern gaming computer is comparable to a mainstream computer with the addition of performance-oriented components, such as high-performance [[video card]]s and high core-count [[central processing unit]]s, that sacrifice power efficiency for raw performance. Gaming computers are often associated with [[enthusiast computing]] due to an overlap in interests; however, while a gaming computer is built to achieve performance for actual gameplay, enthusiast PCs are built to maximize performance, using games as a real application [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]. Whereas enthusiast PCs are high-end by definition, gaming PCs can be subdivided into low-end, mid-range, and high-end markets. Video card manufacturers earn the bulk of their revenue from their low-end and mid-range offerings. Gaming PCs are often also suitable for other intensive tasks, like video editing.<ref>{{cite web |last=D. |first=Pablo |url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO/ |title=GPU battle: 4670 vs. 9600GSO |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2011-01-21 |publisher=[[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120224434/http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/features/132550.20081110.GPU-battle-4670-vs.-9600GSO |archive-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBecause of the large variety of parts that can go into a computer built to play video games, gaming computers are frequently custom-assembled, rather than pre-assembled, either by gaming and hardware enthusiasts or by companies that specialize in producing custom gaming machines. In order to generate interest, gaming computer manufacturers that sell complete systems often produce boutique models, allowing them to compete on aesthetic design in addition to the hardware inside.\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, gaming computers had several distinct hardware components that set them apart from a typical PC. The push for better graphics began with color fidelity, from display systems such as [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] eventually graduating to [[VGA]], which was adopted for the mass market. Gaming also led the push for the adoption of [[sound card]]s, a component that is now commonly integrated onto [[motherboard]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, several non-[[IBM PC compatible]] platforms gained a measure of popularity due to advanced graphics and sound capabilities, starting with the Atari 400/800 and the TI 99/4, and then continuing with others such as the [[Commodore 64]] and eventually the [[Amiga]]. [[Video game developer]]s of the time targeted these platforms for their games, though typically they would later port their games to the more common PC and Apple platforms as well. The [[MSX]] was also popular in Japan, where it preceded the [[video game console]] revolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Most Popular Computers in History|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/10-most-popular-computers-in-history.htm#page=3|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=Discovery|accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref> Japan also had several other popular gaming computers during the 1980s to early 1990s, including the very popular [[PC-88]] and [[PC-98]] as well as the powerful [[X68000]] and [[FM Towns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers.htm |title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date= |accessdate=2016-03-28}}</ref>\n\nBy 1993, PC-compatibles were the standard for gaming in the US.

This equipment is now commonly used by non-gamers with [[broadband Internet access]] to share the connection with multiple computers in the home.

These are generally a requirement to play modern games on the market.\n\nForays into [[physics processing]] have also been made, though with [[Nvidia]]'s buyout of [[PhysX]]<ref>{{cite web|title=NVIDIA completes Acquisition of AGEIA Technologies|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1202895129984.html|publisher=Nvidia Corporation|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>  and [[Intel]]'s buyout of [[Havok (software)|Havok]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Intel wreaks Havok for $110M|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/intel-wreaks-havok-for-110m/1100-6178911/|work=Gamespot.com|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> plans are that this functionality will be combined with existing CPU or GPU technologies.\n\n==Custom-built gaming computers==\nBy 2012, it had become increasingly popular for [[gamer]]s to custom-build their own PC, allowing for more budget control and easier upgradability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/dell_drop_kicks_proprietary_parts|title=Dell Drop Kicks Proprietary Parts|publisher=PCWorld|accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref> More often than not, it is possible to maximize performance for the best value when building a gaming computer. There are several components that must be considered when building a gaming computer, which include [[CPU]]s, [[RAM|memory]], a [[motherboard]], [[video card]]s, [[solid-state drive]]s, [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]], and [[Computer chassis|cases]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-a-gaming-pc-parts-youll-need-where-to-buy-them-2016-12/|title=Building your own gaming PC is incredibly rewarding \u2014 here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen building a custom-built gaming PC, builders usually turn to independent benchmarks to help make their hardware selection. Organizations such as [[AnandTech]] and [[Tom's Hardware Guide]] provide such benchmarks and hardware reviews. The benchmarks include ratings for PC components that are necessary to build a gaming computer. It is also crucial to consider [[computer cooling]], as this is required to remove the [[waste heat]] produced by a computer's components.\n\n===Video cards===\n[[File:NVIDIA-GTX-1070-FoundersEdition-FL.jpg|thumb|225px|An example of an [[NVIDIA]] GPU ([[GeForce 10 series]]).]]\nA [[video card]] is essential to any gaming computer, and connects to a motherboard using the [[PCI Express|Peripheral Component Interconnect Express]] (PCI Express or PCI-E). There are two major manufacturers of GPUs for a gaming computer, [[AMD]] and [[NVIDIA]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-graphics-cards/|title=The best graphics card|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> These companies provide GPUs which other companies, such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] and [[ASUS]], then design circuit boards and cooling shrouds for.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most video cards cost from $200 to $2,000.

There are two major brands that manufacture CPUs, [[AMD]] and [[Intel]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-pc-gaming-cpus-processors/|title=The best PC gaming processor|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> As of 2019, most gaming computers are built with Intel's [[Ice Lake (microarchitecture)|Ice Lake]] or AMD's [[Zen 2|Ryzen 2]] CPUs.<ref name=\":1\" /> While a powerful CPU is important to avoid [[Bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]], after a certain level of CPU power, diminishing returns become evident if the PC is not being used for other, more CPU-intensive purposes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Motherboards===\n[[Motherboard]]s that are designed for gaming computers are differentiated from their normal counterparts by being created with case windows in mind; having more visually appealing designs, sturdier materials, and, in some models, built-in [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-gaming-motherboards/|title=The best gaming motherboards|work=pcgamer|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref> They also have the capability to [[Overclocking|overclock]] certain models of CPUs, and an increased number of various connection ports.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Memory===\n[[Random-access memory]] (RAM) is one of the most important components for a gaming computer. Computers designed for playing games often are supplied with a high amount of RAM.\n\n==== DDR memory ====\n[[Double data rate|DDR]] (double data rate) [[Computer memory|memory]] is essential for any computer system. Adding more memory allows the CPU to address more data for it to quickly access instead of reading off a comparatively slow disk drive or [[solid-state storage device]]. [[DDR SDRAM]] also has much lower latency than its GDDR counterpart and much lower bandwidth as the CPU relies on being able to change small amounts of data quickly. The latest standard of DDR memory is DDR4L.\n\n==== GDDR memory ====\nGDDR (graphical double data rate) memory is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card and is built directly onto the card itself. The amount of RAM built onto a graphics card allows the GPU to quickly access data such as textures instead of reading from a much slower storage device. Having more GDDR memory allows the system to handle higher levels of [[spatial anti-aliasing]] and more complex textures. GDDR memory has a much higher latency when compared to DDR memory but also has a much larger bandwidth, thus allowing the GPU to deal with larger amounts of data at a slower rate when compared to a CPU. The latest revision of GDDR memory is GDDR6.\n\n==== High bandwidth memory (HBM) ====\n[[High Bandwidth Memory|HBM]] is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card, and is placed directly beside the GPU itself on the graphics card. This is different from standard GDDR as standard GDDR memory sits on the PCB of the graphics card. The main advantages of having the memory mounted so close to the GPU itself are as follows; reduced latency due to signals traveling a shorter distance, more bandwidth due to more space for data lanes, and decreased power consumption due to inherent differences to GDDR on the microscopic level. The latest revision of HBM is HBM2.\n\n===Solid-state drives===\n[[Solid-state drive]]s (SSD) are a newer form of data storage that is gaining in popularity. The more common and traditional [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) is still the more widely used, but many gaming enthusiasts are turning to SSDs in favor of the advantages they offer over HDDs. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, meaning they are less susceptible to shock and also run silently. SSDs also offer faster access time, as HDDs require time in order for the moving parts to speed up to operating specifications. An SSD can be 4 or 5 times faster than a traditional HDD. For an SSD, files open almost instantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |title=SSD Drive vs Hard Drive |publisher=Gaming Laptop |access-date=2015-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222141728/http://gamertops.com/ssd-drive-vs-hard-drive |archive-date=2015-02-22 |df= }}</ref> This means with an SSD, booting up a system and launching programs take less time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Santo |first=Joel |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404260,00.asp |title=Advantages/Disadvantages - SSD vs HDD: What's the Difference? |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> SSDs will increase the performance of a system by how often the game accesses the drive in order to load items from the game such as level files and texture images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |title=Computer memory articles for SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM from |publisher=Crucial.com |date= |access-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203003057/http://www.crucial.com/articles/SSD-BOOSTS-GAMING-SYSTEM/news.aspx |archive-date=2014-02-03 |df= }}</ref> However, SSDs cost much more than HDDs do per gigabyte, meaning in terms of pure capacity, they are not as cost-effective. They also currently offer a lower common maximum capacity than HDDs.\n\n===Power supply units===\nAlthough occasionally overlooked, the power supply unit (PSU) is still an important component to consider. The wattage needed to run a system is dependent on the hardware, so often a PSU calculator is used to determine the wattage needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Power-Supply |title=How to Buy a Power Supply: 7 Steps (with Pictures) |publisher=wikiHow |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> In addition, future upgrades to a gaming rig will possibly require more power, and PSUs lose power as they age, so it is often a good idea to buy a PSU that has the capability of lasting through several years and upgrades.

The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling to what the original equipment manufacturer shipped their product with, most notably in the case of CPUs. Two types of mainstream cooling exist, [[air cooling]] and [[water cooling]]. Air cooling,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acosta|first1=Jeremy|title=Air Cooling Vs Liquid Cooling|url=http://gamesngearselite.com/air-cooling-vs-liquid-cooling/|website=Games and Gears Elite|accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> the more common of the two, uses a heat sink often in conjunction with fans, heat pipes and/or vapor chambers to move heat away from the component and dissipate it into the air. Water cooling is somewhat more complex, it makes use of water blocks, radiators, pumps, tubing and optionally a reservoir. Water removes heat by running water through a block affixed to the component and then allowing the water time in the radiator in order to cool off. Fans are often used to increase a radiator's rate of heat dissipation. Watercooling is available as either a ready-to-use system (aio coolers) or as kits that need to be assembled and can be customized for expanding cooling capacity, cooling additional components or for aesthetic reasons.<ref name=\"CPU Cooling\">{{cite web|last1=Lloyd|first1=Chris|title=How do CPU coolers work?|url=http://www.techradar.com/au/news/computing-components/processors/how-do-cpu-coolers-work-721366|website=techradar|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Case===\nChoosing a computer case involves several considerations. For one, there is a large range of sizes. A larger gaming tower will allow for future upgrades and more movement. The case must also be compatible with the motherboard's form factor. Because games are oftentimes demanding on a system, one of the most important factors of choosing a case is cooling. In order to avoid the risk of overheating hardware, a computer case with good airflow and a quality fan will go a long way in ensuring proper cooling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/869-choosing-the-best-gaming-case |title=Picking the Best Gaming PC Case &#124; Gamers Nexus - Gaming PC Builds & Hardware Benchmarks |publisher=Gamers Nexus |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> Other additional features such as fan speed controllers, filters for dust management, and clear side panels are all useful as well. Custom-building allows a builder to personalize their case if they so desire for aesthetic purposes. There are many designs for computer cases so the builder can choose to their liking.\n\n==Pre-built computers==\n[[File:Chillblast Fusion Tracer with green case lighting.jpg|thumb|An example of a pre-built gaming computer showing the case lighting used for the rig.]]\nWhile many \"advanced\" gamers build their gaming PCs themselves, some choose to go with pre-built or custom-built gaming PCs. These PCs can often be more expensive than building one's own, with higher premiums attached to high-end brands with varying levels of customer service.\n\nDifferent companies offer varying degrees of customization. While established gaming computers such as [[Alienware]] offer unique case designs and little customization from the user prior to purchase, other smaller firms allow a greater degree of customization and better value-for-money, often to the same extent as if the user were to build the computer themselves.\n\nThere are, however, drawbacks to building one's own computer. Assembling a computer means being personally responsible for any problems that may arise, both during the assembly phase, and after it is in regular use. Instead of using a single technical support hotline to cover the entire system, often one will have to deal with individual component manufacturers.\n\nDue to the wide inconsistencies in after-purchase support from component manufacturers, trying to get support can be a daunting task. Customer support is a major reason why even extreme gaming enthusiasts may look to a system integrator for their custom PC builds. There are many positive aspects in choosing to build one's own system, such as no longer being tied to specific configurations. Pricing on individual components is often better and thus can save quite a lot of money on a comparable pre-built system. Warranties are often included with the price of each individual piece of hardware when building a PC, whereas a prebuilt PC's warranty may cost an additional fee or maybe as little as 1 or 2 years for the entire system. Those who choose to build their own PC often seek help from an online community or forum in the absence of a consumer helpline.<ref>[http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/ Build Your Own PC]. PCMech. Retrieved on 2012-06-11.</ref>\n\nOne major drawback of buying a prebuilt gaming PC aside from the extra cost is that they are often built with a very powerful CPU, but with a relatively weak graphics card. This results in a \"gaming\" PC that performs poorly in gaming for the price paid. Most games today do not benefit much from having a very powerful CPU with more than 4 [[Multi-core processor|CPU cores]] and hyper-threading,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVl8Eupbr_E CPU Cores for Gaming: How many do you need? - Q1 2015 Update]</ref> but benefits greatly with a more powerful graphics card.\n\n==Gaming laptop computers==\n\nGaming [[laptop]]s such as [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] are the mobile equivalent of gaming desktops and are usually more expensive than their desktop counterparts. Currently, most gaming laptops like [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Asus]] feature more power-efficient versions of high-end desktop [[Video card|graphics card]]s, which nevertheless still significantly drain the battery, and necessitate more advanced systems. One recent development by [[Nvidia]] is [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] for laptops. Generally, gaming laptops are not considered \"rigs\" as the term can also refer to the physical size of the system. Modern gaming laptops can achieve respectable game performance, but never quite match desktops in a class to class comparison, and most do not feature upgradeable graphics cards.\n\nDue to the relatively small size that the hardware has to fit in, cooling the heat-intensive components is a major problem affecting the performance of such laptops, usually causing degraded value for money performance-wise. Attempts at using the same performance hardware as desktops usually end in a decreased clock frequency of graphics chips to reduce heat, causing the poor value for money.\n\nOne can find many value recommendations across the [[World Wide Web]] on [[website]]s like ''[[TechRadar]]'' or ''[[Tom's Hardware]]''.\n\nThe introduction of the [[Nvidia]] GTX 900M series of mobile GPUs in late 2014 represented a significant advancement from the previous 800M series, lessening the gap with desktop systems and making gaming laptops a more viable alternative to desktop PCs.\n\nA newer approach in the gaming PC industry is to create [[small form factor]] desktops that are more compact and easier to transport than a normal full-sized system.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}{{Portal bar|Video games|Electronics}}\n[[Category:Personal computing]]\n[[Category:Video game hardware]]\n", "name_user": "FactualNumber717171", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_computer"}

From October 16\u201317, a cold front moved eastward across the basin. An area of low pressure formed along the southern end of the dissipating boundary, initially harboring characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. This low became more symmetric while also intensifying, transitioning into a hurricane by 00:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19 while located roughly 715&nbsp;miles (1,150&nbsp;km) southeast of Newfoundland. The system attained peak winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) within six hours and weakened shortly thereafter while moving west-northwest.

A second tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico and passed near New Orleans, Louisiana, on August&nbsp;29. A nearly stationary tropical depression developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September&nbsp;29 and dissipated two days later; it may have been absorbed by [[#Tropical Storm Ten|Tropical Storm Ten]]. This system was originally included in the [[HURDAT|official Atlantic hurricane track database]] as a tropical storm, but was found to have winds of only 30&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) by the reanalysis. On October&nbsp;8, a northward-moving tropical depression spawned from a tropical wave well east of the Lesser Antilles, eventually transitioning into an extratropical system on October&nbsp;14. The season's final tropical cyclone was a nearly stationary tropical depression that persisted in the central Caribbean Sea between October&nbsp;25\u201329.

Because technologies such as [[weather satellite|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis project]] which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to [[HURDAT]]; the official intensities and tracks of storms were also revised. The year's first storm formed on July&nbsp;29 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October&nbsp;21.\n\nMost of the season's storms arose from the [[subtropics]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was a focus for storm activity; four storms reached the Canadian province as [[extratropical cyclone]]s. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the [[#Hurricane Four|first]] inflicted $1.5&nbsp;million in damage on the apple crop in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and the [[#Hurricane Eight|second]] tore up four [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and sank or grounded several ships. A [[#Tropical Storm Ten|short-lived tropical storm in October]] caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans, Louisiana]], with {{cvt|16.65|in|mm}} of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]. A [[#Tropical Storm Seven|tropical storm]] striking parts of the [[United States Gulf Coast|U.S. Gulf Coast]] was blamed for the season's only two deaths, but otherwise did minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h); it did not affect any landmasses, remaining over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic.\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2017 till:01/11/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:29/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:01/08/2017 till:04/08/2017 color:TD text:\"TD\"\n  from:02/08/2017 till:09/08/2017 color:TS text:\"Two (TS)\"\n  from:24/08/2017 till:02/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Three (TS)\"\n  from:09/09/2017 till:14/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:10/09/2017 till:12/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  from:13/09/2017 till:19/09/2017 color:C3 text:\"Six (C3)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:16/09/2017 till:21/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Seven (C1)\"\n  from:20/09/2017 till:26/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Eight (C2)\"\n  from:26/09/2017 till:28/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/2017 till:04/10/2017 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n  from:19/10/2017 till:21/10/2017 color:C1 text:\"Eleven (C1)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/2017 till:31/07/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:31/08/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:30/09/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:31/10/2017 text:October\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=Tropical Storm One surface analysis 31 July 1937.png\n|Track=1937 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n|Formed=July 29\n|Dissipated=August 1\n|1-min winds=60\n|Pressure=996\n}}\nIn late July, a [[stationary front]] was draped across the northeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].

While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/|website=Speedrunslive| title = Speedrunslive FAQ}}</ref>\n\nPlayers performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note |name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.speedrun.com/|title=Speedrun.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Speedrun.com|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SpeedRunsLive|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/|website=SpeedRunsLive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SpeedDemosArchive|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/|website=SpeedDemosArchive}}</ref><ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url =  http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1 | title = Smashing the Clock | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | author = Turner, B. | accessdate =August 13, 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"GamersDividedMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528811/20060417/index.jhtml|title=Gamers Divided Over Freakish Feats Achieved With Tool-Assisted Speed Runs|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|year=2006|website=|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Common occurrences ==\n=== Sequence breaking ===\n{{main|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>. See [[Speedrun#Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)|section \"Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)\"]] for more information on Metroid 2002.}} The original thread was called \"Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus\"; since then, the \"''x'' before ''y''\" notation has become common in the nomenclature of speedrunning. Thardus, a fictional creature in the [[Metroid|''Metroid'' series]], was designed to be a mandatory [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] before the Gravity Suit and Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. Since its initial discovery, sequence breaking has become an integral part of speedrunning and has been applied to many other games.\n\nA specific way to do sequence breaking in a specific game is usually called a skip, and well-known skips are known in their communities under names that easily identify it.\n\n=== Glitch usage ===\n[[Image:Sm64 mips.png|thumb|Usage of a [[Speedrun#Glitches|glitch]] in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to pass through a wall, performing a sequence break.]]\n[[Glitch|Glitches]] are often used in order to achieve sequence breaks; an example of this can be found in the \"16 Star\" run of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. In this game, [[Mario]] normally needs to collect at least 70 of the 120 power stars before he is allowed to challenge [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], the final boss, but a glitch makes it possible to access the final level with only 16 stars. With the right kind of movement, it is possible to pass through the boundary of a wall by pushing into it while holding onto MIPS, an [[Non-player character|NPC]] rabbit,<ref name=\"SuperMario6416Star\">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://speeddemosarchive.com/Mario64.html | title = Super Mario 64 | publisher = [[Speed Demos Archive]] | accessdate =March 25, 2006}}</ref> then exploit a trick known as \"backwards long-jumping\" to bypass the 70 star door. Since then, similar tricks have been found to complete the game without collecting any stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/9/17549444/super-mario-64-speedrun-world-record-0-star|title=One of Super Mario 64's toughest speedrun records has been broken|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=2018-07-09|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Glitches can also be used for purposes outside of sequence breaking, such as achieving otherwise impossible speeds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/05/half-life-2-world-record-speedrun-will-make-your-head-spin/|title=Half-Life 2 World Record Speedrun Will Make Your Head Spin|date=2015-05-06|website=Kotaku Australia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-wild-speedrunning-community-of-16-year-old-spongebob-battle-for-bikini-bottom/|title=Inside the wild speedrunning community of 16-year-old SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom|last=Winkie|first=Luke|date=2019-09-25|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> and duplicating resources.\n\nWhile some speedrun rules require that the skipping of such events be avoided, it is often desirable to make full use of such possibilities. Therefore, some websites, such as Speeddemosarchive,<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\">{{cite web|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|title=Speed Demos Archive - Rules|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022020158/http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|archivedate=October 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> offer support for multiple speedrun categories. Each category specifies which glitches are permitted and what game objectives must be completed. For example, it is typically agreed that glitches arising from outside the game, such as improperly inserting the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]], are impermissible. Removing or altering a game disc/cartridge/files while the game is running is forbidden. Examples of this are the crooked cartridge trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]] and the CD streaming trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ZeldaSpeedRuns Leaderboard Rules|url=http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|website=ZeldaSpeedRuns|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220003/http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Tool-assistance ==\n{{main|Tool-assisted speedrun}}\nAlthough most speedruns assume normal human play of a game, ''[[tool-assisted speedrun]]s'' (abbreviated ''TAS'') allow authors to use outside tools to aid their playing. For example, utilizing the [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] function of an [[Video game console emulator|emulator]] to go back in time and revise mistakes (known as ''re-recording''), or using software to read [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] directly from the game's memory, giving the player information not normally available to them. The result is that human limitations, such as skill and reflex, are no longer a barrier in the creation of a run; tool-assisted runs have (sometimes significantly) lower completion times than their unassisted equivalents.<ref name=\"WhyAndHow\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://tasvideos.org/WhyAndHow.html | title = Why And How | publisher = TASVideos | author = TASVideos contributors | accessdate =March 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Completion ==\nSpeedruns are categorized into various levels of completion, or how thoroughly a game is completed, which are as follows:\n\n*'''Any%''', or fastest completion, refers to completing the game as quickly as possible, and often involves sequence breaking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/23/17494370/summer-games-done-quick-2018-where-to-watch-schedule-preview|title=Summer Games Done Quick 2018: everything you need to know about the first day|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=2018-06-23|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> \n*'''100%''', or full completion, requires the player to complete the game to its fullest. This often includes collecting all key items or upgrades, finding all secret features, or anything else that may be deemed important. Specific requirements for a 100% speedrun are different depending on the game.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\">{{cite web|url=https://forum.speeddemosarchive.com/post/low100_definitions.html|title=low%/100% definitions|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref> Some games, such as ''[[Super Metroid]]'', have a percentage counter and therefore have an easy definition for 100%.<ref>{{cite web|title=sweetnumb's SM 100% Item Advanced Tutorial with WildAnaconda69|url=https://www.twitch.tv/sweetnumb/v/44379421|website=Twitch}}</ref> Others do not, and instead the game's community decides what the definition for 100% should be.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|title=SpeedRunsLive Speedrunning Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=SpeedRunsLive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615224214/http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|archive-date=June 15, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> Any% and 100% are the most common categories for speedrunning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@CeltThulu/speedrunning-a-primer-for-beginners-by-a-beginner-76d1f2bdc|title=Speedrunning \u2014 A Primer For Beginners, By a Beginner|last=Steele|first=Brian|date=November 15, 2015|website=Medium|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n*'''Low%''', or minimalist completion, requires the player to complete the game by obtaining the fewest key items or upgrades possible. If the fastest way to complete the game already involves the player picking up the fewest key items or upgrades, a low% category may not exist for that game's speedruns.<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\"/> As with 100% runs, low% speedruns have requirements that vary between games.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, there can be game-specific categories that change how much of the game must be completed. These categories usually include completing or avoiding specific aspects of the game and/or not allowing certain glitches or game exploits to be used in the run. An example of this would be the medallions/stones/trials category in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''; this category requires the runner to beat all major levels in the game and restricts some of the glitches that can be performed. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'', there is a \"Water%\" run, which constitutes collecting every DK Coin in the game; this requires the player to collect every Bear Coin to access the Lost World, but does not require a player to actually 100% the game and ignore the Banana Birds.<ref name=\"DKCspeedruns\">{{cite web|url=https://dkcspeedruns.com/Leaderboards#DKC3_-_Water.25|title=water% definition|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Randomizer}}\nA '''randomizer''' is a type of [[game mod]] that has been used in speedrunning, wherein software is used to shuffle the locations of elements (such as items) to provide an additional challenge. Popular games used for randomizer runs have included ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[Super Metroid]]'', while a notable mod combines both games\u2014with special doorways transitioning the player between them, and items from both games scattered within their respective environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/|title=How \u201crandomizers\u201d are breathing new life into old games|last=Staff|first=Ars|date=2019-12-03|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]] pertaining to video games in general. When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing\u2014usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.\n\n=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===\nDecember 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina \"Strunoph\" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThis site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the \"DHT\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the \"[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]\", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> These so-called \"exams\" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application. ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in October 1994,<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994|title=1994 - Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, List of Winners|accessdate=2009-06-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614193353/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994 |archivedate = June 14, 2008}}</ref> and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new ''Doom'' version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''<nowiki/>'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.<ref name=\"DoomStats\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]]. From there on, since early 1998, it had been administered by Adam Hegyi, who was maintaining the site, but left around 2007 without notice. In 2012, COMPET-N player Zvonimir 'fx' Bu\u017eani\u0107 took over maintaining the site and re-created new database for WAD-s and PWAD-s. It is currently located at [http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n COMPET-N | news].\n\nAs of November 2007, COMPET-N contained a total amount of 6072 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 462 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds.<ref name=\"DoomStats\"/> As of January 2012, COMPET-N contains a total amount of 9122 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 749 hours, 41 minutes and 47 seconds.\n\n=== SpeedRunsLive.com ===\nIn 2009, [http://www.speedrunslive.com/ SpeedRunsLive.com] was created by Narcissa Wright and Daniel 'Jiano' Hart<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/about/|title=About SpeedRunsLive|website=www.speedrunslive.com|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> as a way for speedrunners to showcase speedrunning races in real time with a set goal consisting of various possible categories.

Despite being released as early as 1996, ''Quake'' has steadily remained popular with its players, who subsequently released the ''Quake done Quick with a Vengeance'' movie on September 13, 2000, which featured a complete run through ''Quake'' in 0:12:23.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |accessdate=March 25, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423162351/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |archivedate=April 23, 2006 |title=Quake done Quick with a Vengeance}}</ref> Primarily tricks that had not been used in both its predecessors allowed for this improvement, as the run's manual states that it \"[makes] use of every known trick, including unrestricted [[Strafe-jumping|bunny-hopping]], to represent the state-of-the-art in Nightmare running\".<ref name=\"QuakeDoneQuickWithAVengeance\">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.txt | publisher = Quake done Quick | title = Quake done Quick with a Vengeance | author = Quake done Quick contributors | archivedate = April 9, 2006 | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | url-status = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060409151532/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.txt | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2014, Speed Demos Archive can be found at the web address <tt>[http://speeddemosarchive.com/ http://speeddemosarchive.com/]</tt> and contains a total amount of 9535 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of over 250 hours.<ref name=\"QuakeStats\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = https://archive.org/details/Quake_SDA_collection | title = Quake (PC) \u2013 Speed demo collection | publisher = Internet Archive | accessdate =September 10, 2014}}</ref> In December 2011, a new run was produced and called ''Quake done Quickest''.

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A \"tier\", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun. For example, a low-percentage speedrun is in a different tier than an any-percentage speedrun, as both have different completion goals.}} including any%, 100%, low%, and reverse boss order (RBO), in which the player beats the game's bosses in the opposite order they were meant to be played via sequence breaking.\n\nAs the Internet became more available to the general public, groups of players started collaborating on [[Internet forum|message boards]] to discuss these tricks with one another in what became a community based on playing the games speedily.\n\nThe first ''Metroid'' community that was created for the purpose of fast completion was ''Metroid Prime Discoveries'', created and led by Jean-Sebastien \"Zell\" Dubois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|title=Lycos.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410072328/http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|archivedate=April 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Rather than being a site that focused on speedrunning, it was dedicated to documenting the possibilities of sequence breaking in the game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions. A couple of months afterwards, in June 1999, the first site made for the purpose of sharing these demos, aptly called \"Tools-Assisted Speedruns\", was opened by Esko Koskimaa, Peo Sjoblom, and Yonatan Donner.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/>{{refn|group=Note |name=ToolsAssistedSpeedrun|Doom tool-assisted speedrunning is sometimes referred to as \"tools-assisted speedrunning\", after the first site used to share these demos.

The knowledge that the video was constructed through tedious and careful selective replaying also raised some questions about the authenticity of video game replays; after all, if it is practically impossible to tell the videos of both kinds apart, one cannot possibly know whether a run was made with or without the use of a special emulator. It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator.

Their runs are streamed live at [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and runners often provide commentary throughout the run to give viewers a better understanding of what is going on. Runners who are speedrunning often practice their game in a practice room at the event before their scheduled run as a warm up, or they practice at home beforehand.

While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/|website=Speedrunslive| title = Speedrunslive FAQ}}</ref>\n\nPlayers performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note |name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.speedrun.com/|title=Speedrun.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Speedrun.com|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SpeedRunsLive|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/|website=SpeedRunsLive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SpeedDemosArchive|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/|website=SpeedDemosArchive}}</ref><ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url =  http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1 | title = Smashing the Clock | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | author = Turner, B. | accessdate =August 13, 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"GamersDividedMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528811/20060417/index.jhtml|title=Gamers Divided Over Freakish Feats Achieved With Tool-Assisted Speed Runs|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|year=2006|website=|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Common occurrences ==\n=== Sequence breaking ===\n{{main|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>. See [[Speedrun#Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)|section \"Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)\"]] for more information on Metroid 2002.}} The original thread was called \"Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus\"; since then, the \"''x'' before ''y''\" notation has become common in the nomenclature of speedrunning. Thardus, a fictional creature in the [[Metroid|''Metroid'' series]], was designed to be a mandatory [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] before the Gravity Suit and Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. Since its initial discovery, sequence breaking has become an integral part of speedrunning and has been applied to many other games.\n\nA specific way to do sequence breaking in a specific game is usually called a skip, and well-known skips are known in their communities under names that easily identify it.\n\n=== Glitch usage ===\n[[Image:Sm64 mips.png|thumb|Usage of a [[Speedrun#Glitches|glitch]] in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to pass through a wall, performing a sequence break.]]\nGlitches are often used in order to achieve sequence breaks; an example of this can be found in the \"16 Star\" run of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. In this game, [[Mario]] normally needs to collect at least 70 of the 120 power stars before he is allowed to challenge [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], the final boss, but a glitch makes it possible to access the final level with only 16 stars. With the right kind of movement, it is possible to pass through the boundary of a wall by pushing into it while holding onto MIPS, an [[Non-player character|NPC]] rabbit.<ref name=\"SuperMario6416Star\">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://speeddemosarchive.com/Mario64.html | title = Super Mario 64 | publisher = [[Speed Demos Archive]] | accessdate =March 25, 2006}}</ref> Since then, similar tricks have been found to complete the game without collecting any stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/9/17549444/super-mario-64-speedrun-world-record-0-star|title=One of Super Mario 64's toughest speedrun records has been broken|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=2018-07-09|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Glitches can also be used for purposes outside of sequence breaking, such as achieving otherwise impossible speeds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/05/half-life-2-world-record-speedrun-will-make-your-head-spin/|title=Half-Life 2 World Record Speedrun Will Make Your Head Spin|date=2015-05-06|website=Kotaku Australia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-wild-speedrunning-community-of-16-year-old-spongebob-battle-for-bikini-bottom/|title=Inside the wild speedrunning community of 16-year-old SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom|last=Winkie|first=Luke|date=2019-09-25|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> and duplicating resources.\n\nWhile some speedrun rules require that the skipping of such events be avoided, it is often desirable to make full use of such possibilities. Therefore, some websites, such as Speeddemosarchive,<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\">{{cite web|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|title=Speed Demos Archive - Rules|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022020158/http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|archivedate=October 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> offer support for multiple speedrun categories. Each category specifies which glitches are permitted and what game objectives must be completed. For example, it is typically agreed that glitches arising from outside the game, such as improperly inserting the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]], are impermissible. Removing or altering a game disc/cartridge/files while the game is running is forbidden. Examples of this are the crooked cartridge trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]] and the CD streaming trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ZeldaSpeedRuns Leaderboard Rules|url=http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|website=ZeldaSpeedRuns|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220003/http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Tool-assistance ==\n{{main|Tool-assisted speedrun}}\nAlthough most speedruns assume normal human play of a game, ''[[tool-assisted speedrun]]s'' (abbreviated ''TAS'') allow authors to use outside tools to aid their playing. For example, utilizing the [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] function of an [[Video game console emulator|emulator]] to go back in time and revise mistakes (known as ''re-recording''), or using software to read [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] directly from the game's memory, giving the player information not normally available to them. The result is that human limitations, such as skill and reflex, are no longer a barrier in the creation of a run; tool-assisted runs have (sometimes significantly) lower completion times than their unassisted equivalents.<ref name=\"WhyAndHow\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://tasvideos.org/WhyAndHow.html | title = Why And How | publisher = TASVideos | author = TASVideos contributors | accessdate =March 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Completion ==\nSpeedruns are categorized into various levels of completion, or how thoroughly a game is completed, which are as follows:\n\n*'''Any%''', or fastest completion, refers to completing the game as quickly as possible, and often involves sequence breaking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/23/17494370/summer-games-done-quick-2018-where-to-watch-schedule-preview|title=Summer Games Done Quick 2018: everything you need to know about the first day|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=2018-06-23|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> \n*'''100%''', or full completion, requires the player to complete the game to its fullest. This often includes collecting all key items or upgrades, finding all secret features, or anything else that may be deemed important. Specific requirements for a 100% speedrun are different depending on the game.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\">{{cite web|url=https://forum.speeddemosarchive.com/post/low100_definitions.html|title=low%/100% definitions|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref> Some games, such as ''[[Super Metroid]]'', have a percentage counter and therefore have an easy definition for 100%.<ref>{{cite web|title=sweetnumb's SM 100% Item Advanced Tutorial with WildAnaconda69|url=https://www.twitch.tv/sweetnumb/v/44379421|website=Twitch}}</ref> Others do not, and instead the game's community decides what the definition for 100% should be.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|title=SpeedRunsLive Speedrunning Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=SpeedRunsLive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615224214/http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|archive-date=June 15, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> Any% and 100% are the most common categories for speedrunning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@CeltThulu/speedrunning-a-primer-for-beginners-by-a-beginner-76d1f2bdc|title=Speedrunning \u2014 A Primer For Beginners, By a Beginner|last=Steele|first=Brian|date=November 15, 2015|website=Medium|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>\n*'''Low%''', or minimalist completion, requires the player to complete the game by obtaining the fewest key items or upgrades possible. If the fastest way to complete the game already involves the player picking up the fewest key items or upgrades, a low% category may not exist for that game's speedruns.<ref name=\"speeddemosarchive.com\"/> As with 100% runs, low% speedruns have requirements that vary between games.<ref name=\"forum.speeddemosarchive.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, there can be game-specific categories that change how much of the game must be completed. These categories usually include completing or avoiding specific aspects of the game and/or not allowing certain glitches or game exploits to be used in the run. An example of this would be the medallions/stones/trials category in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''; this category requires the runner to beat all major levels in the game and restricts some of the glitches that can be performed. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'', there is a \"Water%\" run, which constitutes collecting every DK Coin in the game; this requires the player to collect every Bear Coin to access the Lost World, but does not require a player to actually 100% the game and ignore the Banana Birds.<ref name=\"DKCspeedruns\">{{cite web|url=https://dkcspeedruns.com/Leaderboards#DKC3_-_Water.25|title=water% definition|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Randomizer}}\nA '''randomizer''' is a type of [[game mod]] that has been used in speedrunning, wherein software is used to shuffle the locations of elements (such as items) to provide an additional challenge. Popular games used for randomizer runs have included ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[Super Metroid]]'', while a notable mod combines both games\u2014with special doorways transitioning the player between them, and items from both games scattered within their respective environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/|title=How \u201crandomizers\u201d are breathing new life into old games|last=Staff|first=Ars|date=2019-12-03|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]] pertaining to video games in general. When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing\u2014usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.\n\n=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===\nDecember 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina \"Strunoph\" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThis site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the \"DHT\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the \"[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]\", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> These so-called \"exams\" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application. ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in October 1994,<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994|title=1994 - Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, List of Winners|accessdate=2009-06-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614193353/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994 |archivedate = June 14, 2008}}</ref> and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new ''Doom'' version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''<nowiki/>'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.<ref name=\"DoomStats\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]].

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A \"tier\", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun. For example, a low-percentage speedrun is in a different tier than an any-percentage speedrun, as both have different completion goals.}} including any%, 100%, low%, and reverse boss order (RBO), in which the player beats the game's bosses in the opposite order they were meant to be played via sequence breaking.\n\nAs the Internet became more available to the general public, groups of players started collaborating on [[Internet forum|message boards]] to discuss these tricks with one another in what became a community based on playing the games speedily.\n\nThe first ''Metroid'' community that was created for the purpose of fast completion was ''Metroid Prime Discoveries'', created and led by Jean-Sebastien \"Zell\" Dubois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|title=Lycos.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410072328/http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|archivedate=April 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Rather than being a site that focused on speedrunning, it was dedicated to documenting the possibilities of sequence breaking in the game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions. A couple of months afterwards, in June 1999, the first site made for the purpose of sharing these demos, aptly called \"Tools-Assisted Speedruns\", was opened by Esko Koskimaa, Peo Sjoblom, and Yonatan Donner.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/>{{refn|group=Note |name=ToolsAssistedSpeedrun|Doom tool-assisted speedrunning is sometimes referred to as \"tools-assisted speedrunning\", after the first site used to share these demos. A news post after the creation of this site, however, read \"Indeed, I was wrong and the site should be called 'Tool-Assisted Speedruns' rather than 'Tools-Assisted Speedruns'. I'm not going to redo the logo though.\"}}\n\nLike other such communities, the maintainers of the site stressed that their demos were for entertainment purposes rather than skill competitions, although the attempt to have the fastest time possible with tools itself became a competition as well.<ref name=\"AboutToolsAssistedSpeedruns\">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | publisher = Internet Archive | title = Information about Tools-Assisted Speedruns | author = Koskimaa, E. | author2 = Sjoblom, P. | author3 = Donner, Y. | accessdate = April 8, 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000411175100/http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | archivedate = April 11, 2000 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The site became a success, usually updating several times a week with demos recorded by its maintainers and submitted by its readers.

Although it was widely believed that the video was made by an extremely skilled player, it was actually the first tool-assisted speedrun made with a special emulator to generate widespread interest.{{refn|group=Note |name=EarlyTASVideos|There is evidence that several tool-assisted speedrun videos had been made before then, including a few others by Morimoto himself, but the Super Mario Bros. 3 video was the first to become popular with a general audience.}} When Morimoto detailed the making of the run on his website,<ref name=\"MorimotoExplanation\">{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031203222907/http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archivedate = December 3, 2003 | title = emu | publisher = Internet Archive | author = \u3082\u308a\u3082\u3068 | accessdate =December 3, 2003}}</ref> many felt deceived and turned to criticizing the video's \"illegitimacy\" instead. The knowledge that the video was constructed through tedious and careful selective replaying also raised some questions about the authenticity of video game replays; after all, if it is practically impossible to tell the videos of both kinds apart, one cannot possibly know whether a run was made with or without the use of a special emulator. It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator. Nolan Pflug, the former [[webmaster]] of Speed Demos Archive, has been quoted as saying, \"My basic thought is 'don't like them, haven't made them, don't watch them,'\" when asked for his opinion on the subject.<ref name=\"GamersDividedMTV\"/>\n\nThus, in late 2003, the first public website that served tool-assisted speedrun videos from multiple authors, TASVideos (then known as NESVideos), was created.<ref>{{cite web|title=NESVideos - Backup|url=http://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/backup-nesvideos.html|website=Nintendo Entertainment System \"superplay\" videos}}</ref> It was originally created by Joel \"Bisqwit\" Yliluoma for the purpose of showcasing, sharing, and discussing speedruns made with special emulators\u2014at first, the site only held videos of [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games, in part due to the fact that the only emulator suitable for this specialist purpose was, at that time, the Famtasia NES emulator.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Besides just serving the speedrun recordings in the emulator's original format (which, much like ''Doom'' and ''Quake'' demos, required both the emulator and the game in order to be played back), the site also held <tt>AVI</tt> files, which were made available using the [[BitTorrent|BitTorrent protocol]]. <!-- add info about site's growth-->As of March 2016, it holds over 3,000 complete speedruns.<ref name=\"TASMovieList\">{{cite web |url=http://tasvideos.org/ListAllMovies.html |title= List All Movies |work=tasvideos.org |accessdate=March 25, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Speedrun.com===\n\nIn March 2014, [https://www.speedrun.com/ speedrun.com] was launched.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/23/super-mario-64-speedrun-record-cheese05-puncayshun-interview/|title=The life of an elite 'Super Mario 64' speedrunner|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> On the website, speedrunners can customize speedrunning leaderboards for video games and submit video proof of their runs.

This often takes the form of a [[fan convention]] where runners get together to speedrun video games to raise money for charity, but may also be a purely online event. The most popular speedrun marathons are the biannual [[Games Done Quick]] marathon in the United States. Before the marathons, discussions take place on a forum, and runners submit their game choices. An online schedule is created that will show who is speedrunning, when they are speedrunning, and what game they are speedrunning. Their runs are streamed live at [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and runners often provide commentary throughout the run to give viewers a better understanding of what is going on. Runners who are speedrunning often practice their game in a practice room at the event before their scheduled run as a warm up, or they practice at home beforehand. Speedrun marathons such as the Awesome Games Done Quick 2017 marathon have raised $2,222,934.52 for the [[Prevent Cancer Foundation]].<ref name=\"gdq2016total\">{{cite web|url=https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/donations/agdq2017|title=Donation Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Games Done Quick 2017|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Competitive speedrunning ==\nThe first ever competitive speedrunning tournament was organized by the Global Speedrunning Association called PACE.

He purchased {{convert|155|acre|km2}} of land from her and formed the Aspinwall Land Company in 1890. Pittsburghers, mostly from the upper-middle class, purchased lots from the 60 available home sites. By 1890, the town had 400 residents, most of whom were young couples with children. The existing government of O'Hara Township was having difficulty providing services to the rapidly growing area and, in 1892, 40 residents of the new community signed a petition requesting incorporation as \"The Borough of Aspinwall, a self-governing unit.\"<ref name=\"aspinwallhistory\">{{cite web| url =http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~njm1/asp1.htm| title = History of The Borough of Aspinwall, Pennsylvania | accessdate = 2007-08-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070824095759/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~njm1/asp1.htm| archivedate= August 24, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAspinwall was officially incorporated as a borough on December 28, 1892, from [[O'Hara Township]].<ref name=\"phmc\">{{cite web| url =http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Allegheny.pdf | title = Allegheny County \u2013 2nd Class | accessdate = 2007-08-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070810194157/http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Allegheny.pdf| archivedate= August 10, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAspinwall was served by [[Pittsburgh Railways]] streetcar service ''94 Aspinwall'' from c.1910 until November 12, 1960, when the service was discontinued on the closure of the 62nd Street Sharpsburg Bridge. This was replaced by the [[Senator Robert D. Fleming Bridge]] which did not have streetcar tracks.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.pghbridges.com/pittsburghE/0589-4482/sharpsburg1900.htm\n|title=Sharpsburg Bridge c1900-1962\n|date=December 22, 2008 \n|accessdate=August 14, 2009\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090830180546/http://pghbridges.com/pittsburghE/0589-4482/sharpsburg1900.htm| archivedate= August 30, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1893 to 1905, Aspinwall developed in three phases, beginning with the area closest to the [[Allegheny River]].  On September 25, 1905, a group of Aspinwall residents purchased {{convert|200|acre|km2}} from the Delafield Plan and annexed this additional land to the borough.\n\nEarly recreational facilities in the borough included tennis courts and [[water fountain]]s. During [[World War I]], the Patriots Committee of Aspinwall purchased [[wristwatch]]es from a watch factory in [[Canton, Ohio]], which they presented to the approximately 164 Aspinwall men entering the service. Aspinwall held their own victory parade and memorial service for the soldiers of their borough.<ref name=\"aspinwallhistory\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1900= 1231\n|1910= 2592\n|1920= 3170\n|1930= 4263\n|1940= 4716\n|1950= 4084\n|1960= 3727\n|1970= 3541\n|1980= 3284\n|1990= 2880\n|2000= 2960\n|2010= 2801\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2712\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 2, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1910\">{{cite web|title=Population-Pennsylvania|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/36894832v3ch4.pdf|work=U.S. Census 1910|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1930\">{{cite web|title=Number and Distribution of Inhabitants:Pennsylvania-Tennessee|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch09.pdf|work=Fifteenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Pennsylvania|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/17216604v1p40ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-40.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website|df=mdy }}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019235623/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|archive-date=October 19, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 2,960 people, 1,499 households, and 728 families residing in the borough.

He purchased {{convert|155|acre|km2}} of land from her and formed the Aspinwall Land Company in 1890. Pittsburghers, mostly from the upper-middle class, purchased lots from the 60 available home sites. By 1890, the town had 400 residents, most of whom were young couples with children. The existing government of O'Hara Township was having difficulty providing services to the rapidly growing area and, in 1892, 40 residents of the new community signed a petition requesting incorporation as \"The Borough of Aspinwall, a self-governing unit.\"<ref name=\"aspinwallhistory\">{{cite web| url =http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~njm1/asp1.htm| title = History of The Borough of Aspinwall, Pennsylvania | accessdate = 2007-08-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070824095759/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~njm1/asp1.htm| archivedate= August 24, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAspinwall was officially incorporated as a borough on December 28, 1892, from [[O'Hara Township]].<ref name=\"phmc\">{{cite web| url =http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Allegheny.pdf | title = Allegheny County \u2013 2nd Class | accessdate = 2007-08-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070810194157/http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Allegheny.pdf| archivedate= August 10, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nAspinwall was served by [[Pittsburgh Railways]] streetcar service ''94 Aspinwall'' from c.1910 until November 12, 1960, when the service was discontinued on the closure of the 62nd Street Sharpsburg Bridge. This was replaced by the [[Senator Robert D.

On September 25, 1905, a group of Aspinwall residents purchased {{convert|200|acre|km2}} from the Delafield Plan and annexed this additional land to the borough.\n\nEarly recreational facilities in the borough included tennis courts and [[water fountain]]s. During [[World War I]], the Patriots Committee of Aspinwall purchased [[wristwatch]]es from a watch factory in [[Canton, Ohio]], which they presented to the approximately 164 Aspinwall men entering the service.

The film was created using original footage of the [[First World War]] from the [[Imperial War Museum]]'s archives, most previously unseen, all over 100 years old by the time of release. Audio is from [[BBC]] and Imperial War Museum (IWM) interviews of [[British people|British]] servicemen who fought in the conflict. Most of the footage has been [[Film colorization|colourised]] and transformed with modern production techniques, with the addition of [[sound effect]]s and [[voice acting]] to be more evocative and feel closer to the soldiers' actual experiences.\n\nIt is Jackson's first documentary as director. Jackson, whose grandfather (to whom the film is dedicated) fought in the war, intended for the film to be an immersive experience of \"what it was like to be a soldier\" rather than a story or a recount of events. The crew reviewed 600 hours of interviews from 200 veterans and 100 hours of original film footage to make the film. The title was inspired by the line \"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old\" from the 1914 poem \"[[For the Fallen]]\" by [[Laurence Binyon]], famous for being used in the Ode of Remembrance.\n\n''They Shall Not Grow Old'' premiered simultaneously at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] and in selected cinemas in the UK on 16 October 2018, before airing on [[BBC Two]] on 11 November 2018 (the hundredth anniversary of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]]); it received a limited US release on 17 December. Following its box office success, the film received a wide theatrical release in February 2019 (the film's theatrical release was handled by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]).<ref name=\"VarietyWideRelease\">{{cite web |last1=McNary |first1=Dave |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/peter-jackson-they-shall-not-grow-old-1203095920/ |date=27 December 2018 |title=Film News Roundup: Peter Jackson\u2019s \u2018They Shall Not Grow Old\u2019 Sets Record With $3.4 Million |website=Variety |accessdate=29 December 2018}}</ref> It was acclaimed by critics for its restoration work, immersive atmosphere and portrayal of war, and earned a nomination for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Documentary]].\n''They Shall Not Grow Old'' was also nominated by [[Cinema for Peace]] for the Most Valuable Documentary of 2019.\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was co-commissioned by [[14\u201318 NOW]] and Imperial War Museums in association with the BBC, who approached Jackson in 2015 for the project.<ref name=\"3awInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.3aw.com.au/they-shall-not-grow-old-special-interview-with-director-peter-jackson/|title=They Shall Not Grow Old \u2013 Special interview with director Peter Jackson|website=3aw|date=11 November 2018|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref> According to Jackson, to make the film, the crew of ''They Shall Not Grow Old'' reviewed 600 hours of interviews from the BBC and the IWM and 100 hours of original film footage from the IWM.<ref name=\"WilliamJoke\" /><ref name=\"FlicksIntreview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.flicks.com.au/features/peter-jackson-interview-how-i-made-the-visually-stunning-they-shall-not-grow-old/|title=Peter Jackson interview: how I made the visually stunning They Shall Not Grow Old|website=Flicks|date=10 November 2018|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref> The interviews came from 200 veterans, with the audio from 120 of them being used in the film.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/257545-iwm-peter-jackson-restore-film-footage-they-shall-not-grow-old/page/10/?tab=comments#comment-2778849\n |title=Listing of the oral history contributors |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=30 June 2019 |quote= }}</ref> After receiving the footage, Jackson decided that the film would not feature traditional [[narration]] and that it would instead only feature audio excerpts of the soldiers talking about their war memories, in order to make the film about the soldiers themselves; for the same reason, it barely features any dates or named locations.<ref name=\"FlicksIntreview\" />\n{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote=\"This is not a story of the First World War, it is not a historical story, it may not even be entirely accurate but it's the memories of the men who fought \u2013 they're just giving their impressions of what it was like to be a soldier.\"| source =\u2014[[Peter Jackson]] at the film's premiere.<ref name=\"WilliamJoke\">{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1032449/prince-william-news-peter-jackson-they-shall-not-grow-old-ww1-film|title='You tried to get me in an ORC suit' Prince William jokes with director Peter Jackson|website=[[Daily Express|Express]]|date=16 October 2018|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>|width=33%|align=left}}\nJackson stated: \"We made a decision not to identify the soldiers as the film happened.

The film was created using original footage of the [[First World War]] from the [[Imperial War Museum]]'s archives, most previously unseen, all over 100 years old by the time of release. Audio is from [[BBC]] and Imperial War Museum (IWM) interviews of [[British people|British]] servicemen who fought in the conflict. Most of the footage has been [[Film colorization|colourised]] and transformed with modern production techniques, with the addition of [[sound effect]]s and [[voice acting]] to be more evocative and feel closer to the soldiers' actual experiences.\n\nIt is Jackson's first documentary as director. Jackson, whose grandfather (to whom the film is dedicated) fought in the war, intended for the film to be an immersive experience of \"what it was like to be a soldier\" rather than a story or a recount of events. The crew reviewed 600 hours of interviews from 200 veterans and 100 hours of original film footage to make the film. The title was inspired by the line \"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old\" from the 1914 poem \"[[For the Fallen]]\" by [[Laurence Binyon]], famous for being used in the Ode of Remembrance.\n\n''They Shall Not Grow Old'' premiered simultaneously at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] and in selected cinemas in the UK on 16 October 2018, before airing on [[BBC Two]] on 11 November 2018 (the hundredth anniversary of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]]); it received a limited US release on 17 December. Following its box office success, the film received a wide theatrical release in February 2019 (the film's theatrical release was handled by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]).<ref name=\"VarietyWideRelease\">{{cite web |last1=McNary |first1=Dave |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/peter-jackson-they-shall-not-grow-old-1203095920/ |date=27 December 2018 |title=Film News Roundup: Peter Jackson\u2019s \u2018They Shall Not Grow Old\u2019 Sets Record With $3.4 Million |website=Variety |accessdate=29 December 2018}}</ref> It was acclaimed by critics for its restoration work, immersive atmosphere and portrayal of war, and earned a nomination for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Documentary]].\n''They Shall Not Grow Old'' was also nominated by [[Cinema for Peace]] for the Most Valuable Documentary of 2019\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was co-commissioned by [[14\u201318 NOW]] and Imperial War Museums in association with the BBC, who approached Jackson in 2015 for the project.<ref name=\"3awInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.3aw.com.au/they-shall-not-grow-old-special-interview-with-director-peter-jackson/|title=They Shall Not Grow Old \u2013 Special interview with director Peter Jackson|website=3aw|date=11 November 2018|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref> According to Jackson, to make the film, the crew of ''They Shall Not Grow Old'' reviewed 600 hours of interviews from the BBC and the IWM and 100 hours of original film footage from the IWM.<ref name=\"WilliamJoke\" /><ref name=\"FlicksIntreview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.flicks.com.au/features/peter-jackson-interview-how-i-made-the-visually-stunning-they-shall-not-grow-old/|title=Peter Jackson interview: how I made the visually stunning They Shall Not Grow Old|website=Flicks|date=10 November 2018|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref> The interviews came from 200 veterans, with the audio from 120 of them being used in the film.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/257545-iwm-peter-jackson-restore-film-footage-they-shall-not-grow-old/page/10/?tab=comments#comment-2778849\n |title=Listing of the oral history contributors |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=30 June 2019 |quote= }}</ref> After receiving the footage, Jackson decided that the film would not feature traditional [[narration]] and that it would instead only feature audio excerpts of the soldiers talking about their war memories, in order to make the film about the soldiers themselves; for the same reason, it barely features any dates or named locations.<ref name=\"FlicksIntreview\" />\n{{Quote box|style=padding:10px;|quote=\"This is not a story of the First World War, it is not a historical story, it may not even be entirely accurate but it's the memories of the men who fought \u2013 they're just giving their impressions of what it was like to be a soldier.\"| source =\u2014[[Peter Jackson]] at the film's premiere.<ref name=\"WilliamJoke\">{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1032449/prince-william-news-peter-jackson-they-shall-not-grow-old-ww1-film|title='You tried to get me in an ORC suit' Prince William jokes with director Peter Jackson|website=[[Daily Express|Express]]|date=16 October 2018|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>|width=33%|align=left}}\nJackson stated: \"We made a decision not to identify the soldiers as the film happened.

Rather, it's the film's faces that stick longest in the mind. Through the exhaustive transformation completed by Jackson's team, visages that were all but indistinguishably blurred in the archives take on shape, character and creases of worry, terror and occasional hilarity. In conjunction with the film's intricately stitched narration, its soldiers turn from cold statistics to warm, quivering human beings, drawing us with renewed empathy into a Great War that, they all but unanimously agree, had precious little greatness to it.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/they-shall-not-grow-old-review-peter-jackson-1202981266/ |title=Film Review: 'They Shall Not Grow Old'|first=Guy |last=Lodge |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=16 October 2018|accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nStephen Dalton of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that the film \"suggests new cinematic methods of rescuing history from history books, humanizing and dramatizing true stories with a modest injection of movie-world artifice.
