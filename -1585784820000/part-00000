What Bantu doesn't know is that he's actually the son of a businessman swapped by Valmiki with his own son to give the latter a comfortable life. A violent incident draws Bantu closer to the truth, upon learning which he decides to enter Vaikunthapurram, the home of his real parents and eventually confront those who threaten his family.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on 12 January 2020, coinciding with [[Makar Sankranti|Sankranti]].

Ramachandra falls in love with ARK\u2019s daughter Yasu ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), and becomes rich through his marriage to her in no time while Valmiki remains poor. On the day of the birth of both Valmiki\u2019s and Ramachandra\u2019s children, Ramachandra\u2019s son appears to be dead, so the nurse Sulochana ([[Easwari Rao]]) and Valmiki switch the two boys out. However, when Valmiki takes the child down, the child begins to cry and turns out to be alive. The nurse wants to switch them out again, but Valmiki prevents her from doing it and accidentally pushes her off a ledge. The nurse goes into a coma, while Valmiki gets a leg cramp that makes him limp permanently.\n\nThe boys, Raj Manohar ([[Sushanth]]) and Bantu ([[Allu Arjun]]), are raised in two different worlds. Raj is a slow, silent, young rich boy while Bantu is a smart, outspoken, hard working, middle class man. Valmiki always favors Raj no matter how hard Bantu tries to impress Valmiki. He treats Bantu with hatred and neglect due to his true parentage, even going as far as to cancel his MBA scholarship. On his way to an interview at a travel agency, Bantu\u2019s sister\u2019s scarf is pulled off by Shekhar ([[Navdeep]]). Angry, Bantu follows Shekhar and his friends and thrashes them. Ravindra ([[Rahul Ramakrishna]]) interviews Bantu and reveals that Shekhar is the agency's HR manager. Bantu apologizes to Shekhar and convinces him with his wits, successfully getting a job at the travel agency. On his first day of work, Bantu get infatuated with his boss Amulya ([[Pooja Hegde]]), and stares at her legs on the elevator, without realizing she is the CEO of the travel agency. As a result, Amulya gives Bantu some tough assignments to teach him a lesson. After a trip to Paris together, she begins to reciprocate Bantu\u2019s feelings for her. Meanwhile, Raj returns from abroad, unable to complete his MBA. Ramachandra sends Raj to reject Paidithalli ([[Govind Padmasoorya]]) who wants to buy 50% of ARK\u2019s shares. Ramachandra watches from a hotel where Amulya, Bantu, and Sudarshan ([[Brahmaji]]) have a meeting. Ramachandra is disappointed by Raj\u2019s hesitance and inability to say no to Paidithalli, but is proud of Bantu and Amulya for saying no to Sudarshan, who wanted to buy Amulya\u2019s travel agency. Due to this, ARK fixes an engagement between Raj and Amulya, but Raj was actually in love with his cousin Nandini ([[Nivetha Pethuraj]]).\n\nDue to Bantu\u2019s refusal, Sudarshan files a case against Bantu and Amulya. Amulya finally reveals her feelings for Bantu while reprimanding him for his inability to lie to others. Bantu convinces her to tell Ramachandra the truth-that she is in love with Bantu and does not want to get married to Raj. Appala Naidu ([[Samuthirakani]]), a powerful and influential man, as well as Paidithalli\u2019s father, attempts to kill Ramachandra because of the refusal moments before Amulya and Bantu arrive. Bantu saves Ramachandra and takes him to the hospital. Bantu meets Sulochana, who has come out of her coma, and learns of his true parentage. Angry, Bantu slaps Valmiki and tells him that he knows the truth about his birth. He blackmails Ramachandra\u2019s doctor, Shrinivas ([[Vennela Kishore]]) to enter Vaikuntapuram - Ramachandra's home. ARK is fond of Bantu for saving Ramachandra, fixing his relationship with Yasu, setting Paidathalli straight, and handling other business problems. \n\nDue to all this, ARK throws a huge party in happiness, where Yasu witnesses Bantu and Amulya kissing and reports it to the household. Bantu is kicked out by Valmiki and the engagement is cancelled. Appala Naidu uses this to his advantage, kidnapping Nandu and threatening to kill her unless Ramachandra signs off the shares for Paidithalli. When Valmiki begs Bantu to save Nandu, he refuses, but goes anyway. He thrashes the goons, slams Paidathalli, and stabs Appala Naidu with a kebab skewer. But later, Raj comes and saves Appala Naidu and his henchmen, thus Appala Naidu comes out of his enmity with Ramachandra by seeing Raj's humanity.\n\nWhen Bantu and Valmiki are at Vaikuntapuram, ARK slaps Valmiki and reveals that he heard the conversation between Sulochana and Bantu right before her death. Bantu is able to reunite with his biological father,  Ramachandra, but asks him not to reveal this secret to Yasu, because Yasu is still thinking that Raj is her biological son, if he says the truth, then Yasu will get depressed. However Yasu and Raj hear this conversation and Yasu agrees Bantu as his son and the family decides to give him 50% of the company\u2019s shares. Raj also accepts Valmiki as his father and stay in his house happily for 5 years or more to gain the skills necessary to become the CEO.  Valmiki struggles to accept the fact that Raj feels better suited in a middle class setting, repenting for the mistake he made 25 years ago. The film ends with Bantu going to his office as CEO with his wife Amulya in helicopter which makes Valmiki jealous.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Allu Arjun]] as Bantu / \u201cRaja\u201d as a nurse calls him\n* [[Pooja Hegde]] as Amulya / \u201cAmmu\u201d\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as Yasoda \u201cYasu\u201d Radhakrishna, Bantu's real mother\n* [[Jayaram]] as Ramachandra, Bantu's real father\n* [[Sushanth]] as Raj Manohar \n* [[Navdeep]] as Shekhar\n* [[Nivetha Pethuraj]] as Nandini \u201cNandu\u201d\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as Valmiki, Raj\u2019s real father\n* [[Ananth Babu]] as Pujari/ Pujari\n* [[Rohini]] as Lakshmi, Valmiki\u2019s wife\n* [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Govardhan Prajapati\n* [[Sachin Khedekar]] as Ananth Radhakrishna (ARK), Yasu's father\n* [[Samuthirakani]] as Appala Naidu\n* [[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]] as Sitaram \n* [[Harsha Vardhan]] as Kashiram\n* [[Govind Padmasoorya]] as Paidithalli \n* [[Rahul Ramakrishna]] as K.

What Bantu doesn't know is that he's actually the son of a businessman swapped by Valmiki with his own son to give the latter a comfortable life. A violent incident draws Bantu closer to the truth, upon learning which he decides to enter Vaikunthapurram, the home of his real parents and eventually confront those who threaten his family.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on 12 January 2020, coinciding with [[Makar Sankranti|Sankranti]].

Ramachandra falls in love with ARK\u2019s daughter Yasu ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), and becomes rich through his marriage to her in no time while Valmiki remains poor. On the day of the birth of both Valmiki\u2019s and Ramachandra\u2019s children, Ramachandra\u2019s son appears to be dead, so the nurse Sulochana ([[Easwari Rao]]) and Valmiki switch the two boys out. However, when Valmiki takes the child down, the child begins to cry and turns out to be alive. The nurse wants to switch them out again, but Valmiki prevents her from doing it and accidentally pushes her off a ledge. The nurse goes into a coma, while Valmiki gets a leg cramp that makes him limp permanently.\n\nThe boys, Raj Manohar ([[Sushanth]]) and Bantu ([[Allu Arjun]]), are raised in two different worlds. Raj is a slow, silent, young rich boy while Bantu is a smart, outspoken, hard working, middle class man. Valmiki always favors Raj no matter how hard Bantu tries to impress Valmiki. He treats Bantu with hatred and neglect due to his true parentage, even going as far as to cancel his MBA scholarship. On his way to an interview at a travel agency, Bantu\u2019s sister\u2019s scarf is pulled off by Shekhar ([[Navdeep]]). Angry, Bantu follows Shekhar and his friends and thrashes them. Ravindra ([[Rahul Ramakrishna]]) interviews Bantu and reveals that Shekhar is the agency's HR manager. Bantu apologizes to Shekhar and convinces him with his wits, successfully getting a job at the travel agency. On his first day of work, Bantu get infatuated with his boss Amulya ([[Pooja Hegde]]), and stares at her legs on the elevator, without realizing she is the CEO of the travel agency. As a result, Amulya gives Bantu some tough assignments to teach him a lesson. After a trip to Paris together, she begins to reciprocate Bantu\u2019s feelings for her. Meanwhile, Raj returns from abroad, unable to complete his MBA. Ramachandra sends Raj to reject Paidithalli ([[Govind Padmasoorya]]) who wants to buy 50% of ARK\u2019s shares. Ramachandra watches from a hotel where Amulya, Bantu, and Sudarshan ([[Brahmaji]]) have a meeting. Ramachandra is disappointed by Raj\u2019s hesitance and inability to say no to Paidithalli, but is proud of Bantu and Amulya for saying no to Sudarshan, who wanted to buy Amulya\u2019s travel agency. Due to this, ARK fixes an engagement between Raj and Amulya, but Raj was actually in love with his cousin Nandini ([[Nivetha Pethuraj]]).\n\nDue to Bantu\u2019s refusal, Sudarshan files a case against Bantu and Amulya. Amulya finally reveals her feelings for Bantu while reprimanding him for his inability to lie to others. Bantu convinces her to tell Ramachandra the truth-that she is in love with Bantu and does not want to get married to Raj. Appala Naidu ([[Samuthirakani]]), a powerful and influential man, as well as Paidithalli\u2019s father, attempts to kill Ramachandra because of the refusal moments before Amulya and Bantu arrive. Bantu saves Ramachandra and takes him to the hospital. Bantu meets Sulochana, who has come out of her coma, and learns of his true parentage. Angry, Bantu slaps Valmiki and tells him that he knows the truth about his birth. He blackmails Ramachandra\u2019s doctor, Shrinivas ([[Vennela Kishore]]) to enter Vaikuntapuram - Ramachandra's home. ARK is fond of Bantu for saving Ramachandra, fixing his relationship with Yasu, setting Paidathalli straight, and handling other business problems. \n\nDue to all this, ARK throws a huge party in happiness, where Yasu witnesses Bantu and Amulya kissing and reports it to the household. Bantu is kicked out by Valmiki and the engagement is cancelled. Appala Naidu uses this to his advantage, kidnapping Nandu and threatening to kill her unless Ramachandra signs off the shares for Paidithalli. When Valmiki begs Bantu to save Nandu, he refuses, but goes anyway. He thrashes the goons, slams Paidathalli, and stabs Appala Naidu with a kebab skewer. But later, Raj comes and saves Appala Naidu and his henchmen, thus Appala Naidu comes out of his enmity with Ramachandra by seeing Raj's humanity.\n\nWhen Bantu and Valmiki are at Vaikuntapuram, ARK slaps Valmiki and reveals that he heard the conversation between Sulochana and Bantu right before her death. Bantu is able to reunite with his biological father,  Ramachandra, but asks him not to reveal this secret to Yasu, because Yasu is still thinking that Raj is her biological son, if he says the truth, then Yasu will get depressed. However Yasu and Raj hear this conversation and Yasu agrees Bantu as his son and the family decides to give him 50% of the company\u2019s shares. Raj also accepts Valmiki as his father and stay in his house happily for 5 years or more to gain the skills necessary to become the CEO.  Valmiki struggles to accept the fact that Raj feels better suited in a middle class setting, repenting for the mistake he made 25 years ago. The film ends with Bantu going to his office as CEO with his wife Amulya in helicopter which makes Valmiki jealous.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Allu Arjun]] as Bantu / \u201cRaja\u201d as a nurse calls him\n* [[Pooja Hegde]] as Amulya / \u201cAmmu\u201d\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as Yasoda \u201cYasu\u201d Radhakrishna, Bantu's real mother\n* [[Jayaram]] as Ramachandra, Bantu's real father\n* [[Sushanth]] as Raj Manohar \n* [[Navdeep]] as Shekhar\n* [[Nivetha Pethuraj]] as Nandini \u201cNandu\u201d\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as Valmiki, Raj\u2019s real father\n* [[Ananth Babu]] as Pujari/ Pujari\n* [[Rohini]] as Lakshmi, Valmiki\u2019s wife\n* [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Govardhan Prajapati\n* [[Sachin Khedekar]] as Ananth Radhakrishna (ARK), Yasu's father\n* [[Samuthirakani]] as Appala Naidu\n* [[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]] as Sitaram \n* [[Harsha Vardhan]] as Kashiram\n* [[Govind Padmasoorya]] as Paidithalli \n* [[Rahul Ramakrishna]] as K.

He makes fun of religious activities around him and one such day, a low-intensity earthquake hits the city, and Kanji's shop is the only shop that is destroyed. His family and friends blame this on his atheism.\n\nAt the insurance office, Kanji learns that the disaster claim does not cover any damage caused by natural calamities classified under \"[[Act of God]]\". Running out of options, he decides to sue God but fails to find a lawyer for such a lawsuit. Hanif Qureshi ([[Om Puri]]), a poor Muslim lawyer, helps him file the case after Kanji decides to fight on his own. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as to religious priests, Siddheshwar Maharaj, Gopi Maiyya, and their group's founder, Leeladhar Swamy ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]), summoning them to court as representatives of God.\n\nAs the court case commences and gains traction for its bizarre quality, Kanji finds himself facing armed fundamentalists and harassment, with his mortgage bank occupying the house, and his wife and kids leaving him. He is rescued from all of this by Krishna Vasudev Yadav ([[Akshay Kumar]]), who claims to be a real estate agent originally from [[Gokul]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], but appears to do fantastical tricks not possible for a human.\n\nThe lawsuit causes a public outcry. On Krishna's advice, Kanji goes to the media and gets wide coverage. Many people in a similar situation join him in the lawsuit, causing the amount of claims to skyrocket and [[Catholicism|Catholic]] priests and Muslim [[Mullah]]s to also be summoned as defendants. When the court demands written proof that the earthquake was an 'Act of God,' Krishna steers Kanji toward holy books like [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[The Quran]] and [[The Bible]]. Kanji reads them and finds a passage in each that says the world and all that happen in it, from beginning to end, is a creation of God and comes from God's will alone. This strengthens his case and increases public support. However, Kanji suffers a stroke in court and is rushed to the hospital where he goes into a coma and is paralyzed. When he opens his eyes after a month, he finds Krishna, who reveals that he is God, and proves it by curing Kanji completely. He further reveals that He created the entire world, animals and humans but not any religion, and he was the one who destroyed Kanji's shop because he wanted to punish the godmen who showed his fear to public, to earn money when in fact, He wants his creations to love him. He figured out that Kanji would end up exposing them if he destroys his Shop. \n\nKanji learns that the lawsuit's verdict was in his favor and religious organizations were ordered by court to pay the compensation to all the plaintiffs; people have begun revering Kanji himself as a god. Leeladhar, Gopi Maiyya, and Siddheshwar have taken advantage of this by opening a temple dedicated to Kanji and accumulating millions in donations. Krishna explains to Kanji that his job as God is to show people right and wrong - people do with it what they will. Kanji decides to fight back. He breaks his own statue, admonishing the crowd about trusting in God-men. He advises them to search for God in themselves and in others, not in statues; that God is everywhere, not just in temples, and faith should come from within. He tells them not to believe in fraudulent God-men, as their job is to turn religion into business.\n\nKrishna looks on proudly as Kanji speaks, then vanishes when Kanji tries to reach him after. Kanji is reunited with his family and sees Krishna's key chain on the ground. When he is about to keep it, he hears Krishna's voice, telling him to get rid of the key chain as fear of God and reliance on religious objects was what he'd fought against all this time. Kanji smiles and throws it away, watching as it disappears in the sky with a flash.<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/549384|title=OMG Oh My God!

He makes fun of religious activities around him and one such day, a low-intensity earthquake hits the city, and Kanji's shop is the only shop that is destroyed. His family and friends blame this on his atheism.\n\nAt the insurance office, Kanji learns that the disaster claim does not cover any damage caused by natural calamities classified under \"[[Act of God]]\". Running out of options, he decides to sue God but fails to find a lawyer for such a lawsuit. Hanif Qureshi ([[Om Puri]]), a poor Muslim lawyer, helps him file the case after Kanji decides to fight on his own. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as to religious priests, Siddheshwar Maharaj, Gopi Maiyya, and their group's founder, Leeladhar Swamy ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]), summoning them to court as representatives of God.\n\nAs the court case commences and gains traction for its bizarre quality, Kanji finds himself facing armed fundamentalists and harassment, with his mortgage bank occupying the house, and his wife and kids leaving him. He is rescued from all of this by Krishna Vasudev Yadav ([[Akshay Kumar]]), who claims to be a real estate agent originally from [[Gokul]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], but appears to do fantastical tricks not possible for a human.\n\nThe lawsuit causes a public outcry. On Krishna's advice, Kanji goes to the media and gets wide coverage. Many people in a similar situation join him in the lawsuit, causing the amount of claims to skyrocket and [[Catholicism|Catholic]] priests and Muslim [[Mullah]]s to also be summoned as defendants. When the court demands written proof that the earthquake was an 'Act of God,' Krishna steers Kanji toward holy books like [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[The Quran]] and [[The Bible]]. Kanji reads them and finds a passage in each that says the world and all that happen in it, from beginning to end, is a creation of God and comes from God's will alone. This strengthens his case and increases public support. However, Kanji suffers a stroke in court and is rushed to the hospital where he goes into a coma and is paralyzed. When he opens his eyes after a month, he finds Krishna, who reveals that he is God, and proves it by curing Kanji completely. He further reveals that He created the entire world, animals and humans but not any religion, and he was the one who destroyed Kanji's shop because he wanted to punish the godmen who showed his fear to public, to earn money when in fact, He wants his creations to love him. He figured out that Kanji would end up exposing them if he destroys his Shop. \n\nKanji learns that the lawsuit's verdict was in his favor and religious organizations were ordered by court to pay the compensation to all the plaintiffs; people have begun revering Kanji himself as a god. Leeladhar, Gopi Maiyya, and Siddheshwar have taken advantage of this by opening a temple dedicated to Kanji and accumulating millions in donations. Krishna explains to Kanji that his job as God is to show people right and wrong - people do with it what they will. Kanji decides to fight back. He breaks his own statue, admonishing the crowd about trusting in God-men. He advises them to search for God in themselves and in others, not in statues; that God is everywhere, not just in temples, and faith should come from within. He tells them not to believe in fraudulent God-men, as their job is to turn religion into business.\n\nKrishna looks on proudly as Kanji speaks, then vanishes when Kanji tries to reach him after. Kanji is reunited with his family and sees Krishna's key chain on the ground. When he is about to keep it, he hears Krishna's voice, telling him to get rid of the key chain as fear of God and reliance on religious objects was what he'd fought against all this time. Kanji smiles and throws it away, watching as it disappears in the sky with a flash.<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/549384|title=OMG Oh My God!

The MoM (Mars Orbiter Mission) is thought of as an impossible mission by his coworkers due its aim of reaching [[Mars]] with its tight budget.\n\nRakesh learns that MoM cannot take off on the [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle|PSLV]] since the available technology has a payload of only 1500&nbsp;kg and not enough fuel to fire the rocket to be carried to a distance of almost 5.5*10^7 [[kilometres]]. [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle|GSLV]], if it had succeeded, could have taken the satellite to Mars as it had a payload of 2300&nbsp;kg. However, recent significant failures of GSLV have jeopardised the planned future missions.\n\nBack at home, Tara is badly caught in between balancing her career and her family. One day at home, while frying 'Puris', Tara's maid informs of insufficient gas to cook all the 'Puris', to which Tara tells her to heat the oil and turn off the gas, and turn it back on if oil cools down, which sparks her an idea to launch the MoM using PSLV. They would use bursts of gas to push the MoM satellite further into Earth's outside orbit, and then slingshot it using Earth's gravitational sphere, successfully saving fuel. She approaches Rakesh with the idea, who is convinced. The duo tries to get the other team members on board, but instead are mocked, though they later are convinced too along with Director of ISRO. When Tara and Rakesh ask Rupert to lend them expert members of his team, Rupert instead gives them junior scientists and engineers, who have little to no experience in mission launches.\n\nFirst, there is Eka Gandhi, propulsion control expert, a youngster that hates most Indian things and looking for any chance to get away to [[NASA]]. Then there is the spacecraft autonomy designer Neha Siddiqui, who is struggling with rejection as a result of her intercommunal background. Navigation expert Krittika Agarwal is a devoted wife tending to her ex-serviceman husband Rishi Agarwal, who was severely wounded in action. Varsha Pillai, the satellite designer and payload expert, battles with her mother-in-law's taunts at home for not being able to bear a child. Parmeshwar Joshi, payload expert, relies more on the priest and his advice to and develops a romantic interest in Eka. Lastly, there is Ananth  Iyenger, the team's structural engineer.\n\nHowever, after the announcement of India's second Moon mission, [[Chandrayaan-2]], the mission's budget is cut by 50%. In between the tight schedule and minuscule budget, Tara and Rakesh continue to work on their MoM project by making several compromises. Tara and Rakesh realise that the junior scientists working on the project have low morale and motivation to make this mission happen, leading to the team slowing down. Tara soon realises that in order to meet their budget and schedule, she must make the team members change their attitudes, and motivate them to make their dream jobs into a reality. She is successful with this, and the team puts all their hardwork and energy into solving the issues with the mission, and making it happen.\n\nThe MoM satellite is finally launched on PSLV on 5 November 2013(after an 8-day delay due to weather), and is named Mangalyaan ([[Sanskrit]]: Mars-Craft) and is successfully inserted into Earth's orbit. Rakesh and his team celebrates the successful launch. However, while doing the sixth orbit-raising manoeuvre, the jets fail to launch, pushing the mission 6 days behind. Rupert mocks the team, while Tara continues to keep hope that something will happen.

He runs a barber shop in London with his brothers Roy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]) and Max ([[Bobby Deol]]). The three brothers had misplaced a bag of 5 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] which belonged to gangster Michael Bhai. His henchman Big Bhai ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) constantly demands the money. To fulfil this demand, the three brothers get engaged to the three daughters of London's rich business tycoon Thakral ([[Ranjeet]]): Harry is dating Pooja ([[Pooja Hegde]]), Roy is dating Neha ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]) and Max is dating Kriti ([[Kriti Sanon]]). Mysterious circumstances cause the destination wedding to take place in Sitamgarh, India. On arriving in Sitamgarh, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a bellboy at their hotel, recognises them as reincarnations of people that lived 600 years ago, i.e. in 1419. Harry realises that the flashes he sees have something to do with what Pasta was talking about. To meet him, Harry drives to the nearby town of [[Madhavgarh]] where he starts to see the flashes clearly.\n\nIn 1419, Rajkumar Bala Dev Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]) of Madhavgarh was banished by his father, Maharaj Parikshitap ([[Parikshit Sahni]]), since Bala tried to kill him to become King. Bala's servant Pehla Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]) informs him of Sitamgarh - a nearby kingdom whose King, Maharaj Surya Singh Rana ([[Ranjeet]]), is looking for grooms for his three daughters: Rajkumari Madhu ([[Kriti Sanon]]), Rajkumari Mala ([[Pooja Hegde]]) and Rajkumari Meena ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]). Bala plans to marry Rajkumari Madhu, the eldest Princess, so that he becomes the Maharaj of Sitamgarh.\n\nBala meets Bangdu Maharaj ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), an effeminate dance teacher who has an affair with Mala. Meena is secretly in love with the brave bodyguard of the three princesses, Dharamputra ([[Bobby Deol]]). Bala helps the two couples get together and enlists their help for uniting him with Madhu. The plan works and Maharaj Surya Singh Rana announces the wedding of Madhu with Bala, Mala with Bangdu, and Meena with Dharamputra. However, Suryabhan ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), Surya Singh Rana's nephew, wants the throne for himself. He kills the brother of Sitamgarh's enemy clan's leader, Gama ([[Rana Daggubati]]) and frames the three couples for it. On the day of the wedding, Gama storms into the palace and fights them to avenge his brother. During the fight, Bala realises that he now truly loves Madhu, even though initially she was just the path to the throne for him. During the fight, the wedding [[Mandapa|mandap]] (altar) collapses and kills the three couples along with Gama.\n\nBack in the present, Harry realises that the grooms are set to marry the wrong brides. Pasta helps Harry remind Roy and Max of their lives as Bangdu Maharaj and Dharamputra, respectively. Just then, they are introduced to Pappu Rangeela ([[Rana Daggubati]]), a [[qawwali]] singer and the brother of the girls. He is the reincarnation of Gama but has no recollection of his past life. Meanwhile, Pasta finds a painting of their past lives' wedding day which shows Bala with Madhu, Bangdu with Mala, and Dharamputra with Meena. Before they can show this painting to the girls to remind them of their past lives, it gets in the hands of Pappu Rangeela and he remembers his life as Gama.\n\nPappu crashes the wedding and a fight plays out. The fight makes Pooja and Neha remember everything. Soon, Michael Bhai ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), now revealed to be the reincarnation of Suryabhan, shows up at the wedding for his money and shoots Gama. Kriti remembers everything when she sees Michael Bhai and also reveals that the wedding mandap hadn't collapsed on its own - it was broken down by Suryabhan to kill everyone so that he could be the Maharaj of Sitamgarh. Michael Bhai recounts his past life and boasts how he got Gama's brother killed. Pappu Rangeela hears this and pushes Michael Bhai into the collapsing mandap, thus getting his revenge.\n\nThe film ends on a happy note with Harry marrying Kriti, Roy marrying Pooja and Max marrying Neha, thus completing their 600-year-old love story.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Harshit \"Harry\" Sinha / Rajkumar Bala Dev Singh:<br>Harry is a barber who forgets things that just happened when he hears a loud noise.

He runs a barber shop in London with his brothers Roy ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]) and Max ([[Bobby Deol]]). The three brothers had misplaced a bag of 5 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] which belonged to gangster Michael Bhai. His henchman Big Bhai ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) constantly demands the money. To fulfil this demand, the three brothers get engaged to the three daughters of London's rich business tycoon Thakral ([[Ranjeet]]): Harry is dating Pooja ([[Pooja Hegde]]), Roy is dating Neha ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]) and Max is dating Kriti ([[Kriti Sanon]]). Mysterious circumstances cause the destination wedding to take place in Sitamgarh, India. On arriving in Sitamgarh, Aakhri Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]), a bellboy at their hotel, recognises them as reincarnations of people that lived 600 years ago, i.e. in 1419. Harry realises that the flashes he sees have something to do with what Pasta was talking about. To meet him, Harry drives to the nearby town of [[Madhavgarh]] where he starts to see the flashes clearly.\n\nIn 1419, Rajkumar Bala Dev Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]) of Madhavgarh was banished by his father, Maharaj Parikshitap ([[Parikshit Sahni]]), since Bala tried to kill him to become King. Bala's servant Pehla Pasta ([[Chunky Pandey]]) informs him of Sitamgarh - a nearby kingdom whose King, Maharaj Surya Singh Rana ([[Ranjeet]]), is looking for grooms for his three daughters: Rajkumari Madhu ([[Kriti Sanon]]), Rajkumari Mala ([[Pooja Hegde]]) and Rajkumari Meena ([[Kriti Kharbanda]]). Bala plans to marry Rajkumari Madhu, the eldest Princess, so that he becomes the Maharaj of Sitamgarh.\n\nBala meets Bangdu Maharaj ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), an effeminate dance teacher who has an affair with Mala. Meena is secretly in love with the brave bodyguard of the three princesses, Dharamputra ([[Bobby Deol]]). Bala helps the two couples get together and enlists their help for uniting him with Madhu. The plan works and Maharaj Surya Singh Rana announces the wedding of Madhu with Bala, Mala with Bangdu, and Meena with Dharamputra. However, Suryabhan ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), Surya Singh Rana's nephew, wants the throne for himself. He kills the brother of Sitamgarh's enemy clan's leader, Gama ([[Rana Daggubati]]) and frames the three couples for it. On the day of the wedding, Gama storms into the palace and fights them to avenge his brother. During the fight, Bala realises that he now truly loves Madhu, even though initially she was just the path to the throne for him. During the fight, the wedding [[Mandapa|mandap]] (altar) collapses and kills the three couples along with Gama.\n\nBack in the present, Harry realises that the grooms are set to marry the wrong brides. Pasta helps Harry remind Roy and Max of their lives as Bangdu Maharaj and Dharamputra, respectively. Just then, they are introduced to Pappu Rangeela ([[Rana Daggubati]]), a [[qawwali]] singer and the brother of the girls. He is the reincarnation of Gama but has no recollection of his past life. Meanwhile, Pasta finds a painting of their past lives' wedding day which shows Bala with Madhu, Bangdu with Mala, and Dharamputra with Meena. Before they can show this painting to the girls to remind them of their past lives, it gets in the hands of Pappu Rangeela and he remembers his life as Gama.\n\nPappu crashes the wedding and a fight plays out. The fight makes Pooja and Neha remember everything. Soon, Michael Bhai ([[Sharad Kelkar]]), now revealed to be the reincarnation of Suryabhan, shows up at the wedding for his money and shoots Gama. Kriti remembers everything when she sees Michael Bhai and also reveals that the wedding mandap hadn't collapsed on its own - it was broken down by Suryabhan to kill everyone so that he could be the Maharaj of Sitamgarh. Michael Bhai recounts his past life and boasts how he got Gama's brother killed. Pappu Rangeela hears this and pushes Michael Bhai into the collapsing mandap, thus getting his revenge.\n\nThe film ends on a happy note with Harry marrying Kriti, Roy marrying Pooja and Max marrying Neha, thus completing their 600-year-old love story.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Harshit \"Harry\" Sinha / Rajkumar Bala Dev Singh:<br>Harry is a barber who forgets things that just happened when he hears a loud noise.

It was conducted at [[Stanford University]] on the days of August 14\u201320, 1971, by a research group led by psychology professor [[Philip Zimbardo]] using college students.<ref>https://www.newsweek.com/stanford-prison-experiment-age-justice-reform-359247</ref> In the study, volunteers were assigned to be either \"guards\" or \"prisoners\" by the flip of a coin, in a mock prison, with Zimbardo himself serving as the [[superintendent (jail)|superintendent]]. Several \"prisoners\" left mid-experiment, and the whole experiment was abandoned after six days. Early reports on experimental results claimed that students quickly embraced their assigned roles, with some guards enforcing [[Authoritarian personality|authoritarian]] measures and ultimately subjecting some prisoners to [[psychological torture]], while many prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse and, by the officers' request, actively harassed other prisoners who tried to stop it. The experiment has been described in many introductory social psychology textbooks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psypost.org/2014/09/intro-psychology-textbooks-gloss-criticisms-zimbardos-stanford-prison-experiment-27970|title=Intro to psychology textbooks gloss over criticisms of Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment|date=September 7, 2014|publisher=}}</ref> although some have chosen to exclude it because its methodology is sometimes questioned.<ref>{{cite news |title=Psychology Itself Is Under Scrutiny |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/health/psychology-studies-stanford-prison.html? |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Office of Naval Research|U.S. Office of Naval Research]]<ref>[http://www.prisonexp.org/faq.htm FAQ on official site] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120909193121/http://www.prisonexp.org/faq.htm |date=September 9, 2012 }}</ref> funded the experiment as an investigation into the causes of difficulties between guards and prisoners in the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]].

Critics also noted that some of the participants behaved in a way that would help the study, so that, as one \"guard\" later put it, \"the researchers would have something to work with,\" which is known as [[demand characteristics]]. Variants of the experiment have been performed by other researchers, but none of these attempts have replicated the results of the SPE.\n\n== Zimbardo's goals==\nThe (archived) official website of the Stanford Prison Experiment describes the experiment goal as follows:\n\n<blockquote>We wanted to see what the psychological effects were of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. To do this, we decided to set up a simulated prison and then carefully note the effects of this institution on the behavior of all those within its walls.<ref name=\"ArchivedOfficial\"/></blockquote>\n\nA 1997 article from the Stanford News Service described experiment goals in a more detailed way:\n\n<blockquote>Zimbardo's primary reason for conducting the experiment was to focus on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity and situational validation of behavior that generally would repulse ordinary individuals. \"I had been conducting research for some years on deindividuation, vandalism and dehumanization that illustrated the ease with which ordinary people could be led to engage in anti-social acts by putting them in situations where they felt anonymous, or they could perceive of others in ways that made them less than human, as enemies or objects,\" Zimbardo told the Toronto symposium in the summer of 1996.<ref name=\"spespa\">{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html|title=The Stanford Prison Experiment: Still powerful after all these years (1/97)|date=1996-08-12|publisher=News.stanford.edu|accessdate=2018-07-12|quote=In the prison-conscious autumn of 1971, when George Jackson was killed at San Quentin and Attica erupted in even more deadly rebellion and retribution, the Stanford Prison Experiment made news in a big way.

The prison had two fabricated walls, one at the entrance, and one at the cell wall to block observation. Each cell (6 \u00d7 9 feet, or 1.8 \u00d7 2.7 m), contained only a cot for the prisoners.<ref name=\":1\" /> In contrast, the guards lived in a very different environment, separated from the prisoners. They were given rest and relaxation areas, and other comforts.\n\nTwelve of the twenty-four participants were assigned the role of prisoner (nine plus three potential substitutes), while the other twelve were assigned the role of guard (also nine plus three potential substitutes). Zimbardo took on the role of the superintendent and an undergraduate [[research assistant]] took on the role of the warden. Zimbardo designed the experiment in order to induce [[disorientation]], [[depersonalization]], and [[deindividuation]] in the participants.\n\nThe researchers held an orientation session for the guards the day before the experiment, during which guards were instructed not to harm the prisoners physically or withhold food or drink. In the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=760lwYmpXbc footage] of the study, Zimbardo can be seen talking to the guards: \"You can create in the prisoners feelings of boredom, a sense of fear to some degree, you can create a notion of arbitrariness that their life is totally controlled by us, by the system, you, me, and they'll have no privacy ... We're going to take away their individuality in various ways. In general what all this leads to is a sense of powerlessness.

Prisoners wore uncomfortable, ill-fitting smocks and stocking caps, as well as a chain around one ankle. Guards were instructed to call prisoners by their assigned numbers, sewn on their uniforms, instead of by name.\n\nThe prisoners were \"arrested\" at their homes and \"charged\" with armed robbery. The local [[Palo Alto]] police department assisted Zimbardo with the simulated arrests and conducted full booking procedures on the prisoners, which included [[fingerprint]]ing and taking [[mug shot]]s. The prisoners were transported to the mock prison from the police station, where they were [[strip search]]ed and given their new identities.\n\nThe small mock prison cells were set up to hold three prisoners each. There was a small corridor for the prison yard, a closet for solitary confinement, and a bigger room across from the prisoners for the guards and warden. The prisoners were to stay in their cells and the yard all day and night until the end of the study. The guards worked in teams of three for eight-hour shifts. The guards were not required to stay on site after their shift.\n\nGuards had differing responses to their new roles.

Guards from other shifts volunteered to work extra hours, to assist in subduing the revolt, and subsequently attacked the prisoners with [[fire extinguisher]]s without being supervised by the research staff. Finding that handling nine cell mates with only three guards per shift was challenging, one of the guards suggested they use psychological tactics to control them. They set up a \"privilege cell\" in which prisoners who were not involved in the riot were treated with special rewards, such as higher quality meals. The \"privileged\" inmates chose not to eat the meal in commiseration with their fellow prisoners.\n\nAfter only 35 hours, one prisoner began to act \"crazy\", as Zimbardo described: \"#8612 then began to act crazy, to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control. It took quite a while before we became convinced that he was really suffering and that we had to release him.\" \nGuards forced the prisoners to repeat their assigned numbers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/11 |website=The Stanford Prison Experiment |title=Slide tour}}</ref> to reinforce the idea that this was their new identity. Guards soon used these prisoner counts to harass the prisoners, using physical punishment such as protracted exercise for errors in the prisoner count. Sanitary conditions declined rapidly, exacerbated by the guards' refusal to allow some prisoners to urinate or defecate anywhere but in a bucket placed in their cell. As punishment, the guards would not let the prisoners empty the sanitation bucket. Mattresses were a valued item in the prison, so the guards would punish prisoners by removing their mattresses, leaving them to sleep on concrete. Some prisoners were forced to be naked as a method of degradation. Several guards became increasingly cruel as the experiment continued; experimenters reported that approximately one-third of the guards exhibited genuine sadistic tendencies. Most of the guards were upset when the experiment was halted after only six days.\n\nZimbardo mentions his own absorption in the experiment. On the fourth day, some of the guards stated they heard a rumor that the released prisoner was going to come back with his friends and free the remaining inmates. Zimbardo and the guards disassembled the prison and moved it onto a different floor of the building. Zimbardo himself waited in the basement, in case the released prisoner showed up, and planned to tell him that the experiment had been terminated. The released prisoner never returned, and the prison was rebuilt in the basement.\n\nZimbardo argued that the prisoners had [[internalization|internalized]] their roles, since some had stated they would accept \"parole\" even if it would mean forfeiting their pay, despite the fact that quitting would have achieved the same result without the delay involved in waiting for their parole requests to be granted or denied.<ref name=\"Zimbardo, P.G. 2007\">{{cite book|author=Zimbardo, P.G. |date=2007|title=The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil|url=https://archive.org/details/lucifereffectund00zimb |url-access=registration |location= New York|publisher= Random House}}</ref> Zimbardo argued they had no reason for continued participation in the experiment after having lost all monetary compensation, yet they did, because they had internalized the prisoner identity.\n\nPrisoner No. 416, a newly admitted stand-by prisoner, expressed concern about the treatment of the other prisoners. The guards responded with more abuse. When he refused to eat his sausages, saying he was on a [[hunger strike]], guards confined him to \"[[solitary confinement]]\", a dark closet: \"the guards then instructed the other prisoners to repeatedly punch on the door while shouting at 416.\"<ref name = \"Lucifer\">{{cite web|url= http://www.lucifereffect.com |title=The Lucifer Effect|website=lucifereffect.com}}</ref> The guards said he would be released from solitary confinement only if the prisoners gave up their blankets and slept on their bare mattresses, which all but one refused to do.\n\nZimbardo aborted the experiment early when [[Christina Maslach]], a graduate student in psychology whom he was dating (and later married),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html |website=Stanford University News Service |title= The Standard Prison Experiment}}</ref> objected to the conditions of the prison after she was introduced to the experiment to conduct interviews. Zimbardo noted that, of more than 50 people who had observed the experiment, Maslach was the only one who questioned its morality. After only six days of a planned two weeks' duration, the experiment was discontinued.<ref name=\"Zimbardo, P.G. 2007\"/>\n\n== Conclusions ==\nOn August 20, 1971, Zimbardo announced the end of the experiment to the participants.\n\nAccording to Zimbardo's interpretation of the SPE, it demonstrated that the simulated-prison situation, rather than individual [[personality psychology|personality traits]], caused the participants' behavior. Using this [[Attribution theory|situational attribution]], the results are compatible with those of the [[Milgram experiment]], where random participants complied with orders to administer seemingly dangerous and potentially lethal [[electric shock]]s to a [[shill]].<ref name=\"NewYorker\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/the-real-lesson-of-the-stanford-prison-experiment |title=The Real Lesson of the Stanford Prison Experiment |last= Konnikova |first= Konnikova |work= New Yorker |quote=Occasionally, disputes between prisoner and guards got out of hand, violating an explicit injunction against physical force that both prisoners and guards had read prior to enrolling in the study.

In his summary, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I hereby assert that none of these criticisms present any substantial evidence that alters the SPE's main conclusion concerning the importance of understanding how systemic and situational forces can operate to influence individual behavior in negative or positive directions, often without our personal awareness. The SPE's core message is not that a psychological simulation of prison life is the same as the real thing, or that prisoners and guards always or even usually behave the way that they did in the SPE. Rather, the SPE serves as a cautionary tale of what might happen to any of us if we underestimate the extent to which the power of social roles and external pressures can influence our actions.<ref name=\"zimbardo response\">[http://www.prisonexp.org/response Philip Zimbardo\u2019s Response To Recent Criticisms of the Stanford Prison Experiment], Stanford Prison Experiment website</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn turn, Le Texier published a peer-reviewed article which used videos, recordings, and notes from the experiment in Stanford University Archives to argue \nthat \"The guards knew what results the experiment was supposed to produce ... far from reacting spontaneously to this pathogenic social environment, the guards were given clear instructions for how to create it ... the experimenters intervened directly in the experiment, either to give precise instructions, to recall the purposes of the experiment, or to set a general direction ... in order to get their full participation, Zimbardo intended to make the guards believe that they were his research assistants.\".<ref>Thibault Le Texier, \"Debunking the Stanford Prison Experiment.\" American Psychologist, Vol 74(7), Oct 2019, 823-839dx.doi.org/10.1037/amp0000401</ref> Since this English-language publication, the debate has returned to the media in the United States.<ref>Rationally Speaking Episodes 241 - Thibault Le Texier on \"Debunking the Stanford Prison Experiment http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-241-thibault-le-texier-on-debunking-the-stanford-prison-e.html</ref>\n\n===Treatment of \"prisoners\"===\nSome of the guards' behavior allegedly led to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. According to Zimbardo's report, one third of the guards were judged to have exhibited \"genuine sadistic tendencies\", while many prisoners were emotionally traumatized, and three of them had to be removed from the experiment early. Zimbardo concluded that both prisoners and guards had become deeply absorbed in their roles and realized that he had likewise become as deeply absorbed in his own, and he terminated the experiment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-31.htm |website=Stanford Prison Experiment |title= Conclusion}}</ref>\n\nEthical concerns surrounding the experiment often draw comparisons to a [[Milgram experiment|similar experiment]], conducted ten years earlier in 1961 at [[Yale University]] by [[Stanley Milgram]].<ref name=NewYorker/>\n\nWith the treatment that the guards were given to the prisoners, the guards would become so deeply absorbed into their role as a guard that they would emotionally, physically and mentally humiliate the prisoners:\n\n\"Each prisoner was systematically searched and stripped naked. He was then deloused with a spray, to convey our belief that he may have germs or lice[...] Real male prisoners don't wear dresses, but real male prisoners do feel humiliated and do feel emasculated. Our goal was to produce similar effects quickly by putting men in a dress without any underclothes. Indeed, as soon as some of our prisoners were put in these uniforms they began to walk and to sit differently, and to hold themselves differently \u2013 more like a woman than like a man.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prisonexp.org/arrival|title=3.

These participants were stripped from their identity of who they are from the outside world, were given ID numbers and were referred to as so.\n\n===Reliance on anecdotal evidence===\nBecause of the nature of the experiment, Zimbardo found it impossible to keep traditional [[scientific control]]s in place. He was unable to remain a [[Observation|neutral observer]], since he influenced the direction of the experiment as the prison's superintendent. Conclusions and observations drawn by the experimenters were largely [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]], and the experiment is practically impossible for other researchers to accurately [[reproducibility|reproduce]]. [[Erich Fromm]] claimed to see generalizations in the experiment's results and argued that the personality of an individual does affect behavior when imprisoned. This ran counter to the study's conclusion that the prison situation itself controls the individual's behavior. Fromm also argued that the amount of sadism in the \"normal\" subjects could not be determined with the methods employed to screen them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ahrp.org/1971-stanford-prison-experiment-conducted-by-philip-zimbardo-was-an-exercise-that-unleashed-unprovoked-violence-and-a-predilection-for-abuse-bordering-on-torture/|title=1971: Philip Zimbardo, Stanford Prison Experiment - precursor for Abu Ghraib torture. - AHRP|date=December 28, 2014|work=AHRP|access-date=March 31, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Griggs|first=Richard A.|date=July 13, 2014|title=Coverage of the Stanford Prison Experiment in Introductory Psychology Textbooks|journal=Teaching of Psychology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=195\u2013203|doi=10.1177/0098628314537968}}</ref><ref name = \"Fromm\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/or/sociologyshop/frozim.html|title=Fromm...on Zimbardo's Prison Experiment|website=angelfire.com|access-date=March 31, 2018|quote=The purpose of the experiment was to study the behavior of normal people under a particular situation, that of playing the roles of prisoners and guards respectively, in a \"mock prison.\" The general thesis that the authors believe is proved by the experiment is that many, perhaps the majority of people, can be made to do almost anything by the strength of the situation they are put in, regardless of their morals, personal convictions, and values (P.

To allege that all these carefully tested, psychologically solid, upper-middle-class Caucasian \"guards\" dreamed this up on their own is absurd. How can Zimbardo and, by proxy, Maverick Entertainment express horror at the behavior of the \"guards\" when they were merely doing what Zimbardo and others, myself included, encouraged them to do at the outset or frankly established as ground rules?</blockquote>\n\nLike Zimbardo, Prescott has spoken before Congress on issues of prison reform.\n\n(Zimbardo, in his 2018 response, wrote that, though Prescott attached his name to the article, it was in fact written by Hollywood writer/producer [[Michael Lazarou]], who had unsuccessfully tried to get film rights to the Stanford prison experiment story, and when he was turned down began to publicly criticize it.<ref name=\"zimbardo response\" />)\n\nIn 2018, digitized recordings available on the official SPE website were widely discussed, particularly one where \"prison warden\" David Jaffe tried to influence the behavior of one of the \"guards\" by encouraging him to \"participate\" more and be more \"tough\" for the benefit of the experiment.<ref name=\"Cosmos2018\">{{Cite web |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/social-sciences/new-evidence-shows-stanford-prison-experiment-conclusions-untenable |title=New evidence shows Stanford Prison Experiment conclusions \"untenable\" |last= Masterson |first= Andrew |work=Cosmos |quote=Archival recordings show one of the world's most famous psychology experiments was poorly designed \u2013 and its use to justify brutality baseless. |date=July 9, 2018 |accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Leadership\"/>\nIn his 2018 response, Zimbardo wrote that the instructions they gave to the guards were \"mild compared to the pressure exerted by actual wardens and superior officers in real-life prison and military settings, where guards failing to participate fully can face disciplinary hearings, demotion, or dismissal.\"<ref name=\"zimbardo response\" />\n\n===Implied demands by Zimbardo===\nThe study was criticized in 2013 for [[demand characteristics]] by psychologist Peter Gray, who argued that participants in psychological experiments are more likely to do what they believe the researchers want them to do, and specifically in the case of the Stanford prison experiment, \"to act out their stereotyped views of what prisoners and guards do.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Gray, Peter |date=2013|work=Freedom to Learn blog |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201310/why-zimbardo-s-prison-experiment-isn-t-in-my-textbook |title=Why Zimbardo's Prison Experiment Isn't in My Textbook}}</ref> Gray stated that he did not include the experiment in his introductory textbook, ''Psychology'', because he thought it lacked scientific rigor.\n\n\"John Wayne\" (the real-life Dave Eshelman), one of the guards in the experiment, said that he caused the escalation of events between guards and prisoners after he began to emulate a character from the 1967 film ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]''.

Douglas Korpi was the first to leave, after 36 hours; he had a seeming mental breakdown in which he yelled \"Jesus Christ, I'm burning up inside!\" and \"I can't stand another night! I just can't take it anymore!\" His outburst was captured by a camera, and has become, in one commentator's words, \"a defining moment\" of the study.<ref name=\"lifespan of a lie\" /> In a 2017 interview, Korpi stated that his breakdown had been fake, and that he did it only so that he could leave and return to studying. (He had originally thought that he could study while \"imprisoned\", but the \"prison staff\" would not allow him.)<ref name=\"lifespan of a lie\" /> Zimbardo later stated that participants only had to state the phrase \"I quit the experiment\" in order to leave,<ref name=\"lifespan of a lie\" /> but transcripts from a taped conversation between Zimbardo and his staff show him stating \"There are only two conditions under which you can leave, medical help or psychiatric.\"<ref name=\"histoire\" /> In the 2017 interview, Korpi expressed regret that he had not filed a [[false imprisonment]] charge at the time.<ref name=\"lifespan of a lie\" />\n\nIn his 2018 rebuttal, Zimbardo noted that Korpi's description of his actions had changed several times before the 2017 interview, and that in Zimbardo's 1992 documentary ''Quiet Rage'' Korpi had stated that the experiment \"was the most upsetting experience of his life\".<ref name=\"zimbardo response\" />\n\n===Small and unrepresentative sample===\nCritics contend that not only was the sample size too small for extrapolation, but also having all of the experimental subjects be US male students gravely undercut the experiment's validity.

The researchers recruited students for a study using an advertisement similar to the one used in the Stanford Prison Experiment, with some ads saying \"a psychological study\" (the control group), and some with the words \"prison life\" as originally worded in Dr. Zimbardo's experiment. It was found that students who responded to the classified advertisement for the \"prison life\" were higher in traits such as [[social dominance theory|social dominance]], [[aggression]], [[authoritarianism]], etc. and were lower in traits related to [[empathy]] and [[altruism]] when compared to the control group participants.<ref name=revisitingSFE>{{Cite journal | first = Thomas | last = Carnahan |author2=Sam McFarland | year = 2007 | title = Revisiting the Stanford prison experiment: could participant self-selection have led to the cruelty? | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 603\u201314 | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~bertsch/Carnahan.pdf | doi=10.1177/0146167206292689 | pmid=17440210}}</ref>\n\n== Ethical issues ==\nThe experiment was perceived by many to involve questionable ethics, the most serious concern being that it was continued even after participants expressed their desire to withdraw. Despite the fact that participants were told they had the right to leave at any time, Zimbardo did not allow this.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince the time of the Stanford Prison Experiment, ethical guidelines have been established for [[Guidelines for human subject research|experiments involving human subjects]].<ref>U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects</ref><ref>The Belmont Report, Office of the Secretary, Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects for Biomedical and Behavioral Research, April 18, 1979</ref><ref>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, The Nuremberg Code</ref> The Stanford Prison Experiment led to the implementation of rules to preclude any harmful treatment of participants. Before they are implemented, human studies must now be reviewed and found by an [[institutional review board]] (US) or ethics committee (UK) to be in accordance with ethical guidelines set by the American Psychological Association.<ref name=\":0\" /> These guidelines involve the consideration of whether the potential benefit to science outweighs the possible risk for physical and psychological harm.\n\nA post-experimental debriefing is now considered an important ethical consideration to ensure that participants are not harmed in any way by their experience in an experiment. Though Zimbardo did conduct debriefing sessions, they were several years after the Stanford prison experiment. By that time numerous details were forgotten; nonetheless, many participants reported that they experienced no lasting negative effects.<ref name=\":0\" /> Current standards specify that the debriefing process should occur as soon as possible to assess what psychological harm, if any, may have been done and to rehabilitate participants, if necessary.

Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, Sec. 8.07. http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/</ref>\n\nWith how the results of this experiment had ended, there have been some stir in ethical consequences involving this experiment. This study received much criticism with the lack of full consent from the participants with the knowledge from Zimbardo that he himself could not have predicted how the experiment would have turned out to be. With the participants playing the roles of prisoners and guards, there was no certain fact that they would get the help that they need in process of this study.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html|title=Stanford Prison Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> Zimbardo has come out to explain that he himself never thought his experiment would conclude how it did.\n\n== Comparisons to Abu Ghraib ==\nWhen [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|acts of prisoner torture and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq]] were publicized in March 2004, Zimbardo himself, who paid close attention to the details of the story, was struck by the similarity with his own experiment. He was dismayed by official military and government representatives' shifting the blame for the torture and abuses in the [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] American military prison onto \"a few bad apples\" rather than acknowledging the possibly systemic problems of a formally established military incarceration system.\n\nEventually, Zimbardo became involved with the defense team of lawyers representing one of the Abu Ghraib prison guards, Staff Sergeant [[Ivan Frederick|Ivan \"Chip\" Frederick]]. He was granted full access to all investigation and background reports, and testified as an [[expert witness]] in SSG Frederick's [[court martial]], which resulted in an eight-year prison sentence for Frederick in October 2004.\n\nZimbardo drew from his participation in the Frederick case to write the book ''[[The Lucifer Effect|The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil]],'' published by [[Random House]] in 2007, which deals with the similarities between his own Stanford Prison Experiment and the Abu Ghraib abuses.<ref name = \"Lucifer\"/>\n\n== Similar studies ==\n\n=== BBC prison study ===\nPsychologists [[Alex Haslam]] and [[Steve Reicher]] conducted the BBC Prison Study in 2002 and published the results in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcprisonstudy.org|title=Welcome to the official site for the BBC Prison Study.

Their results and conclusions differed from Zimbardo's and led to a number of publications on tyranny, [[stress (biology)|stress]], and leadership. The results were published in leading academic journals such as ''[[British Journal of Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'', ''[[Social Psychology Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]]''. The BBC Prison Study is now taught as a core study on the UK [[A-level]] [[Psychology]] OCR syllabus.\n\nWhile Haslam and Reicher's procedure was not a direct replication of Zimbardo's, their study casts further doubt on the generality of his conclusions. Specifically, it questions the notion that people slip mindlessly into role and the idea that the dynamics of evil are in any way banal. Their research also points to the importance of leadership in the emergence of tyranny of the form displayed by Zimbardo when briefing guards in the Stanford experiment.<ref>[http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,,1605313,00.html Interview of Alex Haslam] at ''The Guardian''</ref><ref>{{cite interview|last=Reicher|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Reicher|last2=Haslam|first2=Alex|authorlink2=Alex Haslam|interviewer = Briggs, Pam |title=''Learning from the Experiment''|work=The Psychologist|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/experiment.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221194634/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/experiment.htm| archivedate=February 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Experiments in the United States===\nThe Stanford prison experiment was in part a response to the [[Milgram experiment]] at Yale beginning in 1961 and published in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html|title=Milgram Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[The Third Wave (experiment)|The Third Wave experiment]] involved the use of authoritarian dynamics similar to [[Nazi Party]] methods of mass control in a classroom setting by high school teacher [[Ron Jones (teacher)|Ron Jones]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], in 1967 with the goal of demonstrating to the class in a vivid way how the German public in [[World War II]] could have acted in the way it did.<ref name=\"wave\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewavehome.com/1976_The-Third-Wave_story.htm |title=The Third Wave\n |last1=Jones |first1=Ron |date=1976 |website=The Wave Home |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202082041/http://www.thewavehome.com/1976_The-Third-Wave_story.htm |archivedate=February 2, 2015 |accessdate=December 3, 2016 |quote= }}</ref> Although the veracity of Jones' accounts has been questioned, several participants in the study have gone on record to confirm the events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lessonplanmovie.com/|title=Lesson Plan: The Story of the Third Wave (The Wave, Die Welle)|website=lessonplanmovie.com}}</ref>\n\nIn both experiments, participants found it difficult to leave the study due to the roles they were assigned.

Conformity is strengthened by allowing some participants to feel more or less powerful than others. In both experiments, behavior is altered to match the group stereotype.\n\n=== Milgram shock experiment ===\nOne famous study in obedience was created by Stanley Milgram, a psychologist at Yale University. He came up with an idea for an experiment focusing on the conflicting decisions between obedience to authority and inner conscience. During this experiment Milgram had a \u201cteacher\u201d and a \u201cstudent\u201d with the experimenter (wearing a lab coat) on the side. However the teacher (who is the participant) does not know that the student is in on the experiment and is not actually another participant. If the student answered a question wrong during the experiment, the teacher would \u201cshock\u201d the student. The teacher, being unable to see the student, would hear a prerecorded response from the student towards the shock. The teacher would ask the experimenter to stop and end the test, but the latter would not let them and make the teacher continue the test. The teacher would do so because of the higher authority of the experimenter. Comparing this to the Stanford prison experiment, both participants were influenced by higher authority and this has created a stir of ethical issues between these two experiments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html|title=Milgram Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe 2001 film ''[[Das Experiment]]'' starring [[Moritz Bleibtreu]] is based on the experiment.\n\nThe 2015 film ''[[The Stanford Prison Experiment (film)|The Stanford Prison Experiment]]'' is based on the experiment.<ref>Highfill, Samantha (July 17, 2015).

It was conducted at [[Stanford University]] on the days of August 14\u201320, 1971, by a research group led by psychology professor [[Philip Zimbardo]] using college students.<ref>https://www.newsweek.com/stanford-prison-experiment-age-justice-reform-359247</ref> In the study, volunteers were assigned to be either \"guards\" or \"prisoners\" by the flip of a coin, in a mock prison, with Zimbardo himself serving as the [[superintendent (jail)|superintendent]]. Several \"prisoners\" left mid-experiment, and the whole experiment was abandoned after six days. Early reports on experimental results claimed that students quickly embraced their assigned roles, with some guards enforcing [[Authoritarian personality|authoritarian]] measures and ultimately subjecting some prisoners to [[psychological torture]], while many prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse and, by the officers' request, actively harassed other prisoners who tried to stop it. The experiment has been described in many introductory social psychology textbooks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psypost.org/2014/09/intro-psychology-textbooks-gloss-criticisms-zimbardos-stanford-prison-experiment-27970|title=Intro to psychology textbooks gloss over criticisms of Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment|date=September 7, 2014|publisher=}}</ref> although some have chosen to exclude it because its methodology is sometimes questioned.<ref>{{cite news |title=Psychology Itself Is Under Scrutiny |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/health/psychology-studies-stanford-prison.html? |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Office of Naval Research|U.S. Office of Naval Research]]<ref>[http://www.prisonexp.org/faq.htm FAQ on official site] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120909193121/http://www.prisonexp.org/faq.htm |date=September 9, 2012 }}</ref> funded the experiment as an investigation into the causes of difficulties between guards and prisoners in the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]].

Critics also noted that some of the participants behaved in a way that would help the study, so that, as one \"guard\" later put it, \"the researchers would have something to work with,\" which is known as [[demand characteristics]]. Variants of the experiment have been performed by other researchers, but none of these attempts have replicated the results of the SPE.\n\n== Zimbardo's goals==\nThe (archived) official website of the Stanford Prison Experiment describes the experiment goal as follows:\n\n<blockquote>We wanted to see what the psychological effects were of becoming a prisoner or prison guard. To do this, we decided to set up a simulated prison and then carefully note the effects of this institution on the behavior of all those within its walls.<ref name=\"ArchivedOfficial\"/></blockquote>\n\nA 1997 article from the Stanford News Service described experiment goals in a more detailed way:\n\n<blockquote>Zimbardo's primary reason for conducting the experiment was to focus on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity and situational validation of behavior that generally would repulse ordinary individuals. \"I had been conducting research for some years on deindividuation, vandalism and dehumanization that illustrated the ease with which ordinary people could be led to engage in anti-social acts by putting them in situations where they felt anonymous, or they could perceive of others in ways that made them less than human, as enemies or objects,\" Zimbardo told the Toronto symposium in the summer of 1996.<ref name=\"spespa\">{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html|title=The Stanford Prison Experiment: Still powerful after all these years (1/97)|date=1996-08-12|publisher=News.stanford.edu|accessdate=2018-07-12|quote=In the prison-conscious autumn of 1971, when George Jackson was killed at San Quentin and Attica erupted in even more deadly rebellion and retribution, the Stanford Prison Experiment made news in a big way.

The prison had two fabricated walls, one at the entrance, and one at the cell wall to block observation. Each cell (6 \u00d7 9 feet, or 1.8 \u00d7 2.7 m), contained only a cot for the prisoners.<ref name=\":1\" /> In contrast, the guards lived in a very different environment, separated from the prisoners. They were given rest and relaxation areas, and other comforts.\n\nTwelve of the twenty-four participants were assigned the role of prisoner (nine plus three potential substitutes), while the other twelve were assigned the role of guard (also nine plus three potential substitutes). Zimbardo took on the role of the superintendent and an undergraduate [[research assistant]] took on the role of the warden. Zimbardo designed the experiment in order to induce [[disorientation]], [[depersonalization]], and [[deindividuation]] in the participants.\n\nThe researchers held an orientation session for the guards the day before the experiment, during which guards were instructed not to harm the prisoners physically or withhold food or drink. In the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=760lwYmpXbc footage] of the study, Zimbardo can be seen talking to the guards: \"You can create in the prisoners feelings of boredom, a sense of fear to some degree, you can create a notion of arbitrariness that their life is totally controlled by us, by the system, you, me, and they'll have no privacy ... We're going to take away their individuality in various ways. In general what all this leads to is a sense of powerlessness.

Prisoners wore uncomfortable, ill-fitting smocks and stocking caps, as well as a chain around one ankle. Guards were instructed to call prisoners by their assigned numbers, sewn on their uniforms, instead of by name.\n\nThe prisoners were \"arrested\" at their homes and \"charged\" with armed robbery. The local [[Palo Alto]] police department assisted Zimbardo with the simulated arrests and conducted full booking procedures on the prisoners, which included [[fingerprint]]ing and taking [[mug shot]]s. The prisoners were transported to the mock prison from the police station, where they were [[strip search]]ed and given their new identities.\n\nThe small mock prison cells were set up to hold three prisoners each. There was a small corridor for the prison yard, a closet for solitary confinement, and a bigger room across from the prisoners for the guards and warden. The prisoners were to stay in their cells and the yard all day and night until the end of the study. The guards worked in teams of three for eight-hour shifts. The guards were not required to stay on site after their shift.\n\nGuards had differing responses to their new roles. One, described by Stanford Magazine as \"the most abusive guard\" felt his aggressive behavior was helping experimenters to get what they wanted. Another who had joined the experiment hoping to be selected as a prisoner, instead recalls \"I brought joints with me, and every day I wanted to give them to the prisoners.

Guards from other shifts volunteered to work extra hours, to assist in subduing the revolt, and subsequently attacked the prisoners with [[fire extinguisher]]s without being supervised by the research staff. Finding that handling nine cell mates with only three guards per shift was challenging, one of the guards suggested they use psychological tactics to control them. They set up a \"privilege cell\" in which prisoners who were not involved in the riot were treated with special rewards, such as higher quality meals. The \"privileged\" inmates chose not to eat the meal in commiseration with their fellow prisoners.\n\nAfter only 35 hours, one prisoner began to act \"crazy\", as Zimbardo described: \"#8612 then began to act crazy, to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control. It took quite a while before we became convinced that he was really suffering and that we had to release him.\" \nGuards forced the prisoners to repeat their assigned numbers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/11 |website=The Stanford Prison Experiment |title=Slide tour}}</ref> to reinforce the idea that this was their new identity. Guards soon used these prisoner counts to harass the prisoners, using physical punishment such as protracted exercise for errors in the prisoner count. Sanitary conditions declined rapidly, exacerbated by the guards' refusal to allow some prisoners to urinate or defecate anywhere but in a bucket placed in their cell. As punishment, the guards would not let the prisoners empty the sanitation bucket. Mattresses were a valued item in the prison, so the guards would punish prisoners by removing their mattresses, leaving them to sleep on concrete. Some prisoners were forced to be naked as a method of degradation. Several guards became increasingly cruel as the experiment continued; experimenters reported that approximately one-third of the guards exhibited genuine sadistic tendencies. Most of the guards were upset when the experiment was halted after only six days.\n\nZimbardo mentions his own absorption in the experiment. On the fourth day, some of the guards stated they heard a rumor that the released prisoner was going to come back with his friends and free the remaining inmates. Zimbardo and the guards disassembled the prison and moved it onto a different floor of the building. Zimbardo himself waited in the basement, in case the released prisoner showed up, and planned to tell him that the experiment had been terminated. The released prisoner never returned, and the prison was rebuilt in the basement.\n\nZimbardo argued that the prisoners had [[internalization|internalized]] their roles, since some had stated they would accept \"parole\" even if it would mean forfeiting their pay, despite the fact that quitting would have achieved the same result without the delay involved in waiting for their parole requests to be granted or denied.<ref name=\"Zimbardo, P.G. 2007\">{{cite book|author=Zimbardo, P.G. |date=2007|title=The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil|url=https://archive.org/details/lucifereffectund00zimb |url-access=registration |location= New York|publisher= Random House}}</ref> Zimbardo argued they had no reason for continued participation in the experiment after having lost all monetary compensation, yet they did, because they had internalized the prisoner identity.\n\nPrisoner No. 416, a newly admitted stand-by prisoner, expressed concern about the treatment of the other prisoners. The guards responded with more abuse. When he refused to eat his sausages, saying he was on a [[hunger strike]], guards confined him to \"[[solitary confinement]]\", a dark closet: \"the guards then instructed the other prisoners to repeatedly punch on the door while shouting at 416.\"<ref name = \"Lucifer\">{{cite web|url= http://www.lucifereffect.com |title=The Lucifer Effect|website=lucifereffect.com}}</ref> The guards said he would be released from solitary confinement only if the prisoners gave up their blankets and slept on their bare mattresses, which all but one refused to do.\n\nZimbardo aborted the experiment early when [[Christina Maslach]], a graduate student in psychology whom he was dating (and later married),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html |website=Stanford University News Service |title= The Standard Prison Experiment}}</ref> objected to the conditions of the prison after she was introduced to the experiment to conduct interviews. Zimbardo noted that, of more than 50 people who had observed the experiment, Maslach was the only one who questioned its morality. After only six days of a planned two weeks' duration, the experiment was discontinued.<ref name=\"Zimbardo, P.G. 2007\"/>\n\n== Conclusions ==\nOn August 20, 1971, Zimbardo announced the end of the experiment to the participants.\n\nAccording to Zimbardo's interpretation of the SPE, it demonstrated that the simulated-prison situation, rather than individual [[personality psychology|personality traits]], caused the participants' behavior. Using this [[Attribution theory|situational attribution]], the results are compatible with those of the [[Milgram experiment]], where random participants complied with orders to administer seemingly dangerous and potentially lethal [[electric shock]]s to a [[shill]].<ref name=\"NewYorker\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/the-real-lesson-of-the-stanford-prison-experiment |title=The Real Lesson of the Stanford Prison Experiment |last= Konnikova |first= Konnikova |work= New Yorker |quote=Occasionally, disputes between prisoner and guards got out of hand, violating an explicit injunction against physical force that both prisoners and guards had read prior to enrolling in the study.

In his summary, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I hereby assert that none of these criticisms present any substantial evidence that alters the SPE's main conclusion concerning the importance of understanding how systemic and situational forces can operate to influence individual behavior in negative or positive directions, often without our personal awareness. The SPE's core message is not that a psychological simulation of prison life is the same as the real thing, or that prisoners and guards always or even usually behave the way that they did in the SPE. Rather, the SPE serves as a cautionary tale of what might happen to any of us if we underestimate the extent to which the power of social roles and external pressures can influence our actions.<ref name=\"zimbardo response\">[http://www.prisonexp.org/response Philip Zimbardo\u2019s Response To Recent Criticisms of the Stanford Prison Experiment], Stanford Prison Experiment website</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn turn, Le Texier published a peer-reviewed article which used videos, recordings, and notes from the experiment in Stanford University Archives to argue \nthat \"The guards knew what results the experiment was supposed to produce ... far from reacting spontaneously to this pathogenic social environment, the guards were given clear instructions for how to create it ... the experimenters intervened directly in the experiment, either to give precise instructions, to recall the purposes of the experiment, or to set a general direction ... in order to get their full participation, Zimbardo intended to make the guards believe that they were his research assistants.\".<ref>Thibault Le Texier, \"Debunking the Stanford Prison Experiment.\" American Psychologist, Vol 74(7), Oct 2019, 823-839dx.doi.org/10.1037/amp0000401</ref> Since this English-language publication, the debate has returned to the media in the United States.<ref>Rationally Speaking Episodes 241 - Thibault Le Texier on \"Debunking the Stanford Prison Experiment http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-241-thibault-le-texier-on-debunking-the-stanford-prison-e.html</ref>\n\n===Treatment of \"prisoners\"===\nSome of the guards' behavior allegedly led to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. According to Zimbardo's report, one third of the guards were judged to have exhibited \"genuine sadistic tendencies\", while many prisoners were emotionally traumatized, and three of them had to be removed from the experiment early. Zimbardo concluded that both prisoners and guards had become deeply absorbed in their roles and realized that he had likewise become as deeply absorbed in his own, and he terminated the experiment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-31.htm |website=Stanford Prison Experiment |title= Conclusion}}</ref>\n\nEthical concerns surrounding the experiment often draw comparisons to a [[Milgram experiment|similar experiment]], conducted ten years earlier in 1961 at [[Yale University]] by [[Stanley Milgram]].<ref name=NewYorker/>\n\nWith the treatment that the guards were given to the prisoners, the guards would become so deeply absorbed into their role as a guard that they would emotionally, physically and mentally humiliate the prisoners:\n\n\"Each prisoner was systematically searched and stripped naked.

Our goal was to produce similar effects quickly by putting men in a dress without any underclothes. Indeed, as soon as some of our prisoners were put in these uniforms they began to walk and to sit differently, and to hold themselves differently \u2013 more like a woman than like a man.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prisonexp.org/arrival|title=3.

These participants were stripped from their identity of who they are from the outside world, were given ID numbers and were referred to as so.\n\n===Reliance on anecdotal evidence===\nBecause of the nature of the experiment, Zimbardo found it impossible to keep traditional [[scientific control]]s in place. He was unable to remain a [[Observation|neutral observer]], since he influenced the direction of the experiment as the prison's superintendent. Conclusions and observations drawn by the experimenters were largely [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]], and the experiment is practically impossible for other researchers to accurately [[reproducibility|reproduce]]. [[Erich Fromm]] claimed to see generalizations in the experiment's results and argued that the personality of an individual does affect behavior when imprisoned. This ran counter to the study's conclusion that the prison situation itself controls the individual's behavior. Fromm also argued that the amount of sadism in the \"normal\" subjects could not be determined with the methods employed to screen them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ahrp.org/1971-stanford-prison-experiment-conducted-by-philip-zimbardo-was-an-exercise-that-unleashed-unprovoked-violence-and-a-predilection-for-abuse-bordering-on-torture/|title=1971: Philip Zimbardo, Stanford Prison Experiment - precursor for Abu Ghraib torture. - AHRP|date=December 28, 2014|work=AHRP|access-date=March 31, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Griggs|first=Richard A.|date=July 13, 2014|title=Coverage of the Stanford Prison Experiment in Introductory Psychology Textbooks|journal=Teaching of Psychology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=195\u2013203|doi=10.1177/0098628314537968}}</ref><ref name = \"Fromm\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/or/sociologyshop/frozim.html|title=Fromm...on Zimbardo's Prison Experiment|website=angelfire.com|access-date=March 31, 2018|quote=The purpose of the experiment was to study the behavior of normal people under a particular situation, that of playing the roles of prisoners and guards respectively, in a \"mock prison.\" The general thesis that the authors believe is proved by the experiment is that many, perhaps the majority of people, can be made to do almost anything by the strength of the situation they are put in, regardless of their morals, personal convictions, and values (P.

In that article, entitled \"The Lie of the Stanford Prison Experiment\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&d=stanford20050428-01.2.24&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------|title=The Stanford Daily 28 April 2005 \u2014 The Stanford Daily|website=stanforddailyarchive.com|access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref> Prescott wrote:\n\n<blockquote>[...] ideas such as bags being placed over the heads of prisoners, inmates being bound together with chains and buckets being used in place of toilets in their cells were all experiences of mine at the old \"Spanish Jail\" section of San Quentin and which I dutifully shared with the Stanford Prison Experiment braintrust months before the experiment started. To allege that all these carefully tested, psychologically solid, upper-middle-class Caucasian \"guards\" dreamed this up on their own is absurd. How can Zimbardo and, by proxy, Maverick Entertainment express horror at the behavior of the \"guards\" when they were merely doing what Zimbardo and others, myself included, encouraged them to do at the outset or frankly established as ground rules?</blockquote>\n\nLike Zimbardo, Prescott has spoken before Congress on issues of prison reform.\n\n(Zimbardo, in his 2018 response, wrote that, though Prescott attached his name to the article, it was in fact written by Hollywood writer/producer [[Michael Lazarou]], who had unsuccessfully tried to get film rights to the Stanford prison experiment story, and when he was turned down began to publicly criticize it.<ref name=\"zimbardo response\" />)\n\nIn 2018, digitized recordings available on the official SPE website were widely discussed, particularly one where \"prison warden\" David Jaffe tried to influence the behavior of one of the \"guards\" by encouraging him to \"participate\" more and be more \"tough\" for the benefit of the experiment.<ref name=\"Cosmos2018\">{{Cite web |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/social-sciences/new-evidence-shows-stanford-prison-experiment-conclusions-untenable |title=New evidence shows Stanford Prison Experiment conclusions \"untenable\" |last= Masterson |first= Andrew |work=Cosmos |quote=Archival recordings show one of the world's most famous psychology experiments was poorly designed \u2013 and its use to justify brutality baseless. |date=July 9, 2018 |accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Leadership\"/>\nIn his 2018 response, Zimbardo wrote that the instructions they gave to the guards were \"mild compared to the pressure exerted by actual wardens and superior officers in real-life prison and military settings, where guards failing to participate fully can face disciplinary hearings, demotion, or dismissal.\"<ref name=\"zimbardo response\" />\n\n===Implied demands by Zimbardo===\nThe study was criticized in 2013 for [[demand characteristics]] by psychologist Peter Gray, who argued that participants in psychological experiments are more likely to do what they believe the researchers want them to do, and specifically in the case of the Stanford prison experiment, \"to act out their stereotyped views of what prisoners and guards do.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Gray, Peter |date=2013|work=Freedom to Learn blog |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201310/why-zimbardo-s-prison-experiment-isn-t-in-my-textbook |title=Why Zimbardo's Prison Experiment Isn't in My Textbook}}</ref> Gray stated that he did not include the experiment in his introductory textbook, ''Psychology'', because he thought it lacked scientific rigor.\n\n\"John Wayne\" (the real-life Dave Eshelman), one of the guards in the experiment, said that he caused the escalation of events between guards and prisoners after he began to emulate a character from the 1967 film ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]''.

Douglas Korpi was the first to leave, after 36 hours; he had a seeming mental breakdown in which he yelled \"Jesus Christ, I'm burning up inside!\" and \"I can't stand another night! I just can't take it anymore!\" His outburst was captured by a camera, and has become, in one commentator's words, \"a defining moment\" of the study.<ref name=\"lifespan of a lie\" /> In a 2017 interview, Korpi stated that his breakdown had been fake, and that he did it only so that he could leave and return to studying. (He had originally thought that he could study while \"imprisoned\", but the \"prison staff\" would not allow him.)<ref name=\"lifespan of a lie\" /> Zimbardo later stated that participants only had to state the phrase \"I quit the experiment\" in order to leave,<ref name=\"lifespan of a lie\" /> but transcripts from a taped conversation between Zimbardo and his staff show him stating \"There are only two conditions under which you can leave, medical help or psychiatric.\"<ref name=\"histoire\" /> In the 2017 interview, Korpi expressed regret that he had not filed a [[false imprisonment]] charge at the time.<ref name=\"lifespan of a lie\" />\n\nIn his 2018 rebuttal, Zimbardo noted that Korpi's description of his actions had changed several times before the 2017 interview, and that in Zimbardo's 1992 documentary ''Quiet Rage'' Korpi had stated that the experiment \"was the most upsetting experience of his life\".<ref name=\"zimbardo response\" />\n\n===Small and unrepresentative sample===\nCritics contend that not only was the sample size too small for extrapolation, but also having all of the experimental subjects be US male students gravely undercut the experiment's validity. In other words, it is conceivable that replicating the experiment using a diverse group of people (with different objectives and views in life)<ref name=\":0\"/> would have produced radically distinct results.\n\nResearchers from [[Western Kentucky University]] argued that [[selection bias]] may have played a role in the results. The researchers recruited students for a study using an advertisement similar to the one used in the Stanford Prison Experiment, with some ads saying \"a psychological study\" (the control group), and some with the words \"prison life\" as originally worded in Dr. Zimbardo's experiment. It was found that students who responded to the classified advertisement for the \"prison life\" were higher in traits such as [[social dominance theory|social dominance]], [[aggression]], [[authoritarianism]], etc. and were lower in traits related to [[empathy]] and [[altruism]] when compared to the control group participants.<ref name=revisitingSFE>{{Cite journal | first = Thomas | last = Carnahan |author2=Sam McFarland | year = 2007 | title = Revisiting the Stanford prison experiment: could participant self-selection have led to the cruelty? | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 603\u201314 | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~bertsch/Carnahan.pdf | doi=10.1177/0146167206292689 | pmid=17440210}}</ref>\n\n== Ethical issues ==\nThe experiment was perceived by many to involve questionable ethics, the most serious concern being that it was continued even after participants expressed their desire to withdraw. Despite the fact that participants were told they had the right to leave at any time, Zimbardo did not allow this.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince the time of the Stanford Prison Experiment, ethical guidelines have been established for [[Guidelines for human subject research|experiments involving human subjects]].<ref>U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects</ref><ref>The Belmont Report, Office of the Secretary, Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects for Biomedical and Behavioral Research, April 18, 1979</ref><ref>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, The Nuremberg Code</ref> The Stanford Prison Experiment led to the implementation of rules to preclude any harmful treatment of participants. Before they are implemented, human studies must now be reviewed and found by an [[institutional review board]] (US) or ethics committee (UK) to be in accordance with ethical guidelines set by the American Psychological Association.<ref name=\":0\" /> These guidelines involve the consideration of whether the potential benefit to science outweighs the possible risk for physical and psychological harm.\n\nA post-experimental debriefing is now considered an important ethical consideration to ensure that participants are not harmed in any way by their experience in an experiment. Though Zimbardo did conduct debriefing sessions, they were several years after the Stanford prison experiment. By that time numerous details were forgotten; nonetheless, many participants reported that they experienced no lasting negative effects.<ref name=\":0\" /> Current standards specify that the debriefing process should occur as soon as possible to assess what psychological harm, if any, may have been done and to rehabilitate participants, if necessary.

Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, Sec. 8.07. http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/</ref>\n\nWith how the results of this experiment had ended, there have been some stir in ethical consequences involving this experiment. This study received much criticism with the lack of full consent from the participants with the knowledge from Zimbardo that he himself could not have predicted how the experiment would have turned out to be. With the participants playing the roles of prisoners and guards, there was no certain fact that they would get the help that they need in process of this study.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html|title=Stanford Prison Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> Zimbardo has come out to explain that he himself never thought his experiment would conclude how it did.\n\n== Comparisons to Abu Ghraib ==\nWhen [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|acts of prisoner torture and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq]] were publicized in March 2004, Zimbardo himself, who paid close attention to the details of the story, was struck by the similarity with his own experiment. He was dismayed by official military and government representatives' shifting the blame for the torture and abuses in the [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] American military prison onto \"a few bad apples\" rather than acknowledging the possibly systemic problems of a formally established military incarceration system.\n\nEventually, Zimbardo became involved with the defense team of lawyers representing one of the Abu Ghraib prison guards, Staff Sergeant [[Ivan Frederick|Ivan \"Chip\" Frederick]]. He was granted full access to all investigation and background reports, and testified as an [[expert witness]] in SSG Frederick's [[court martial]], which resulted in an eight-year prison sentence for Frederick in October 2004.\n\nZimbardo drew from his participation in the Frederick case to write the book ''[[The Lucifer Effect|The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil]],'' published by [[Random House]] in 2007, which deals with the similarities between his own Stanford Prison Experiment and the Abu Ghraib abuses.<ref name = \"Lucifer\"/>\n\n== Similar studies ==\n\n=== BBC prison study ===\nPsychologists [[Alex Haslam]] and [[Steve Reicher]] conducted the BBC Prison Study in 2002 and published the results in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcprisonstudy.org|title=Welcome to the official site for the BBC Prison Study.

Their results and conclusions differed from Zimbardo's and led to a number of publications on tyranny, [[stress (biology)|stress]], and leadership. The results were published in leading academic journals such as ''[[British Journal of Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'', ''[[Social Psychology Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]]''. The BBC Prison Study is now taught as a core study on the UK [[A-level]] [[Psychology]] OCR syllabus.\n\nWhile Haslam and Reicher's procedure was not a direct replication of Zimbardo's, their study casts further doubt on the generality of his conclusions. Specifically, it questions the notion that people slip mindlessly into role and the idea that the dynamics of evil are in any way banal. Their research also points to the importance of leadership in the emergence of tyranny of the form displayed by Zimbardo when briefing guards in the Stanford experiment.<ref>[http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,,1605313,00.html Interview of Alex Haslam] at ''The Guardian''</ref><ref>{{cite interview|last=Reicher|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Reicher|last2=Haslam|first2=Alex|authorlink2=Alex Haslam|interviewer = Briggs, Pam |title=''Learning from the Experiment''|work=The Psychologist|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/experiment.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221194634/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/experiment.htm| archivedate=February 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Experiments in the United States===\nThe Stanford prison experiment was in part a response to the [[Milgram experiment]] at Yale beginning in 1961 and published in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html|title=Milgram Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[The Third Wave (experiment)|The Third Wave experiment]] involved the use of authoritarian dynamics similar to [[Nazi Party]] methods of mass control in a classroom setting by high school teacher [[Ron Jones (teacher)|Ron Jones]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], in 1967 with the goal of demonstrating to the class in a vivid way how the German public in [[World War II]] could have acted in the way it did.<ref name=\"wave\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewavehome.com/1976_The-Third-Wave_story.htm |title=The Third Wave\n |last1=Jones |first1=Ron |date=1976 |website=The Wave Home |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202082041/http://www.thewavehome.com/1976_The-Third-Wave_story.htm |archivedate=February 2, 2015 |accessdate=December 3, 2016 |quote= }}</ref> Although the veracity of Jones' accounts has been questioned, several participants in the study have gone on record to confirm the events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lessonplanmovie.com/|title=Lesson Plan: The Story of the Third Wave (The Wave, Die Welle)|website=lessonplanmovie.com}}</ref>\n\nIn both experiments, participants found it difficult to leave the study due to the roles they were assigned.

Conformity is strengthened by allowing some participants to feel more or less powerful than others. In both experiments, behavior is altered to match the group stereotype.\n\n=== Milgram shock experiment ===\nOne famous study in obedience was created by Stanley Milgram, a psychologist at Yale University. He came up with an idea for an experiment focusing on the conflicting decisions between obedience to authority and inner conscience. During this experiment Milgram had a \u201cteacher\u201d and a \u201cstudent\u201d with the experimenter (wearing a lab coat) on the side. However the teacher (who is the participant) does not know that the student is in on the experiment and is not actually another participant. If the student answered a question wrong during the experiment, the teacher would \u201cshock\u201d the student. The teacher, being unable to see the student, would hear a prerecorded response from the student towards the shock. The teacher would ask the experimenter to stop and end the test, but the latter would not let them and make the teacher continue the test. The teacher would do so because of the higher authority of the experimenter.
