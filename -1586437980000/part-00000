The dictatorship was established after the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|democratically-elected socialist government]] of [[Salvador Allende]] was overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 11 September 1973. During this time, the country was ruled by a [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|military junta]] headed by General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The military used the alleged breakdown of democracy and the economic crisis that took place during Allende's presidency to justify its seizure of power. The dictatorship presented its mission as a \"national reconstruction.\" The coup was the result of multiple forces, including pressure from conservative and women\u2019s groups, certain political parties, union strikes and other domestic unrest, as well as international factors. According to an article written by lifelong CIA operative [[Jack Devine]], although it was widely reported that the CIA was directly involved in orchestrating and carrying out the coup, subsequently released sources suggest a much reduced role of the US government.<ref>Jack Devine & Peter Kornbluh, 'Showdown in Santiago: What Really Happened in Chile?', Foreign Affairs 93 (2014), 168-174.</ref>\n\nThe regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent unprecedented in the [[history of Chile]]. Overall, the regime left over 3,000 dead or missing, tortured tens of thousands of prisoners,<ref name=\"BBC-Chile\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm |title=Country profile: Chile |work=BBC News |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=31 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114035710/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm |archivedate=14 January 2010 }}</ref> and drove an estimated 200,000 Chileans into exile.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1            = Wright\n| first1           = T.C.\n| last2            = O\u00f1ate\n| first2           = R.\n| contribution     = Chilean Diaspora\n| editor-last1     = Ember\n| editor-first1    = M.\n| editor-last2     = Ember\n| editor-first2    = C.R.\n| editor-last3     = Skoggard\n| editor-first3    = I.\n| title            = Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World\n| volume           = II\n| pages            = 57\u201365\n| place            = \n| date = 2005\n| contribution-url = \n}}</ref> The dictatorship's effects on Chilean political and economic life continue to be felt. Two years after its ascension radical [[neoliberal]] economic reforms were implemented, in sharp contrast to Allende's leftist policies, advised by a team of free-market economists educated in US universities known as the [[Chicago Boys]]. Later, in 1980, the regime replaced the [[Chilean Constitution of 1925]] with a [[Constitution of Chile|new constitution]]. This established a series of provisions that would eventually lead to the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite]] on October 5 of that year.\n\nIn that referendum, the Chilean people denied Pinochet a new mandate, opening the way for the [[Chilean transition to democracy|reestablishment of democracy in 1990]]. Consequently, democratic presidential elections were held the following year. The military dictatorship ended in 1990 with the election of [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian-Democrat]] candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]]. However, the military remained out of civilian control for several years after the junta itself had lost power.<ref name=AngellPollack1990>{{cite journal |last=Angell |first=Alan |last2=Pollack |first2=Benny |date=1990 |title=The Chilean Elections of 1989 |journal=[[Bulletin of Latin American Research]] |publisher=Society for Latin American Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201323 |doi= 10.2307/3338214|jstor=3338214 }}</ref>\n\n==Rise to power==\n{{main|1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n\nThere has been a large amount of debate over the extent of US government involvement in destabilising the Allende government.<ref>{{Citation|last=Harmer|first=Tanya|chapter=Rebellion|date=2011-10-10|pages=73\u2013106|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807834954|doi=10.5149/9780807869246_harmer.8|title=Allende's Chile and the Inter-American Cold War}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|doi = 10.1163/2468-1733_shafr_sim180020010}}</ref> Recently declassified documents show evidence of communication between the Chilean military and US officials, suggesting covert US involvement in assisting the military\u2019s rise to power.

The strike lasted 76 days and cost the government severely in lost revenues. One of the strikers, Luis Bravo Morales, was shot dead in [[Rancagua]] city. On June 29, the Blindados No. 2 tank regiment under the command of Colonel [[Roberto Souper]], attacked [[La Moneda]], Chile's presidential palace. Instigated by the anti-Marxist militia [[Patria y Libertad]] (\"''country and freedom''\"), the armoured cavalry soldiers hoped other units would be inspired to join them. Instead, armed units led by generals [[Carlos Prats]] and [[Augusto Pinochet]] quickly put down the coup attempt. In late July, 40,000 truckers, squeezed by price controls and rising costs, tied up transportation in a nationwide strike that lasted 37 days, costing the government $6 million USD a day.<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Chile'', Salvatore Bizzarro, p. 34, Scarecrow Press, 2005</ref> Two weeks before the coup, public dissatisfaction with rising prices and food shortages led to protests like the one at the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n which had been dispersed with tear gas.<ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907929-8,00.html The Bloody End of a Marxist Dream] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111142339/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907929-8,00.html |date=2011-11-11 }}\".

Furthermore, the economic chaos that Allende\u2019s regime was seeing meant that there were struggles to buy food and thus look after their families.

These women criticised the military for being \u2018cowards\u2019 for not getting rid of Allende, arguing that they were not carrying out their role of protecting Chilean women.\n\nOn August 22, 1973, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] passed, by a vote of 81 to 47, a resolution calling for President Allende to respect the constitution. The measure failed to obtain the two-thirds majority in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] constitutionally required to convict the president of abuse of power, but the resolution still represented a challenge to Allende's legitimacy.

This was done with support of journalists who \"reported\" the supposed events; in some cases, the fake combats were also staged.

It is thought that the killing of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] leader [[Miguel Enr\u00edquez (politician)|Miguel Enr\u00edquez]] in 1974 could be an early case of a faked combat.

Leigh criticized Pinochet for having joined the coup very late and then pretending to keep all power for himself. In December 1974 Leigh opposed the proposal to name Pinochet president of Chile. Leigh recalls about that moment that, \"Pinochet was furious, he hit the board, broke the glass, injured his hand a little and bled. Then, Merino and Mendoza told me I should sign, because if not the junta would split. I signed.\". Leigh's primary concern was Pinochet's consolidating of the legislative and executive branches of government under the new government. In particular, Pinochet's decision to enact a plebiscite without formally alerting the other junta members.<ref name=\"auto1\">Ensalaco, Mark. 2000. Chile Under Pinochet : Recovering the Truth. Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> Leigh, although a fervent supporter of the regime and hater of marxist ideology, had already taken steps to separate the executive and legislative branches. Pinochet is said to have been angered by Leigh's continued founding of a structure to divide the executive and legislative branches, eventually leading to Pinochet consolidating power and Leigh being dumped from the regime.<ref>Barros, Robert. La Junta militar: Pinochet y la Constituci\u00f3n de 1980.

MIR assassinated the head of the Army Intelligence school, Lieutenant Roger Vergara, with machine gun fire in the late 1970s.

Domestically, it was the second most powerful institution, behind Pinochet's government. While the Church remained politically neutral, its opposition to the regime came in the form of human rights advocacy and through the social movements that it gave a platform to. It achieved this through the establishment of the Cooperative Committee for Peace in Chile (COPACHI) and Vicariate of Solidarity. COPACHI was founded by [[Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez|Cardinal Raul Silve Henriquez]], Archbishop of Santiago, as an immediate response to the repression of the Pinochet regime. It was apolitical in a spirit of collaboration rather than conflict with the government. Pinochet developed suspicion of COPACHI, leading to its dissolution in late 1975. In response Silva founded the Vicariate in its place. Historian Hugo Fruhling's work highlights the multifaceted nature of Vicaria.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Corradi |first1=Juan |title=Fear at the Edge, State Terror and Resistance in Latin America |url=https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan |url-access=registration |date=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan/page/121 121\u2013141]}}</ref> Through developments and education programs in the shantytown area of Santiago, the Vicaria had mobilised around 44,000 people to join campaigns by 1979. The Church published a newsletter called ''Solidarity'' published in Chile and abroad, and supplied the public with information through radio stations. Vicaria pursued a legal strategy of defending human rights, not a political strategy to re-democratise Chile.\n\n====Jornadas de Protesta Nacional====\n\nThe Days of National Protest ([[:es:Jornadas de Protesta Nacional|Jornadas de Protesta Nacional]]) were days of civil demonstrations that periodically took place in Chile in the 1980s against the military junta. They were characterized by street demonstrations in the downtown avenues of the city in the mornings, strikes during the day, and barricades and clashes in the periphery of the city throughout the night. The protests were faced with increased government repression from 1984, with the biggest and last protest summoned in July 1986. The protests changed the mentality of many Chileans, strengthening opposition organizations and movements in the 1988 plebiscite.\n\n=== External Opposition ===\n\n==== Solidarity Campaigns & Exiles Movements ====\nThe regime's forced exile of over 200,000 Chileans led to areas of global opposition to the Pinochet government. However, the exiles themselves were not entirely responsible for the international resistance against Pinochet, but rather were able to gain the solidarity of many members of their host countries. Exiles were dispersed across the globe, and to all continents, with different factions of leftist opposition finding refuge in like-minded host countries. For example, the militant revolutionary MIR centring their operations in Havana, Cuba. While the efforts of exiles across the globe in actually militarily or financially supporting the domestic opposition to the junta were limited in their effectiveness, the more important work of the exiles came in their efforts in mobilising support among citizens in their host countries. As such, The Chile Solidarity Campaign (CSC) in the UK was relatively successful at petitioning the labour government. This included lobbying host governments and international organisations such as the United Nations to condemn the abuses of the dictatorship. The overall effect of this was the successful creation of a global solidarity movement.\n\n==Economy and free market reforms==\n[[Image:Chile- el pueblo vencera cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio Nacional de Chile]] as a [[concentration camp]] after the coup.]]\n{{Main|Economic history of Chile#1975-81}}\nAfter the military took over the government in 1973, a period of dramatic economic changes began. The Chilean economy was still faltering in the months following the coup. As the military junta itself was not particularly skilled in remedying the persistent economic difficulties, it appointed a group of Chilean economists who had been educated in the United States at the [[University of Chicago]]. Given financial and ideological support from Pinochet, the U.S., and international financial institutions, the [[Chicago Boys]] advocated ''[[laissez-faire]]'', [[free market|free-market]], [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]], and [[Conservatism#Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] policies, in stark contrast to the extensive [[nationalization]] and centrally-planned economic programs supported by Allende.<ref name=\"K.

Remmer 1998 5-55\"/>\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the era can be divided into two periods. The first, from 1975 to 1982, corresponds to the period when most of the reforms were implemented. The period ended with the international debt crisis and the collapse of the Chilean economy. At that point, unemployment was extremely high, above 20 percent, and a large proportion of the banking sector had become bankrupt. The following period was characterized by new reforms and economic recovery. Some economists argue that the recovery was due to an about-face turnaround of Pinochet's free market policy, since he nationalized many of the same industries that were nationalized under Allende and fired the Chicago Boys from their government posts.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Valenzuela\n| first = Arturo\n| year = 2002\n| title = A Nation of Enemies\n| publisher = W.

Chile went ahead with privatizations, including public utilities and the re-privatization of companies that had briefly returned to government control during the 1982\u201383 crisis. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent.

Chile actually helped the United Kingdom during the war. The two countries (Chile and Argentina) finally agreed to papal mediation over the Beagle canal that finally ended in the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] (''Tratado de Paz y Amistad'').

Due to intense U.S. Pressure at the last minute (while Pinochet's plane was halfway en route over the Pacific), Marcos cancelled the visit and denied Pinochet landing rights in the country. Pinochet and the junta were further caught off guard and humiliated when they were forced to land in Fiji to refuel for the planned return to Santiago, only to be met with airport staff who refused to assist the plane in any way (the Fijian military was called in instead), invasive and prolonged customs searches, exorbitant fuel and aviation service charges, and hundreds of angry protesters who pelted his plane with eggs and tomatoes.

Before that period ended, a candidate for President was to be proposed by the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Carabinero Chief General for the following period of eight years. The candidate was to be ratified by registered voters in a national plebiscite. On 30 August 1988 Pinochet was declared to be the candidate.<ref>David Altma, \u201cLatin America\u201d, Referendums Around the World, 2018</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitutional Court of Chile]] ruled that the plebiscite should be carried out as stipulated by Article 64 in the Constitution. That included an \"Electoral Space\" during which all positions, in this case, two, ''S\u00ed'' (yes), and ''No'', would have two free slots of equal and uninterrupted TV time, simultaneously broadcast by all TV channels, with no political advertising outside those spots. The allotment was scheduled in two off-prime time slots: one before the afternoon news and the other before the late-night news, from 22:45 to 23:15 each night (the evening news was from 20:30 to 21:30, and prime time from 21:30 to 22:30). The opposition ''No'' campaign, headed by [[Ricardo Lagos]], produced colorful, upbeat programs, telling the Chilean people to vote against the extension of the presidential term. Lagos, in a TV interview, pointed his index finger towards the camera and directly called on Pinochet to account for all the \"disappeared\" persons. The ''S\u00ed'' campaign did not argue for the advantages of extension, but was instead negative, claiming that voting \"no\" was equivalent to voting for a return to the chaos of the UP government.\n\nPinochet lost the 1988 referendum, where 56% of the votes rejected the extension of the presidential term, against 44% for \"''S\u00ed''\", and, following the constitutional provisions, he stayed as President for one more year.  The [[1989 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] was held in December 1989, at the same time as congressional elections that were due to take place. Pinochet left the presidency on March 11, 1990 and transferred power to political opponent [[Patricio Aylwin]], the new democratically elected president. Due to the same transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, until March 1998.\n\n===1989 General Elections===\nFrom the 1989 elections onwards the military had officially left the political sphere in Chile. Pinochet did not endorse any candidate publicly. Former Pinochet economic minister [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]] ran for president as candidate of the two right-wing parties [[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]] and [[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]. He had little political experience and was relatively young and credited with Chile's good economic performance in the second half of the 1980s. The right-wing parties faced several problems in the elections: there was considerable infighting between RN and UDI, B\u00fcchi had only very reluctantly accepted to run for president and right-wing politicians struggled to define their position towards the Pinochet regime. In addition to this [[right-wing populist]] [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera]] ran independently for president and made several election promises B\u00fcchi could not match.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nThe centre-left coalition [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] was more united and coherent. Its candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]], a [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrat]], behaved as if he had won and refused a second television debate with B\u00fcchi. B\u00fcchi attacked Aylwin on a remark he had made concerning that inflation rate of 20% was not much and he also accused Aylwin of making secret agreements with the [[Communist Party of Chile]], a party that was not part of Concertaci\u00f3n.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/> Aylwin spoke with authority about the need to clarify human rights violations but did not confront the dictatorship for it; in contrast, B\u00fcchi, as a former regime minister, lacked any credibility when dealing with human right violations.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nB\u00fcchi and Err\u00e1zuriz lost to [[Patricio Aylwin]] in the election. The electoral system meant that the largely Pinochet-sympathetic right was overrepresented in parliament in such a way that it could block any reform to the constitution. This over-representation was crucial for UDI in obtaining places in parliament and securing its political future. The far-left and the far-right performed poorly in the election.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\n===Presidential Election Results===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!

In a statement read by his wife Lucia Hiriart, he said, ''Today, near the end of my days, I want to say that I harbour no rancour against anybody, that I love my fatherland above all. ...

The dictatorship was established after the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|democratically-elected socialist government]] of [[Salvador Allende]] was overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 11 September 1973. During this time, the country was ruled by a [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|military junta]] headed by General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The military used the alleged breakdown of democracy and the economic crisis that took place during Allende's presidency to justify its seizure of power. The dictatorship presented its mission as a \"national reconstruction.\" The coup was the result of multiple forces, including pressure from conservative and women\u2019s groups, certain political parties, union strikes and other domestic unrest, as well as international factors. According to an article written by lifelong CIA operative [[Jack Devine]], although it was widely reported that the CIA was directly involved in orchestrating and carrying out the coup, subsequently released sources suggest a much reduced role of the US government.<ref>Jack Devine & Peter Kornbluh, 'Showdown in Santiago: What Really Happened in Chile?', Foreign Affairs 93 (2014), 168-174.</ref>\n\nThe regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent unprecedented in the [[history of Chile]]. Overall, the regime left over 3,000 dead or missing, tortured tens of thousands of prisoners,<ref name=\"BBC-Chile\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm |title=Country profile: Chile |work=BBC News |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=31 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114035710/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm |archivedate=14 January 2010 }}</ref> and drove an estimated 200,000 Chileans into exile.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1            = Wright\n| first1           = T.C.\n| last2            = O\u00f1ate\n| first2           = R.\n| contribution     = Chilean Diaspora\n| editor-last1     = Ember\n| editor-first1    = M.\n| editor-last2     = Ember\n| editor-first2    = C.R.\n| editor-last3     = Skoggard\n| editor-first3    = I.\n| title            = Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World\n| volume           = II\n| pages            = 57\u201365\n| place            = \n| date = 2005\n| contribution-url = \n}}</ref> The dictatorship's effects on Chilean political and economic life continue to be felt. Two years after its ascension radical [[neoliberal]] economic reforms were implemented, in sharp contrast to Allende's leftist policies, advised by a team of free-market economists educated in US universities known as the [[Chicago Boys]]. Later, in 1980, the regime replaced the [[Chilean Constitution of 1925]] with a [[Constitution of Chile|new constitution]]. This established a series of provisions that would eventually lead to the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite]] on October 5 of that year.\n\nIn that referendum, the Chilean people denied Pinochet a new mandate, opening the way for the [[Chilean transition to democracy|reestablishment of democracy in 1990]]. Consequently, democratic presidential elections were held the following year. The military dictatorship ended in 1990 with the election of [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian-Democrat]] candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]].

Instigated by the anti-Marxist militia [[Patria y Libertad]] (\"''country and freedom''\"), the armoured cavalry soldiers hoped other units would be inspired to join them. Instead, armed units led by generals [[Carlos Prats]] and [[Augusto Pinochet]] quickly put down the coup attempt.

The measure failed to obtain the two-thirds majority in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] constitutionally required to convict the president of abuse of power, but the resolution still represented a challenge to Allende's legitimacy.

This was done with support of journalists who \"reported\" the supposed events; in some cases, the fake combats were also staged.

It is thought that the killing of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] leader [[Miguel Enr\u00edquez (politician)|Miguel Enr\u00edquez]] in 1974 could be an early case of a faked combat.

Leigh criticized Pinochet for having joined the coup very late and then pretending to keep all power for himself. In December 1974 Leigh opposed the proposal to name Pinochet president of Chile. Leigh recalls about that moment that, \"Pinochet was furious, he hit the board, broke the glass, injured his hand a little and bled. Then, Merino and Mendoza told me I should sign, because if not the junta would split. I signed.\". Leigh's primary concern was Pinochet's consolidating of the legislative and executive branches of government under the new government. In particular, Pinochet's decision to enact a plebiscite without formally alerting the other junta members.<ref name=\"auto1\">Ensalaco, Mark. 2000. Chile Under Pinochet : Recovering the Truth. Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> Leigh, although a fervent supporter of the regime and hater of marxist ideology, had already taken steps to separate the executive and legislative branches. Pinochet is said to have been angered by Leigh's continued founding of a structure to divide the executive and legislative branches, eventually leading to Pinochet consolidating power and Leigh being dumped from the regime.<ref>Barros, Robert. La Junta militar: Pinochet y la Constituci\u00f3n de 1980.

MIR assassinated the head of the Army Intelligence school, Lieutenant Roger Vergara, with machine gun fire in the late 1970s.

Domestically, it was the second most powerful institution, behind Pinochet's government. While the Church remained politically neutral, its opposition to the regime came in the form of human rights advocacy and through the social movements that it gave a platform to. It achieved this through the establishment of the Cooperative Committee for Peace in Chile (COPACHI) and Vicariate of Solidarity. COPACHI was founded by [[Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez|Cardinal Raul Silve Henriquez]], Archbishop of Santiago, as an immediate response to the repression of the Pinochet regime. It was apolitical in a spirit of collaboration rather than conflict with the government. Pinochet developed suspicion of COPACHI, leading to its dissolution in late 1975. In response Silva founded the Vicariate in its place. Historian Hugo Fruhling's work highlights the multifaceted nature of Vicaria.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Corradi |first1=Juan |title=Fear at the Edge, State Terror and Resistance in Latin America |url=https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan |url-access=registration |date=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fearatedgestatet00juan/page/121 121\u2013141]}}</ref> Through developments and education programs in the shantytown area of Santiago, the Vicaria had mobilised around 44,000 people to join campaigns by 1979. The Church published a newsletter called ''Solidarity'' published in Chile and abroad, and supplied the public with information through radio stations. Vicaria pursued a legal strategy of defending human rights, not a political strategy to re-democratise Chile.\n\n====Jornadas de Protesta Nacional====\n\nThe Days of National Protest ([[:es:Jornadas de Protesta Nacional|Jornadas de Protesta Nacional]]) were days of civil demonstrations that periodically took place in Chile in the 1980s against the military junta. They were characterized by street demonstrations in the downtown avenues of the city in the mornings, strikes during the day, and barricades and clashes in the periphery of the city throughout the night. The protests were faced with increased government repression from 1984, with the biggest and last protest summoned in July 1986. The protests changed the mentality of many Chileans, strengthening opposition organizations and movements in the 1988 plebiscite.\n\n=== External Opposition ===\n\n==== Solidarity Campaigns & Exiles Movements ====\nThe regime's forced exile of over 200,000 Chileans led to areas of global opposition to the Pinochet government. However, the exiles themselves were not entirely responsible for the international resistance against Pinochet, but rather were able to gain the solidarity of many members of their host countries. Exiles were dispersed across the globe, and to all continents, with different factions of leftist opposition finding refuge in like-minded host countries. For example, the militant revolutionary MIR centring their operations in Havana, Cuba. While the efforts of exiles across the globe in actually militarily or financially supporting the domestic opposition to the junta were limited in their effectiveness, the more important work of the exiles came in their efforts in mobilising support among citizens in their host countries. As such, The Chile Solidarity Campaign (CSC) in the UK was relatively successful at petitioning the labour government. This included lobbying host governments and international organisations such as the United Nations to condemn the abuses of the dictatorship. The overall effect of this was the successful creation of a global solidarity movement.\n\n==Economy and free market reforms==\n[[Image:Chile- el pueblo vencera cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio Nacional de Chile]] as a [[concentration camp]] after the coup.]]\n{{Main|Economic history of Chile#1975-81}}\nAfter the military took over the government in 1973, a period of dramatic economic changes began. The Chilean economy was still faltering in the months following the coup. As the military junta itself was not particularly skilled in remedying the persistent economic difficulties, it appointed a group of Chilean economists who had been educated in the United States at the [[University of Chicago]]. Given financial and ideological support from Pinochet, the U.S., and international financial institutions, the [[Chicago Boys]] advocated ''[[laissez-faire]]'', [[free market|free-market]], [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]], and [[Conservatism#Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] policies, in stark contrast to the extensive [[nationalization]] and centrally-planned economic programs supported by Allende.<ref name=\"K.

Remmer 1998 5-55\"/>\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the era can be divided into two periods. The first, from 1975 to 1982, corresponds to the period when most of the reforms were implemented. The period ended with the international debt crisis and the collapse of the Chilean economy. At that point, unemployment was extremely high, above 20 percent, and a large proportion of the banking sector had become bankrupt. The following period was characterized by new reforms and economic recovery. Some economists argue that the recovery was due to an about-face turnaround of Pinochet's free market policy, since he nationalized many of the same industries that were nationalized under Allende and fired the Chicago Boys from their government posts.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Valenzuela\n| first = Arturo\n| year = 2002\n| title = A Nation of Enemies\n| publisher = W.

Chile went ahead with privatizations, including public utilities and the re-privatization of companies that had briefly returned to government control during the 1982\u201383 crisis. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent.

Chile actually helped the United Kingdom during the war. The two countries (Chile and Argentina) finally agreed to papal mediation over the Beagle canal that finally ended in the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] (''Tratado de Paz y Amistad'').

Due to intense U.S. Pressure at the last minute (while Pinochet's plane was halfway en route over the Pacific), Marcos cancelled the visit and denied Pinochet landing rights in the country. Pinochet and the junta were further caught off guard and humiliated when they were forced to land in Fiji to refuel for the planned return to Santiago, only to be met with airport staff who refused to assist the plane in any way (the Fijian military was called in instead), invasive and prolonged customs searches, exorbitant fuel and aviation service charges, and hundreds of angry protesters who pelted his plane with eggs and tomatoes.

Before that period ended, a candidate for President was to be proposed by the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Carabinero Chief General for the following period of eight years. The candidate was to be ratified by registered voters in a national plebiscite. On 30 August 1988 Pinochet was declared to be the candidate.<ref>David Altma, \u201cLatin America\u201d, Referendums Around the World, 2018</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitutional Court of Chile]] ruled that the plebiscite should be carried out as stipulated by Article 64 in the Constitution. That included an \"Electoral Space\" during which all positions, in this case, two, ''S\u00ed'' (yes), and ''No'', would have two free slots of equal and uninterrupted TV time, simultaneously broadcast by all TV channels, with no political advertising outside those spots. The allotment was scheduled in two off-prime time slots: one before the afternoon news and the other before the late-night news, from 22:45 to 23:15 each night (the evening news was from 20:30 to 21:30, and prime time from 21:30 to 22:30). The opposition ''No'' campaign, headed by [[Ricardo Lagos]], produced colorful, upbeat programs, telling the Chilean people to vote against the extension of the presidential term. Lagos, in a TV interview, pointed his index finger towards the camera and directly called on Pinochet to account for all the \"disappeared\" persons. The ''S\u00ed'' campaign did not argue for the advantages of extension, but was instead negative, claiming that voting \"no\" was equivalent to voting for a return to the chaos of the UP government.\n\nPinochet lost the 1988 referendum, where 56% of the votes rejected the extension of the presidential term, against 44% for \"''S\u00ed''\", and, following the constitutional provisions, he stayed as President for one more year.  The [[1989 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] was held in December 1989, at the same time as congressional elections that were due to take place. Pinochet left the presidency on March 11, 1990 and transferred power to political opponent [[Patricio Aylwin]], the new democratically elected president. Due to the same transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, until March 1998.\n\n===1989 General Elections===\nFrom the 1989 elections onwards the military had officially left the political sphere in Chile. Pinochet did not endorse any candidate publicly. Former Pinochet economic minister [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]] ran for president as candidate of the two right-wing parties [[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]] and [[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]. He had little political experience and was relatively young and credited with Chile's good economic performance in the second half of the 1980s. The right-wing parties faced several problems in the elections: there was considerable infighting between RN and UDI, B\u00fcchi had only very reluctantly accepted to run for president and right-wing politicians struggled to define their position towards the Pinochet regime. In addition to this [[right-wing populist]] [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera]] ran independently for president and made several election promises B\u00fcchi could not match.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nThe centre-left coalition [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] was more united and coherent. Its candidate [[Patricio Aylwin]], a [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrat]], behaved as if he had won and refused a second television debate with B\u00fcchi. B\u00fcchi attacked Aylwin on a remark he had made concerning that inflation rate of 20% was not much and he also accused Aylwin of making secret agreements with the [[Communist Party of Chile]], a party that was not part of Concertaci\u00f3n.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/> Aylwin spoke with authority about the need to clarify human rights violations but did not confront the dictatorship for it; in contrast, B\u00fcchi, as a former regime minister, lacked any credibility when dealing with human right violations.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\nB\u00fcchi and Err\u00e1zuriz lost to [[Patricio Aylwin]] in the election. The electoral system meant that the largely Pinochet-sympathetic right was overrepresented in parliament in such a way that it could block any reform to the constitution. This over-representation was crucial for UDI in obtaining places in parliament and securing its political future. The far-left and the far-right performed poorly in the election.<ref name=AngellPollack1990/>\n\n===Presidential Election Results===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!

In a statement read by his wife Lucia Hiriart, he said, ''Today, near the end of my days, I want to say that I harbour no rancour against anybody, that I love my fatherland above all. ...

This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making County the only senior club in

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making County the only senior club in

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to Eden Park, this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at Rotorua with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the Bay of Plenty Times about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in Australia and Auckland than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to Eden Park, this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at Rotorua with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the Bay of Plenty Times about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in Australia and Auckland than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.
