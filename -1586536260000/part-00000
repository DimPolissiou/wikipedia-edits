The group's longest-standing lineup, from 2009\u20132016, consisted of Dahvie Vanity and Jayy Von Monroe. The group released nine studio albums before breaking up in 2016 following Von Monroe's departure. It was reformed by Vanity the following year, initially with Fallon Vendetta. After Vendetta's departure, Vanity became the sole member of the group. Since 2019, Vanity has been releasing music under the moniker Kawaii Monster and Merchandise under the Instagram handle @darkartsofficial.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings and first albums===\nIn 2006, Jesus David Torres, also known as \"Dahvie Vanity\", started a trio called Love the Fashion with Christopher Mongillo and Rebecca Fugate. The group was originally nothing but a joke, which soon developed into Blood on the Dance Floor. The group self-released their first album, ''Let's Start a Riot'', in April 2008.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Not being able to tour, Mongillo and Fugate left the band while Vanity toured the [[Orlando, Florida]] area.<ref name=studio>[http://criticstudio.com/interviews/blood-on-the-dance-floor/ Exclusive Interview: Blood On The Dance Floor]. Critic Studio (January 26, 2012). Retrieved on 2015-10-21.</ref>\n\nDuring the recording of their second album, ''It's Hard to be a Diamond in a Rhinestone World'', Mongillo and Fugate left, and the band was picked up by producer and writer Rusty \"Lixx\" Wilmot. During the recording of this album, Garrett Marshal McLaughlin (\"Garrett Ecstasy\") was recruited to do backup vocals and screaming. The CD was self-released in October 2008. Only 300 copies were made.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Extended plays and ''Epic'' (2009\u20132010)===\nVanity and Ecstasy recorded the singles \"Siq With a Q\" and \"Suicide Club\" as a duo in 2008, and released three extended plays over the first half of 2009, ''I Scream I Scream'', ''OMFG Sneak Peak'', and ''Extended Play''.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The duo embarked on the OMFG Tour with other local bands Electric Valentine, Weston Buck, The Greenlight District, and The Crush in promotion of their upcoming album then titled ''OMFG''.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nAs the OMFG tour continued and concluded without Vanity, Garrett was replaced by Jeremy Brian Griffis, known by his stage name \"Jayy Von Monroe\". Along with Monroe, Vanity and the group's new drummer and rapper, Nick \"Nasty\" Wenzel, released \"Horrifically Delicious\".{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nMany of the songs originally recorded with Garrett intended for the upcoming album ''OMFG'' were re-recorded with new vocals by Jayyvon. The previous concept of the ''OMFG'' album was scrapped, and re-branded as ''EPIC'', set for release in 2010. The band went on tour over spring and summer 2010 to promote the release of ''Epic''. With [[Jeffree Star]] they recorded three songs for that album. However, the collaboration was short-lived since during the ''Looking Hot & Dangerous Tour'' serious disagreements between Star and Vanity came to a head. Star later made amends with the group, and later featured on their 2014 single \"Poison Apple\", from the album ''Bitchcraft''.<ref name=\"fight\">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1872142 |title=Jeffree Star and BOTDF at war |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |date= |access-date=July 14, 2012}}</ref> As with the previous conflict with Garrett, the three singles featuring Jeffree's vocals were re-recorded with vocals by Jayyvon, and the original tracks were not featured on the final album.\n\nIn October 2010, the album ''[[Epic (Blood on the Dance Floor album)|Epic]]'' charted No. 5 on the dance/electronic [[Billboard charts|Billboard chart]].<ref name=\"amg\"/> The band headlined the Epic Tour and the Epic Tour Part II in support of the album.<ref>[http://www.topspotusa.com/the-epic-tour.html The Epic Tour!!! \u2013 Top Spot USA \u2013 September 29th 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222194910/http://www.topspotusa.com/the-epic-tour.html |date=February 22, 2014 }}.

The album was preceded by several singles to promote the release, including \"Bewitched\", \"Yo Ho\", and \"P.L.U.R.\" The band embarked on [[Warped Tour 2011]] in June 2011,<ref name=\"warped\">{{cite web|url=http://vanswarpedtour.com/band/blood-on-the-dance-floor |title=Vans Warped Tour / Bands / June 16th \u2013 August 5th / Tickets On Sale Now / Blood On The Dance Floor |publisher=Vanswarpedtour.com |accessdate=July 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805020200/http://vanswarpedtour.com/band/blood-on-the-dance-floor |archivedate=August 5, 2012 }}</ref> and released the album while on tour.\n\nA music video for their hit single from the album, \"Bewitched\", featured \"Lady\" Nicole Nogrady, who later said that she felt disrespected by the band during production of the album as well as on the music video, and found herself having to confront the band directly in order for her name to appear on the credits of her work with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonademagazine.net/july2012 |title=Lady Nogrady Speaks Out |publisher=Lemonade Magazine |date=July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215045345/http://www.lemonademagazine.net/july2012 |archivedate=February 15, 2013 }}</ref> The song was subsequently performed by other female vocalists in place of Nogrady at live shows, and was re-recorded with vocals by Haley Rose for their 2013 acoustic album ''Blood Unplugged''.\n\nThe album peaked at No.&nbsp;13 on the ''Billboard'' Top Electronic Albums chart.<ref name=\"amg\"/> At the end of 2011, the duo headlined the All the Rage Tour and was planning the 'Tis the Season to be Killing Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurotrashmusic.co/2011/uncategorized/blood-on-the-dance-floor-all-the-rage-tour-dates/ |title=Blood On The Dance Floor:.

The group's longest-standing lineup, from 2009-2016, consisted of Dahvie Vanity and Jayy Von Monroe. The group released nine studio albums before breaking up in 2016 following Von Monroe's departure. It was reformed by Vanity the following year, initially with Fallon Vendetta. After Vendetta's departure, Vanity became the sole member of the group. Since 2019, Vanity has been releasing music under the moniker Kawaii Monster and Merchandise under the Instagram handle @darkartsofficial.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings and first albums===\nIn 2006, Jesus David Torres, also known as \"Dahvie Vanity\", started a trio called Love the Fashion with Christopher Mongillo and Rebecca Fugate. The group was originally nothing but a joke, which soon developed into Blood on the Dance Floor. The group self-released their first album, ''Let's Start a Riot'', in April 2008.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Not being able to tour, Mongillo and Fugate left the band while Vanity toured the [[Orlando, Florida]] area.<ref name=studio>[http://criticstudio.com/interviews/blood-on-the-dance-floor/ Exclusive Interview: Blood On The Dance Floor]. Critic Studio (January 26, 2012). Retrieved on 2015-10-21.</ref>\n\nDuring the recording of their second album, ''It's Hard to be a Diamond in a Rhinestone World'', Mongillo and Fugate left, and the band was picked up by producer and writer Rusty \"Lixx\" Wilmot. During the recording of this album, Garrett Marshal McLaughlin (\"Garrett Ecstasy\") was recruited to do backup vocals and screaming. The CD was self-released in October 2008. Only 300 copies were made.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Extended plays and ''Epic'' (2009\u20132010)===\nVanity and Ecstasy recorded the singles \"Siq With a Q\" and \"Suicide Club\" as a duo in 2008, and released three extended plays over the first half of 2009, ''I Scream I Scream'', ''OMFG Sneak Peak'', and ''Extended Play''.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The duo embarked on the OMFG Tour with other local bands Electric Valentine, Weston Buck, The Greenlight District, and The Crush in promotion of their upcoming album then titled ''OMFG''.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nAs the OMFG tour continued and concluded without Vanity, Garrett was replaced by Jeremy Brian Griffis, known by his stage name \"Jayy Von Monroe\". Along with Monroe, Vanity and the group's new drummer and rapper, Nick \"Nasty\" Wenzel, released \"Horrifically Delicious\".{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nMany of the songs originally recorded with Garrett intended for the upcoming album ''OMFG'' were re-recorded with new vocals by Jayyvon. The previous concept of the ''OMFG'' album was scrapped, and re-branded as ''EPIC'', set for release in 2010. The band went on tour over spring and summer 2010 to promote the release of ''Epic''. With [[Jeffree Star]] they recorded three songs for that album. However, the collaboration was short-lived since during the ''Looking Hot & Dangerous Tour'' serious disagreements between Star and Vanity came to a head. Star later made amends with the group, and later featured on their 2014 single \"Poison Apple\", from the album ''Bitchcraft''.<ref name=\"fight\">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1872142 |title=Jeffree Star and BOTDF at war |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |date= |access-date=July 14, 2012}}</ref> As with the previous conflict with Garrett, the three singles featuring Jeffree's vocals were re-recorded with vocals by Jayyvon, and the original tracks were not featured on the final album.\n\nIn October 2010, the album ''[[Epic (Blood on the Dance Floor album)|Epic]]'' charted No. 5 on the dance/electronic [[Billboard charts|Billboard chart]].<ref name=\"amg\"/> The band headlined the Epic Tour and the Epic Tour Part II in support of the album.<ref>[http://www.topspotusa.com/the-epic-tour.html The Epic Tour!!! \u2013 Top Spot USA \u2013 September 29th 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222194910/http://www.topspotusa.com/the-epic-tour.html |date=February 22, 2014 }}.

The album was preceded by several singles to promote the release, including \"Bewitched\", \"Yo Ho\", and \"P.L.U.R.\" The band embarked on [[Warped Tour 2011]] in June 2011,<ref name=\"warped\">{{cite web|url=http://vanswarpedtour.com/band/blood-on-the-dance-floor |title=Vans Warped Tour / Bands / June 16th \u2013 August 5th / Tickets On Sale Now / Blood On The Dance Floor |publisher=Vanswarpedtour.com |accessdate=July 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805020200/http://vanswarpedtour.com/band/blood-on-the-dance-floor |archivedate=August 5, 2012 }}</ref> and released the album while on tour.\n\nA music video for their hit single from the album, \"Bewitched\", featured \"Lady\" Nicole Nogrady, who later said that she felt disrespected by the band during production of the album as well as on the music video, and found herself having to confront the band directly in order for her name to appear on the credits of her work with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonademagazine.net/july2012 |title=Lady Nogrady Speaks Out |publisher=Lemonade Magazine |date=July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215045345/http://www.lemonademagazine.net/july2012 |archivedate=February 15, 2013 }}</ref> The song was subsequently performed by other female vocalists in place of Nogrady at live shows, and was re-recorded with vocals by Haley Rose for their 2013 acoustic album ''Blood Unplugged''.\n\nThe album peaked at No.&nbsp;13 on the ''Billboard'' Top Electronic Albums chart.<ref name=\"amg\"/> At the end of 2011, the duo headlined the All the Rage Tour and was planning the 'Tis the Season to be Killing Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurotrashmusic.co/2011/uncategorized/blood-on-the-dance-floor-all-the-rage-tour-dates/ |title=Blood On The Dance Floor:.

One day they decide to travel the world together with their two horses and two dogs but at some point they separate from each other.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=411\u2013439}}\n\n==Story==\n===Twins' birth===\nThere was a king who had lost his kingdom. Of all his wealth, he retained only two gold rings each adorned with a gem, a mare, a brave female dog, and a vegetable garden, where he lived with his wife. He used to spend the days hoeing the earth, his wife spinning linen and wool. They were happy in the quiet of the fields and in the tranquility of a solitary life. The only thing missing them was a son.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=426}} One morning the king went to the seashore and caught a big red fish, which resulted magic as it began to speak and told the king to divide it into four pieces, giving his wife the part that was on the side of the head, eating the middle part himself, giving a piece from the part of the tail to the mare and another to the dog, and burying the bones in the garden. The king fulfilled the instructions of the fish. Time passed and his wife gave birth to two male twins, Zjerma{{efn|The term ''zjerma'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''zjarm'', which means \"fire\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=47}}}} and Handa,{{efn|The term ''handa'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''hana'', which means \"moon\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=20}}}} the one with the Sun and the other with the Moon in their forehead; while the mare gave birth to two foals, the dog to two puppies, and two silver swords appeared in the garden. The mother raised her twins with care, and the father taught them to ride even without a saddle, to use the spear and the bow, the sword and the dagger, and to hunt in the mountains and forests.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=427}}\n\n===King's death and Twins' departure===\nWhen the twins became nineteen, the old man fell ill and realized he was joined by the black [[ora (mythology)|ora]]. He called his sons in front of the bed, he recommended them never to forget that in their veins pure king's blood flowed, to love each other as they had done until that day, to take care of their old mother, and to leave a good name, doing good to everyone, wherever they happened to pass. Before dying he gave each of them one of his gold [[Magic ring|rings]]. They buried him with all his weapons and [[Vajtim|mourned]] him for nine days and for nine nights. The queen suffered a lot for her husband's death, but she was comforted by her two sons. So she went back to spinning linen and wool all day. A farmer started to work in the garden, while his wife took care of the housework.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=427\u2013428}}\n\nAfter a year Zjerma told Handa that he intended to leave and travel the world in order to gain fame and conquer some kingdom, so they could rise again in the high glory of their ancestors. He proposed to gird their silver swords, to mount on their steeds, to take with them the two dogs who were not afraid to attack even a [[drangue]], and to depart. As for their mother, although old, she was healthy and there was already someone who could help her. Handa accepted his brother's proposal, so the two greeted their mother and left with the horses and dogs.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\nOn their journey they came to a water source that was at the foot of a flowering almond tree, where the road split. There they decided to separate and follow their own [[fate]], according to the choice of the horses, [[Besa (Albanian culture)|swearing]] to be in that place every year on the same day. In the event that one of the two had found himself in danger and had thus needed the help of the other, the gem of the ring would have lost its radiance, darkening and eventually becoming completely black, so the other would have rushed to the rescue. The two brothers hug each other, subsequently the horse of Zjerma went towards the way on the right and that of Handa towards the other on the left.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\n===Zjerma's journey===\n====Kulshedra: the seven-headed dragon====\nAfter a few days, Zjerma arrived in a city where he noticed that all the streets were empy and the houses were closed. At some point he arrived in front of the great temple of the Sun, where he saw an old man crying, thus Zjerma asked him for informations about that mysterious situation.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}} The old man answered that the [[kulshedra]] appeared about a month before at the sources of the river and blocked the waters causing drought in the region. All the valiant heroes who tried to slay the monster were defeated and perished. So the elders suggested to the king to find an agreement with the monster if she was willing to release the waters. She accepted only on the condition of receiving daily the offering of one of the most beautiful maidens. The old man told Zjerma that his daughter was sent the day before, while king's daughter Bardhakuqja (\"Whitered\") was sent that day, and the king had promised his daughter in marriage to whatever man succeeded in slaying the dragon.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\nZjerma then promised the old man that he would avenge his daughter and departed immediately with his animal companions.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}} The hero soon reached a dark valley, in the midst of high mountains, where the head of the river consisted of a deep and wide abyss, at the bottom of which the monster lived. There the wretched maiden was tied to a boulder, almost lifeless. Seeing the [[Princess and dragon|princess]], still radiant in her great beauty, Zjerma felt all his blood stirring in his veins. Her big blue eyes saw Zjerma, and immediately she told him to go away to save his life. But the hero was there to save her and free the city, thus he dismounted and freed the princess. Because he was very tired, he wanted to rest holding his head on her knees before the arrival of the monster, so he lay down on the ground and soon fell asleep.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\nAt noon the water began to move and the beauty realized that the [[kulshedra]] was about to come out, however she did not have the courage to wake Zjerma up, and began to cry, but a tear woke him up. Zjerma mounted his horse and brandished the silver sword, waiting for the monster. The water was boiling and from its waves the seven heads of the kulshedra emerged, of which, the central one was horned and with a seven-pointed crown. Poison was flowing between her teeth and forked tongues were hissing, while her mouths were spitting fire. When the kulshedra jumped to the ground Zjerma saw that her body was similar to that of a giant lizard, but equipped with a segmented armor, made of bone hard as steel. In the back there was a serpentine tail with nine knots and covered with hard scales. Her legs were short, but large and robust, with curved claws as hard as iron. On her back she had a kind of fish fin that dilated and narrowed by means of certain mobile antennas that ended like boar tusks. She had wings like those of a bat, but nine times larger than those of a large hawk.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}}\n\n====Dragon Slayer====\nWhen the kulshedra was about to pounce, Zjerma attacked her together with the horse and went up to the monster, while the dog bit her behind. The kulshedra writhed spitting flames and hissing from her mouths, striving to bite the enemies and crush them with her tail, but the horse trampled on her with its paws denting the bony armor and breaking the scales that protected her body, while the hero uninterruptedly wounded her with the sword, cutting off her heads, in vain because they leapt from the ground and sticked to the bloody necks again. He realized that he would have to cut off her central head to kill her. Meanwhile, a thick black cloud covered the valley, full of thunders and lightning.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}} Finally Zjerma's sword struck and cut off the central head, and a torrent of boiling black blood erupted along with flames from the neck, accompanied by a very loud screech. The cloud cleared and the Sun shone. The waters began to flow again into the river renewing life in the region.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=431}}\n\nZjerma cut off kulshedra's tongues and put them in the saddlebag along with the crowned head. He washed himself in the river with the horse and the dog. Then he helped the princess to mount on horseback and brought her into the city, where the hero was greeted with celebrations and honors. Meanwhile, [[False hero|Barkulku]] (\"Wolfbelly\") passed near the source of the river and noticed the dead kulshedra. Not knowing what had happened, he cut off the remaining heads and put them in a sack hoping to get some reward. He arrived in the city at the same time Zjerma and Bardhakuqja were getting married. Then Barkulku approached the foot of the throne, and in the presence of all the people he shouted that he had killed the kulshedra, consequently the reward had to be his. The king asked him to prove what he claimed. So Barkulku pulled out the heads of the kulshedra, but Zjerma pointed out that the crowned head was missing along with the tongues, thus he took them out of his saddlebag and showed them to everyone.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=431\u2013432}} The king [[Besa (Albanian culture)|swore]] by the Sun that if Barkulku had no other arguments to defend himself, he would have given the order to burn him. Thus Barkulku attacked Zjerma, but during the battle he was wounded and finally killed by the real [[Dragonslayer|dragon slayer]].{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=432}}\n\nWhen Zjerma and Bardhakuqja were about to put garlands on their heads, Zjerma realized that the gem of his ring lost its radiance and began darkening. Suddenly Zjerma stopped the ceremony saying that he had to leave urgently. He kissed the bride and told her to wait for him for a year, a month and a day. If he hadn't come back in time, she would have been free to remarry. He greeted everyone and departed to rescue his brother with his horse and dog.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=432\u2013433}}\n\n===Handa's journey===\nAfter separating from his brother, Handa and his animal companions crossed plains, hills and mountains, and finally arrived in a thick forest. He proceeded with difficulty often cutting the plants to make his way. When the forest became thinner, the young man noticed a hut near a stream, at the entrance of which an old man was resting. They greeted each other and the elder immediately advised Handa not to continue on the direction he had taken because he would face many risks, even worse than death, but the young man replied that he had to follow his [[fate]], thus he continued on his way.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=433}} After a while he arrived in the garden of the [[Zana (mythology)|Zanas]]. There, white dressed nymphs welcomed him with laughs, songs and dances. They charmed the young man with kisses and caresses, then they informed him that [[e Bukura e Dheut]] (\"the Earthly Beauty\") lived in the cave at the foot of the mountain, where that plain ended. It was easy to convince the inebriated Handa to go and find her in order to achieve his complete happiness.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=434}}\n\nHe left the Zanas and arrived with the horse and the dog at the entrance of a garden surrounded by a hedge of brambles and briars. An old woman appeared and asked him what he was looking for. He replied that he wanted to meet the Earthly Beauty and then to marry her. The old woman allowed him to enter only after a test of intelligence, of the ability to wield his sword and to ride his horse. The test consisted of solving a riddle, cutting a woolen bow in two pieces and climbing over the hedge on the horse's back without touching it. Handa failed all of them, and when he was in the garden, the [[shtriga|evil old woman]] sprayed him, the horse and the dog with an herbal ointment [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|transforming them into stone]]. It was then that Zjerma noticed the darkening of the gem of his ring.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=435}}\n\n====Brother's rescue====\nZjerma reached the source under the flowering almond tree, walked towards the way that Handa had taken before him, and finally arrived at the old man's hut. Once they greeted each other, the elder told the young man that his brother followed the path that led to the garden of the Earthly Beauty, that he unsuccessfully tried to convince him not to go, but his brother didn't listen him. The old man said that before him he saw many other men try that feat without ever going back. The [[wise old man]] invited Zjerma to enter the hut, where he gave him many secret teachings that could have helped him to save his brother. Later Zjerma greeted the old man and departed. In the garden of the Zanas the bright nymphs tried to entertain him with their songs and dances, but he did not stop, saying that they were very beautiful, but they were not for him.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=436}}\n\nAt the entrance of the garden of the Earthly Beauty he solved the riddle of the evil old woman, with the silver sword he cut the woolen bow in two pieces, then he jumped the hedge with his horse, but before the witch sprayed the herbal ointment on him, he captured her and tied her to a tree ordering her to show him his brother, otherwise he would kill her. Trembling, she showed him a great number of petrified brave men, among whom was also Handa. Thus he asked the witch to tell him what to do to get his brother back to life, she replied that he should anointed Handa's eyes and lips with the [[dew]] that he could have found inside the calyx of the [[white lily]]. Not finding the flower by himself, he ordered the witch to tell him its location, she obeyed.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=436}} The young man took the flower and with the dew sprinkled Handa's eyes and lips making him come back to life. Zjerma embraced Handa, thus he sprinkled also the horse and dog with the dew, and when he started waking up everyone else, the witch yelled at him to stop, but he paid no attention to her, so she [[Shapeshifting|transformed]] herself to a black [[bolla]] and tried to free herself by twisting, then she clung to a nearby tree trying to uproot the tree on which she was tied, but her body split into two pieces causing her death.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=437}}\n\nWhen all the petrified men came back to life, the twins realized that they were all young brave men of noble origins. Handa proposed to them, since they were all there for the [[E Bukura e Dheut|Earthly Beauty]]'s hand, to compete in a tournament. The brave men showed gratitude to his brother Zjerma who had saved their lives, thus they granted to Handa to marry her without having to fight. Zjerma begged everyone to follow him and his brother to visit the Beauty, they accepted.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=437}} At the head of that group of brave heroes, the twins arrived at the cave where the Earthly Beauty lived. There they found the immortal maiden in the shade of a cypress and vine, surrounded by her maids. She greeted the heroes and offered her hand to Handa. Earthly Beauty's eyes were lighter than Moon and she looked like the bright of Venus. Zjerma made two laurel wreaths and placed them on the head of Earthly Beauty and Handa. Nine-day celebrations followed.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}}\n\n===Twins' kingdoms===\nZjerma gathered all his brave companions in assembly and invited them to take part in the liberation of the kingdom of twins' ancestors from the foreign domination. Everyone approved his proposal and left for the war.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}} The twin's army was composed of a few men, but their value combined with the strength of Zjerma and Handa \u2013 comparable to that of a [[drangue]] \u2013 allowed them to win the battles for several months. When the foreign king realized that he no longer had hope of victory or of salvation, he joined his army in combat, but found death by Handa's silver sword. Being heir to his father-in-law's throne, Zjerma left Handa the part he owed of his ancestor's crown and recognized his brother as king. Then the two heroes took their mother back to her own kingdom. Afterwards Zjerma went with his army to Earthly Beauty's cave to bring her to his brother. After such a journey Zjerma became ill. Soon came the last day of the expiration of the time by which he should have returned to Bardhakuqja, but he had no strength to get out of bed, so he sent Handa to his beloved.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}}\n\nWhen Handa arrived in the city freed by his brother, everyone mistaken him for Zjerma. People there spent all day celebrating. At night Handa had to go to bed with her sister-in-law. He revealed the truth to her, then he placed the sword between them. In the morning Zjerma arrived unexpectedly, entered the room and saw the two sleeping in the same bed. At first he would have killed them both in their sleep, but he noticed Handa's silver sword which separated them better than a wall, he realized how the matter had gone and laughed waking them up.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=439}} The twins later went with Bardhakuqja to Handa's kingdom, where she met their mother and Handa's wife. After three months Zjerma and his wife returned home. There, since the king was very old and would have liked to rest, he gave his throne to Zjerma and placed the golden crown on his head.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=439}}\n\n==Classification==\nThe tale is [[Aarne\u2013Thompson]] type 303, \"The Twins or Blood Brothers\" including also the ATU type 300, \"The Dragon Slayer\".<ref name=\"Gonzenbach\"/>{{sfn|Thompson|1977|pp=27, 29}} Instead of the theme of the social rise of a young man of humble conditions \u2013 son of a fisherman \u2013 who is found in different variations of other traditions, in the Albanian version there is the theme of two brothers \u2013 sons of a king who has lost his throne, born one with the sun and the other with the moon in their forehead \u2013 who restore the initial order, regaining the former kingdom of their father.

One day they decide to travel the world together with their two horses and two dogs but at some point they separate from each other.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=411\u2013439}}\n\n==Story==\n===Twins' birth===\nThere was a king who had lost his kingdom. Of all his wealth, he retained only two gold rings each adorned with a gem, a mare, a brave female dog, and a vegetable garden, where he lived with his wife. He used to spend the days hoeing the earth, his wife spinning linen and wool. They were happy in the quiet of the fields and in the tranquility of a solitary life. The only thing missing them was a son.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=426}} One morning the king went to the seashore and caught a big red fish, which resulted magic as it began to speak and told the king to divide it into four pieces, giving his wife the part that was on the side of the head, eating the middle part himself, giving a piece from the part of the tail to the mare and another to the dog, and burying the bones in the garden. The king fulfilled the instructions of the fish. Time passed and his wife gave birth to two male twins, Zjerma{{efn|The term ''zjerma'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''zjarm'', which means \"fire\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=47}}}} and Handa,{{efn|The term ''handa'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''hana'', which means \"moon\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=20}}}} the one with the Sun and the other with the Moon in their forehead; while the mare gave birth to two foals, the dog to two puppies, and two silver swords appeared in the garden. The mother raised her twins with care, and the father taught them to ride even without a saddle, to use the spear and the bow, the sword and the dagger, and to hunt in the mountains and forests.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=427}}\n\n===King's death and Twins' departure===\nWhen the twins became nineteen, the old man fell ill and realized he was joined by the black [[ora (mythology)|ora]]. He called his sons in front of the bed, he recommended them never to forget that in their veins pure king's blood flowed, to love each other as they had done until that day, to take care of their old mother, and to leave a good name, doing good to everyone, wherever they happened to pass. Before dying he gave each of them one of his gold [[Magic ring|rings]]. They buried him with all his weapons and [[Vajtim|mourned]] him for nine days and for nine nights. The queen suffered a lot for her husband's death, but she was comforted by her two sons. So she went back to spinning linen and wool all day. A farmer started to work in the garden, while his wife took care of the housework.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=427\u2013428}}\n\nAfter a year Zjerma told Handa that he intended to leave and travel the world in order to gain fame and conquer some kingdom, so they could rise again in the high glory of their ancestors. He proposed to gird their silver swords, to mount on their steeds, to take with them the two dogs who were not afraid to attack even a [[drangue]], and to depart. As for their mother, although old, she was healthy and there was already someone who could help her. Handa accepted his brother's proposal, so the two greeted their mother and left with the horses and dogs.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\nOn their journey they came to a water source that was at the foot of a flowering almond tree, where the road split. There they decided to separate and follow their own [[fate]], according to the choice of the horses, [[Besa (Albanian culture)|swearing]] to be in that place every year on the same day. In the event that one of the two had found himself in danger and had thus needed the help of the other, the gem of the ring would have lost its radiance, darkening and eventually becoming completely black, so the other would have rushed to the rescue. The two brothers hug each other, subsequently the horse of Zjerma went towards the way on the right and that of Handa towards the other on the left.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\n===Zjerma's journey===\n====Kulshedra: the seven-headed dragon====\nAfter a few days, Zjerma arrived in a city where he noticed that all the streets were empy and the houses were closed. At some point he arrived in front of the great temple of the Sun, where he saw an old man crying, thus Zjerma asked him for informations about that mysterious situation.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}} The old man answered that the [[kulshedra]] appeared about a month before at the sources of the river and blocked the waters causing drought in the region. All the valiant heroes who tried to slay the monster were defeated and perished. So the elders suggested to the king to find an agreement with the monster if she was willing to release the waters. She accepted only on the condition of receiving daily the offering of one of the most beautiful maidens. The old man told Zjerma that his daughter was sent the day before, while king's daughter Bardhakuqja (\"Whitered\") was sent that day, and the king had promised his daughter in marriage to whatever man succeeded in slaying the dragon.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\nZjerma then promised the old man that he would avenge his daughter and departed immediately with his animal companions.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}} The hero soon reached a dark valley, in the midst of high mountains, where the head of the river consisted of a deep and wide abyss, at the bottom of which the monster lived. There the wretched maiden was tied to a boulder, almost lifeless. Seeing the [[Princess and dragon|princess]], still radiant in her great beauty, Zjerma felt all his blood stirring in his veins. Her big blue eyes saw Zjerma, and immediately she told him to go away to save his life. But the hero was there to save her and free the city, thus he dismounted and freed the princess. Because he was very tired, he wanted to rest holding his head on her knees before the arrival of the monster, so he lay down on the ground and soon fell asleep.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\nAt noon the water began to move and the beauty realized that the [[kulshedra]] was about to come out, however she did not have the courage to wake Zjerma up, and began to cry, but a tear woke him up. Zjerma mounted his horse and brandished the silver sword, waiting for the monster. The water was boiling and from its waves the seven heads of the kulshedra emerged, of which, the central one was horned and with a seven-pointed crown. Poison was flowing between her teeth and forked tongues were hissing, while her mouths were spitting fire. When the kulshedra jumped to the ground Zjerma saw that her body was similar to that of a giant lizard, but equipped with a segmented armor, made of bone hard as steel. In the back there was a serpentine tail with nine knots and covered with hard scales. Her legs were short, but large and robust, with curved claws as hard as iron. On her back she had a kind of fish fin that dilated and narrowed by means of certain mobile antennas that ended like boar tusks. She had wings like those of a bat, but nine times larger than those of a large hawk.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}}\n\n====Dragon Slayer====\nWhen the kulshedra was about to pounce, Zjerma attacked her together with the horse and went up to the monster, while the dog bit her behind. The kulshedra writhed spitting flames and hissing from her mouths, striving to bite the enemies and crush them with her tail, but the horse trampled on her with its paws denting the bony armor and breaking the scales that protected her body, while the hero uninterruptedly wounded her with the sword, cutting off her heads, in vain because they leapt from the ground and sticked to the bloody necks again. He realized that he would have to cut off her central head to kill her. Meanwhile, a thick black cloud covered the valley, full of thunders and lightning.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}} Finally Zjerma's sword struck and cut off the central head, and a torrent of boiling black blood erupted along with flames from the neck, accompanied by a very loud screech. The cloud cleared and the Sun shone. The waters began to flow again into the river renewing life in the region.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=431}}\n\nZjerma cut off kulshedra's tongues and put them in the saddlebag along with the crowned head. He washed himself in the river with the horse and the dog. Then he helped the princess to mount on horseback and brought her into the city, where the hero was greeted with celebrations and honors. Meanwhile, [[False hero|Barkulku]] (\"Wolfbelly\") passed near the source of the river and noticed the dead kulshedra. Not knowing what had happened, he cut off the remaining heads and put them in a sack hoping to get some reward. He arrived in the city at the same time Zjerma and Bardhakuqja were getting married. Then Barkulku approached the foot of the throne, and in the presence of all the people he shouted that he had killed the kulshedra, consequently the reward had to be his. The king asked him to prove what he claimed. So Barkulku pulled out the heads of the kulshedra, but Zjerma pointed out that the crowned head was missing along with the tongues, thus he took them out of his saddlebag and showed them to everyone.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=431\u2013432}} The king [[Besa (Albanian culture)|swore]] by the Sun that if Barkulku had no other arguments to defend himself, he would have given the order to burn him. Thus Barkulku attacked Zjerma, but during the battle he was wounded and finally killed by the real [[Dragonslayer|dragon slayer]].{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=432}}\n\nWhen Zjerma and Bardhakuqja were about to put garlands on their heads, Zjerma realized that the gem of his ring lost its radiance and began darkening. Suddenly Zjerma stopped the ceremony saying that he had to leave urgently. He kissed the bride and told her to wait for him for a year, a month and a day. If he hadn't come back in time, she would have been free to remarry. He greeted everyone and departed to rescue his brother with his horse and dog.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=432\u2013433}}\n\n===Handa's journey===\nAfter separating from his brother, Handa and his animal companions crossed plains, hills and mountains, and finally arrived in a thick forest. He proceeded with difficulty often cutting the plants to make his way. When the forest became thinner, the young man noticed a hut near a stream, at the entrance of which an old man was resting. They greeted each other and the elder immediately advised Handa not to continue on the direction he had taken because he would face many risks, even worse than death, but the young man replied that he had to follow his [[fate]], thus he continued on his way.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=433}} After a while he arrived in the garden of the [[Zana (mythology)|Zanas]]. There, white dressed nymphs welcomed him with laughs, songs and dances. They charmed the young man with kisses and caresses, then they informed him that [[e Bukura e Dheut]] (\"the Earthly Beauty\") lived in the cave at the foot of the mountain, where that plain ended. It was easy to convince the inebriated Handa to go and find her in order to achieve his complete happiness.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=434}}\n\nHe left the Zanas and arrived with the horse and the dog at the entrance of a garden surrounded by a hedge of brambles and briars. An old woman appeared and asked him what he was looking for. He replied that he wanted to meet the Earthly Beauty and then to marry her. The old woman allowed him to enter only after a test of intelligence, of the ability to wield his sword and to ride his horse. The test consisted of solving a riddle, cutting a woolen bow in two pieces and climbing over the hedge on the horse's back without touching it. Handa failed all of them, and when he was in the garden, the [[shtriga|evil old woman]] sprayed him, the horse and the dog with an herbal ointment [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|transforming them into stone]]. It was then that Zjerma noticed the darkening of the gem of his ring.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=435}}\n\n====Brother's rescue====\nZjerma reached the source under the flowering almond tree, walked towards the way that Handa had taken before him, and finally arrived at the old man's hut. Once they greeted each other, the elder told the young man that his brother followed the path that led to the garden of the Earthly Beauty, that he unsuccessfully tried to convince him not to go, but his brother didn't listen him. The old man said that before him he saw many other men try that feat without ever going back. The [[wise old man]] invited Zjerma to enter the hut, where he gave him many secret teachings that could have helped him to save his brother. Later Zjerma greeted the old man and departed. In the garden of the Zanas the bright nymphs tried to entertain him with their songs and dances, but he did not stop, saying that they were very beautiful, but they were not for him.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=436}}\n\nAt the entrance of the garden of the Earthly Beauty he solved the riddle of the evil old woman, with the silver sword he cut the woolen bow in two pieces, then he jumped the hedge with his horse, but before the witch sprayed the herbal ointment on him, he captured her and tied her to a tree ordering her to show him his brother, otherwise he would kill her. Trembling, she showed him a great number of petrified brave men, among whom was also Handa. Thus he asked the witch to tell him what to do to get his brother back to life, she replied that he should anointed Handa's eyes and lips with the [[dew]] that he could have found inside the calyx of the [[white lily]]. Not finding the flower by himself, he ordered the witch to tell him its location, she obeyed.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=436}} The young man took the flower and with the dew sprinkled Handa's eyes and lips making him come back to life. Zjerma embraced Handa, thus he sprinkled also the horse and dog with the dew, and when he started waking up everyone else, the witch yelled at him to stop, but he paid no attention to her, so she [[Shapeshifting|transformed]] herself to a black [[bolla]] and tried to free herself by twisting, then she clung to a nearby tree trying to uproot the tree on which she was tied, but her body split into two pieces causing her death.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=437}}\n\nWhen all the petrified men came back to life, the twins realized that they were all young brave men of noble origins. Handa proposed to them, since they were all there for the [[E Bukura e Dheut|Earthly Beauty]]'s hand, to compete in a tournament. The brave men showed gratitude to his brother Zjerma who had saved their lives, thus they granted to Handa to marry her without having to fight. Zjerma begged everyone to follow him and his brother to visit the Beauty, they accepted.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=437}} At the head of that group of brave heroes, the twins arrived at the cave where the Earthly Beauty lived. There they found the immortal maiden in the shade of a cypress and vine, surrounded by her maids. She greeted the heroes and offered her hand to Handa. Earthly Beauty's eyes were lighter than Moon and she looked like the bright of Venus. Zjerma made two laurel wreaths and placed them on the head of Earthly Beauty and Handa. Nine-day celebrations followed.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}}\n\n===Twins' kingdoms===\nZjerma gathered all his brave companions in assembly and invited them to take part in the liberation of the kingdom of twins' ancestors from the foreign domination. Everyone approved his proposal and left for the war.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}} The twin's army was composed of a few men, but their value combined with the strength of Zjerma and Handa \u2013 comparable to that of a [[drangue]] \u2013 allowed them to win the battles for several months. When the foreign king realized that he no longer had hope of victory or of salvation, he joined his army in combat, but found death by Handa's silver sword. Being heir to his father-in-law's throne, Zjerma left Handa the part he owed of his ancestor's crown and recognized his brother as king. Then the two heroes took their mother back to her own kingdom. Afterwards Zjerma went with his army to Earthly Beauty's cave to bring her to his brother. After such a journey Zjerma became ill. Soon came the last day of the expiration of the time by which he should have returned to Bardhakuqja, but he had no strength to get out of bed, so he sent Handa to his beloved.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}}\n\nWhen Handa arrived in the city freed by his brother, everyone mistaken him for Zjerma. People there spent all day celebrating. At night Handa had to go to bed with her sister-in-law. He revealed the truth to her, then he placed the sword between them. In the morning Zjerma arrived unexpectedly, entered the room and saw the two sleeping in the same bed. At first he would have killed them both in their sleep, but he noticed Handa's silver sword which separated them better than a wall, he realized how the matter had gone and laughed waking them up.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=439}} The twins later went with Bardhakuqja to Handa's kingdom, where she met their mother and Handa's wife. After three months Zjerma and his wife returned home. There, since the king was very old and would have liked to rest, he gave his throne to Zjerma and placed the golden crown on his head.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=439}}\n\n==Classification==\nThe tale is [[Aarne\u2013Thompson]] type 303, \"The Twins or Blood Brothers\" including also the ATU type 300, \"The Dragon Slayer\".<ref name=\"Gonzenbach\"/>{{sfn|Thompson|1977|pp=27, 29}} Instead of the theme of the social rise of a young man of humble conditions \u2013 son of a fisherman \u2013 who is found in different variations of other traditions, in the Albanian version there is the theme of two brothers \u2013 sons of a king who has lost his throne, born one with the sun and the other with the moon in their forehead \u2013 who restore the initial order, regaining the former kingdom of their father.

Woody then pecks his name into a [[tree]]. In [[Seattle]], Lance Walters, a real estate [[lawyer]], gets fired after a video of him claiming wildlife conservation is unprofitable goes viral. He tells his girlfriend Vanessa that he intends to build an investment home on a large piece of property located near the [[Canada|Canadian]] border, left to him by his grandfather. Meanwhile, Lance's ex-wife Linda leaves their son Tommy with him and Vanessa, since she needs to visit her hospitalized father in [[Philadelphia]].\n\nAt the Pine Grove forest, Lance, Tommy, and Vanessa meet the park ranger named Samantha Bartlett. As Lance and Vanessa unpack, Tommy goes into the forest for a walk. There, he discovers and befriends Woody after he gives him [[peanut butter]] crackers. Woody visits the family at lunchtime and eats almost all of the food. Lance tries to shoo Woody away, but he accidentally wrecks the table and hits Vanessa in the face with a [[broom]]. The next morning, construction on the investment home begins, prompting an agitated Woody to cause chaos at the site. Later, in a nearby town, Tommy befriends a young musician named Jill, who persuades him to join her band in the annual Firefly Festival. Tommy is then saved from two [[bully|bullies]] by Woody.\n\nAs days pass, Lance grows more agitated because of Woody's constant interference with his project, and he goes to meet Samantha at the ranger station. She reveals that the woodpecker is an [[endangered species]] known as a red-crowned [[pileated woodpecker]], which [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] saw as a god of mischief and chaos. Lance continues with his work, but Vanessa leaves him after Woody blows up their RV with her inside as a prank. Samantha eventually advises Lance to get along with Woody. Lance reluctantly attempts to surrender to Woody by giving him crackers, but Woody agrees to let him and the workers continue with their construction, as long as he is given crackers every day. Eventually, the investment home is completed despite excessive payment and extended scheduling.\n\nAt the town's Firefly Festival, Tommy and Jill's drummer Lyle comes down with indigestion, prompting Woody to take over using a homemade drum kit. The performance is a hit, and Lance is surprised to hear that Woody gave Tommy some friendly support. Realizing that having humans around again isn't a bad idea, Woody heads back to the investment home and carves a [[mural]] above the fireplace. However, as he signs his name into the carving, he accidentally burns the house down after hitting exposed wiring. Ashamed of his mistake, he flies back to his tree. Infuriated by this, Lance hires Nate and Ottis to hunt Woody down. The brothers find him and tase him unconscious. As they leave, Tommy reprimands his father and runs away. He then forms a plan to rescue Woody and heads to Grimes' shack with Jill and Lyle, as the brothers try to sell Woody at an online [[black market]] auction.\n\nLance finds the mural that Woody had created. Having a change of heart, he enlists Samantha's help and they set out to find both Tommy and Woody. However, everyone is captured by the brothers. As Nate grabs a tranquilizer, Lance tilts his cage towards Woody's so he can free him. After beating the brothers, Woody chases them as they attempt to flee to Canada. He carves a hole in the middle of a bridge, and the brothers fall into the river below, where they are later arrested. Later, Lance apologizes to Woody for not knowing that the house fire was an accident and therefore replaces Woody's cut-down tree with a birdhouse. Woody accepts both the gift and the group to be called his new family, much to their generosity. That night, as Lance and Tommy fall asleep in a tent, Woody carves the words \"Home Sweet Home\" into the new birdhouse, only to accidentally make it topple onto the tent. After the credits, the Woody Woodpecker cartoon ''[[Niagara Fools]]'' is shown.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Eric Bauza]] as the voice of [[Woody Woodpecker]], a hyperactive, rare and mischievous [[pileated woodpecker]].\n*[[Timothy Omundson]] as Lance Walters, a [[Seattle]] lawyer who is the ex-husband of Linda, Tommy's father and Vanessa's boyfriend.\n**The name Lance is a reference to Walter Lantz, who created Woody Woodpecker.<ref name=CartoonBrewBrazilAud/>\n*[[Graham Verchere]] as Tommy Walters, the teenager son of Lance and the best friend of Woody.\n*Jordana Largy as Samantha Barlett, the park-ranger of Pine Grove.\n*[[Thaila Ayala]] as Vanessa, Lance's girlfriend.\n** Ayala was cast to add appeal in Brazil and in Brazilian dubbing, Ayala voiced herself. \n*Adrian Glynn McMorran as Ottis Grimes, a dummy furtive poacher and partner and younger brother of Nate.\n*[[Scott McNeil]] as Nate Grimes, a furtive poacher who want to capture, dissect and to sell Woody in auction.\n*Chelsea Miller as Jill Ferguson, a teenager bass guitarist who becomes Tommy's friend.\n*Jakob Davies as Lyle, a  drummer who is Jill's friend and becomes friend of Tommy.\n*Sean Tyson as George, a builder who directs the building of the new house of Lance.\n*Patrick Lubczyk as Chris,a bully who is the partner of John and threatens Tommy.\n*Ty Consiglio as John, a bully who also threatens Tommy in one part of the film.\n*[[Emily Holmes]] as Linda Walters, Lance's ex-wife and mother of Tommy.\n*[[Karin Konoval]] as Barbara Krum, the receptionist for Lance.\n\n==Production==\nIn November 2011, [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]] planned a ''Woody Woodpecker'' feature film.

Woody then pecks his name into a [[tree]]. In [[Seattle]], Lance Walters, a real estate [[lawyer]], gets fired after a video of him claiming wildlife conservation is unprofitable goes viral. He tells his girlfriend Vanessa that he intends to build an investment home on a large piece of property located near the [[Canada|Canadian]] border, left to him by his grandfather. Meanwhile, Lance's ex-wife Linda leaves their son Tommy with him and Vanessa, since she needs to visit her hospitalized father in [[Philadelphia]].\n\nAt the Pine Grove forest, Lance, Tommy, and Vanessa meet the park ranger named Samantha Bartlett. As Lance and Vanessa unpack, Tommy goes into the forest for a walk. There, he discovers and befriends Woody after he gives him [[peanut butter]] crackers. Woody visits the family at lunchtime and eats almost all of the food. Lance tries to shoo Woody away, but he accidentally wrecks the table and hits Vanessa in the face with a [[broom]]. The next morning, construction on the investment home begins, prompting an agitated Woody to cause chaos at the site. Later, in a nearby town, Tommy befriends a young musician named Jill, who persuades him to join her band in the annual Firefly Festival. Tommy is then saved from two [[bully|bullies]] by Woody.\n\nAs days pass, Lance grows more agitated because of Woody's constant interference with his project, and he goes to meet Samantha at the ranger station. She reveals that the woodpecker is an [[endangered species]] known as a red-crowned [[pileated woodpecker]], which [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] saw as a god of mischief and chaos. Lance continues with his work, but Vanessa leaves him after Woody blows up their RV with her inside as a prank. Samantha eventually advises Lance to get along with Woody. Lance reluctantly attempts to surrender to Woody by giving him crackers, but Woody agrees to let him and the workers continue with their construction, as long as he is given crackers every day. Eventually, the investment home is completed despite excessive payment and extended scheduling.\n\nAt the town's Firefly Festival, Tommy and Jill's drummer Lyle comes down with indigestion, prompting Woody to take over using a homemade drum kit. The performance is a hit, and Lance is surprised to hear that Woody gave Tommy some friendly support. Realizing that having humans around again isn't a bad idea, Woody heads back to the investment home and carves a [[mural]] above the fireplace. However, as he signs his name into the carving, he accidentally burns the house down after hitting exposed wiring. Ashamed of his mistake, he flies back to his tree. Infuriated by this, Lance hires Nate and Ottis to hunt Woody down. The brothers find him and tase him unconscious. As they leave, Tommy reprimands his father and runs away. He then forms a plan to rescue Woody and heads to Grimes' shack with Jill and Lyle, as the brothers try to sell Woody at an online [[black market]] auction.\n\nLance finds the mural that Woody had created. Having a change of heart, he enlists Samantha's help and they set out to find both Tommy and Woody. However, everyone is captured by the brothers. As Nate grabs a tranquilizer, Lance tilts his cage towards Woody's so he can free him. After beating the brothers, Woody chases them as they attempt to flee to Canada. He carves a hole in the middle of a bridge, and the brothers fall into the river below, where they are later arrested. Later, Lance apologizes to Woody for not knowing that the house fire was an accident and therefore replaces Woody's cut-down tree with a birdhouse. Woody accepts both the gift and the group to be called his new family, much to their generosity. That night, as Lance and Tommy fall asleep in a tent, Woody carves the words \"Home Sweet Home\" into the new birdhouse, only to accidentally make it topple onto the tent. After the credits, the Woody Woodpecker cartoon ''[[Niagara Fools]]'' is shown.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Eric Bauza]] as the voice of [[Woody Woodpecker]], a hyperactive, rare and mischievous [[pileated woodpecker]].\n*[[Timothy Omundson]] as Lance Walters, a [[Seattle]] lawyer who is the ex-husband of Linda, Tommy's father and Vanessa's boyfriend.\n**The name Lance is a reference to Walter Lantz, who created Woody Woodpecker.<ref name=CartoonBrewBrazilAud/>\n*[[Graham Verchere]] as Tommy Walters, the teenager son of Lance and the best friend of Woody.\n*Jordana Largy as Samantha Barlett, the park-ranger of Pine Grove.\n*[[Thaila Ayala]] as Vanessa, Lance's girlfriend.\n** Ayala was cast to add appeal in Brazil and in Brazilian dubbing, Ayala voiced herself. \n*Adrian Glynn McMorran as Ottis Grimes, a dummy furtive poacher and partner and younger brother of Nate.\n*[[Scott McNeil]] as Nate Grimes, a furtive poacher who want to capture, dissect and to sell Woody in auction.\n*Chelsea Miller as Jill Ferguson, a teenager bass guitarist who becomes Tommy's friend.\n*Jakob Davies as Lyle, a  drummer who is Jill's friend and becomes friend of Tommy.\n*Sean Tyson as George, a builder who directs the building of the new house of Lance.\n*Patrick Lubczyk as Chris,a bully who is the partner of John and threatens Tommy.\n*Ty Consiglio as John, a bully who also threatens Tommy in one part of the film.\n*[[Emily Holmes]] as Linda Walters, Lance's ex-wife and mother of Tommy.\n*[[Karin Konoval]] as Barbara Krum, the receptionist for Lance.\n\n==Production==\nIn November 2011, [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]] planned a ''Woody Woodpecker'' feature film.
