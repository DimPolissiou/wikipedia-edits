While initially skeptical that the Veyron would ever be produced, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] later declared the Veyron \"the greatest car ever made and the greatest car we will ever see in our lifetime\", comparing it to [[Concorde]] and [[SS Great Britain|S.S. ''Great Britain'']]. He also pointed out that the actual production cost of a Bugatti Veyron car was {{GBP|5 million}}, but was sold to customers for just {{GBP|1 million}}. When asked why, he jokingly said that [[Volkswagen]] designed the car merely as a \"Technical Exercise\". [[James May]] described the Veyron as \"our Concorde moment.\" Clarkson test drove the Veyron from [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] in northern Italy to [[London]] in a race against May and [[Richard Hammond]] who made the journey in a [[Cessna 182]] aeroplane.\n\nA few episodes later, May drove the Veyron at the VW test track and took it to its top speed of {{convert|407.16|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. In series 10, Hammond raced the Veyron against the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] and lost. He also raced the car in Series 13 against a [[McLaren F1]] driven by [[The Stig]] in a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) drag race in [[Abu Dhabi]]. The commentary focused on Bugatti's \"amazing technical achievement\" versus the \"non-gizmo\" racing purity of the F1. While the F1 was quicker off the line and remained ahead until both cars were travelling at approximately 200&nbsp;km/h, the Bugatti overtook its competitor from 200 to 300&nbsp;km/h and emerged the victor. Hammond has stated that he did not use the Veyron's [[Launch control (automotive)|launch control]] in order to make the race more interesting.\n\nThe Veyron also won the award for \"Car of the Decade\" in ''Top Gear'''s end of 2010 award show. Clarkson commented \"It was a car that just rewrote the rule book really, an amazing piece of engineering, a genuine Concorde moment\". When the standard version was tested in 2008, it did not reach the top of the lap time leader board, with a time of 1:18.3, which was speculated as being due to the car's considerable weight disadvantage against the other cars towards the top. In 2010 the Super Sport version achieved the fastest ever time of 1:16.8 (dethroned the [[Gumpert Apollo|Gumpert Apollo S]], replaced by the [[Ariel Atom V8]] in 2011),<ref name = \"tgpower\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/powerlaps.shtml\n| title = Power Laps\n| work  = [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear UK]]\n| publisher = BBC\n| accessdate = 29 November 2011\n}}</ref> as well as being taken to a verified average top speed of {{convert|431|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} by Raphanel on the programme,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/bugatti/8063779/Bugatti-Veyron-16.4-Super-Sport-review.html|title=Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport review|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|first=Paul|last=Hudson|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=1 November 2010|quote=The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport is officially the world\u2019s fastest production car, after reaching 431.072 km/h (267.856mph) at the VW group's Ehra-Lessien test track on 3 July.

While initially skeptical that the Veyron would ever be produced, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] later declared the Veyron \"the greatest car ever made and the greatest car we will ever see in our lifetime\", comparing it to [[Concorde]] and [[SS Great Britain|S.S. ''Great Britain'']]. He also pointed out that the actual production cost of a Bugatti Veyron car was {{GBP|5 million}}, but was sold to customers for just {{GBP|1 million}}. When asked why, he jokingly said that [[Volkswagen]] designed the car merely as a \"Technical Exercise\". [[James May]] described the Veyron as \"our Concorde moment.\" Clarkson test drove the Veyron from [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] in northern Italy to [[London]] in a race against May and [[Richard Hammond]] who made the journey in a [[Cessna 182]] aeroplane.\n\nA few episodes later, May drove the Veyron at the VW test track and took it to its top speed of {{convert|407.16|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. In series 10, Hammond raced the Veyron against the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] and lost. He also raced the car in Series 13 against a [[McLaren F1]] driven by [[The Stig]] in a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) drag race in [[Abu Dhabi]]. The commentary focused on Bugatti's \"amazing technical achievement\" versus the \"non-gizmo\" racing purity of the F1. While the F1 was quicker off the line and remained ahead until both cars were travelling at approximately 200&nbsp;km/h, the Bugatti overtook its competitor from 200 to 300&nbsp;km/h and emerged the victor. Hammond has stated that he did not use the Veyron's [[Launch control (automotive)|launch control]] in order to make the race more interesting.\n\nThe Veyron also won the award for \"Car of the Decade\" in ''Top Gear'''s end of 2010 award show. Clarkson commented \"It was a car that just rewrote the rule book really, an amazing piece of engineering, a genuine Concorde moment\". When the standard version was tested in 2008, it did not reach the top of the lap time leader board, with a time of 1:18.3, which was speculated as being due to the car's considerable weight disadvantage against the other cars towards the top. In 2010 the Super Sport version achieved the fastest ever time of 1:16.8 (dethroned the [[Gumpert Apollo|Gumpert Apollo S]], replaced by the [[Ariel Atom V8]] in 2011),<ref name = \"tgpower\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/powerlaps.shtml\n| title = Power Laps\n| work  = [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear UK]]\n| publisher = BBC\n| accessdate = 29 November 2011\n}}</ref> as well as being taken to a verified average top speed of {{convert|431|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} by Raphanel on the programme,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/bugatti/8063779/Bugatti-Veyron-16.4-Super-Sport-review.html|title=Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport review|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|first=Paul|last=Hudson|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=1 November 2010|quote=The Bugatti Veyron Super Sport is officially the world\u2019s fastest production car, after reaching 431.072 km/h (267.856mph) at the VW group's Ehra-Lessien test track on 3 July.

This was attributed to the consumption of a medicine called [[Jamaica Ginger]], which had been [[adulterated]] with TOCP. TOCP had been mixed into the alcoholic medicine so that the drink would pass inspection by [[prohibition]] officers without making the alcohol taste as bitter as other adulterants. This caused partial paralysis of many of its consumers, characterized by an awkward, high-kneed walk, dubbed \"Jake walk\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baum|first1=Dan|title=Annals of Epidemiology: Jake Leg|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2003-09-15#folio=052|work=archives.newyorker.com|publisher=The New Yorker}}</ref>\n\nIn [[World War 2]], there were several incidents in Switzerland and Germany. A Swiss military company improperly stored machine gun cooling oil in canisters that were also used for cooking oil. 74 soldiers were poisoned in [[M\u00fcmliswil-Ramiswil|Ramiswil]] and 10-12 civilians, too \u2013 because the soldiers had shared rations with them. They were known as \"[[Oil soldiers]]\" (''\u00d6lsoldaten'' in German). In the same year, a similar case occurred in central Switzerland when 17 soldiers ate salad with contaminated oil. In the winter of 1941/1942, torpedo oil was stolen from the torpedo trial facility at [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]], Germany, and was, due to scarcity of proper cooking oil, used in private households. About 70 people were affected in what was known as the \"Eckernf\u00f6rder Krankheit\" (disease of Eckernf\u00f6rde). Similar outbreaks happened in the harbor town of [[Kiel]] (1944) and again at Eckernf\u00f6rde (1949). Incidentally, torpedo oil from [[World War 1]] did not use additives, and in times of distress, it was used for cooking \u2013 without ill effects.\n\nAnother large outbreak of TOCP poisoning occurred in [[Meknes]], Morocco, in the 1960s. Of the 10,000 cases, nearly all of them were Arab and middle class, with the majority being women. The condition was found to be caused by the adulteration of cooking oil with lubricating oil used in jet engines which contained 3% mixed cresyl phosphates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Travers|first1=P.

This was attributed to the consumption of a medicine called [[Jamaica Ginger]], which had been [[adulterated]] with TOCP. TOCP had been mixed into the alcoholic medicine so that the drink would pass inspection by [[prohibition]] officers without making the alcohol taste as bitter as other adulterants. This caused partial paralysis of many of its consumers, characterized by an awkward, high-kneed walk, dubbed \"Jake walk\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baum|first1=Dan|title=Annals of Epidemiology: Jake Leg|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2003-09-15#folio=052|work=archives.newyorker.com|publisher=The New Yorker}}</ref>\n\nIn [[World War 2]], there were several incidents in Switzerland and Germany. A Swiss military company improperly stored machine gun cooling oil in canisters that were also used for cooking oil. 74 soldiers were poisoned in [[M\u00fcmliswil-Ramiswil|Ramiswil]] and 10-12 civilians, too \u2013 because the soldiers had shared rations with them. They were known as \"[[Oil soldiers]]\" (''\u00d6lsoldaten'' in German). In the same year, a similar case occurred in central Switzerland when 17 soldiers ate salad with contaminated oil. In the winter of 1941/1942, torpedo oil was stolen from the torpedo trial facility at [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]], Germany, and was, due to scarcity of proper cooking oil, used in private households. About 70 people were affected in what was known as the \"Eckernf\u00f6rder Krankheit\" (disease of Eckernf\u00f6rde). Similar outbreaks happened in the harbor town of [[Kiel]] (1944) and again at Eckernf\u00f6rde (1949). Incidentally, torpedo oil from [[World War 1]] did not use additives, and in times of distress, it was used for cooking \u2013 without ill effects.\n\nAnother large outbreak of TOCP poisoning occurred in [[Meknes]], Morocco, in the 1960s. Of the 10,000 cases, nearly all of them were Arab and middle class, with the majority being women. The condition was found to be caused by the adulteration of cooking oil with lubricating oil used in jet engines which contained 3% mixed cresyl phosphates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Travers|first1=P.

It is the third and best known of three books featuring the Makepeace sisters, Charlotte and Emma,<ref>Anita Silvey, ed: ''Children's books and their creators'' (New York, Houghton Mifflin, 1995), p. 238.</ref> sometimes known as the ''Aviary Hall'' books.<ref>[http://www.kidlit.co.uk/chars/c/xc030403.htm]</ref> The book inspired [[Charlotte Sometimes (song)|a song of the same name]] in 2007,<ref name=Farmer2007>''Charlotte Sometimes'' author Penelope Farmer [https://web.archive.org/web/20080512233831/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured.html one]</ref> and a number by the English rock band [[The Cure]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080218140007/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured-climaxed.html two] (via [[Archive.org]])</ref> The story centres on a girl starting at a [[boarding school]], who finds she has travelled mysteriously back more than 40 years. There the teachers and students call her \"Clare\". Charlotte and Clare change places each night, alternating between the years 1918 and Charlotte's time.<ref>Charlotte travels back to 1918 (p. 77). In Charlotte's time, the year is 1963, as the book states that Clare's time is more than 40 years before Charlotte's, and that 14 September was a Saturday in both years. The events take place about a year after those in ''The Summer Birds'', set in southern England in the early 1960s. Another World War I time-slip novel of the same period is the more matter-of-fact ''[[Jessamy]]'' (1967) by [[Barbara Sleigh]].</ref> Although Charlotte and Clare never meet, they communicate through diary notes in an exercise book. The story is wholly written from Charlotte's point of view: Clare never narrates. As it progresses, Charlotte becomes trapped in Clare's time, struggling to maintain her own identity.\n\n==Background==\nAt the age of twenty-one, Penelope Farmer was contracted for her first collection of short stories, ''The China People''. One story originally intended for this collection proved too long to include. This was rewritten as the first chapter of ''[[The Summer Birds]]'' (1962), her first book featuring Charlotte and Emma Makepeace.<ref>\"Penelope Farmer\" in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 67.</ref> A second book, ''[[Emma in Winter]]'', with Emma as the main character followed in 1966. ''Charlotte Sometimes'' was first published in 1969 by Harcourt in the United States, and by Chatto and Windus in the UK in the same year.\n\nPenelope Farmer arranged many of the incidents in ''Charlotte Sometimes'' ahead of time, based upon family experiences.<ref>Margaret K. McElderry, \"Penelope Farmer: The Development of an Author\". In ''Elementary English'' Vol. 51, No. 6, September 1974, p. 804. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref> She later wrote that Charlotte and Emma were originally based on her mother and her mother's sister as children, having no parents and \"having to be everything to each other,\" one being the responsible one, the other being rather difficult. She wrote, \"Emma and Charlotte have grown in their own ways and aren't exactly based on my mother and her sister now, but this is where it started.\"<ref name=\"Penelope Farmer 1985 p. 77.\">'Penelope Farmer' in ''Something About the Author'' 40 (1985) p. 77.</ref> Penelope Farmer's mother, Penelope Boothby, who was \"talkative and unconventional\", besides being the inspiration for Emma, was also the inspiration for the character of Emily.<ref>'Penelope Farmer' in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 66.</ref> The boarding school's location in the novel is set near where Penelope Farmer lived in London.<ref name=\"Penelope Farmer 1985 p. 77.\" /> The school, along with its pillared front door, glass verandah and cedar tree, was based on the [[West Heath School]] in Sevenoaks, which the author and her twin sister Judith attended in the 1950s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512233831/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured.html \"The Cure(d)\". Penelope Farmer's personal blog entry, 9 June 2007]</ref>  Some of the characters there were based on real students of the time.  The episode when Charlotte walks onto the glass verandah is based on a real event when Penelope Farmer climbed on the glass, breaking it.  <ref>[http://grannyp.blogspot.com/search/label/Charlotte%20Sometimes%20and%20The%20Cure. Penelope Farmer's personal blog entry, 21 November 2007]</ref>\n\nTwo versions of the novel's text exist.  A revised edition of the novel was published by Dell in 1985, with a number of changes by the author.  Almost all of the revisions were minor, such as modernisations of vocabulary and punctuation, and minor re-wording of sentences.  However, the most significant change is that a few events at the end of the story were removed.  These include a poignant episode where Charlotte, back in her own time, receives a package and a letter from Clare's sister, Emily, as an adult.  Also removed was the original ending of the novel, in which the end of term comes, and the boarders ride away in the school bus, with Charlotte among them, heading home to Aviary Hall.\n\nThe book has been re-issued, with the original text, in [[The New York Review Children's Collection]].\n\n\n==Plot==\n===Part one===\nCharlotte arrives at a new boarding school, and is shown around by a [[prefect]] named Sarah. Sarah's mother also attended the school. She is shown a room that she shares with other girls (Suzanna, Elizabeth). The next morning she finds herself in the same place, but in the year 1918 \u2013 with war still going on. A younger girl called Emily calls Charlotte her sister, and addresses her as \"Clare\". She tries to spend the day in 1918 without being noticed. Each night, Charlotte finds herself swapping between her own time and Clare's time. They must learn to live two different lives. Charlotte and Clare manage to write to each other via Clare's diary, which they share and hide in their bed.\n\nEmily and Clare are supposed to leave their room soon and go into lodgings with the Chisel Brown family. They have to make sure this happens when Clare is in 1918, because they won't be able to switch again after that.\n\n===Part two===\nCharlotte, expecting to have returned to her own time for the last time, is shocked to find that she has not, and is still in 1918. She will go into lodgings with the Chisel Brown family: it appears she will be trapped in the past. In the house, Miss Agnes Chisel Brown shows Charlotte and Emily the toys she had once played with. These include toy soldiers and a solitaire board with marbles.  She tells the two girls about her brother Arthur, who died in the [[World War I|war]]. Charlotte reflects, forward and back: to Arthur in the past; her own sister Emma in the future; and Clare, trapped in Charlotte's time. She struggles with her identity as being Charlotte sometimes, but Clare at other times.\n\nCharlotte and Emily form a plan to enter the school by night in an attempt to get Charlotte into the bed which will take Charlotte back to her own time. Inside her room, which is now being used as the school sick room, Charlotte finds the bed is occupied, and thus she cannot return home. She escapes being seen by Nurse Gregory, but is seen by another student, Ruth.\n\nCharlotte is not the only one who struggles with identity. Emily tells of the wretchedness of being motherless and unwanted, moving around between homes while her father fights in the war. Meanwhile, Charlotte dreams she is fighting to stay as Charlotte. She dreams about Arthur.\n\nA letter arrives for Clare and Emily from their father. Emily does not let Charlotte read it, to the bewilderment of the other girls. Charlotte, thoughtful as always, wonders who Sarah's mother is: perhaps it will be Charlotte herself if she is trapped in 1918?\n\nAt night, Charlotte dreams about Arthur again, as a drummer boy, and that she has turned into Agnes. Her crisis of identity comes to a head as she struggles to preserve her identity as Charlotte.\n\nOne evening, the Chisel Browns hold a [[seance]] in an attempt to speak to Arthur. The girls hide behind the curtains to observe. During the seance, they hear Clare's voice crying out for Emily. Emily cries out, and the two girls are discovered and disciplined. Later, Miss Agnes asks about the voice they heard at the seance \u2013 Clare's. She then tells Charlotte and Emily of Arthur's war experiences.\n\nFinally, the [[Armistice]] comes. The war is over: people dance and celebrate in the street, and Charlotte and Emily join in, even though it would anger Mr Chisel Brown. In disgrace, Charlotte and Emily are sent back to the school. Miss Agnes gives them the toys as a gift.\n\n===Part three===\nRuth recalls her \"dream\" of seeing Clare whilst in the sick room. Because of the [[Spanish flu|flu epidemic]], the students are able to play wild games in the dormitories, and eventually, Charlotte is finally able to sleep in the bed that will return her to her own time.\n\nOn arriving back in her own time, Charlotte is surprised to learn that her room-mate Elizabeth had deduced the truth about her swap with Clare. Charlotte wonders about Sarah's mother and what has become of Emily and Clare. At the school, Charlotte sees the elderly Miss Wilkin.  Charlotte realises that she had known Miss Wilkin when she was a young teacher in 1918.\n\nOne day, Charlotte has a conversation with Sarah, and learns what has become of Emily and Clare. Sarah's mother is Emily, and Clare died in the flu epidemic after the war. Later, Charlotte and Elizabeth discuss the events Charlotte has experienced. They find the exercise book in the bed leg, having been there for forty years, finding the last letter Charlotte wrote to Clare.\n\nCharlotte receives a package from Emily as an adult. It contains a letter from Emily, and the toys which Miss Agnes had given them, over forty years ago. Charlotte places the marbles from the solitaire set in a jar and fills it with water, which the other girls admire.  Charlotte feels a sense of personal identity in now having her own decoration to her dresser, yet muses that the marbles belonged her when she was living the life of another person, namely Clare.  The end of term comes, and the boarders leave the school in the school bus, while singing rhymes. <ref>Penelope Farmer ''Charlotte Sometimes'', Harcourt, 1969.  This last episode is not in the 1985 Revised edition</ref>\n\n\n==Continuity==\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' begins one year after the ending of ''The Summer Birds'', after Charlotte has left her small village school, and covers the period of her first term at boarding school. While written three years after ''Emma in Winter'' \u2014 set during Charlotte's second term at boarding school \u2014 the events of ''Charlotte Sometimes'' occur beforehand. Charlotte's sister Emma and their grandfather Elijah do not appear in ''Charlotte Sometimes'', although there are references to them. For example, Charlotte compares Emily with her sister Emma in her own time; and compares the Chisel Brown family home with her own home, Aviary Hall.\n\n''Emma in Winter'' begins during the same Christmas holidays where ''Charlotte Sometimes'' ends, and indicates that Charlotte will stay a week with one of the friends she made at boarding school during the events of ''Charlotte Sometimes''.<ref>Penelope Farmer, ''Emma in Winter''. London: [[Chatto & Windus]], 1969, p. 6.</ref> ''Emma in Winter'' then follows Emma's story while Charlotte returns to boarding school.\n\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Identity===\nWhile she had been writing ''Emma in Winter'', Farmer was not aware that identity was such a predominant theme in the book.  She only realised this later, when she encountered [[Margery Fisher]]'s comments on the book in ''Growing Point''.  She had a similar realisation, this time on her own, while writing ''Charlotte Sometimes''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Writers, Critics, and Children |url=https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg |url-access=registration |editor= Geoff Fox|editor2= Graham Hammond|editor3= Terry Jones|editor4= Frederic Smith|editor5= Kenneth Sterck |year=1976 |publisher=Agathon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-87586-054-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg/page/60 60] }}</ref>  She writes, \"...halfway through ''Charlotte Sometimes'' I realized that I was writing a book about identity.  I am a twin, a nonidentical one, and apparently one of the chief problems of nonidentical twins is always the establishment of a genuine and separate sense of identity.  Looking back I can see this has in fact been an obsession with me, since the age of twelve or so at least.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Penelope (Jane) Farmer 1939- |journal=Children's Literature Review |date=1985 |volume=8 |page=65}}</ref>\n\nAuthor [[David Rees (author)|David Rees]] also points out that identity as a major theme.  He wrote, \"Its most memorable passages are poignant or resigned or concerned with absence, loss, or death... Its theme is not so much maturing relationships, but identity...  Charlotte begins to wonder, with increasing dismay, if she really is Charlotte: perhaps she has turned into Clare, rather than just substituted for her.  This may be an adult fear \u2013 the fear of not being everything you and other people have always said you are, the realization that you may be someone totally different.\"<ref name=\"Rees\">David Rees, 'The Marble in the Water: Penelope Farmer,'. In ''The Marble in the Water: Essays on Contemporary Writers of Fiction for Children and Young Adults'', The Horn Book, Inc., 1980, pp. 1-13. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Time Travel===\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' continues the theme, begun in ''Emma in Winter'', of time travel into the past. While this is unexplained in ''Charlotte Sometimes'', a theorised explanation is given in ''Emma in Winter''. Emma and Bobby are reading journals in Emma and Charlotte's grandfather Elijah's study, where they find an article theorising the non-linear nature of time. It describes time as being like a coiled spring, which can be pushed together, so that some moments in time can be very near a moment in another time.<ref>Penelope Farmer, ''Emma in Winter''. London: Chatto & Windus, 1969, Ch. 4.</ref>\n\n\n==Reviews==\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' received widespread acclaim by reviewers.\n\n[[Margery Fisher]], in a 1969 review for her children's literature journal ''Growing Point'', wrote: \"Like ''Emma in Winter'', this is really a study in disintegration, the study of a girl finding an identity by losing it... Above all, here is a dream-allegory which teaches not through statement but through feeling. We sense the meaning of Charlotte's changes of identity in the way that she senses them herself... [It is] a book of quite exceptional distinction... a haunting, convincing story which comes close to being a masterpiece of its kind... \"<ref>Margery Fisher, review of ''Charlotte Sometimes'', ''Growing Point'', November 1969, p. 1408, cited in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 68.</ref>\n\nChildren's novelist [[Eleanor Cameron]] wrote, \"Farmer writes with style. She is vivid in her depiction of place: on almost every page, scattered with colorful figures of speech, we are drawn into the school and the surroundings of the school through sights and sounds and smells and textures... above all we are moved by the depth and poignancy of the relationship between Charlotte and Emily.\" She continues, \"Farmer is always gifted in her grasp of possibilities that bring us up short with surprise and delight and satisfaction.\"<ref name=\"Dell\">Penelope Farmer''Charlotte Sometimes''.

It is the third and best known of three books featuring the Makepeace sisters, Charlotte and Emma,<ref>Anita Silvey, ed: ''Children's books and their creators'' (New York, Houghton Mifflin, 1995), p. 238.</ref> sometimes known as the ''Aviary Hall'' books.<ref>[http://www.kidlit.co.uk/chars/c/xc030403.htm]</ref> The book inspired [[Charlotte Sometimes (song)|a song of the same name]] in 2007,<ref name=Farmer2007>''Charlotte Sometimes'' author Penelope Farmer [https://web.archive.org/web/20080512233831/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured.html one]</ref> and a number by the English rock band [[The Cure]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080218140007/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured-climaxed.html two] (via [[Archive.org]])</ref> The story centres on a girl who on starting at a [[boarding school]], finds she has travelled mysteriously back more than 40 years. There the teachers and students call her \"Clare\". Charlotte and Clare change places each night, alternating between the years 1918 and Charlotte's time.<ref>Charlotte travels back in time to the year 1918 (p. 77). In Charlotte's time, the year is 1963, as the book states that Clare's time is more than 40 years before Charlotte's, and that 14 September was a Saturday in both years. The events in the book take place about a year after those in ''The Summer Birds'', set in southern England in the early 1960s. Another World War I time-slip novel of the same period is the more matter-of-fact ''[[Jessamy]]'' (1967) by [[Barbara Sleigh]].</ref> Although Charlotte and Clare never meet, they communicate through diary notes in an old exercise book. The story is wholly written from Charlotte's point of view: Clare never narrates. As the story progresses, Charlotte becomes trapped in Clare's time, struggling to maintain her own identity as Charlotte.\n\n\n==Background==\nAt the age of twenty-one, Penelope Farmer was contracted for her first collection of short stories, ''The China People''. One story originally intended for this collection proved too long to include. This was rewritten as the first chapter of ''[[The Summer Birds]]'' (1962), her first book featuring Charlotte and Emma Makepeace.<ref>\"Penelope Farmer\" in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 67.</ref> A second book, ''[[Emma in Winter]]'', with Emma as the main character followed in 1966. ''Charlotte Sometimes'' was first published in 1969 by Harcourt in the United States, and by Chatto and Windus in the UK in the same year.\n\nPenelope Farmer arranged many of the incidents in ''Charlotte Sometimes'' ahead of time, based upon family experiences.<ref>Margaret K. McElderry, \"Penelope Farmer: The Development of an Author\". In ''Elementary English'' Vol. 51, No. 6, September 1974, p. 804. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref> She later wrote that Charlotte and Emma were originally based on her mother and her mother's sister as children, having no parents and \"having to be everything to each other,\" one being the responsible one, the other being rather difficult. She wrote, \"Emma and Charlotte have grown in their own ways and aren't exactly based on my mother and her sister now, but this is where it started.\"<ref name=\"Penelope Farmer 1985 p. 77.\">'Penelope Farmer' in ''Something About the Author'' 40 (1985) p. 77.</ref> Penelope Farmer's mother, Penelope Boothby, who was \"talkative and unconventional\", besides being the inspiration for Emma, was also the inspiration for the character of Emily.<ref>'Penelope Farmer' in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 66.</ref> The boarding school's location in the novel is set near where Penelope Farmer lived in London.<ref name=\"Penelope Farmer 1985 p. 77.\" /> The school, along with its pillared front door, glass verandah and cedar tree, was based on the [[West Heath School]] in Sevenoaks, which the author and her twin sister Judith attended in the 1950s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512233831/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured.html \"The Cure(d)\". Penelope Farmer's personal blog entry, 9 June 2007]</ref>  Some of the characters there were based on real students of the time.  The episode when Charlotte walks onto the glass verandah is based on a real event when Penelope Farmer climbed on the glass, breaking it.  <ref>[http://grannyp.blogspot.com/search/label/Charlotte%20Sometimes%20and%20The%20Cure. Penelope Farmer's personal blog entry, 21 November 2007]</ref>\n\nTwo versions of the novel's text exist.  A revised edition of the novel was published by Dell in 1985, with a number of changes by the author.  Almost all of the revisions were minor, such as modernisations of vocabulary and punctuation, and minor re-wording of sentences.  However, the most significant change is that a few events at the end of the story were removed.  These include a poignant episode where Charlotte, back in her own time, receives a package and a letter from Clare's sister, Emily, as an adult.  Also removed was the original ending of the novel, in which the end of term comes, and the boarders ride away in the school bus, with Charlotte among them, heading home to Aviary Hall.\n\nThe book has been re-issued, with the original text, in [[The New York Review Children's Collection]].\n\n\n==Plot==\n===Part one===\nCharlotte arrives at a new boarding school, and is shown around by a [[prefect]] named Sarah. Sarah's mother also attended the school. She is shown a room that she shares with other girls (Suzanna, Elizabeth). The next morning she finds herself in the same place, but in the year 1918 \u2013 with war still going on. A younger girl called Emily calls Charlotte her sister, and addresses her as \"Clare\". She tries to spend the day in 1918 without being noticed. Each night, Charlotte finds herself swapping between her own time and Clare's time. They must learn to live two different lives. Charlotte and Clare manage to write to each other via Clare's diary, which they share and hide in their bed.\n\nEmily and Clare are supposed to leave their room soon and go into lodgings with the Chisel Brown family. They have to make sure this happens when Clare is in 1918, because they won't be able to switch again after that.\n\n===Part two===\nCharlotte, expecting to have returned to her own time for the last time, is shocked to find that she has not, and is still in 1918. She will go into lodgings with the Chisel Brown family: it appears she will be trapped in the past. In the house, Miss Agnes Chisel Brown shows Charlotte and Emily the toys she had once played with. These include toy soldiers and a solitaire board with marbles.  She tells the two girls about her brother Arthur, who died in the [[World War I|war]]. Charlotte reflects, forward and back: to Arthur in the past; her own sister Emma in the future; and Clare, trapped in Charlotte's time. She struggles with her identity as being Charlotte sometimes, but Clare at other times.\n\nCharlotte and Emily form a plan to enter the school by night in an attempt to get Charlotte into the bed which will take Charlotte back to her own time. Inside her room, which is now being used as the school sick room, Charlotte finds the bed is occupied, and thus she cannot return home. She escapes being seen by Nurse Gregory, but is seen by another student, Ruth.\n\nCharlotte is not the only one who struggles with identity. Emily tells of the wretchedness of being motherless and unwanted, moving around between homes while her father fights in the war. Meanwhile, Charlotte dreams she is fighting to stay as Charlotte. She dreams about Arthur.\n\nA letter arrives for Clare and Emily from their father. Emily does not let Charlotte read it, to the bewilderment of the other girls. Charlotte, thoughtful as always, wonders who Sarah's mother is: perhaps it will be Charlotte herself if she is trapped in 1918?\n\nAt night, Charlotte dreams about Arthur again, as a drummer boy, and that she has turned into Agnes. Her crisis of identity comes to a head as she struggles to preserve her identity as Charlotte.\n\nOne evening, the Chisel Browns hold a [[seance]] in an attempt to speak to Arthur. The girls hide behind the curtains to observe. During the seance, they hear Clare's voice crying out for Emily. Emily cries out, and the two girls are discovered and disciplined. Later, Miss Agnes asks about the voice they heard at the seance \u2013 Clare's. She then tells Charlotte and Emily of Arthur's war experiences.\n\nFinally, the [[Armistice]] comes. The war is over: people dance and celebrate in the street, and Charlotte and Emily join in, even though it would anger Mr Chisel Brown. In disgrace, Charlotte and Emily are sent back to the school. Miss Agnes gives them the toys as a gift.\n\n===Part three===\nRuth recalls her \"dream\" of seeing Clare whilst in the sick room. Because of the [[Spanish flu|flu epidemic]], the students are able to play wild games in the dormitories, and eventually, Charlotte is finally able to sleep in the bed that will return her to her own time.\n\nOn arriving back in her own time, Charlotte is surprised to learn that her room-mate Elizabeth had deduced the truth about her swap with Clare. Charlotte wonders about Sarah's mother and what has become of Emily and Clare. At the school, Charlotte sees the elderly Miss Wilkin.  Charlotte realises that she had known Miss Wilkin when she was a young teacher in 1918.\n\nOne day, Charlotte has a conversation with Sarah, and learns what has become of Emily and Clare. Sarah's mother is Emily, and Clare died in the flu epidemic after the war. Later, Charlotte and Elizabeth discuss the events Charlotte has experienced. They find the exercise book in the bed leg, having been there for forty years, finding the last letter Charlotte wrote to Clare.\n\nCharlotte receives a package from Emily as an adult. It contains a letter from Emily, and the toys which Miss Agnes had given them, over forty years ago. Charlotte places the marbles from the solitaire set in a jar and fills it with water, which the other girls admire.  Charlotte feels a sense of personal identity in now having her own decoration to her dresser, yet muses that the marbles belonged her when she was living the life of another person, namely Clare.  The end of term comes, and the boarders leave the school in the school bus, while singing rhymes. <ref>Penelope Farmer ''Charlotte Sometimes'', Harcourt, 1969.  This last episode is not in the 1985 Revised edition</ref>\n\n\n==Continuity==\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' begins one year after the ending of ''The Summer Birds'', after Charlotte has left her small village school, and covers the period of her first term at boarding school. While written three years after ''Emma in Winter'' \u2014 set during Charlotte's second term at boarding school \u2014 the events of ''Charlotte Sometimes'' occur beforehand. Charlotte's sister Emma and their grandfather Elijah do not appear in ''Charlotte Sometimes'', although there are references to them. For example, Charlotte compares Emily with her sister Emma in her own time; and compares the Chisel Brown family home with her own home, Aviary Hall.\n\n''Emma in Winter'' begins during the same Christmas holidays where ''Charlotte Sometimes'' ends, and indicates that Charlotte will stay a week with one of the friends she made at boarding school during the events of ''Charlotte Sometimes''.<ref>Penelope Farmer, ''Emma in Winter''. London: [[Chatto & Windus]], 1969, p. 6.</ref> ''Emma in Winter'' then follows Emma's story while Charlotte returns to boarding school.\n\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Identity===\nWhile she had been writing ''Emma in Winter'', Farmer was not aware that identity was such a predominant theme in the book.  She only realised this later, when she encountered [[Margery Fisher]]'s comments on the book in ''Growing Point''.  She had a similar realisation, this time on her own, while writing ''Charlotte Sometimes''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Writers, Critics, and Children |url=https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg |url-access=registration |editor= Geoff Fox|editor2= Graham Hammond|editor3= Terry Jones|editor4= Frederic Smith|editor5= Kenneth Sterck |year=1976 |publisher=Agathon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-87586-054-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg/page/60 60] }}</ref>  She writes, \"...halfway through ''Charlotte Sometimes'' I realized that I was writing a book about identity.  I am a twin, a nonidentical one, and apparently one of the chief problems of nonidentical twins is always the establishment of a genuine and separate sense of identity.  Looking back I can see this has in fact been an obsession with me, since the age of twelve or so at least.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Penelope (Jane) Farmer 1939- |journal=Children's Literature Review |date=1985 |volume=8 |page=65}}</ref>\n\nAuthor [[David Rees (author)|David Rees]] also points out that identity as a major theme.  He wrote, \"Its most memorable passages are poignant or resigned or concerned with absence, loss, or death... Its theme is not so much maturing relationships, but identity...  Charlotte begins to wonder, with increasing dismay, if she really is Charlotte: perhaps she has turned into Clare, rather than just substituted for her.  This may be an adult fear \u2013 the fear of not being everything you and other people have always said you are, the realization that you may be someone totally different.\"<ref name=\"Rees\">David Rees, 'The Marble in the Water: Penelope Farmer,'. In ''The Marble in the Water: Essays on Contemporary Writers of Fiction for Children and Young Adults'', The Horn Book, Inc., 1980, pp. 1-13. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Time Travel===\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' continues the theme, begun in ''Emma in Winter'', of time travel into the past. While this is unexplained in ''Charlotte Sometimes'', a theorised explanation is given in ''Emma in Winter''. Emma and Bobby are reading journals in Emma and Charlotte's grandfather Elijah's study, where they find an article theorising the non-linear nature of time. It describes time as being like a coiled spring, which can be pushed together, so that some moments in time can be very near a moment in another time.<ref>Penelope Farmer, ''Emma in Winter''. London: Chatto & Windus, 1969, Ch. 4.</ref>\n\n\n==Reviews==\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' received widespread acclaim by reviewers.\n\n[[Margery Fisher]], in a 1969 review for her children's literature journal ''Growing Point'', wrote: \"Like ''Emma in Winter'', this is really a study in disintegration, the study of a girl finding an identity by losing it... Above all, here is a dream-allegory which teaches not through statement but through feeling. We sense the meaning of Charlotte's changes of identity in the way that she senses them herself... [It is] a book of quite exceptional distinction... a haunting, convincing story which comes close to being a masterpiece of its kind... \"<ref>Margery Fisher, review of ''Charlotte Sometimes'', ''Growing Point'', November 1969, p. 1408, cited in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 68.</ref>\n\nChildren's novelist [[Eleanor Cameron]] wrote, \"Farmer writes with style. She is vivid in her depiction of place: on almost every page, scattered with colorful figures of speech, we are drawn into the school and the surroundings of the school through sights and sounds and smells and textures... above all we are moved by the depth and poignancy of the relationship between Charlotte and Emily.\" She continues, \"Farmer is always gifted in her grasp of possibilities that bring us up short with surprise and delight and satisfaction.\"<ref name=\"Dell\">Penelope Farmer''Charlotte Sometimes''. Revised edition, Dell, 1985, rear cover.</ref>\n\nNeil Millar, in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', wrote, \"''Charlotte Sometimes'' is a book of quite exceptional distinction...  The book is essentially about humanity caught up in the still trickery of time... Not easily forgotten.\"<ref>Neil Millar, 'Tales from School,' in ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 6 November 1969. p. B5.  Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\nIn 1969, ''The Sunday Times'' described the book as \"this year's most haunting fantasy\".<ref name=\"Dell\" />\n\nChildren's publisher [[Margaret K. McElderry]] wrote, \"[''Charlotte Sometimes''] is a fascinating exploration of the fragile barriers between layers of time, handled with great skill in the writing and delicacy of perception.<ref>Margaret K.

Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\nChildren's author [[David Rees (author)|David Rees]] wrote in 1980, \"...the book is none the worse for breaking the conventional bounds of the children's novel.  It is probably Penelope Farmer's finest novel \u2013 complex, taut, not a word wrong \u2013 and it thoroughly deserves the popularity it has attained.\"<ref name=\"Rees\" />\n\nPeggy Heeks writes in ''Twentieth-Century Children's Writers'', \"[''Charlotte Sometimes''] shows a brilliant handling of the time-switch technique and a sincerity which rejects slick solutions to the dilemmas of the two heroines.\"<ref>Peggy Heeks, entry in ''Twentieth-Century Children's Writers'', ed.

During the subsequent century the French carried out several excavation campaigns directed by [[Pierre Montet]], then by [[Jean Yoyotte]] and subsequently by Philippe Brissaud.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921}} For some time the overwhelming amount of monuments bearing the cartouches of Ramesses II or [[Merenptah]] led archaeologists to believe that Tanis and Pi-Ramesses were in fact the same. Furthermore, the discovery of the [[Year 400 Stela]] at Tanis led to the speculation that Tanis should also be identified with the older, former [[Hyksos]] capital, [[Avaris]]. The later re-discovery of the actual, neighbouring archaeological sites of Pi-Ramesses ([[Qantir]]) and Avaris ([[Tell el-Dab'a]]) made clear that the earlier identifications were incorrect, and that all the Ramesside and pre-Ramesside monuments at Tanis were in fact brought here from Pi-Ramesses or other cities.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921\u20132}}\n\nThere are ruins of a number of temples, including the chief temple dedicated to [[Amun]], and a very important royal [[necropolis]] of the Third Intermediate Period (which contains the only known intact royal pharaonic burials&nbsp;\u2014 the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] having been entered in antiquity). The burials of three pharaohs of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties&nbsp;\u2014 [[Psusennes I]], [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]] and [[Shoshenq II]] &nbsp;\u2014 survived the depredations of tomb robbers throughout antiquity. They were discovered intact in 1939 and 1940 by [[Pierre Montet]] and proved to contain a large catalogue of gold, jewelry, [[lapis lazuli]] and other precious stones, as well as the funerary masks of these kings.\n\nThe chief deities of Tanis were Amun; his consort, Mut; and their child Khonsu, forming the Tanite triad. This triad was, however, identical to that of Thebes, leading many scholars to speak of Tanis as the \"northern Thebes\".\n\nIn 2009, the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Egyptian Culture Ministry]] reported archaeologists had discovered a sacred lake in the temple of Mut at Tanis. The lake, built out of limestone blocks, had been 15 meters long and 5 meters deep. It was discovered 12 meters below ground in good condition.

Furthermore, the discovery of the [[Year 400 Stela]] at Tanis led to the speculation that Tanis should also be identified with the older, former [[Hyksos]] capital, [[Avaris]]. The later re-discovery of the actual, neighbouring archaeological sites of Pi-Ramesses ([[Qantir]]) and Avaris ([[Tell el-Dab'a]]) made clear that the earlier identifications were incorrect, and that all the Ramesside and pre-Ramesside monuments at Tanis were in fact brought here from Pi-Ramesses or other cities.<ref name=bard/>{{rp|921\u20132}}\n\nThere are ruins of a number of temples, including the chief temple dedicated to [[Amun]], and a very important royal [[necropolis]] of the Third Intermediate Period (which contains the only known intact royal pharaonic burials&nbsp;\u2014 the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] having been entered in antiquity).

They were discovered intact in 1939 and 1940 by [[Pierre Montet]] and proved to contain a large catalogue of gold, jewelry, [[lapis lazuli]] and other precious stones, as well as the funerary masks of these kings.\n\nThe chief deities of Tanis were Amun; his consort, Mut; and their child Khonsu, forming the Tanite triad. This triad was, however, identical to that of Thebes, leading many scholars to speak of Tanis as the \"northern Thebes\".\n\nIn 2009, the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Egyptian Culture Ministry]] reported archaeologists had discovered a sacred lake in the temple of Mut at Tanis. The lake, built out of limestone blocks, had been 15 meters long and 5 meters deep. It was discovered 12 meters below ground in good condition.

The first bridge was built on the site in 1285{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and was dedicated to the saint, and was important for transport until the establishment of the railway. The current bridge dates from the 18th century after the original bridge was swept away in a flood in 1763. There were flour-mills at the weir and there was a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] police station in the village.<ref>{{Citation | last = Lewis | first = Samuel | title = A Topgrahical Dictionary of Ireland | publisher=S.
