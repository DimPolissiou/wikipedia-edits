Archaeologists working from the last half of the 19th century discovered continuous traces of human settlements in areas situated in Bra\u0219ov: Valea Cet\u0103\u021bii, Pietrele lui Solomon, \u0218prenghi, T\u00e2mpa, Dealul Melcilor, and Noua. The first three locations show traces of [[Dacians|Dacian]] citadels; \u0218prenghi Hill housed a [[Roman Dacia|Roman]]-style construction. The last two locations had their names applied to [[Bronze Age]] cultures \u2014 ''[[Schneckenberg culture|Schneckenberg]]'' (\"Hill of the Snails\"; Early Bronze Age){{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=140}} and ''[[Noua culture|Noua]]'' (\"The New\"; Late Bronze Age).{{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=410}}\n\n[[Transylvanian Saxons]] played a decisive role in Bra\u0219ov's development and were invited by [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] kings to develop towns, build mines, and cultivate the land of [[Transylvania]] at different stages between 1141 and 1300. The settlers came primarily from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and the [[Moselle]] region, with others from [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Wallonia]] and even [[France]].\n\nIn 1211, by order of King [[Andrew II of Hungary]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] fortified the [[Burzenland]] to defend the border of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. On the site of the village of Bra\u0219ov, the Teutonic Knights built Kronstadt \u2013 'the City of the Crown'.<ref>Mediaeval studies, Volumes 17-18, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1955, Toronto, Canada, An annual journal of scholarship, History, {{ISSN|0076-5872}}</ref> Although the crusaders were evicted by 1225, the colonists they brought in long ago remained, along with local population in three distinct settlements they founded on the site of Bra\u0219ov:\n*''Corona'', around the Black Church (Biserica Neagr\u0103);\n*''Martinsberg'', west of Cet\u0103\u021buia Hill;\n*''Bartholom\u00e4'', on the eastern side of Sprenghi Hill.\n[[File:Brasov 1689.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the walled city prior to the 1689 fire]]\nGermans living in Bra\u0219ov were mainly involved in trade and crafts. The location of the city at the intersection of trade routes linking the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Western Europe]], together with certain tax exemptions, allowed Saxon merchants to obtain considerable wealth and exert a strong political influence. They contributed a great deal to the architectural flavor of the city. Fortifications around the city were erected and continually expanded, with several towers maintained by different craftsmen's guilds, according to the medieval custom. Part of the fortification ensemble was recently restored using [[UNESCO]] funds, and other projects are ongoing. At least two entrances to the city, ''Poarta Ecaterinei'' (or ''Katharinentor'') and ''Poarta \u0218chei'' (or ''Waisenhausg\u00e4ssertor''), are still in existence. The city center is marked by the mayor's former office building ([[:ro:Casa Sfatului din Bra\u0219ov|Casa Sfatului]]) and the surrounding square (''pia\u021ba''), which includes one of the oldest buildings in Bra\u0219ov, the Hirscher Haus. Nearby is the \"Black Church\" (''[[Biserica Neagr\u0103]]''), which some claim to be the largest [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] church in [[Southeastern Europe]].\n\nIn 1689, a great fire destroyed the walled city almost entirely, and its rebuilding lasted several decades.\n\nBesides the German (Saxon) population living in the walled city and in the northern suburbs, Bra\u0219ov had also a significant Romanian and Bulgarian population (living in the [[\u0218cheii Bra\u0219ovului|\u0218chei]] district), and also some Hungarian population (living in the Blum\u0103na district). The cultural and religious importance of the Romanian church and school in \u0218chei is underlined by the generous donations received from more than thirty [[hospodar]]s of Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as that from [[Elizabeth of Russia]]. In the 17th and 19th centuries, the Romanians in \u0218chei campaigned for national, political, and cultural rights, and were supported in their efforts by Romanians from all other provinces, as well as by the local Greek merchant community. In 1838, they established the first Romanian language newspaper ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'' and the first Romanian institutions of higher education: ''\u0218colile Centrale Greco-Ortodoxe'' (\"The Greek-Orthodox Central Schools\", today named after [[Andrei \u0218aguna]]). The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and sovereign of Transylvania [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] awarded Romanians citizenship rights for a brief period during the latter decades of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1850, the town had 21,782 inhabitants: 8,874 (40.7%) Germans, 8,727 (40%) Romanians, 2,939 (13.4%) Hungarians.<ref name=\"varga.adatbank.transindex.ro\">{{cite web|url=http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|title=Erd\u00e9ly etnikai \u00e9s felekezeti statisztik\u00e1ja|website=varga.adatbank.transindex.ro|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219010951/http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|archivedate=2007-12-19}}</ref> In 1910 there were 41,056 inhabitants: 10,841 (26.4%) Germans, 11,786 (28.7%) Romanians, 17,831 (43.4%) Hungarians.\n<ref name=\"varga.adatbank.transindex.ro\"/>\n\nOn 29 August 1916, during the [[First World War]], the [[Romanian Army]] occupied Bra\u0219ov. Romanian troops entered the city at around five o'clock p.m. and paraded towards the city square.

The inter-war period was a time of flourishing economy and cultural life in general, which included the Saxons in Bra\u0219ov as well. However, at the end of World War II many ethnic Germans were forcibly deported to the [[Soviet Union]]. A majority of them emigrated to [[West Germany]] after [[Communist Romania|Romania became a democratic country]].\n\nThe first Jewish community in Bra\u0219ov was established in 1828, joining the [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] association in 1868. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] founded their religious organization in 1877. The Neolog synagogue, seating 800, was built between 1899\u20131905. During the [[interwar period]], the communities had separate institutions, but opened a jointly managed school in 1940. Zionist organizations appeared already in 1920. By 1930, Jews numbered 2594 individuals, or 4% of the total population. In autumn 1940, during the [[National Legionary State]], the antisemitic [[Iron Guard]] nationalized all Jewish institutions and seized most shops owned by Jews. In 1941, Jews were drafted for service in forced labor battalions. Those from throughout southern Transylvania were concentrated in Bra\u0219ov; a further 200 refugees came from [[Ploie\u0219ti]]. In August 1942, 850 Jews between the ages of 18 and 50 were drafted into labor battalions and ordered to work in Bra\u0219ov, while others were sent to [[Predeal]] and [[Bran, Bra\u0219ov|Bran]]. In spring 1943, 250 youths were sent to [[Suraia]] camp to build fortifications. After the [[King Michael Coup]] of August 1944, the labor battalions were reduced to 250-300 while most of the Jews managed to obtain their freedom. In 1945\u20131946, the Jewish population increased to 3500.<ref>Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: A-J'', p. 182.

Under [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s rule, the city was the site of the [[1987 Bra\u0219ov strike]]. This was brutally repressed by the authorities and resulted in numerous workers being imprisoned.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n[[File:UTB - IAR-22 tractor 1.jpg|thumb|First Romanian-made tractor, the IAR 22]]\n\nIndustrial development in Bra\u0219ov started in the inter-war period, with one of the largest factories being the airplane manufacturing plant ([[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103|IAR]] Bra\u0219ov), which produced the first Romanian fighter planes used during World War II. After signing the armistice with [[USSR]] on September 12, 1944, the factory started repairing trucks, and on October 1945 it began manufacturing agricultural tractors. [[IAR 22 (tractor)|IAR 22]] was the first Romanian-made wheeled tractor. In 1948 the company was renamed \"[[Uzina Tractorul Bra\u0219ov]]\" known internationally as [[Universal Tractor Bra\u0219ov]]. Aircraft manufacturing resumed in 1968 at first under the name ICA and then under its old name of [[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103|IAR]] at a new location in nearby [[Ghimbav]].\n\nIndustrialization was accelerated in the Communist era, with special emphasis being placed on heavy industry, attracting many workers from other parts of the country. Heavy industry is still abundant, including [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|Roman]], which manufactures [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] trucks as well as native-designed trucks and coaches. Although the industrial base has been in decline in recent years, Bra\u0219ov is still a site for manufacturing hydraulic transmissions, auto parts, ball-bearings, construction materials, hand tools, furniture, textiles and shoe-wear. There is also a large brewery. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Demographics==\nBra\u0219ov has a total population of 253,200 (2011 census).\nIts ethnic composition includes:\n\n*[[Romanians]]: 208,019 (91.3%)\n*[[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]]: 16,172 (7.1%)\n*[[Germans in Romania|Germans]] <small>([[Transylvanian Saxons]])</small>: 1,079 (0.5%)\n*[[Romani people]]: 916 (0.4%)\n*Other ethnicities: 1,037 (0.7%)\n\nIn 2005, the [[Bra\u0219ov metropolitan area]] was created.

The project consists of a terminal capable of handling 1 million passengers per year and a {{convert|2,800|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} runway.\nThe [[A3 (Romania)|A3]] highway is also planned to pass the city. However, there is no foreseeable date for starting construction.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Brasov, Piata Sfatului.jpg|thumb|The city center ([[Bra\u0219ov Council Square (Pia\u021ba Sfatului)|Pia\u021ba Sfatului]])]]\nWith its central location, Bra\u0219ov is a suitable location from which to explore Romania, and the distances to several tourist destinations (including the [[Black Sea]] resorts, the monasteries in northern Moldavia, and the wooden churches of [[Maramure\u0219 region|Maramure\u0219]]) are similar. It is also the largest city in a mountain resorts area. The old city is very well preserved and is best seen by taking the cable-car to the top of T\u00e2mpa Mountain.\n\nTemperatures from May to September fluctuate around {{convert|23|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Bra\u0219ov benefits from a winter tourism season centered on [[winter sports]] and other activities. [[Poiana Bra\u0219ov]] is the most popular Romanian [[ski resort]] and an important tourist center preferred by many tourists from other European states.\n\nThe city also has several restaurants that serve local as well as international cuisine (e.g. Hungarian and Chinese).

The Transylvanian Sports Museum is among the oldest in the country and presents the evolution of consecrated sports in the city. During the communist period, [[universiade]]s and [[Daciad]]s were held, where local sportsmen were obliged to participate. Nowadays, the infrastructure of the city allows other sports to be practiced, such as football, rugby, tennis, cycling, handball, gliding, skiing, skating, mountain climbing, paintball, bowling, swimming, target shooting, basketball, martial arts, equestrian, volleyball or gymnastics. Annually, at \"Olimpia\" sports ground, the \"Bra\u0219ov Challenge Cup\" tennis competition is held.\n\n[[Col\u021bea Bra\u0219ov]] was the football champion in 1928, managing a second place in 1927, in its only 10 years of existence (1921\u20131931).

Archaeologists working from the last half of the 19th century discovered continuous traces of human settlements in areas situated in Bra\u0219ov: Valea Cet\u0103\u021bii, Pietrele lui Solomon, \u0218prenghi, T\u00e2mpa, Dealul Melcilor, and Noua. The first three locations show traces of [[Dacians|Dacian]] citadels; \u0218prenghi Hill housed a [[Roman Dacia|Roman]]-style construction. The last two locations had their names applied to [[Bronze Age]] cultures \u2014 ''[[Schneckenberg culture|Schneckenberg]]'' (\"Hill of the Snails\"; Early Bronze Age){{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=140}} and ''[[Noua culture|Noua]]'' (\"The New\"; Late Bronze Age).{{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=410}}\n\n[[Transylvanian Saxons]] played a decisive role in Bra\u0219ov's development and were invited by [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] kings to develop towns, build mines, and cultivate the land of [[Transylvania]] at different stages between 1141 and 1300. The settlers came primarily from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and the [[Moselle]] region, with others from [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Wallonia]] and even [[France]].\n\nIn 1211, by order of King [[Andrew II of Hungary]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] fortified the [[Burzenland]] to defend the border of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. On the site of the village of Bra\u0219ov, the Teutonic Knights built Kronstadt \u2013 'the City of the Crown'.<ref>Mediaeval studies, Volumes 17-18, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1955, Toronto, Canada, An annual journal of scholarship, History, {{ISSN|0076-5872}}</ref> Although the crusaders were evicted by 1225, the colonists they brought in long ago remained, along with local population in three distinct settlements they founded on the site of Bra\u0219ov:\n*''Corona'', around the Black Church (Biserica Neagr\u0103);\n*''Martinsberg'', west of Cet\u0103\u021buia Hill;\n*''Bartholom\u00e4'', on the eastern side of Sprenghi Hill.\n[[File:Brasov 1689.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the walled city prior to the 1689 fire]]\nGermans living in Bra\u0219ov were mainly involved in trade and crafts. The location of the city at the intersection of trade routes linking the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Western Europe]], together with certain tax exemptions, allowed Saxon merchants to obtain considerable wealth and exert a strong political influence. They contributed a great deal to the architectural flavor of the city. Fortifications around the city were erected and continually expanded, with several towers maintained by different craftsmen's guilds, according to the medieval custom. Part of the fortification ensemble was recently restored using [[UNESCO]] funds, and other projects are ongoing. At least two entrances to the city, ''Poarta Ecaterinei'' (or ''Katharinentor'') and ''Poarta \u0218chei'' (or ''Waisenhausg\u00e4ssertor''), are still in existence. The city center is marked by the mayor's former office building ([[:ro:Casa Sfatului din Bra\u0219ov|Casa Sfatului]]) and the surrounding square (''pia\u021ba''), which includes one of the oldest buildings in Bra\u0219ov, the Hirscher Haus. Nearby is the \"Black Church\" (''[[Biserica Neagr\u0103]]''), which some claim to be the largest [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] church in [[Southeastern Europe]].\n\nIn 1689, a great fire destroyed the walled city almost entirely, and its rebuilding lasted several decades.\n\nBesides the German (Saxon) population living in the walled city and in the northern suburbs, Bra\u0219ov had also a significant Romanian and Bulgarian population (living in the [[\u0218cheii Bra\u0219ovului|\u0218chei]] district), and also some Hungarian population (living in the Blum\u0103na district). The cultural and religious importance of the Romanian church and school in \u0218chei is underlined by the generous donations received from more than thirty [[hospodar]]s of Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as that from [[Elizabeth of Russia]]. In the 17th and 19th centuries, the Romanians in \u0218chei campaigned for national, political, and cultural rights, and were supported in their efforts by Romanians from all other provinces, as well as by the local Greek merchant community. In 1838, they established the first Romanian language newspaper ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'' and the first Romanian institutions of higher education: ''\u0218colile Centrale Greco-Ortodoxe'' (\"The Greek-Orthodox Central Schools\", today named after [[Andrei \u0218aguna]]). The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and sovereign of Transylvania [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] awarded Romanians citizenship rights for a brief period during the latter decades of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1850, the town had 21,782 inhabitants: 8,874 (40.7%) Germans, 8,727 (40%) Romanians, 2,939 (13.4%) Hungarians.<ref name=\"varga.adatbank.transindex.ro\">{{cite web|url=http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|title=Erd\u00e9ly etnikai \u00e9s felekezeti statisztik\u00e1ja|website=varga.adatbank.transindex.ro|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219010951/http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|archivedate=2007-12-19}}</ref> In 1910 there were 41,056 inhabitants: 10,841 (26.4%) Germans, 11,786 (28.7%) Romanians, 17,831 (43.4%) Hungarians.\n<ref name=\"varga.adatbank.transindex.ro\"/>\n\nOn 29 August 1916, during the [[First World War]], the [[Romanian Army]] occupied Bra\u0219ov.

The inter-war period was a time of flourishing economy and cultural life in general, which included the Saxons in Bra\u0219ov as well. However, at the end of World War II many ethnic Germans were forcibly deported to the [[Soviet Union]]. A majority of them emigrated to [[West Germany]] after [[Communist Romania|Romania became a democratic country]].\n\nThe first Jewish community in Bra\u0219ov was established in 1828, joining the [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] association in 1868. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] founded their religious organization in 1877. The Neolog synagogue, seating 800, was built between 1899\u20131905. During the [[interwar period]], the communities had separate institutions, but opened a jointly managed school in 1940. Zionist organizations appeared already in 1920. By 1930, Jews numbered 2594 individuals, or 4% of the total population. In autumn 1940, during the [[National Legionary State]], the antisemitic [[Iron Guard]] nationalized all Jewish institutions and seized most shops owned by Jews. In 1941, Jews were drafted for service in forced labor battalions. Those from throughout southern Transylvania were concentrated in Bra\u0219ov; a further 200 refugees came from [[Ploie\u0219ti]]. In August 1942, 850 Jews between the ages of 18 and 50 were drafted into labor battalions and ordered to work in Bra\u0219ov, while others were sent to [[Predeal]] and [[Bran, Bra\u0219ov|Bran]]. In spring 1943, 250 youths were sent to [[Suraia]] camp to build fortifications. After the [[King Michael Coup]] of August 1944, the labor battalions were reduced to 250-300 while most of the Jews managed to obtain their freedom. In 1945\u20131946, the Jewish population increased to 3500.<ref>Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: A-J'', p. 182.

Under [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s rule, the city was the site of the [[1987 Bra\u0219ov strike]]. This was brutally repressed by the authorities and resulted in numerous workers being imprisoned.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n[[File:UTB - IAR-22 tractor 1.jpg|thumb|First Romanian-made tractor, the IAR 22]]\n\nIndustrial development in Bra\u0219ov started in the inter-war period, with one of the largest factories being the airplane manufacturing plant ([[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103|IAR]] Bra\u0219ov), which produced the first Romanian fighter planes used during World War II. After signing the armistice with [[USSR]] on September 12, 1944, the factory started repairing trucks, and on October 1945 it began manufacturing agricultural tractors. [[IAR 22 (tractor)|IAR 22]] was the first Romanian-made wheeled tractor. In 1948 the company was renamed \"[[Uzina Tractorul Bra\u0219ov]]\" known internationally as [[Universal Tractor Bra\u0219ov]]. Aircraft manufacturing resumed in 1968 at first under the name ICA and then under its old name of [[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103|IAR]] at a new location in nearby [[Ghimbav]].\n\nIndustrialization was accelerated in the Communist era, with special emphasis being placed on heavy industry, attracting many workers from other parts of the country. Heavy industry is still abundant, including [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|Roman]], which manufactures [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] trucks as well as native-designed trucks and coaches. Although the industrial base has been in decline in recent years, Bra\u0219ov is still a site for manufacturing hydraulic transmissions, auto parts, ball-bearings, construction materials, hand tools, furniture, textiles and shoe-wear. There is also a large brewery. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Demographics==\nBra\u0219ov has a total population of 253,200 (2011 census).\nIts ethnic composition includes:\n\n*[[Romanians]]: 208,019 (91.3%)\n*[[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]]: 16,172 (7.1%)\n*[[Germans in Romania|Germans]] <small>([[Transylvanian Saxons]])</small>: 1,079 (0.5%)\n*[[Romani people]]: 916 (0.4%)\n*Other ethnicities: 1,037 (0.7%)\n\nIn 2005, the [[Bra\u0219ov metropolitan area]] was created.

It is also the largest city in a mountain resorts area.

Bra\u0219ov benefits from a winter tourism season centered on [[winter sports]] and other activities. [[Poiana Bra\u0219ov]] is the most popular Romanian [[ski resort]] and an important tourist center preferred by many tourists from other European states.\n\nThe city also has several restaurants that serve local as well as international cuisine (e.g. Hungarian and Chinese).

The Transylvanian Sports Museum is among the oldest in the country and presents the evolution of consecrated sports in the city. During the communist period, [[universiade]]s and [[Daciad]]s were held, where local sportsmen were obliged to participate. Nowadays, the infrastructure of the city allows other sports to be practiced, such as football, rugby, tennis, cycling, handball, gliding, skiing, skating, mountain climbing, paintball, bowling, swimming, target shooting, basketball, martial arts, equestrian, volleyball or gymnastics. Annually, at \"Olimpia\" sports ground, the \"Bra\u0219ov Challenge Cup\" tennis competition is held.\n\n[[Col\u021bea Bra\u0219ov]] was the football champion in 1928, managing a second place in 1927, in its only 10 years of existence (1921\u20131931).

It was originally developed by [[Hunting Percival]] from the earlier [[piston engine]]-powered [[Percival Provost]] basic trainer, and later produced by the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC). In addition to the multiple RAF orders, the Jet Provost, sometimes with light armament, was exported to  many air forces worldwide. The design was also further developed into a more heavily armed [[Attack aircraft|ground attack]] variant under the name [[BAC Strikemaster]].\n\n== Development ==\n===Origins===\nIn early 1951, Hunting Percival began work on the design studies that would ultimately lead to the Jet Provost.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> At the time, the company in the process of establishing mass production for the earlier [[Piston engine|piston-engined]] [[Percival Provost]] basic trainer, but had anticipated that demand for a jet-powered trainer aircraft would be on the horizon. The design team aimed to produce an aircraft capable of equaling the handling characteristics of operational jet fighters of the era while also possessing modest approach and [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] speeds and remaining simple to handle, as opposed to aiming to obtain maximum performance.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/>\n\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost T.1 XD674 Farnborough 10.09.54 edited-2.jpg|thumb|The prototype Jet Provost T.1 with the initial longer undercarriage at the [[Farnborough Air Show]] in 1954]]\nDuring the early design process, a series of increasingly frequent liaisons with [[RAF Flying Training Command]] took place, helping to gauge the considerations required to succeed in aspects of the proposed aircraft's design, such as instructional processes and maintenance requirements.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> During development, Hunting Percival had intentionally reused as many existing components and subsystems of the Percival Provost as possible, including the [[Empennage#Tailplanes|tail surfaces]], [[Wing configuration|main planes]] and main [[landing gear|undercarriage]] legs, to speed development through to the prototype stage.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> The initial design work was performed as a private venture, independent of any service requirement; in March 1953, sponsorship from the British Government to support the development was made available as a result of interest from the [[Ministry of Supply]].<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> That same month, an order for service-test quantity of Jet Provosts was received.<ref name=\"fi55 p587\">''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 587.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes and evaluation===\nOn 16 June 1954, the prototype ''XD674'' conducted its [[maiden flight]] from the factory at [[Luton Airport]], flown by Dick Wheldon.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\">''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, p. 795.</ref> A series of seven flights were flown in quick succession over the following three days. By early November 1954, a total of 123 flying hours had been accumulated by the prototype during Hunting Percival's own flight test program, after which the prototype was submitted for official trials at [[MoD Boscombe Down|RAF Boscombe Down]].<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> While testing proved the overall performance of the Jet Provost to be satisfactory, refinements were made, such as shortening the legs of the landing gear for a smoother ride when deployed at semi-prepared airstrips.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/>\n\nOn 19 February 1955, the first of ten pre-production aircraft, designated as the ''Jet Provost T1'', performed its first flight.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> In May 1955, three of the pre-production aircraft were assigned for the first stage of service trials with the [[Central Flying School]] (CFS) of the RAF to determine the value of the Jet Provost in the ''[[ab initio]]'' training role and to develop a syllabus for the training program. During the second stage of CFS trials using the same three aircraft, actual students were introduced to the type for practical evaluation purposes, which was performed at [[Hullavington Airfield|RAF Hullavington]] until the successful completion of trials on 2 July 1956.<ref>''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, pp. 795\u2013796.</ref> According to feedback from CFS examiners, the Jet Provost had noticeably improved the performance of students during its trial deployment.<ref name=\"fi58 p796\">''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, p. 796.</ref>\n\n===Further development===\nAs a result of the results and responses produced from the trials performed using the pre-production aircraft, Hunting Percival proceeded to develop and incorporate several different improvements upon the design. Amongst the changes made was an overall smoothening of the fuselage lines, [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] systems being substituted for [[pneumatic]] counterparts, and the addition of a [[Vertical stabilizer#Fins|dorsal fillet]]; the new model was designated as the ''Jet Provost T2''.<ref name=\"fi58 p796\"/> On 1 September 1955, the first Jet Provost T2 made its first flight. This variant was used only for development work; in addition to seeing use at Hullavington, three Jet Provost T2s were dispatched overseas for [[winterization]] trials in [[Scandinavia]] and a series of sales tours across [[Europe]], [[Canada]], the [[United States of America]], and [[Latin America]].<ref name=\"fi58 p796\"/>\n\n[[File:jet and prop provosts arp.jpg|thumb|left|Preserved BAC Jet Provost T5a in formation with a Percival Provost T1]]\nIn June 1957, a production order was placed for the first 40 of the developed ''Jet Provost T3'', featuring a more powerful [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]] jet engine, ejector seats, a redesign of the airframe, and a shortened and strengthened version of the retractable tricycle [[Landing gear|undercarriage]].<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> Percival built a single example, which was used purely for structural tests throughout the development stages, giving the designers valuable research into what could be achieved with the basic design.<ref>''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, pp. 796\u2013798.</ref> On 22 June 1958, the first Jet Provost T.3 conducted its first flight.<ref name = \"herit prov\"/> In total, 201 T3s were delivered between 1958 and 1962.\n\nThe ''T4'' followed in 1960, fitted with a more powerful variant of the Viper engine and first flown on 15 July, and this was followed by the [[Cabin pressurization|pressurised]] ''T5'' in 1967.<ref name=\"t5ff\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Flight International]]|date=9 March 1967|page=379|title=The Jet Provost T.5}}</ref> The ''T51'' was an armed export version, sold to Ceylon (present day [[Sri Lanka]]), Kuwait and Sudan. It was armed with two 7.7-mm (0.303-inch) [[machine gun]]s. The ''T52'' was another export version sold to Iraq, [[South Yemen]], Sudan and Venezuela, with the same armament as the T51. The ''T55'' was the final armed export version which was sold to Sudan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} A more heavily armed variant of the airframe was developed as the [[BAC Strikemaster]].\n\n==Design==\n[[File:jet provost t5 fairford arp.jpg|thumb|ex-RAF BAC Jet Provost T5 lands at [[RAF Fairford]], England, in 2008]]\nThe BAC Jet Provost is a dedicated jet-powered trainer aircraft; according to aviation publication ''[[Flight International]]'', it has the distinction of being the first ''[[ab initio]]'' jet trainer to be standardised by any air force.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> As designed, it was intended for the Jet Provost to replace, rather than accompany, the use of piston-engine trainer aircraft.<ref name=\"fi55 p586\"/> The Jet Provost incorporates numerous features to support students during training. The aerodynamic design deliberately avoids speed, instead focusing on favourable handling characteristics and ease of recovery from stall and [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]] conditions. An emphasis was placed on flexibility, enabling use of the type throughout a range of training operations.<ref name=\"fi58 p798\">''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, p. 798.</ref>\n\nThe cockpit of the Jet Provost, and much of the operational equipment fittings, is essentially identical to that of the preceding [[Percival Provost]].<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 582-585.</ref> It features a side-by-side seating arrangement, both positions being fitted with duplicated flight controls and instrumentation, which is well suited to the pupil-instructor pairing.<ref name=\"fi55 p583\"/> The dual flight controls employs conventional manually-controlled [[flight control surfaces]] via a cable-and-[[tie rod]] arrangement. A key feature for the era amongst the fittings in the cockpit is the [[Annunciator panel|Centralized Warning Panel]], which alerts the pilots in the event of a number of unfavourable or hazardous conditions being detected, such as [[icing conditions]], fire, and oxygen failure.<ref name=\"fi58 p799\"/> The high-flying capabilities of the Jet Provost necessitated the addition of an [[Oxygen mask#Oxygen masks for aviators|oxygen system]] in the cockpit, which was [[Cabin pressurization|unpressurised]] on early production aircraft.<ref name=\"fi55 p585\"/>\n\nThe Jet Provost has an uncomplicated structure, the airframe being based on the Percival Provost, albeit being strengthened in key areas such as the main wing [[Spar (aeronautics)|spar]] and featuring a substantially different [[landing gear|undercarriage]] arrangement.<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, pp. 582\u2013583.</ref> It possesses an all-metal stressed-skin fuselage built in two sections, the forward section stretching from the rear of the engine bay to the nose comprises a double-frame to absorb the wing and engine loads, while the rear fuselage section uses an orthodox semi-monocoque structure.<ref>''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, pp. 798\u2013799.</ref> Major loads across the fuselage are supported by a combination of four [[longeron]]s and a single [[Collar beam|longitudinal beam]] across the upper-center line.<ref name=\"fi55 p582\">''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 582.</ref> The [[ailerons]], [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]], and [[rudder]] are all attached to the airframe via two inset hinges each.<ref name=\"fi55 p583\"/> The nose contains a hinged metal assembly, housing the [[radio]], batteries, and other electronic equipment, and is easily serviceable by ground crew.<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, pp. 583\u2013584, 586.</ref> All fuel tankage is housed within the wings.<ref name=\"fi55 p586\"/> Where possible, all components used were designed to maximized interchangeability and to conform with international standardisation; a total of 49 service panels across the aircraft's exterior provides access for maintenance and servicing.<ref name=\"fi55 p583\">''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 583.</ref><ref name=\"fi58 p799\">''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, p. 799.</ref>\n\nThe Jet Provost is equipped with a single [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper|Armstrong Siddeley Viper 101]] [[turbojet]] engine, which is mounted behind the cockpit in a roomy [[stainless steel]]-lined engine bay upon a secondary steel-tube structure.<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, pp. 582, 585\u2013586.</ref> Air is fed to the engine by a pair of [[ram-air intake]]s set on either side of the aircraft's forward fuselage connected via sharply-curving ducts to converge just forward of the engine itself.<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, pp. 584, 586.</ref> As supplied, each engine is delivered as a compact engine-change unit, comprising the engine itself, accessories, and oil tank.<ref name=\"fi55 p582\"/> Both the hydraulic and electrical systems were driven via a fuselage-mounted [[accessory drive|accessories gearbox]] connected to the Viper engine by a [[Telescopic cylinder|telescopic]] drive.<ref name=\"fi55 p586\">''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 586.</ref> One particular favourable aspect of the Viper engine is the low maintenance demands imposed for the era.<ref name=\"fi58 p796\"/> Engine ignition is achieved via an electric starter system, the engine controls have been described as being of a conventional nature.<ref name=\"fi55 p586\"/>\n\n== Operational service ==\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost T.3 XN605 '9' 6 FTS Valley 03.09.67 edited-2.jpg|thumb|Operational Jet Provost T3 of No.6 Flying Training School, RAF, in 1967]]\n\nThe Jet Provost proved to be a capable trainer, being used in the ''ab initio'' Basic Trainer role from the outset (pilots progessed to the [[de Havilland Vampire]] and later the [[Folland Gnat]] for Advanced Jet Training).\n\nAfter successful acceptance trials of the T1 during late 1955 at No. 2 Flying Training School at [[RAF Hullavington]], the RAF formally accepted the type in 1957. The first production version was the T3, powered by the Viper 102, and this entered service with No. 2 FTS, located at [[RAF Syerston]], during June 1959, when deliveries commenced from the Hunting Aircraft factory at [[Luton airport]]. The T3 was also operated by [[Central Flying School]] at [[RAF Little Rissington]]; the [[Royal Air Force College]] at [[RAF Cranwell]],  Lincolnshire; by No. 1 Flying Training School at [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]], Yorkshire; 3FTS at [[RAF Leeming]], Yorkshire; 6FTS at [[RAF Acklington]], Northumberland; and 7FTS at [[RAF Church Fenton]], Yorkshire. The twin-seated side by side variant was also used at [[RAF Brawdy]] in Wales to train [[Forward Air Controllers]].\n\nThe later T4 was fitted with the more powerful Viper A.S.V. 11 of 2,500&nbsp;lbs static [[thrust]] and first flew on 15 July 1960. It quickly entered service with the units listed above.\n\nThe T5 variant was fitted with the Viper 201 and cockpit pressurisation. These developments encouraged the RAF to utilise the Jet Provost in a number of different roles besides basic training. With a top speed of 440&nbsp;mph, excellent maneuverability, mechanical reliability and low operating costs, the Jet Provost was utilized as an [[Aerobatics|aerobatic]] aircraft, air warfare and tactical weapons training as well as advanced training. The first T5 made its maiden flight on 28 February 1967 and deliveries from BAC{{'}}s [[Warton, Fylde|Warton]] factory commenced on 3 September 1969. Operators of the T5 included the RAFs [[Central Flying School]] and No. 1, No. 3 and No. 6 Flying Training Schools.<ref>Thetford, pp. 91\u201395</ref>\n\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost 603 Iraq FAR 12.09.64 edited-2.jpg|thumb|left|Jet Provost T52 of the Iraq Air Force at the [[Farnborough Air Show]] in 1964]]\nBesides service with the RAF, the Jet Provost found success in export markets. A single Jet Provost T2 was exported to Australia and was operated by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) to evaluate the type for the purpose of providing 'all-through' jet-based training.<ref name = \"prov raaf\"/> Following a six-month evaluation period, the RAAF ultimately decided to retain the [[de Havilland Vampire]] to fulfill its requirements for a jet-powered trainer, and later replaced its Vampires with the Italian-built [[Aermacchi MB-326]] during the late 1960s instead. The sole aircraft itself was retained, being presented to the Sydney Technical College for use as an instructional airframe, and was later preserved.<ref name = \"prov raaf\"/><ref name=\"ADF Serials\">http://www.adf-serials.com.au/2a99.htm</ref>\n\nThe Jet Provost was withdrawn from RAF service during the early 1990s, having been replaced by the newer [[turboprop]]-powered [[Short Tucano]]. ''Ab initio'' training had reverted to piston-engined aircraft in the early 1970s, using the [[Scottish Aviation Bulldog]].\n\nThe Jet Provost remains popular among private operators and enthusiasts; being an inexpensive jet, many have been acquired and maintained in a flightworthy condition by collectors and private individuals. Some are flown at airshows, whilst roughly equal numbers are maintained in ground-runnable condition at various locations, many of these being in the United Kingdom.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== Variants ==\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost T5 XW309 V.6 FINN 30.07.77 edited-3.jpg|thumb|Operational Jet Provost T.5 of No.6 Flying Training School in 1977]]\n[[File:Cutaway_Jet_Provost_(3236849646).jpg|thumb|Jet Provost training frame with cutaway sections at [[RAF Cosford]], 2004]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!Number built\n!Manufacturer\n!Comments\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T1'''\n|12\n|Hunting Percival\n|Initial production batch for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T2'''\n|4\n|Hunting Percival\n|Development aircraft only.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T3'''\n|201\n|Hunting Aircraft\n|Main production batch for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T3A'''\n|(70)\n|Hunting\n|Modified T3 with improved avionics for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T4'''\n|198\n|BAC\n|Variant with more powerful engine for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T5'''\n|110\n|BAC\n|Pressurised version for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T5A'''||(93)||BAC||Modified T5 with improved avionics and a rough grey coating on the wing to break up the smooth airflow and give the trainee pilot an early indication of the onset of a stall (the T5's original clean wing gave the pilot little warning).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://all-aero.com/index.php/contactus/7763-percival-p84-jet-provost |title=Percival Hunting P.84 Jet Provost|website=All-aero.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 10 August 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|'''(Jet Provost T5B)'''||(13)||BAC||Unofficial designation: a T5 fitted with tip-tanks used for navigator training.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T51'''\n|22\n|Hunting Aircraft\n|Export version of the T3 (12 built for Ceylon, four built for Sudan, and six built for Kuwait).\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T52'''||43||BAC||Export version of the T4 (20 built for Iraq, 15 built for Venezuela, eight built for Sudan).\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T52A'''||?||BAC||Export version of the T4 (? built for South Yemen).\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T55'''||5||BAC||Export version of the T5, built for Sudan.\n|-\n|'''[[BAC Strikemaster]]'''||146||BAC||Ground attack version of the T5.\n|-\n|'''BAC 166'''||1||BAC||Private venture trial variant of the T4 with a Viper 522 engine.\n|}\n\n== Operators ==\n[[File:jet provost g-bwds kemble arp.jpg|thumb|ex-RAF Jet Provost T3a on display at [[Kemble Airport|Kemble Air Day]] 2008, England]]\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost, Front Range Airport, Colorado.jpg|thumb|A BAC Jet Provost at [[Front Range Airport]], [[Colorado]], 2006]]\n[[File:BAC Jet Provost T5 XW324 U (G-BWSG) (9461785218).jpg|thumb|Underside of a preserved BAC Jet Provost in period RAF markings, 2013]]\n;{{AUS}}\n*[[Royal Australian Air Force]] evaluated single T.2 in No. 1 Basic Flying Training School RAAF for six months in 1959.<ref name=\"ADF Serials\" />\n;{{flag|Ceylon}}\n*[[Sri Lanka Air Force|Royal Ceylon Air Force]] received 12 T.51s.\n;{{flag|Iraq|1963}}\n*[[Iraqi Air Force]] received 20 T.52s, 15 of which survived the 1991 [[Gulf War]].\n;{{KUW}}\n*[[Kuwait Air Force]] received six T.51s.\n;{{POR}}\n*[[Portuguese Air Force]] received one T.2B in 1959.\n;{{SGP}}\n*[[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] operated three (ex-South Yemen Air Force) T.52s from 1975 until 1980.<ref>[http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=60&pagetype=65&appid=1&mode=detailnosummary&fullregmark=PROV UK Civil Aviation Authority Aircraft Register \u2013 Entry for former Singapore AF Jet Provost T52 registered G-PROV]</ref><ref>Andrade 1982, page 192</ref><ref>[http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=60&pagetype=65&appid=1&mode=detailnosummary&fullregmark=JETP \"Jet Provost T52 registered G-JETP.\"] UK Civil Aviation Authority Aircraft Register.

It was originally developed by [[Hunting Percival]] from the earlier [[piston engine]]-powered [[Percival Provost]] basic trainer, and later produced by the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC). In addition to the multiple RAF orders, the Jet Provost, sometimes with light armament, was exported to  many air forces worldwide. The design was also further developed into a more heavily armed [[Attack aircraft|ground attack]] variant under the name [[BAC Strikemaster]].\n\n== Development ==\n===Origins===\nIn early 1951, Hunting Percival began work on the design studies that would ultimately lead to the Jet Provost.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> At the time, the company in the process of establishing mass production for the earlier [[Piston engine|piston-engined]] [[Percival Provost]] basic trainer, but had anticipated that demand for a jet-powered trainer aircraft would be on the horizon. The design team aimed to produce an aircraft capable of equaling the handling characteristics of operational jet fighters of the era while also possessing modest approach and [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] speeds and remaining simple to handle, as opposed to aiming to obtain maximum performance.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/>\n\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost T.1 XD674 Farnborough 10.09.54 edited-2.jpg|thumb|The prototype Jet Provost T.1 with the initial longer undercarriage at the [[Farnborough Air Show]] in 1954]]\nDuring the early design process, a series of increasingly frequent liaisons with [[RAF Flying Training Command]] took place, helping to gauge the considerations required to succeed in aspects of the proposed aircraft's design, such as instructional processes and maintenance requirements.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> During development, Hunting Percival had intentionally reused as many existing components and subsystems of the Percival Provost as possible, including the [[Empennage#Tailplanes|tail surfaces]], [[Wing configuration|main planes]] and main [[landing gear|undercarriage]] legs, to speed development through to the prototype stage.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> The initial design work was performed as a private venture, independent of any service requirement; in March 1953, sponsorship from the British Government to support the development was made available as a result of interest from the [[Ministry of Supply]].<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> That same month, an order for service-test quantity of Jet Provosts was received.<ref name=\"fi55 p587\">''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 587.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes and evaluation===\nOn 16 June 1954, the prototype ''XD674'' conducted its [[maiden flight]] from the factory at [[Luton Airport]], flown by Dick Wheldon.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\">''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, p. 795.</ref> A series of seven flights were flown in quick succession over the following three days. By early November 1954, a total of 123 flying hours had been accumulated by the prototype during Hunting Percival's own flight test program, after which the prototype was submitted for official trials at [[MoD Boscombe Down|RAF Boscombe Down]].<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> While testing proved the overall performance of the Jet Provost to be satisfactory, refinements were made, such as shortening the legs of the landing gear for a smoother ride when deployed at semi-prepared airstrips.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/>\n\nOn 19 February 1955, the first of ten pre-production aircraft, designated as the ''Jet Provost T1'', performed its first flight.<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> In May 1955, three of the pre-production aircraft were assigned for the first stage of service trials with the [[Central Flying School]] (CFS) of the RAF to determine the value of the Jet Provost in the ''[[ab initio]]'' training role and to develop a syllabus for the training program. During the second stage of CFS trials using the same three aircraft, actual students were introduced to the type for practical evaluation purposes, which was performed at [[Hullavington Airfield|RAF Hullavington]] until the successful completion of trials on 2 July 1956.<ref>''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, pp. 795\u2013796.</ref> According to feedback from CFS examiners, the Jet Provost had noticeably improved the performance of students during its trial deployment.<ref name=\"fi58 p796\">''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, p. 796.</ref>\n\n===Further development===\nAs a result of the results and responses produced from the trials performed using the pre-production aircraft, Hunting Percival proceeded to develop and incorporate several different improvements upon the design. Amongst the changes made was an overall smoothening of the fuselage lines, [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] systems being substituted for [[pneumatic]] counterparts, and the addition of a [[Vertical stabilizer#Fins|dorsal fillet]]; the new model was designated as the ''Jet Provost T2''.<ref name=\"fi58 p796\"/> On 1 September 1955, the first Jet Provost T2 made its first flight. This variant was used only for development work; in addition to seeing use at Hullavington, three Jet Provost T2s were dispatched overseas for [[winterization]] trials in [[Scandinavia]] and a series of sales tours across [[Europe]], [[Canada]], the [[United States of America]], and [[Latin America]].<ref name=\"fi58 p796\"/>\n\n[[File:jet and prop provosts arp.jpg|thumb|left|Preserved BAC Jet Provost T5a in formation with a Percival Provost T1]]\nIn June 1957, a production order was placed for the first 40 of the developed ''Jet Provost T3'', featuring a more powerful [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]] jet engine, ejector seats, a redesign of the airframe, and a shortened and strengthened version of the retractable tricycle [[Landing gear|undercarriage]].<ref name=\"fi58 p795\"/> Percival built a single example, which was used purely for structural tests throughout the development stages, giving the designers valuable research into what could be achieved with the basic design.<ref>''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, pp. 796\u2013798.</ref> On 22 June 1958, the first Jet Provost T.3 conducted its first flight.<ref name = \"herit prov\"/> In total, 201 T3s were delivered between 1958 and 1962.\n\nThe ''T4'' followed in 1960, fitted with a more powerful variant of the Viper engine and first flown on 15 July, and this was followed by the [[Cabin pressurization|pressurised]] ''T5'' in 1967.<ref name=\"t5ff\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Flight International]]|date=9 March 1967|page=379|title=The Jet Provost T.5}}</ref> The ''T51'' was an armed export version, sold to Ceylon (present day [[Sri Lanka]]), Kuwait and Sudan.

The aerodynamic design deliberately avoids speed, instead focusing on favourable handling characteristics and ease of recovery from stall and [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]] conditions. An emphasis was placed on flexibility, enabling use of the type throughout a range of training operations.<ref name=\"fi58 p798\">''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, p. 798.</ref>\n\nThe cockpit of the Jet Provost, and much of the operational equipment fittings, is essentially identical to that of the preceding [[Percival Provost]].<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 582-585.</ref> It features a side-by-side seating arrangement, both positions being fitted with duplicated flight controls and instrumentation, which is well suited to the pupil-instructor pairing.<ref name=\"fi55 p583\"/> The dual flight controls employs conventional manually-controlled [[flight control surfaces]] via a cable-and-[[tie rod]] arrangement. A key feature for the era amongst the fittings in the cockpit is the [[Annunciator panel|Centralized Warning Panel]], which alerts the pilots in the event of a number of unfavourable or hazardous conditions being detected, such as [[icing conditions]], fire, and oxygen failure.<ref name=\"fi58 p799\"/> The high-flying capabilities of the Jet Provost necessitated the addition of an [[Oxygen mask#Oxygen masks for aviators|oxygen system]] in the cockpit, which was [[Cabin pressurization|unpressurised]] on early production aircraft.<ref name=\"fi55 p585\"/>\n\nThe Jet Provost has an uncomplicated structure, the airframe being based on the Percival Provost, albeit being strengthened in key areas such as the main wing [[Spar (aeronautics)|spar]] and featuring a substantially different [[landing gear|undercarriage]] arrangement.<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, pp. 582\u2013583.</ref> It possesses an all-metal stressed-skin fuselage built in two sections, the forward section stretching from the rear of the engine bay to the nose comprises a double-frame to absorb the wing and engine loads, while the rear fuselage section uses an orthodox semi-monocoque structure.<ref>''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, pp. 798\u2013799.</ref> Major loads across the fuselage are supported by a combination of four [[longeron]]s and a single [[Collar beam|longitudinal beam]] across the upper-center line.<ref name=\"fi55 p582\">''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 582.</ref> The [[ailerons]], [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]], and [[rudder]] are all attached to the airframe via two inset hinges each.<ref name=\"fi55 p583\"/> The nose contains a hinged metal assembly, housing the [[radio]], batteries, and other electronic equipment, and is easily serviceable by ground crew.<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, pp. 583\u2013584, 586.</ref> All fuel tankage is housed within the wings.<ref name=\"fi55 p586\"/> Where possible, all components used were designed to maximized interchangeability and to conform with international standardisation; a total of 49 service panels across the aircraft's exterior provides access for maintenance and servicing.<ref name=\"fi55 p583\">''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 583.</ref><ref name=\"fi58 p799\">''Flight International'' 13 June 1958, p. 799.</ref>\n\nThe Jet Provost is equipped with a single [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper|Armstrong Siddeley Viper 101]] [[turbojet]] engine, which is mounted behind the cockpit in a roomy [[stainless steel]]-lined engine bay upon a secondary steel-tube structure.<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, pp. 582, 585\u2013586.</ref> Air is fed to the engine by a pair of [[ram-air intake]]s set on either side of the aircraft's forward fuselage connected via sharply-curving ducts to converge just forward of the engine itself.<ref>''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, pp. 584, 586.</ref> As supplied, each engine is delivered as a compact engine-change unit, comprising the engine itself, accessories, and oil tank.<ref name=\"fi55 p582\"/> Both the hydraulic and electrical systems were driven via a fuselage-mounted [[accessory drive|accessories gearbox]] connected to the Viper engine by a [[Telescopic cylinder|telescopic]] drive.<ref name=\"fi55 p586\">''Flight International'', 6 May 1955, p. 586.</ref> One particular favourable aspect of the Viper engine is the low maintenance demands imposed for the era.<ref name=\"fi58 p796\"/> Engine ignition is achieved via an electric starter system, the engine controls have been described as being of a conventional nature.<ref name=\"fi55 p586\"/>\n\n== Operational service ==\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost T.3 XN605 '9' 6 FTS Valley 03.09.67 edited-2.jpg|thumb|Operational Jet Provost T3 of No.6 Flying Training School, RAF, in 1967]]\n\nThe Jet Provost proved to be a capable trainer, being used in the an initio Basic Trainer role from the outset (pilots progessed to the [[de Havilland Vampire]] and later the [[Folland Gnat]] for Advanced Jet Training).\n\nAfter successful acceptance trials of the T1 during late 1955 at No. 2 Flying Training School at [[RAF Hullavington]], the RAF formally accepted the type in 1957. The first production version was the T3, powered by the Viper 102, and this entered service with No. 2 FTS, located at [[RAF Syerston]], during June 1959, when deliveries commenced from the Hunting Aircraft factory at [[Luton airport]]. The T3 was also operated by [[Central Flying School]] at [[RAF Little Rissington]]; the [[Royal Air Force College]] at [[RAF Cranwell]],  Lincolnshire; by No. 1 Flying Training School at [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]], Yorkshire; 3FTS at [[RAF Leeming]], Yorkshire; 6FTS at [[RAF Acklington]], Northumberland; and 7FTS at [[RAF Church Fenton]], Yorkshire. The twin-seated side by side variant was also used at [[RAF Brawdy]] in Wales to train [[Forward Air Controllers]].\n\nThe later T4 was fitted with the more powerful Viper A.S.V. 11 of 2,500&nbsp;lbs static [[thrust]] and first flew on 15 July 1960. It quickly entered service with the units listed above.\n\nThe T5 variant was fitted with the Viper 201 and cockpit pressurisation. These developments encouraged the RAF to utilise the Jet Provost in a number of different roles besides basic training. With a top speed of 440&nbsp;mph, excellent maneuverability, mechanical reliability and low operating costs, the Jet Provost was utilized as an [[Aerobatics|aerobatic]] aircraft, air warfare and tactical weapons training as well as advanced training. The first T5 made its maiden flight on 28 February 1967 and deliveries from BAC{{'}}s [[Warton, Fylde|Warton]] factory commenced on 3 September 1969. Operators of the T5 included the RAFs [[Central Flying School]] and No. 1, No. 3 and No. 6 Flying Training Schools.<ref>Thetford, pp. 91\u201395</ref>\n\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost 603 Iraq FAR 12.09.64 edited-2.jpg|thumb|left|Jet Provost T52 of the Iraq Air Force at the [[Farnborough Air Show]] in 1964]]\nBesides service with the RAF, the Jet Provost found success in export markets. A single Jet Provost T2 was exported to Australia and was operated by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) to evaluate the type for the purpose of providing 'all-through' jet-based training.<ref name = \"prov raaf\"/> Following a six-month evaluation period, the RAAF ultimately decided to retain the [[de Havilland Vampire]] to fulfill its requirements for a jet-powered trainer, and later replaced its Vampires with the Italian-built [[Aermacchi MB-326]] during the late 1960s instead. The sole aircraft itself was retained, being presented to the Sydney Technical College for use as an instructional airframe, and was later preserved.<ref name = \"prov raaf\"/><ref name=\"ADF Serials\">http://www.adf-serials.com.au/2a99.htm</ref>\n\nThe Jet Provost was withdrawn from RAF service during the early 1990s, having been replaced by the newer [[turboprop]]-powered [[Short Tucano]]. Ab initio training had reverted to piston-engined aircraft in the early 1970s, using the [[Scottish Aviation Bulldog]].\n\nThe Jet Provost remains popular among private operators and enthusiasts; being an inexpensive jet, many have been acquired and maintained in a flightworthy condition by collectors and private individuals. Some are flown at airshows, whilst roughly equal numbers are maintained in ground-runnable condition at various locations, many of these being in the United Kingdom.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n== Variants ==\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost T5 XW309 V.6 FINN 30.07.77 edited-3.jpg|thumb|Operational Jet Provost T.5 of No.6 Flying Training School in 1977]]\n[[File:Cutaway_Jet_Provost_(3236849646).jpg|thumb|Jet Provost training frame with cutaway sections at [[RAF Cosford]], 2004]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!Number built\n!Manufacturer\n!Comments\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T1'''\n|12\n|Hunting Percival\n|Initial production batch for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T2'''\n|4\n|Hunting Percival\n|Development aircraft only.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T3'''\n|201\n|Hunting Aircraft\n|Main production batch for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T3A'''\n|(70)\n|Hunting\n|Modified T3 with improved avionics for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T4'''\n|198\n|BAC\n|Variant with more powerful engine for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T5'''\n|110\n|BAC\n|Pressurised version for the RAF.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T5A'''||(93)||BAC||Modified T5 with improved avionics and a rough grey coating on the wing to break up the smooth airflow and give the trainee pilot an early indication of the onset of a stall (the T5's original clean wing gave the pilot little warning).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://all-aero.com/index.php/contactus/7763-percival-p84-jet-provost |title=Percival Hunting P.84 Jet Provost|website=All-aero.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 10 August 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|'''(Jet Provost T5B)'''||(13)||BAC||Unofficial designation: a T5 fitted with tip-tanks used for navigator training.\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T51'''\n|22\n|Hunting Aircraft\n|Export version of the T3 (12 built for Ceylon, four built for Sudan, and six built for Kuwait).\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T52'''||43||BAC||Export version of the T4 (20 built for Iraq, 15 built for Venezuela, eight built for Sudan).\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T52A'''||?||BAC||Export version of the T4 (? built for South Yemen).\n|-\n|'''Jet Provost T55'''||5||BAC||Export version of the T5, built for Sudan.\n|-\n|'''[[BAC Strikemaster]]'''||146||BAC||Ground attack version of the T5.\n|-\n|'''BAC 166'''||1||BAC||Private venture trial variant of the T4 with a Viper 522 engine.\n|}\n\n== Operators ==\n[[File:jet provost g-bwds kemble arp.jpg|thumb|ex-RAF Jet Provost T3a on display at [[Kemble Airport|Kemble Air Day]] 2008, England]]\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost, Front Range Airport, Colorado.jpg|thumb|A BAC Jet Provost at [[Front Range Airport]], [[Colorado]], 2006]]\n[[File:BAC Jet Provost T5 XW324 U (G-BWSG) (9461785218).jpg|thumb|Underside of a preserved BAC Jet Provost in period RAF markings, 2013]]\n;{{AUS}}\n*[[Royal Australian Air Force]] evaluated single T.2 in No. 1 Basic Flying Training School RAAF for six months in 1959.<ref name=\"ADF Serials\" />\n;{{flag|Ceylon}}\n*[[Sri Lanka Air Force|Royal Ceylon Air Force]] received 12 T.51s.\n;{{flag|Iraq|1963}}\n*[[Iraqi Air Force]] received 20 T.52s, 15 of which survived the 1991 [[Gulf War]].\n;{{KUW}}\n*[[Kuwait Air Force]] received six T.51s.\n;{{POR}}\n*[[Portuguese Air Force]] received one T.2B in 1959.\n;{{SGP}}\n*[[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] operated three (ex-South Yemen Air Force) T.52s from 1975 until 1980.<ref>[http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=60&pagetype=65&appid=1&mode=detailnosummary&fullregmark=PROV UK Civil Aviation Authority Aircraft Register \u2013 Entry for former Singapore AF Jet Provost T52 registered G-PROV]</ref><ref>Andrade 1982, page 192</ref><ref>[http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=60&pagetype=65&appid=1&mode=detailnosummary&fullregmark=JETP \"Jet Provost T52 registered G-JETP.\"] UK Civil Aviation Authority Aircraft Register.

In December 2009, the Ituna-Itut\u00e1 land had 12,000 hectares felled, an increase of 656% over the same period last year, says ISA. Deforestation in indigenous lands has broken a record in 11 years, according to a study released on Monday 16 by the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA). The survey shows that, between August 2018 and July 2019, the destruction of forests in indigenous Amazonian lands reached 42,600 hectares. The number is equivalent to 51 million trees felled, the largest extension since the period between 2007 and 2008. The numbers were analyzed by ISA based on official data from the Brazilian Amazon Forest Deforestation Monitoring Program (Prodes) from the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe), released at the end of November.<ref>https://www.mma.gov.br/</ref>\n\nIn Brazil, researchers make a direct connection between the advance of deforestation and the increased incidence of malaria in deforested regions. A study carried out in the Amazon showed that the increase in forest loss in 4% of newly deforested areas in a municipality caused an increase of 50% in cases of malaria. This is because as destruction progresses over green areas, open clearings end up being an ideal environment for the proliferation of the mosquito that transmits the disease. From August 2018 to July 2019, the Amazon lost almost 10,000 km\u00b2 of forest - the highest rate of deforestation in the decade. Which means that the planet is also losing biodiversity, that is, reducing species of animals and plants that live there, and also losing the ability to protect us from the imbalance that this destruction can cause.<ref>https://www.greenpeace.org/brasil/blog/como-o-desmatamento-tem-nos-deixado-mais-doentes/</ref>\n\nDespite the data talking about the biggest crisis in the Amazon in years, the clearing of vegetation in indigenous lands represents only 4.2% of the total deforestation of the biome. \u201cLand grabbing, illegal mining and theft of wood by invaders continue to be the main vectors of the problem,\u201d reports ISA. In absolute numbers, the number of inspection, prevention and information collection operations carried out by Funai (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio) has remained stable, but the Institute points out that the actions taken by Ibama that had a drop of 22% in 2019. In addition moreover, there is greater difficulty in overcoming the tone of destruction by the operations carried out. \u201cThe anti-environmental and anti-indigenous rhetoric aggravates the difficulties of inspection, which also influence the rates of deforestation, by supporting those who commit environmental crimes and mobilizing the local population against those who fight them\u201d, ponders the NGO.\n\nThe six most deforested indigenous areas are in southwestern Par\u00e1, according to data from Prodes / Inpe. The region accumulates 80% of all deforestation committed on indigenous lands in the Amazon in the analyzed period. The Ituna-Itut\u00e1 land is the most serious case recorded: the 12 thousand hectares felled represent an increase of 656% in relation to the same period of the previous year. \u201cHe [the territory] has records of isolated indigenous peoples, very vulnerable to conflict and disease. Funai informed the report that it carried out three expeditions this year to try to locate them and that \u201cnew activities\u201d are planned for 2020 \u2033, quotes ISA. According to the NGO, declarations against the demarcation of indigenous lands and weakened policies for monitoring fires and deforestation strengthen the escalation of destroyed hectares.\n\nIn Ituna Itat\u00e1, Par\u00e1, deforestation was frightening: 656% higher in 2019. The report accuses the government of contributing to this scenario. The decisions made by the government of Jair Bolsonaro weakened environmental control policies in the country and contributed to the reduction of inspection, the increase in deforestation on public lands and, consequently, the violation of the rights of indigenous peoples. It cites examples of government decisions such as deep budget cuts, mainly affecting enforcement; cancellation of fines; stoppage of significant financing for conservation; release of environmental authorizations in spite of technical opinions.\n\nThe institute also warns of the government's project that authorizes mining on indigenous lands, which was submitted to Congress for analysis. The study will be presented on Tuesday (3) to the UN Human Rights Commission in Switzerland. The objective is to draw the attention of the international community to the growing threats to indigenous peoples and to ask the Brazilian government to strengthen inspection and control in the Amazon. This Monday (2), at a UN meeting in Geneva, the Yanomami chief Davi Kopenawa asked for help.\n\n\"I come here to alert and also inform what our indigenous people are in need of.\"\n\nThe Yanomami land in Roraima has eight records of isolated peoples. The study denounces that there is an invasion of 20,000 illegal gold miners in search of gold. The Ministry of the Environment and Funai declared that they did not have access to the report and did not want to manifest themselves.<ref>https://www.cartacapital.com.br/sustentabilidade/desmatamento-em-terras-indigenas-e-o-maior-em-11-anos-diz-estudo/</ref><ref>https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2020/03/02/aumenta-o-desmatamento-em-terras-indigenas-diz-estudo.ghtml</ref>\n\nOn 25 March, the Ministry of the Environment signed the receipt of approximately R $ 500 million from the Green Climate Fund. Brazil is the first country to receive the resource for results in reducing deforestation in the Legal Amazon. In the conservation module, the forecast is R $ 250 per hectare per year, for a period of 4 years, with eligibility criteria and monitoring of the area enrolled in the program for the entire period.<ref>https://www.mma.gov.br/component/k2/item/15738-mma-assina-recebimento-de-96-milh%C3%B5es-de-d%C3%B3lares-para-proteger-a-amaz%C3%B4nia.html</ref>\n\nOn 27 March, Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights (MMFDH) prepared a series of social media posts with guidelines for three groups of traditional peoples and communities: quilombolas, gypsies and indigenous people. The objective is to bring specific information to these segments about the prevention of the new coronavirus (Covid-19). The materials began to be released earlier this week on social networks of the National Secretariat for Policies to Promote Racial Equality (SNPIR) and MMFDH. Cards can also be shared via WhatsApp, Telegram and other applications. \u201cMMFDH, through SNPIR, has joined efforts with the Federal Government to guarantee the promotion of the rights of traditional communities. And that includes the right to the correct information for the prevention of Covid-19. These materials reinforce the orientation according to their customs \u201d, said the SNPIR national secretary, the indigenous Sandra Terena.<ref>https://www.mdh.gov.br/todas-as-noticias/2020-2/marco/ministerio-lanca-material-nas-redes-sociais-para-orientar-povos-e-comunidades-tradicionais-sobre-o-novo-coronavirus</ref>\n\nOn 28 March, The first death caused by the covid-19 in the Federal District was that of an indigenous Pareci. The victim, Israel Tiago Martins, 46, did not live in a village, according to the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health of the Ministry of Health. Martins has lived since February in the federal capital, in a settlement in Rota do Cavalo, in the countryside. Indigenous and non-indigenous residents live there. He was born in C\u00e1ceres (MT) and previously lived in S\u00e3o Carlos (SP). The Special Indigenous Sanitary Districts are on alert, in the containment phase of covid-19. Currently, there are 13 cases considered to be suspected of being infected with the new coronavirus being monitored by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health. Seven of them are from Indians who live in the South and Southeast regions of the country, in the Interior South (4) and South Coast (3) districts. Two other suspected Xavante infections have already been ruled out by the Ministry of Health, according to the most recent epidemiological bulletin.\n\nAccording to the ministry, 800,000 indigenous people live in villages under the responsibility of serving 34 special health districts across the country. The greater susceptibility of indigenous people to respiratory infections was used by the secretariat to ask for the closure of borders and effective measures to ensure the effective ban foreigners. According to data from the ministry, 79,000 Indians live in Yanomami and eastern Roraima lands, near Venezuela and Guyana; 76 thousand Indians, in the Alto Solim\u00f5es and Vale do Javari region, close to Peru and Colombia. Another 13,000 are in the Amap\u00e1 and Northern Par\u00e1 region, neighboring French Guiana.<ref>https://noticias.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/agencia-estado/2020/03/28/primeira-morte-por-covid-19-em-brasilia-e-de-indigena.htm</ref>\n\nOn 01 April, The Amazonas Health Surveillance Foundation today confirmed (1st) the first case of the new coronavirus among Brazilian Indians. According to the foundation, linked to the state health department (Susam), this is a 20-year-old girl, ethnic Kokama, who works as an indigenous health agent in the region of the city of Santo Ant\u00f4nio do I\u00e7\u00e1 (AM). The municipality, which is in the Alto Solim\u00f5es micro-region, is part of the Alto Rio Solim\u00f5es Indigenous Special Sanitary District. According to the foundation, the patient may have had contact with the doctor who works in the same district and who also tested positive for covid-19. Also according to Sesai, the health worker did not show any symptoms of the infection. His relatives are also being assisted and in isolation. In addition, surveillance actions have been stepped up across the region to try to prevent flu-like and severe acute respiratory syndromes from spreading.\n\nRegarding the possibility of transmission of the virus among the indigenous people, Sesai claims to be attentive, \"working to serve the more than 800,000 indigenous people living and present throughout Brazil\", in accordance with technical guidelines to help prevent, combat and treat infection with covid-19. In a note, the National Indian Foundation (Funai) recalled that, as a precaution, it suspended the granting of new authorizations for the entry of non-Indians into indigenous lands. And that is monitoring the situation in the villages, in partnership with Sesai, which is responsible for defining the disease prevention instructions. Funai, on the other hand, guarantees that it is working \u201cin the orientation and dissemination of information among the indigenous communities\u201d.\n\nAt the end of the afternoon, when presenting the latest figures on covid-19 in the country, the Minister of Health, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, said that the possibility of the disease spreading among indigenous peoples is \"a major concern\" of all authorities . \u201cHistory [demonstrates that] Indians have always had a very different response [from non-Indians] and may have greater curves in relation to morbidity and lethality in relation to this disease. We're warning. There have already been indigenous leaders arriving [on a trip abroad] who were recommended not to go to the village, to do a 14-day quarantine, and who insisted and went. Finally, triple care must be taken in these communities. Especially with those who have little coexistence [with non-Indians] and an immune system not prepared for a situation like this \u201d, declared the minister, recalling that indigenous cultural habits can contribute to spread the disease among their own communities if the virus reaches the villages.<ref>https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/saude/noticia/2020-04/agente-de-saude-e-primeira-indigena-ter-coronavirus-confirmado</ref>\n\nOn 02 April, it looked like a April 1st lie. Yesterday, the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) revealed an error in its budget, described in the Annual Budget Law (LOA), which can simply paralyze environmental preservation and inspection actions. In practice, it is as if the entire 2020 budget for these activities had been spent in March. MMA sent a letter to the Ministry of Economy to try to correct the error. Until they resolve, the protection of the forest remains even more threatened. It draws attention to the administrative incapacity of the portfolio, which, in the last year, had its bad management criticized nationally and internationally, and was responsible for a 30% increase in deforestation in the Amazon, compared to the previous year.\n\nIf the reduction in the inspection of deforestation announced in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic was not enough, MMA, instead of seeking solutions to protect the forest and the people who depend on it, makes the scenario even worse. Without cash on hand to carry on activities, the threat to the forest - which was already enormous - only increases, with the aggravating danger of environmental criminals taking the virus to populations more vulnerable to diseases, such as indigenous peoples. As we have shown in this article, grileiros, garimpeiros and loggers do not do home office. On the Brazilian border with French Guiana, by the way, indigenous people are already reporting an increase in the number of gold miners during the pandemic.<ref>https://www.greenpeace.org/brasil/blog/erro-em-orcamento-coloca-floresta-e-seus-povos-sob-ainda-mais-ameaca/</ref>\n\nOn 03 April, The state of Amazonas received, this Thursday (02/04), a batch with 9,600 rapid tests for new coronavirus, sent by the Ministry of Health. A first shipment of 60,000 rapid tests acquired by the State Government is also being awaited. According to the State Health Secretariat (Susam), the delivery of the first batch with 30,000 tests is scheduled for Monday (06/04). During Thursday's online press conference, health secretary Rodrigo Tobias explained the criteria for distribution and application of tests in the health network. The acquisition of 60,000 rapid tests is part of a series of measures adopted by the government of Amazonas, which includes the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators and other inputs to face Covid 19.<ref>http://www.fvs.am.gov.br/noticias_view/3811</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nOn 19 March, [[Eduardo Bolsonaro]], son of President Jair Bolsonaro, set off a diplomatic dispute with China, Brazil's largest trading partner, when he retweeted a message blaming the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] for the virus.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/rio-reports-first-coronavirus-deaths-163812406.html Brazil coronavirus cases top 600, diplomatic spat with China bubbles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320192215/https://news.yahoo.com/rio-reports-first-coronavirus-deaths-163812406.html |date=20 March 2020 }} By Pedro Fonseca, Reuters, 19 March 2020</ref> Yang Wanming, China's top diplomat in Brazil, later retweeted a message saying \"The Bolsonaro family is the great poison of this country.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Bolsonaro's son enrages Beijing by blaming China for coronavirus crisis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-bolsonaro-son-china-row |work=The Guardian |date=19 March 2020 |access-date=22 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320190353/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-bolsonaro-son-china-row |archive-date=20 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nBolsonaro made a televised speech about the pandemic, during which both pro and anti-Bolsonaro ''[[Cacerolazo|panela\u00e7os]]'' broke out in the largest cities of Brazil.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-51955679|title=Brazil coronavirus protesters urge 'Bolsonaro out'|date=19 March 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=22 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322135850/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-51955679|archive-date=22 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> \nAccording to one poll, 64% of Brazilians reject the way Bolsonaro has been handling the pandemic, while 44.8% support his [[impeachment]], an all-time high.<ref>[https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2020-03-19/gestao-de-bolsonaro-do-coronavirus-e-reprovada-por-64-e-45-se-dizem-a-favor-de-impeachment.html \"Gest\u00e3o de Bolsonaro do coronav\u00edrus \u00e9 reprovada por 64%, e 45% se dizem a favor de impeachment\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323021820/https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2020-03-19/gestao-de-bolsonaro-do-coronavirus-e-reprovada-por-64-e-45-se-dizem-a-favor-de-impeachment.html |date=23 March 2020 }}.

Brazil took longer to go from 100 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 than countries like Italy and Spain. The data used were compiled by the American university Johns Hopkins. The country passed 100 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on March 13th. That day, 151 cases were recorded. Eight days later, on March 21st, Brazil reached the 1,000th positive test and reached 1,021 people with the disease. In Italy, this movement took place between February 23rd and 29th (six days); in Spain, between March 2nd and 9th  (seven days).

In December 2009, the Ituna-Itut\u00e1 land had 12,000 hectares felled, an increase of 656% over the same period last year, says ISA. Deforestation in indigenous lands has broken a record in 11 years, according to a study released on Monday 16 by the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA). The survey shows that, between August 2018 and July 2019, the destruction of forests in indigenous Amazonian lands reached 42,600 hectares. The number is equivalent to 51 million trees felled, the largest extension since the period between 2007 and 2008. The numbers were analyzed by ISA based on official data from the Brazilian Amazon Forest Deforestation Monitoring Program (Prodes) from the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe), released at the end of November.<ref>https://www.mma.gov.br/</ref>\n\nIn Brazil, researchers make a direct connection between the advance of deforestation and the increased incidence of malaria in deforested regions. A study carried out in the Amazon showed that the increase in forest loss in 4% of newly deforested areas in a municipality caused an increase of 50% in cases of malaria. This is because as destruction progresses over green areas, open clearings end up being an ideal environment for the proliferation of the mosquito that transmits the disease. From August 2018 to July 2019, the Amazon lost almost 10,000 km\u00b2 of forest - the highest rate of deforestation in the decade. Which means that the planet is also losing biodiversity, that is, reducing species of animals and plants that live there, and also losing the ability to protect us from the imbalance that this destruction can cause.<ref>https://www.greenpeace.org/brasil/blog/como-o-desmatamento-tem-nos-deixado-mais-doentes/</ref>\n\nDespite the data talking about the biggest crisis in the Amazon in years, the clearing of vegetation in indigenous lands represents only 4.2% of the total deforestation of the biome. \u201cLand grabbing, illegal mining and theft of wood by invaders continue to be the main vectors of the problem,\u201d reports ISA. In absolute numbers, the number of inspection, prevention and information collection operations carried out by Funai (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio) has remained stable, but the Institute points out that the actions taken by Ibama that had a drop of 22% in 2019. In addition moreover, there is greater difficulty in overcoming the tone of destruction by the operations carried out. \u201cThe anti-environmental and anti-indigenous rhetoric aggravates the difficulties of inspection, which also influence the rates of deforestation, by supporting those who commit environmental crimes and mobilizing the local population against those who fight them\u201d, ponders the NGO.\n\nThe six most deforested indigenous areas are in southwestern Par\u00e1, according to data from Prodes / Inpe. The region accumulates 80% of all deforestation committed on indigenous lands in the Amazon in the analyzed period. The Ituna-Itut\u00e1 land is the most serious case recorded: the 12 thousand hectares felled represent an increase of 656% in relation to the same period of the previous year. \u201cHe [the territory] has records of isolated indigenous peoples, very vulnerable to conflict and disease. Funai informed the report that it carried out three expeditions this year to try to locate them and that \u201cnew activities\u201d are planned for 2020 \u2033, quotes ISA. According to the NGO, declarations against the demarcation of indigenous lands and weakened policies for monitoring fires and deforestation strengthen the escalation of destroyed hectares.\n\nIn Ituna Itat\u00e1, Par\u00e1, deforestation was frightening: 656% higher in 2019. The report accuses the government of contributing to this scenario. The decisions made by the government of Jair Bolsonaro weakened environmental control policies in the country and contributed to the reduction of inspection, the increase in deforestation on public lands and, consequently, the violation of the rights of indigenous peoples. It cites examples of government decisions such as deep budget cuts, mainly affecting enforcement; cancellation of fines; stoppage of significant financing for conservation; release of environmental authorizations in spite of technical opinions.\n\nThe institute also warns of the government's project that authorizes mining on indigenous lands, which was submitted to Congress for analysis. The study will be presented on Tuesday (3) to the UN Human Rights Commission in Switzerland. The objective is to draw the attention of the international community to the growing threats to indigenous peoples and to ask the Brazilian government to strengthen inspection and control in the Amazon. This Monday (2), at a UN meeting in Geneva, the Yanomami chief Davi Kopenawa asked for help.\n\n\"I come here to alert and also inform what our indigenous people are in need of.\"\n\nThe Yanomami land in Roraima has eight records of isolated peoples. The study denounces that there is an invasion of 20,000 illegal gold miners in search of gold. The Ministry of the Environment and Funai declared that they did not have access to the report and did not want to manifest themselves.<ref>https://www.cartacapital.com.br/sustentabilidade/desmatamento-em-terras-indigenas-e-o-maior-em-11-anos-diz-estudo/</ref><ref>https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2020/03/02/aumenta-o-desmatamento-em-terras-indigenas-diz-estudo.ghtml</ref>\n\nOn 25 March, the Ministry of the Environment signed the receipt of approximately R $ 500 million from the Green Climate Fund. Brazil is the first country to receive the resource for results in reducing deforestation in the Legal Amazon. In the conservation module, the forecast is R $ 250 per hectare per year, for a period of 4 years, with eligibility criteria and monitoring of the area enrolled in the program for the entire period.<ref>https://www.mma.gov.br/component/k2/item/15738-mma-assina-recebimento-de-96-milh%C3%B5es-de-d%C3%B3lares-para-proteger-a-amaz%C3%B4nia.html</ref>\n\nOn 27 March, Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights (MMFDH) prepared a series of social media posts with guidelines for three groups of traditional peoples and communities: quilombolas, gypsies and indigenous people. The objective is to bring specific information to these segments about the prevention of the new coronavirus (Covid-19). The materials began to be released earlier this week on social networks of the National Secretariat for Policies to Promote Racial Equality (SNPIR) and MMFDH. Cards can also be shared via WhatsApp, Telegram and other applications. \u201cMMFDH, through SNPIR, has joined efforts with the Federal Government to guarantee the promotion of the rights of traditional communities. And that includes the right to the correct information for the prevention of Covid-19. These materials reinforce the orientation according to their customs \u201d, said the SNPIR national secretary, the indigenous Sandra Terena.<ref>https://www.mdh.gov.br/todas-as-noticias/2020-2/marco/ministerio-lanca-material-nas-redes-sociais-para-orientar-povos-e-comunidades-tradicionais-sobre-o-novo-coronavirus</ref>\n\nOn 28 March, The first death caused by the covid-19 in the Federal District was that of an indigenous Pareci. The victim, Israel Tiago Martins, 46, did not live in a village, according to the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health of the Ministry of Health. Martins has lived since February in the federal capital, in a settlement in Rota do Cavalo, in the countryside. Indigenous and non-indigenous residents live there. He was born in C\u00e1ceres (MT) and previously lived in S\u00e3o Carlos (SP). The Special Indigenous Sanitary Districts are on alert, in the containment phase of covid-19. Currently, there are 13 cases considered to be suspected of being infected with the new coronavirus being monitored by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health. Seven of them are from Indians who live in the South and Southeast regions of the country, in the Interior South (4) and South Coast (3) districts. Two other suspected Xavante infections have already been ruled out by the Ministry of Health, according to the most recent epidemiological bulletin.\n\nAccording to the ministry, 800,000 indigenous people live in villages under the responsibility of serving 34 special health districts across the country. The greater susceptibility of indigenous people to respiratory infections was used by the secretariat to ask for the closure of borders and effective measures to ensure the effective ban foreigners. According to data from the ministry, 79,000 Indians live in Yanomami and eastern Roraima lands, near Venezuela and Guyana; 76 thousand Indians, in the Alto Solim\u00f5es and Vale do Javari region, close to Peru and Colombia. Another 13,000 are in the Amap\u00e1 and Northern Par\u00e1 region, neighboring French Guiana.<ref>https://noticias.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/agencia-estado/2020/03/28/primeira-morte-por-covid-19-em-brasilia-e-de-indigena.htm</ref>\n\nOn 01 April, The Amazonas Health Surveillance Foundation today confirmed (1st) the first case of the new coronavirus among Brazilian Indians. According to the foundation, linked to the state health department (Susam), this is a 20-year-old girl, ethnic Kokama, who works as an indigenous health agent in the region of the city of Santo Ant\u00f4nio do I\u00e7\u00e1 (AM). The municipality, which is in the Alto Solim\u00f5es micro-region, is part of the Alto Rio Solim\u00f5es Indigenous Special Sanitary District. According to the foundation, the patient may have had contact with the doctor who works in the same district and who also tested positive for covid-19. Also according to Sesai, the health worker did not show any symptoms of the infection. His relatives are also being assisted and in isolation. In addition, surveillance actions have been stepped up across the region to try to prevent flu-like and severe acute respiratory syndromes from spreading.\n\nRegarding the possibility of transmission of the virus among the indigenous people, Sesai claims to be attentive, \"working to serve the more than 800,000 indigenous people living and present throughout Brazil\", in accordance with technical guidelines to help prevent, combat and treat infection with covid-19. In a note, the National Indian Foundation (Funai) recalled that, as a precaution, it suspended the granting of new authorizations for the entry of non-Indians into indigenous lands. And that is monitoring the situation in the villages, in partnership with Sesai, which is responsible for defining the disease prevention instructions. Funai, on the other hand, guarantees that it is working \u201cin the orientation and dissemination of information among the indigenous communities\u201d.\n\nAt the end of the afternoon, when presenting the latest figures on covid-19 in the country, the Minister of Health, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, said that the possibility of the disease spreading among indigenous peoples is \"a major concern\" of all authorities . \u201cHistory [demonstrates that] Indians have always had a very different response [from non-Indians] and may have greater curves in relation to morbidity and lethality in relation to this disease. We're warning. There have already been indigenous leaders arriving [on a trip abroad] who were recommended not to go to the village, to do a 14-day quarantine, and who insisted and went. Finally, triple care must be taken in these communities. Especially with those who have little coexistence [with non-Indians] and an immune system not prepared for a situation like this \u201d, declared the minister, recalling that indigenous cultural habits can contribute to spread the disease among their own communities if the virus reaches the villages.<ref>https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/saude/noticia/2020-04/agente-de-saude-e-primeira-indigena-ter-coronavirus-confirmado</ref>\n\nOn 02 April, it looked like a April 1st lie. Yesterday, the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) revealed an error in its budget, described in the Annual Budget Law (LOA), which can simply paralyze environmental preservation and inspection actions. In practice, it is as if the entire 2020 budget for these activities had been spent in March. MMA sent a letter to the Ministry of Economy to try to correct the error. Until they resolve, the protection of the forest remains even more threatened. It draws attention to the administrative incapacity of the portfolio, which, in the last year, had its bad management criticized nationally and internationally, and was responsible for a 30% increase in deforestation in the Amazon, compared to the previous year.\n\nIf the reduction in the inspection of deforestation announced in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic was not enough, MMA, instead of seeking solutions to protect the forest and the people who depend on it, makes the scenario even worse. Without cash on hand to carry on activities, the threat to the forest - which was already enormous - only increases, with the aggravating danger of environmental criminals taking the virus to populations more vulnerable to diseases, such as indigenous peoples. As we have shown in this article, grileiros, garimpeiros and loggers do not do home office.

We have already complained to Cedae, the company said it is resolving, but we already know that the favela is always the last to receive everything and that the rights only come after a lot of collection \".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://s2.glbimg.com/_pbfQW3RR8K11JBZvO2u590X8FM=/0x41:720x861/1600x0/smart/filters:strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_59edd422c0c84a879bd37670ae4f538a/internal_photos/bs/2020/v/O/AA9BvNRQSiodWbwzkd2w/jacarezinho.jfif |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324094915/https://s2.glbimg.com/_pbfQW3RR8K11JBZvO2u590X8FM%3D/0x41:720x861/1600x0/smart/filters:strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_59edd422c0c84a879bd37670ae4f538a/internal_photos/bs/2020/v/O/AA9BvNRQSiodWbwzkd2w/jacarezinho.jfif |archive-date=24 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2020/03/23/favelas-do-rio-tem-63-casos-suspeitos-do-novo-coronavirus.ghtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324154450/https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2020/03/23/favelas-do-rio-tem-63-casos-suspeitos-do-novo-coronavirus.ghtml |archive-date=24 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2020/03/23/favelas-do-rio-sofrem-com-falta-d-agua-e-populacao-fica-mais-vulneravel-a-coronavirus |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324094920/https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2020/03/23/favelas-do-rio-sofrem-com-falta-d-agua-e-populacao-fica-mais-vulneravel-a-coronavirus |archive-date=24 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Healthcare===\n\n[[File:Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade -01- Boletim Infec\u00e7\u00e3o Humana pelo Novo Coronav\u00edrus 2019-nCoV.pdf|thumb|Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade -01- Boletim Infec\u00e7\u00e3o Humana pelo Novo Coronav\u00edrus 2019-nCoV]]\n\nOn 23 January, faced with cases of respiratory disease in [[China]], caused by the new coronavirus, the [[Ministry of Health]] installed, this Wednesday (01/22), the Emergency Operations Center (COE) - new coronavirus. The committee's objective is to prepare the public health system to deal with possible cases in Brazil. So far, there is no detection of any suspected cases in the country. The portfolio has been carrying out daily monitoring of the situation with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which has been monitoring the issue since the first reports of cases in [[Wuhan]], [[China]], on December 31, 2019. The [[Ministry of Health]] conducted this Thursday (23), in [[Bras\u00edlia]], a technical press conference to clarify doubts about the virus and inform the actions that the portfolio has taken, with the state and municipal health departments, in addition to other bodies, for a possible treatment of a suspected case in the country. During the press conference, the acting Health Minister, [[Jo\u00e3o Gabbardo]], highlighted that the portfolio will continue to inform Brazilian society as the situation updates by the WHO. \u201cThe Ministry of Health has an obligation to clarify and not generate unnecessary panic in the population and we are working together with the state departments for this purpose. Our laboratory network is prepared to carry out the tests and make the diagnostics \", highlighted Jo\u00e3o Gabbardo.\n\nThe COE is composed of technicians specialized in responding to public health emergencies. In addition to the [[Ministry of Health]], the group includes the Pan American Health Organization ([[PAHO]] / [[WHO]]), the National Health Surveillance Agency ([[Anvisa]]), the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC), and other bodies. In this way, the country will be able to respond in a unified and immediate way to the entry of the virus in Brazilian territory. The [[Ministry of Health]] provides basic care to reduce the overall risk of acute [[respiratory infections]]. Among the guidelines are: avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections; perform frequent hand washing, especially after direct contact with sick people or the environment; avoid close contact with wild animals and sick animals on farms.\n\nSince learning about the cases of severe [[pneumonia]] in [[China]], the Brazilian [[Federal Government]] has adopted several actions to monitor and improve the country's capacity to act. These actions include the adoption of measures recommended by WHO; the notification of the Ports, Airports and Borders area of \u200b\u200bthe National Health Surveillance Agency ([[Anvisa]]); the notification of the Animal Surveillance area of \u200b\u200bthe [[Ministry of Agriculture]], Livestock and Supply (MAPA); and the notification to the Health Departments of the States and Municipalities, other Secretariats of the Ministry of Health and other federal agencies based on official data, avoiding restrictive and disproportionate measures in relation to the risks to the health and transit of people, goods and goods.<ref>{{cite web | last=Sa\u00fade | first=Minist\u00e9rio da | title=Brasil prepara rede de sa\u00fade para novo coronav\u00edrus | website=Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade | date=2020-01-23 | url=https://www.saude.gov.br/noticias/agencia-saude/46219-brasil-prepara-rede-de-saude-para-novo-coronavirus | language=pt | access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nSince the first cases were reported in the country, there were concerns if its [[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade|healthcare system]] would be able to deal with the pandemic.\n\nOn 18 March, hospitals in [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] denounced a lack of health materials, such as masks, gloves and [[hand sanitizer]], caused by an in an increase in prices.<ref name=\"auto8\">{{cite web|url=https://noticias.uol.com.br/saude/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2020/03/19/funcionarios-relatam-falta-de-alcool-gel-e-luvas-em-hospitais-de-sao-paulo.htm|title=Funcion\u00e1rios relatam falta de \u00e1lcool gel e luvas em hospitais de S\u00e3o Paulo|website=noticias.uol.com.br|access-date=20 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320175759/https://noticias.uol.com.br/saude/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2020/03/19/funcionarios-relatam-falta-de-alcool-gel-e-luvas-em-hospitais-de-sao-paulo.htm|archive-date=20 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto7\">{{cite web|url=https://brasil.elpais.com/sociedade/2020-03-20/profissionais-relatam-precariedade-contra-coronavirus-no-sus-paciente-fica-exposto-e-nos-tambem.html|title=Profissionais relatam precariedade contra coronav\u00edrus no SUS: \"Paciente fica exposto, e n\u00f3s tamb\u00e9m\"|first=Joana|last=Oliveira|date=20 March 2020|website=EL PA\u00cdS|access-date=20 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320182411/https://brasil.elpais.com/sociedade/2020-03-20/profissionais-relatam-precariedade-contra-coronavirus-no-sus-paciente-fica-exposto-e-nos-tambem.html|archive-date=20 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> According to them, packages of masks went from R$4.50 in January to R$140 on 17 March.

The cut-off between working class and middle class here might mean the line where a population has discretionary income, rather than simply  sustenance (for example, on [[fashion]] versus merely [[nutrition]] and shelter).\n\nSome researchers have suggested that working-class status should be defined subjectively as self-identification with the working-class group.{{sfn|Rubin|Denson|Kilpatrick|Matthews|2014}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} This subjective approach allows people, rather than researchers, to define their own social class.\n\n==History and growth==\n[[File:Victorian Bishopgate.jpg|thumb|Working-class life in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Wetherby]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England]]\n\nIn [[feudalism|feudal]] Europe, the working class as such did not exist in large numbers. Instead, most people were part of the labouring class, a group made up of different professions, trades and occupations. A lawyer, craftsman and peasant were all considered to be part of the same [[social unit]], a [[Estates of the realm|third estate]] of people who were neither [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] nor church officials. Similar hierarchies existed outside Europe in other [[pre-industrial societies]]. The social position of these labouring classes was viewed as ordained by [[natural law]] and common religious belief. This social position was contested, particularly by peasants, for example during the [[German Peasants' War]].{{sfn|Abendroth|1973}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the late 18th century, under the influence of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], European society was in a state of change, and this change could not be reconciled with the idea of a changeless god-created social order. Wealthy members of these societies created ideologies which blamed many of the problems of working-class people on their morals and ethics (i.e. excessive consumption of alcohol, perceived laziness and inability to save money). In ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'', [[E.&nbsp;P. Thompson]] argues that the English working class was present at its own creation, and seeks to describe the transformation of pre-modern labouring classes into a modern, politically self-conscious, working class.{{sfn|Abendroth|1973}}{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/prospective-undergrads/virtual-classroom/secondary-source-exercises/sources-people/thompson|title=Thompson: The Making of the English Working Class \u2014 Faculty of History|website=www.hist.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\nStarting around 1917, a number of countries became ruled ostensibly in the interests of the working class (see [[Soviet working class]]). Some historians have noted that a key change in these Soviet-style societies has been a massive a new type of [[proletarianization]], often effected by the administratively achieved forced displacement of peasants and rural workers. Since then, four major industrial states have turned towards semi-market-based governance ([[China]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cuba]]), and one state has turned inwards into an increasing cycle of poverty and brutalization ([[North Korea]]). Other states of this sort have collapsed (such as the [[Soviet Union]]).{{sfn|Kuromiya|1990|p=87}}\n\nSince 1960, large-scale proletarianization and [[enclosure]] of commons has occurred in the [[third world]], generating new working classes. Additionally, countries such as [[India]] have been slowly undergoing social change, expanding the size of the urban working class.{{sfn|Gutkind|1988}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Marxist definition: the proletariat==\n{{main|Proletariat}}\n[[File:battle strike 1934.jpg|thumb|Striking teamsters battling police on the streets of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], June 1934]]\n[[Karl Marx]] defined the working class or [[proletariat]] as individuals who sell their [[labour power]] for [[wage]]s and who do not own the [[means of production]]. He argued that they were responsible for creating the [[wealth]] of a society.  He asserted that the working class physically build bridges, craft furniture, grow food, and nurse children, but do not own land, or [[factories]].{{sfn|Lebowitz|2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nA sub-section of the proletariat, the [[lumpenproletariat]] (''rag-proletariat''), are the extremely poor and unemployed, such as [[day labourer]]s and [[homeless]] people. Marx considered them to be devoid of class consciousness.\n\nIn ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that it was the destiny of the working class to displace the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (the rule of the many, as opposed to the \"[[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\"), abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which \"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\" ''The Communist Manifesto'' was a response to Adam Smith's pro capitalist text ''The Wealth of Nations''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adamsmith.org/the-wealth-of-nations|title=The Wealth of Nations|website=Adam Smith Institute|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> ''(''published in 1776)''.'' Some issues in Marxist arguments about working-class membership have included:\n*The class status of people in a temporary or permanent position of [[unemployment]].\n*The class status of [[domestic labour]], particularly the children (see [[child labour]]), and also traditionally the wives of male workers, as some spouses do not themselves work in paying jobs outside the home.\n*Whether workers can be considered working class if they own [[personal property]] or small amounts of stock ownership.\n*The relationships among peasants, rural smallholders, and the working class.\n*The extent to which non-class group identities and politics (race, gender, etc.) can obviate or substitute for working-class membership in Enlightenment projects, where working-class membership is prohibitively contradictory or obfuscated.\n\nPossible responses to some of these issues are:\n*Unemployed workers are proletariat.\n*Class for dependents is determined by the primary income earner.\n*Personal property is argued to be different from [[private property]]. For example, the proletariat can own automobiles; this is personal property.\n*The self-employed worker may be a member of the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'' (for example, a small store owner who controls little capital), or a ''de facto'' member of the proletariat (for example, a contract worker whose income may be relatively high, but is precarious and tied to the need to sell one's labour on the labour market).\n\nIn general, in Marxist terms [[wage slavery|wage labourers]] and those dependent on the [[welfare state]] are working class, and those who live on [[capital accumulation|accumulated capital]] are not. This broad dichotomy defines the [[class struggle]]. Different groups and individuals may at any given time be on one side or the other. Such contradictions of interests and identity within individuals' lives and within communities can effectively undermine the ability of the working class to act in solidarity to reduce [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], inequality, and the role of [[ownership]] in determining people's life chances, work conditions, and political power.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Apprentice]]\n*[[Blue collar]]\n*[[Embourgeoisement thesis]]\n*[[False consciousness]]\n*[[Globalization]]\n*[[Household income in the United States]]\n*[[Industrial novel]]\n*[[Labour movement]]\n*[[Living wage]]\n*[[Minimum wage]]\n*[[Proletarian literature]]\n*[[Proletarian novel]]\n*[[Reserve army of labour]]\n*[[Seebohm Rowntree]], English sociological researcher\n*[[Social mobility]]\n*[[Trade union]]\n*[[Vocational education]]\n*[[Wage slavery]]\n*[[Working class in the United States]]\n*[[Working-class culture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Abendroth\n|first=Wolfgang\n|author-link=Wolfgang Abendroth\n|year=1973\n|title=A Short History of the European Working Class\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Doob\n|first=Christopher B.\n|year=2013\n|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society\n|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey\n|publisher=Pearson Education\n|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|year=1988\n|editor-last=Gutkind\n|editor-first=Peter C.&nbsp;W.\n|title=Third Worlds Workers: Comparative International Labour Studies\n|series=International Studies in Sociology and Social Anthropology\n|volume=49\n|location=Leiden, Netherlands\n|publisher=E.J.

The cut-off between working class and middle class here might mean the line where a population has discretionary income, rather than simply  sustenance (for example, on [[fashion]] versus merely [[nutrition]] and shelter).\n\nSome researchers have suggested that working-class status should be defined subjectively as self-identification with the working-class group.{{sfn|Rubin|Denson|Kilpatrick|Matthews|2014}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} This subjective approach allows people, rather than researchers, to define their own social class.\n\n==History and growth==\n[[File:Victorian Bishopgate.jpg|thumb|Working-class life in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Wetherby]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England]]\n\nIn [[feudalism|feudal]] Europe, the working class as such did not exist in large numbers. Instead, most people were part of the labouring class, a group made up of different professions, trades and occupations. A lawyer, craftsman and peasant were all considered to be part of the same [[social unit]], a [[Estates of the realm|third estate]] of people who were neither [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] nor church officials. Similar hierarchies existed outside Europe in other [[pre-industrial societies]]. The social position of these labouring classes was viewed as ordained by [[natural law]] and common religious belief. This social position was contested, particularly by peasants, for example during the [[German Peasants' War]].{{sfn|Abendroth|1973}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the late 18th century, under the influence of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], European society was in a state of change, and this change could not be reconciled with the idea of a changeless god-created social order. Wealthy members of these societies created ideologies which blamed many of the problems of working-class people on their morals and ethics (i.e. excessive consumption of alcohol, perceived laziness and inability to save money). In ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'', [[E.&nbsp;P. Thompson]] argues that the English working class was present at its own creation, and seeks to describe the transformation of pre-modern labouring classes into a modern, politically self-conscious, working class.{{sfn|Abendroth|1973}}{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/prospective-undergrads/virtual-classroom/secondary-source-exercises/sources-people/thompson|title=Thompson: The Making of the English Working Class \u2014 Faculty of History|website=www.hist.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\nStarting around 1917, a number of countries became ruled ostensibly in the interests of the working class (see [[Soviet working class]]). Some historians have noted that a key change in these Soviet-style societies has been a massive a new type of [[proletarianization]], often effected by the administratively achieved forced displacement of peasants and rural workers. Since then, four major industrial states have turned towards semi-market-based governance ([[China]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cuba]]), and one state has turned inwards into an increasing cycle of poverty and brutalization ([[North Korea]]). Other states of this sort have collapsed (such as the [[Soviet Union]]).{{sfn|Kuromiya|1990|p=87}}\n\nSince 1960, large-scale proletarianization and [[enclosure]] of commons has occurred in the [[third world]], generating new working classes. Additionally, countries such as [[India]] have been slowly undergoing social change, expanding the size of the urban working class.{{sfn|Gutkind|1988}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Marxist definition: the proletariat==\n{{main|Proletariat}}\n[[File:battle strike 1934.jpg|thumb|Striking teamsters battling police on the streets of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], June 1934]]\n[[Karl Marx]] defined the working class or [[proletariat]] as individuals who sell their [[labour power]] for [[wage]]s and who do not own the [[means of production]]. He argued that they were responsible for creating the [[wealth]] of a society.  He asserted that the working class physically build bridges, craft furniture, grow food, and nurse children, but do not own land, or [[factories]].{{sfn|Lebowitz|2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nA sub-section of the proletariat, the [[lumpenproletariat]] (''rag-proletariat''), are the extremely poor and unemployed, such as [[day labourer]]s and [[homeless]] people. Marx considered them to be devoid of class consciousness.\n\nIn ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that it was the destiny of the working class to displace the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (the rule of the many, as opposed to the \"[[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\"), abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which \"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\" ''The Communist Manifesto'' was a response to Adam Smith's pro capitalist text ''The Wealth of Nations''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adamsmith.org/the-wealth-of-nations|title=The Wealth of Nations|website=Adam Smith Institute|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> ''(''published in 1776)''.'' Some issues in Marxist arguments about working-class membership have included:\n*The class status of people in a temporary or permanent position of [[unemployment]].\n*The class status of [[domestic labour]], particularly the children (see [[child labour]]), and also traditionally the wives of male workers, as some spouses do not themselves work in paying jobs outside the home.\n*Whether workers can be considered working class if they own [[personal property]] or small amounts of stock ownership.\n*The relationships among peasants, rural smallholders, and the working class.\n*The extent to which non-class group identities and politics (race, gender, etc.) can obviate or substitute for working-class membership in Enlightenment projects, where working-class membership is prohibitively contradictory or obfuscated.\n\nPossible responses to some of these issues are:\n*Unemployed workers are proletariat.\n*Class for dependents is determined by the primary income earner.\n*Personal property is argued to be different from [[private property]]. For example, the proletariat can own automobiles; this is personal property.\n*The self-employed worker may be a member of the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'' (for example, a small store owner who controls little capital), or a ''de facto'' member of the proletariat (for example, a contract worker whose income may be relatively high, but is precarious and tied to the need to sell one's labour on the labour market).\n\nIn general, in Marxist terms [[wage slavery|wage labourers]] and those dependent on the [[welfare state]] are working class, and those who live on [[capital accumulation|accumulated capital]] are not. This broad dichotomy defines the [[class struggle]]. Different groups and individuals may at any given time be on one side or the other. Such contradictions of interests and identity within individuals' lives and within communities can effectively undermine the ability of the working class to act in solidarity to reduce [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], inequality, and the role of [[ownership]] in determining people's life chances, work conditions, and political power.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Apprentice]]\n*[[Blue collar]]\n*[[Embourgeoisement thesis]]\n*[[False consciousness]]\n*[[Globalization]]\n*[[Household income in the United States]]\n*[[Industrial novel]]\n*[[Labour movement]]\n*[[Living wage]]\n*[[Minimum wage]]\n*[[Proletarian literature]]\n*[[Proletarian novel]]\n*[[Reserve army of labour]]\n*[[Seebohm Rowntree]], English sociological researcher\n*[[Social mobility]]\n*[[Trade union]]\n*[[Vocational education]]\n*[[Wage slavery]]\n*[[Working class in the United States]]\n*[[Working-class culture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Abendroth\n|first=Wolfgang\n|author-link=Wolfgang Abendroth\n|year=1973\n|title=A Short History of the European Working Class\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Doob\n|first=Christopher B.\n|year=2013\n|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society\n|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey\n|publisher=Pearson Education\n|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|year=1988\n|editor-last=Gutkind\n|editor-first=Peter C.&nbsp;W.\n|title=Third Worlds Workers: Comparative International Labour Studies\n|series=International Studies in Sociology and Social Anthropology\n|volume=49\n|location=Leiden, Netherlands\n|publisher=E.J.

This tax was popularly known as \"''Drets Generals''\" (General Rights) or \"''generalitats''\" (generalities), finding its counterpart in the French \"G\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s\", which were also founded as taxing districts.\n\n=== Medieval origins ===\n[[File:Casa generalitat web.jpg|thumb|''[[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya]]'', Barcelona, seat of the Government and the Presidency of Catalonia]]\n[[File:St George's Cross Crowned Badge.svg|thumb|140px|Old emblem of the ''Generalitat''.]]\nCatalonia's political past as a territorially differentiated community with its own representative and separated institutions, with respect to the sovereign power of the combined [[Catalan counties]] (988-1164), [[Crown of Aragon|the Crown of Aragon]] (1164-1516), the Monarchy of Spain (1516-1808),(1812-1814) French Empire and of the Spanish constitutional state (since 1814), can be divided into four stages, separated by three great ruptures in the legal/public order.\n\nThe ''Pau i Treva de D\u00e9u'' (\"[[Peace and Truce of God]]\") was a social movement born in the eleventh century promoted by the Church, united with the peasantry as the response to the violence perpetrated by feudal nobles. The hometowns, then, delimited a space protected of feudal violence. However, to ensure a coexistence climate, it was necessary to go further, establishing an authority that prohibited the practice of any type of violent act anywhere in the territory. This was the objective of the assemblies of Peace and Truce of God, the first of which, in the Catalan counties, took place in Toluges (Roussillon), in 1027, under the presidency of [[Abbot Oliba]], on behalf of Bishop [[Berenguer d'Elna]], absent from the diocese because he was on a pilgrimage. The origin of the [[Catalan Courts]] can be considered from the Peace of Truce of God.\n\nThe [[Generalitat]] of Catalonia stems from the medieval institution which ruled, in the name of the King of the [[Crown of Aragon]], some aspects of the administration of the [[Principality of Catalonia]]. The Catalan Courts were the main institution of the Principality during its existence as a political entity and approved the [[Catalan constitutions]]. The first constitutions were that of the Courts of 1283.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=ca&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://indigentsadojo.blogspot.com/2016/05/per-que-la-confusio-no-duri-mes.html%3Fm%3D1&xid=17259,1500000,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nThe medieval precedent of the Generalitat, the ''Diputaci\u00f3 del General de Catalunya'' (\"Deputation of the General of Catalonia\", where \"General\" means the political community of the Catalans and not the military rank) was a permanent council of deputies established by the Courts in order to recapt the new \"tax of the General\" in 1359, and gained an important political power during the next centuries, assuming tasks of prosecutor. It was chosen by the legislators in 1931 because they felt it was appropriate for invoking as a legitimising base for contemporary self-government.\n\n===First abolition===\nCatalan institutions which depended on the Generalitat were abolished in what is currently known in Catalonia as [[Northern Catalonia]], one year after the signature of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in the 17th century, which transferred the territory from Spanish to French sovereignty.\n\nThen, by the early 18th century, as the [[Nueva Planta decrees|\"Nueva Planta Decrees]]\" were passed in Spain after the Catalan defeat in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the institution was abolished in the Spanish territory as well.\n\n===First restoration===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Macia 2a tongada scans 003 editora 8 44 1.jpg\n| width1 = 140\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Luis Companys, gobernador civil de Barcelona, en Mundo Gr\u00e1fico 1931-04-29.jpg\n| width2 = 145\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[Francesc Maci\u00e0]], first President of the restored Generalitat of Catalonia (1931-1933).

''Modern Spain: 1975-1980''. Oxford University Press, 1980, p.xvi.</ref> The restored Generalitat was ruled by a statute of autonomy approved by the Spanish Cortes and included a [[Parliament of Catalonia|parliament]], a [[President of the Generalitat de Catalunya|presidency]], a [[Government of Catalonia|government]] and a [[Tribunal de Cassaci\u00f3|court of appeal]]. It was presided by Francesc Maci\u00e0 (1931-1933) and [[Llu\u00eds Companys]] (1933-1940).\n\nAfter the right wing coalition won the Spanish elections in 1934, the leftist leaders of the Generalitat of Catalonia [[Catalan State (1934)|rebelled in October of that year]] against the Spanish authorities, and it was temporarily suspended from 1934 to 1936.\n\n===Second abolition===\n[[Image:Catalonia-bank note-observe.jpg|thumb|250px|Bank note from the Generalitat de Catalunya, 1936]]\nIn 1939, as the [[Spanish Civil War]] finished with the defeat of the Republican side, the ''Generalitat'' of Catalonia as an institution was abolished and remained so during the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist dictatorship]] until 1975. The president of the ''Generalitat'' at the time, [[Llu\u00eds Companys]], was tortured and executed in October 1940 for the crime of 'military rebellion'. Nonetheless, the Generalitat maintained its official existence in exile, led by presidents [[Josep Irla]] (1940-1954) and [[Josep Tarradellas]] (1954-1980).\n\n===Second restoration===\nThe succession of presidents of the ''Generalitat'' was maintained in exile from 1939 to 1977, when Josep Tarradellas returned to [[Catalonia]] and was recognized as the legitimate president by the Spanish government. Tarradellas, when he returned to Catalonia, made his often quoted remark  \"''Ciutadans de Catalunya: ja s\u00f3c aqu\u00ed''\" (\"Citizens of Catalonia: I am back!\"), reassuming the autonomous powers of Catalonia, one of the historic nationalities of present-day Spain.\n\nAfter this, the powers given to the autonomous Catalan government according to the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] were transferred and the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] (''Estatut d'Autonomia'') was passed after being approved both by referendum in Catalonia and by the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish parliament]].\n\n== Recent history ==\n\n=== Governance since 2006 ===\n[[Artur Mas]] held the office of President of the ''Generalitat'' from December 2010<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/12/27/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-19854.pdf|title=Real Decreto 1777/2010|last=|first=|date=|website=Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado|access-date=}}</ref> until his resignation in January 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2016-276|title=BOE.es - Documento BOE-A-2016-276|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2017-09-08}}</ref> leading a minority government dependent on pacts with other parties including the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] following the [[2010 Catalan Parliament election|2010 election]] and the [[2015 Catalan regional election|2015 election]].\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Montilla]], leader of the Socialist Party, had been the president of the ''Generalitat'' until November 2010, he was backed up by a tripartite coalition of left-wing and [[Catalan nationalist]] political parties. His party actually won fewer seats in parliament than the main opposition party, Convergence and Union, in the [[2006 Catalan Parliament election|2006 election]], but as he gathered more support from MPs from other parties in the parliament, he was able to repeat the same coalition government that his predecessor ([[Pasqual Maragall]]) had formed in order to send CiU to the opposition for the first time after 23 years of [[Jordi Pujol]]'s government.\n\nOn 18 June 2006, a [[2006 Catalan constitutional referendum|reformed version was approved]] of the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] and went into effect in August. In its inception, the reform was promoted by both the leftist parties in the government and by the main opposition party (CiU), which were united in pushing for increased devolution of powers from the Spanish government level, enhanced fiscal autonomy and finances, and explicit recognition of Catalonia's national identity; however the details of its final redaction were harshly fought and the subject became a controversial issue in the Catalan politics, with ERC, themselves members of the Tripartite, finally opposing it.\nIn 2010, the [[Spanish Constitutional Court]] reduced the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 2006|Statute]] voted in a referendum, eliminating or reinterpreting more than 200 articles, due to a signature collection promoted by then the Spanish opposition leader, [[Mariano Rajoy]]. Tis is considered one of the main reasons for the independence boom that happened from 2010 with 8% support to 2018 with 52.4% Support.\n\nFormer president Artur Mas (mentioned above) was recently charged by the Spanish government for civil disobedience, after he organised and staged a referendum on independence in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2006/11/06BARCELONA169.html|title=SOCIALISTS, LEFTISTS RECONSTITUTE THREE PARTY COALITION, OUTLINE NEW CATALAN GOVERNMENT|date=2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511192439/http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2006/11/06BARCELONA169.html|archivedate=2013-05-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Current status ===\nThe most recent [[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia]] was [[Carles Puigdemont]], member of the [[Catalan European Democratic Party]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.partitdemocrata.cat/comite-nacional/|title=Comit\u00e8 Nacional|work=Partit Dem\u00f2crata|access-date=2017-09-08|language=ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909004959/http://www.partitdemocrata.cat/comite-nacional/|archive-date=2017-09-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> successor formation to the defunct [[Convergence and Union]] alliance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.partitdemocrata.cat/transparencia/|title=Transpar\u00e8ncia|work=Partit Dem\u00f2crata|access-date=2017-09-08|language=ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909005912/http://www.partitdemocrata.cat/transparencia/|archive-date=2017-09-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was suspended from office on 27 October 2017, by the Spanish government.<ref>[http://boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2017-12332 Real Decreto 942/2017, de 27 de octubre, por el que se dispone, en virtud de las medidas autorizadas con fecha 27 de octubre de 2017 por el Pleno del Senado respecto de la Generalitat de Catalu\u00f1a en aplicaci\u00f3n del art\u00edculo 155 de la Constituci\u00f3n, el cese del M.H.

Under the reign of [[Peter the Great]] (1276-1285), the Catalan Courts gained institutional status, after the king obliged himself to celebrate an annual \"General Court\".\n\nThe Catalan Courts exercised as Council and had legislative functions through its three branches: the ecclesiastical (clergy), the military (nobility) and the popular (villages and towns submitted to direct rule of the king). This union of powers was named \"Lo General de Cathalunya\"\n\nIs in [[1289]] when the first step into becoming an institution happens during the Courts celebrated in the castle of [[Monz\u00f3n|Monts\u00f3]] (situated in the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], ruled by [[Count of Barcelona]], since the year 1151 AD when Count [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer IV]] married Princess [[Petronilla of Aragon]]<ref>[[Petronilla of Aragon]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}).

This tax was popularly known as \"''Drets Generals''\" (General Rights) or \"''generalitats''\" (generalities), finding its counterpart in the French \"G\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s\", which were also founded as taxing districts.\n\n=== Medieval origins ===\n[[File:Casa generalitat web.jpg|thumb|''[[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya]]'', Barcelona, seat of the Government and the Presidency of Catalonia]]\n[[File:St George's Cross Crowned Badge.svg|thumb|140px|Old emblem of the ''Generalitat''.]]\nCatalonia's political past as a territorially differentiated community with its own representative and separated institutions, with respect to the sovereign power of the combined [[Catalan counties]] (988-1164), [[Crown of Aragon|the Crown of Aragon]] (1164-1516), the Monarchy of Spain (1516-1808),(1812-1814) French Empire and of the Spanish constitutional state (since 1814), can be divided into four stages, separated by three great ruptures in the legal/public order.\n\nThe ''Pau i Treva de D\u00e9u'' (\"[[Peace and Truce of God]]\") was a social movement born in the eleventh century promoted by the Church, united with the peasantry as the response to the violence perpetrated by feudal nobles. The hometowns, then, delimited a space protected of feudal violence. However, to ensure a coexistence climate, it was necessary to go further, establishing an authority that prohibited the practice of any type of violent act anywhere in the territory. This was the objective of the assemblies of Peace and Truce of God, the first of which, in the Catalan counties, took place in Toluges (Roussillon), in 1027, under the presidency of [[Abbot Oliba]], on behalf of Bishop [[Berenguer d'Elna]], absent from the diocese because he was on a pilgrimage. The origin of the [[Catalan Courts]] can be considered from the Peace of Truce of God.\n\nThe [[Generalitat]] of Catalonia stems from the medieval institution which ruled, in the name of the King of the [[Crown of Aragon]], some aspects of the administration of the [[Principality of Catalonia]]. The Catalan Courts were the main institution of the Principality during its existence as a political entity and approved the [[Catalan constitutions]]. The first constitutions were that of the Courts of 1283.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=ca&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://indigentsadojo.blogspot.com/2016/05/per-que-la-confusio-no-duri-mes.html%3Fm%3D1&xid=17259,1500000,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nThe medieval precedent of the Generalitat, the ''Diputaci\u00f3 del General de Catalunya'' (\"Deputation of the General of Catalonia\", where \"General\" means the political community of the Catalans and not the military rank) was a permanent council of deputies established by the Courts in order to recapt the new \"tax of the General\" in 1359, and gained an important political power during the next centuries, assuming tasks of prosecutor. It was chosen by the legislators in 1931 because they felt it was appropriate for invoking as a legitimising base for contemporary self-government.\n\n===First abolition===\nCatalan institutions which depended on the Generalitat were abolished in what is currently known in Catalonia as [[Northern Catalonia]], one year after the signature of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in the 17th century, which transferred the territory from Spanish to French sovereignty.\n\nThen, by the early 18th century, as the [[Nueva Planta decrees|\"Nueva Planta Decrees]]\" were passed in Spain after the Catalan defeat in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the institution was abolished in the Spanish territory as well.\n\n===First restoration===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Macia 2a tongada scans 003 editora 8 44 1.jpg\n| width1 = 140\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Luis Companys, gobernador civil de Barcelona, en Mundo Gr\u00e1fico 1931-04-29.jpg\n| width2 = 145\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[Francesc Maci\u00e0]], first President of the restored Generalitat of Catalonia (1931-1933).

It was presided by Francesc Maci\u00e0 (1931-1933) and [[Llu\u00eds Companys]] (1933-1940).\n\nAfter the right wing coalition won the Spanish elections in 1934, the leftist leaders of the Generalitat of Catalonia [[Catalan State (1934)|rebelled in October of that year]] against the Spanish authorities, and it was temporarily suspended from 1934 to 1936.\n\n===Second abolition===\n[[Image:Catalonia-bank note-observe.jpg|thumb|250px|Bank note from the Generalitat de Catalunya, 1936]]\nIn 1939, as the [[Spanish Civil War]] finished with the defeat of the Republican side, the ''Generalitat'' of Catalonia as an institution was abolished and remained so during the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist dictatorship]] until 1975. The president of the ''Generalitat'' at the time, [[Llu\u00eds Companys]], was tortured and executed in October 1940 for the crime of 'military rebellion'. Nonetheless, the Generalitat maintained its official existence in exile, led by presidents [[Josep Irla]] (1940-1954) and [[Josep Tarradellas]] (1954-1980).\n\n===Second restoration===\nThe succession of presidents of the ''Generalitat'' was maintained in exile from 1939 to 1977, when Josep Tarradellas returned to [[Catalonia]] and was recognized as the legitimate president by the Spanish government. Tarradellas, when he returned to Catalonia, made his often quoted remark  \"''Ciutadans de Catalunya: ja s\u00f3c aqu\u00ed''\" (\"Citizens of Catalonia: I am back!\"), reassuming the autonomous powers of Catalonia, one of the historic nationalities of present-day Spain.\n\nAfter this, the powers given to the autonomous Catalan government according to the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] were transferred and the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] (''Estatut d'Autonomia'') was passed after being approved both by referendum in Catalonia and by the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish parliament]].\n\n== Recent history ==\n\n=== Governance since 2006 ===\n[[Artur Mas]] held the office of President of the ''Generalitat'' from December 2010<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/12/27/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-19854.pdf|title=Real Decreto 1777/2010|last=|first=|date=|website=Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado|access-date=}}</ref> until his resignation in January 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2016-276|title=BOE.es - Documento BOE-A-2016-276|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2017-09-08}}</ref> leading a minority government dependent on pacts with other parties including the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] following the [[2010 Catalan Parliament election|2010 election]] and the [[2015 Catalan regional election|2015 election]].\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Montilla]], leader of the Socialist Party, had been the president of the ''Generalitat'' until November 2010, he was backed up by a tripartite coalition of left-wing and [[Catalan nationalist]] political parties. His party actually won fewer seats in parliament than the main opposition party, Convergence and Union, in the [[2006 Catalan Parliament election|2006 election]], but as he gathered more support from MPs from other parties in the parliament, he was able to repeat the same coalition government that his predecessor ([[Pasqual Maragall]]) had formed in order to send CiU to the opposition for the first time after 23 years of [[Jordi Pujol]]'s government.\n\nOn 18 June 2006, a [[2006 Catalan constitutional referendum|reformed version was approved]] of the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] and went into effect in August. In its inception, the reform was promoted by both the leftist parties in the government and by the main opposition party (CiU), which were united in pushing for increased devolution of powers from the Spanish government level, enhanced fiscal autonomy and finances, and explicit recognition of Catalonia's national identity; however the details of its final redaction were harshly fought and the subject became a controversial issue in the Catalan politics, with ERC, themselves members of the Tripartite, finally opposing it.\nIn 2010, the [[Spanish Constitutional Court]] reduced the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 2006|Statute]] voted in a referendum, eliminating or reinterpreting more than 200 articles, due to a signature collection promoted by then the Spanish opposition leader, [[Mariano Rajoy]].

The last Catalan election was held on 21 December 2017, and its current president is [[Roger Torrent]], incumbent since January 2018.\n\n=== Presidency ===\nThe [[president of the Generalitat of Catalonia]] (in Catalan: ''president de la Generalitat de Catalunya'') is the highest representative of Catalonia, and is also responsible of leading the government's action. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the [[List of Presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya|presidents of Catalonia]] have been [[Josep Tarradellas]] (1977\u20131980, president in exile since 1954), [[Jordi Pujol]] (1980\u20132003), [[Pasqual Maragall]] (2003\u20132006), [[Jos\u00e9 Montilla]] (2006\u20132010), [[Artur Mas]] (2010\u20132016), [[Carles Puigdemont]] (2016&ndash;2017) and, after the imposition of direct rule from Madrid, [[Quim Torra]] (2018\u2013).\n\n=== Executive ===\n[[File:Govern de Catalunya foto oficial 2018.jpg|thumb|Executive Council of Catalonia (2018\u2013).

It comprises the president of the Generalitat, the [[List of First Ministers of Catalonia|First Minister]] (or the [[List of Vice Presidents of Catalonia|Vice President]]) and the Ministers (''consellers''). Its seat is the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya|Palau de la Generalitat]], in Barcelona.\n\n==International presence==\nAs an autonomous community of Spain, Catalonia is not recognized as a sovereign state by any sovereign state. However, as Catalonia has progressively gained a greater degree of self-government in recent years, the Catalan Government has established nearly bilateral relationships with foreign bodies. For the most part, these relationships are with the governments of other powerful subnational entities such as [[Quebec]]<ref>http://www.mdeie.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=4201{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> or [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soir.senate.ca.gov/scr71|title=Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 71  - Senate Office of International Relations|publisher=}}</ref> In addition, like most Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia has permanent delegations before international organizations, such as the [[European Union]].<ref>http://www.copca.cat/infoglueDeliverLive/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=247&languageId=1&contentId=-1{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Catalonia has embarked upon an expansion process of its international representation by opening a number of delegations worldwide.
