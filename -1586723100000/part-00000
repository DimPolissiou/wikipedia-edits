Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the project's groundbreaking took place in 2009. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated with the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line was re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing connection between OMSI and the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

From September\u2013November that year, crews closed the OMSI streetcar platform to install the streetcar-track connection with the Portland\u2013Milwaukie light rail. This project had a total cost of $6.7{{nbsp}}million (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|6700000|2013}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars), including [[automatic train stop]] upgrades.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/Transportation/article/458059?archive=2013-08 |title=Traffic Advisory: Streetcar track work to close lanes on SE MLK Blvd Aug. 5-9; buses to replace streetcar service during construction |publisher=Portland Bureau of Transportation |date=August 9, 2013 |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://efiles.portlandoregon.gov/Record/5449862/File/Document |title=Close the Loop Streetcar |publisher=Portland Bureau of Transportation |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn August 30, 2015, CL Line service was extended {{convert|0.9|mi|km}} south on the west side from Southwest 10th and Market streets along existing NS Line tracks south to Southwest Moody and Meade streets in the South Waterfront.<ref name=\"streetcar-loop-fta\"/>{{rp|19}} A new temporary schedule eliminated the name CL Line in favor of two separate routes: A Loop and B Loop.

Service''' is a [[streetcar]] [[circle route|circle line]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States, that is part of the [[Portland Streetcar]] system. Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the project's groundbreaking took place in 2009. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated with the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line was re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing connection between OMSI and the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

This project had a total cost of $6.7{{nbsp}}million (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|6700000|2013}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars), including [[automatic train stop]] upgrades.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/Transportation/article/458059?archive=2013-08 |title=Traffic Advisory: Streetcar track work to close lanes on SE MLK Blvd Aug. 5-9; buses to replace streetcar service during construction |publisher=Portland Bureau of Transportation |date=August 9, 2013 |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://efiles.portlandoregon.gov/Record/5449862/File/Document |title=Close the Loop Streetcar |publisher=Portland Bureau of Transportation |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn August 30, 2015, CL Line service was extended {{convert|0.9|mi|km}} south on the west side from Southwest 10th and Market streets along existing NS Line tracks south to Southwest Moody and Meade streets in the South Waterfront.<ref name=\"streetcar-loop-fta\"/>{{rp|19}} A new temporary schedule eliminated the name CL Line in favor of two separate routes: A Loop and B Loop.

They achieved their most significant success between 1987 and 1993, when they released four albums that charted in the top 50 in the US: ''[[In My Tribe]]'' (1987), ''[[Blind Man's Zoo]]'' (1989), ''[[Our Time in Eden]]'' (1992) and the live album ''[[MTV Unplugged (10,000 Maniacs album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' (1993). After the recording but before the release of ''MTV Unplugged'', original lead singer and main songwriter [[Natalie Merchant]] left the band to pursue a solo career. She was replaced by [[Mary Ramsey]], who was the lead singer from 1993 to 2001 and then from 2007 to the present.\n\n==History==\n\n===1981\u20131993===\n[[File:Natalie merchant1.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|left|Natalie Merchant as lead singer in 1984]]\nThe band was formed as Still Life in 1981 in [[Jamestown, New York]], by [[Dennis Drew]] (keyboards), [[Steven Gustafson]] (bass), Chet Cardinale (drums), [[Rob Buck|Robert Buck]] (guitar and Newhouse's ex-husband) and Teri Newhouse (vocalist and Buck's ex-wife). Gustafson invited [[Natalie Merchant]], who was 17 at the time, to do some vocals. [[John Lombardo]], who was in a band called The Mills (along with brother guitarist/vocalists Mark Liuzzo and Paul Liuzzo and drummer Mike Young) and used to play occasionally with Still Life, was invited to join permanently on guitar and vocals. Newhouse and Cardinale left the band in July, and Merchant became the main singer. Various drummers came and left. The band changed its name to Burn Victims and then to 10,000 Maniacs after the low-budget horror movie ''[[Two Thousand Maniacs!]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Deusner|first=Stephen|title=Natalie Merchant: \"When I talk to friends who have creative lives and children, we commiserate about all the time we wasted in our youth\"|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/05/12/natalie_merchant_when_i_talk_to_friends_who_have_creative_lives_and_children_we_commiserate_about_all_the_time_we_wasted_in_our_youth/|date=May 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThey performed as 10,000 Maniacs for the first time on Labor Day, September 7, 1981, with a line-up of Merchant, Lombardo, Buck, Drew, Gustafson, and Tim Edborg on drums. Edborg left and Bob \"Bob O Matic\" Wachter was on drums for most of the 1981 gigs. Tired of playing cover songs\u2014though their first notable American hit was a cover of the [[Cat Stevens]] hit \"[[Peace Train]]\"\u2014the band started to write their own music, usually with Merchant handling the lyrics and Lombardo the music. In March 1982, with Jim Foti on drums, the band recorded an [[Extended play|EP album]] called ''[[Human Conflict Number Five]]''. More gigs followed in 1982. During this time they lived in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] for a short while at the encouragement of friends who said that many gigs were available there. Discouraged by the lack of actual gigs, and by having to sell plasma and rake leaves to buy food, the band moved back to Jamestown in November 1982 to regroup.\n\n[[File:JohnLombardo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Lombardo]]\nAt the beginning of 1983, [[Jerry Augustyniak]] joined the band as their permanent drummer. The Maniacs met Augustyniak when they played in [[Buffalo, New York]], where he was in a punk band called The Stains. Between March and July, the band recorded songs for a second record, ''[[Secrets of the I Ching]]'', their debut full-length album, which was pressed by Mark Records for the band's own label Christian Burial Music. The record was well received by critics and caught the attention of respected [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]] in London. One song, \"[[My Mother the War]]\", turned out to be a minor hit in the United Kingdom, and entered the independent singles chart. The band toured extensively during 1983 and 1984, and played gigs in the UK.\n\nPeter Leak, an Englishman living in New York City, became interested in the band, made contact and was made their manager. With the help of Leak and Elektra Records A & R man Howard Thompson, 10,000 Maniacs signed to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] in November 1984. In the spring of 1985, they recorded their second full-length album, ''[[The Wishing Chair (album)|The Wishing Chair]]'', in London at Livingston Studios, with [[Joe Boyd]] as producer. Though the album was not a blockbuster hit, its status as the band's major label debut did win it some notice, and it received significant critical acclaim.\n\nCo-founder Lombardo left 10,000 Maniacs during a rehearsal on July 14, 1986. The remaining five members started recording a new album in Los Angeles with [[Peter Asher]] as the producer. ''[[In My Tribe]]'', a more pop-rock oriented record, was released on July 7, 1987. The album stayed on the charts for 77 weeks, peaking at No.&nbsp;37, and established a large U.S. audience for the group. It was also well received in the UK. The album originally contained \"Peace Train\". It was removed from subsequent pressings after Cat Stevens (now Yusuf Islam) made comments implying he agreed with a death Fatwa against author [[Salman Rushdie]].\n\n10,000 Maniacs' next album, 1989's ''[[Blind Man's Zoo]],'' hit No.&nbsp;13 and went gold, further increasing the group's following. In May 1989, the British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported that 10,000 Maniacs had won the songwriter category prize at the [[New York Music Awards]].<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= 456\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref> In 1990, with the help of Lombardo, they remastered their first two records, ''[[Human Conflict Number Five]]'' and ''[[Secrets of the I Ching]],'' and released them as a compilation called ''Hope Chest: The Fredonia Recordings 1982\u20131983''. Lombardo and [[Mary Ramsey]], who had formed a folk act called [[John & Mary]], opened gigs for the Maniacs on the Hope Chest Tour in 1990.\n\nIn 1991, during the recordings of a new album, Merchant revealed to the other members that she would be leaving 10,000 Maniacs for a solo career in two years' time. The new album, ''[[Our Time in Eden]]'', was released on September 29, 1992.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/our-time-in-eden-mw0000085508 10,000 Maniacs, ''Our Time in Eden'']. allmusic.com.

The revamped band began performing new material almost immediately, initially calling themselves \"John & Mary, Rob, Steve, Dennis, & Jerry,\" before they were able to legally regain control of the 10,000 Maniacs name. 10,000 Maniacs released two albums with Ramsey on vocals. In 1997, they released ''[[Love Among the Ruins (album)|Love Among the Ruins]]'' on [[Geffen Records]], from which their cover of the [[Roxy Music]] song \"[[More than This (Roxy Music song)|More than This]]\" became a moderate hit, and followed up in 1999, with ''[[The Earth Pressed Flat]]'' on [[Bar/None]].\n\nIn December 1998, Buck took some time off from the band, moving to [[Texas]] to focus on a new project called [[League of Blind Women]]. The band recruited Buffalo-based [[Michael Lee Jackson]] of the band Animal Planet to step into the lead guitar role. Buck returned to the band in the summer of 1999. On November 3, 2000, 10,000 Maniacs played with the [[Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra]], in [[Buffalo, New York]]. It was the last concert they performed with Buck. On December 19, 2000, Buck died of [[liver failure]] at the age of 42.<ref>{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435370/10000-maniacs-guitarist-rob-buck-dies-liver-failure.jhtml |title=10,000 Maniacs Guitarist Rob Buck Dies Of Liver Failure \u2013 Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=2000-12-20 |accessdate=2013-02-27}}</ref> He was buried in the Mission Covenant Church Cemetery in [[Sugar Grove, Pennsylvania]].\n\nFollowing Buck's death, 10,000 Maniacs took a break. Gustafson and Drew, with Jeff Erickson, started a band called [[The Mighty Wallop!]]. Augustyniak joined a band called Only Humen. On December 5, 2001, a 10,000 Maniacs line-up comprising Gustafson, Drew, Augustyniak, Lombardo and Ramsey played on a benefit concert in Toronto, with Buck's former guitar technician, Erickson, on lead guitar.\n\n===2002\u20132007===\n[[File:Dennis Drew 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Dennis Drew]]\nIn 2002, Gustafson, Drew, and Augustyniak decided that they wished to continue 10,000 Maniacs with a new lead singer. Lombardo showed up at the first band practice, found out that the band had hired Erickson to play lead guitar and [[Oskar Saville]] of the Chicago-based band [[Rubygrass]] to sing, and quit the band. This lineup toured sporadically between 2002 and 2006, playing at various festivals.\n\nOn January 27, 2004, Elektra/Asylum/Rhino Records released ''[[Campfire Songs: The Popular, Obscure and Unknown Recordings]]'', a two-CD set compilation, with 31 digitally remastered songs, four of them demos and one unreleased. The second disc contained B-sides and outtakes throughout the band's career up to that point, including many covers. [[Jackson Browne]]'s \"[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]\" and [[Tom Waits]]' \"I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love with You\" were among those included.\n\nIn 2006, [[John & Mary]] formed a folk-rock band called the Valkyries. John & Mary & the Valkyries are composed of several longtime Buffalo music scene stalwarts. Ramsey rejoined the current edition of the band for several dates in 2006, playing viola and singing backing vocals. Saville left in 2007, and Ramsey regained the lead vocalist spot.\n\n===2008\u2013present===\n[[File:10kManiacs.jpg|thumb|10,000 Maniacs in 2019 in Rochester, Minnesota]]\nThe band\u2014consisting of Augustyniak, Drew, Erickson, Gustafson and Ramsey\u2014remained active, playing shows throughout the United States. In June 2011, the band released the EP ''[[Triangles (album)|Triangles]]'' on its own label, Ruby Wristwatch Records. The band celebrated its 30th anniversary in October 2011 with two sold out concerts at the Scharmann Theater on the campus of [[Jamestown Community College]]. The band spent most of 2012 recording a new full-length album at their studio in Jamestown, New York. In February 2013, they released the album, entitled ''[[Music from the Motion Picture]]''.\n\nFormer drummer Robert Wachter died on March 26, 2013, at the age of 49 due to a long illness.<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/oleantimesherald/obituary.aspx?pid=163897611 Robert J.

They have released nine studio albums, six EPs and five live albums. They achieved their most significant success between 1987 and 1993, when they released four albums that charted in the top 50 in the US: ''[[In My Tribe]]'' (1987), ''[[Blind Man's Zoo]]'' (1989), ''[[Our Time in Eden]]'' (1992) and the live album ''[[MTV Unplugged (10,000 Maniacs album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' (1993). After the recording but before the release of ''MTV Unplugged'', original lead singer and main songwriter [[Natalie Merchant]] left the band to pursue a solo career. She was replaced by [[Mary Ramsey]], who was the lead singer from 1993 to 2001 and then from 2007 to the present.\n\n==History==\n\n===1981\u20131993===\n[[File:Natalie merchant1.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|left|Natalie Merchant as lead singer in 1984]]\nThe band was formed as Still Life in 1981 in [[Jamestown, New York]], by [[Dennis Drew]] (keyboards), [[Steven Gustafson]] (bass), Chet Cardinale (drums), [[Rob Buck|Robert Buck]] (guitar and Newhouse's ex-husband) and Teri Newhouse (vocalist and Buck's ex-wife). Gustafson invited [[Natalie Merchant]], who was 17 at the time, to do some vocals. [[John Lombardo]], who was in a band called The Mills (along with brother guitarist/vocalists Mark Liuzzo and Paul Liuzzo and drummer Mike Young) and used to play occasionally with Still Life, was invited to join permanently on guitar and vocals. Newhouse and Cardinale left the band in July, and Merchant became the main singer. Various drummers came and left. The band changed its name to Burn Victims and then to 10,000 Maniacs after the low-budget horror movie ''[[Two Thousand Maniacs!]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Deusner|first=Stephen|title=Natalie Merchant: \"When I talk to friends who have creative lives and children, we commiserate about all the time we wasted in our youth\"|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/05/12/natalie_merchant_when_i_talk_to_friends_who_have_creative_lives_and_children_we_commiserate_about_all_the_time_we_wasted_in_our_youth/|date=May 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThey performed as 10,000 Maniacs for the first time on Labor Day, September 7, 1981, with a line-up of Merchant, Lombardo, Buck, Drew, Gustafson, and Tim Edborg on drums. Edborg left and Bob \"Bob O Matic\" Wachter was on drums for most of the 1981 gigs. Tired of playing cover songs\u2014though their first notable American hit was a cover of the [[Cat Stevens]] hit \"[[Peace Train]]\"\u2014the band started to write their own music, usually with Merchant handling the lyrics and Lombardo the music. In March 1982, with Jim Foti on drums, the band recorded an [[Extended play|EP album]] called ''[[Human Conflict Number Five]]''. More gigs followed in 1982. During this time they lived in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] for a short while at the encouragement of friends who said that many gigs were available there. Discouraged by the lack of actual gigs, and by having to sell plasma and rake leaves to buy food, the band moved back to Jamestown in November 1982 to regroup.\n\n[[File:JohnLombardo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Lombardo]]\nAt the beginning of 1983, [[Jerry Augustyniak]] joined the band as their permanent drummer. The Maniacs met Augustyniak when they played in [[Buffalo, New York]], where he was in a punk band called The Stains. Between March and July, the band recorded songs for a second record, ''[[Secrets of the I Ching]]'', their debut full-length album, which was pressed by Mark Records for the band's own label Christian Burial Music. The record was well received by critics and caught the attention of respected [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]] in London. One song, \"[[My Mother the War]]\", turned out to be a minor hit in the United Kingdom, and entered the independent singles chart. The band toured extensively during 1983 and 1984, and played gigs in the UK.\n\nPeter Leak, an Englishman living in New York City, became interested in the band, made contact and was made their manager. With the help of Leak and Elektra Records A & R man Howard Thompson, 10,000 Maniacs signed to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] in November 1984. In the spring of 1985, they recorded their second full-length album, ''[[The Wishing Chair (album)|The Wishing Chair]]'', in London at Livingston Studios, with [[Joe Boyd]] as producer. Though the album was not a blockbuster hit, its status as the band's major label debut did win it some notice, and it received significant critical acclaim.\n\nCo-founder Lombardo left 10,000 Maniacs during a rehearsal on July 14, 1986. The remaining five members started recording a new album in Los Angeles with [[Peter Asher]] as the producer. ''[[In My Tribe]]'', a more pop-rock oriented record, was released on July 7, 1987. The album stayed on the charts for 77 weeks, peaking at No.&nbsp;37, and established a large U.S. audience for the group. It was also well received in the UK. The album originally contained \"Peace Train\". It was removed from subsequent pressings after Cat Stevens (now Yusuf Islam) made comments implying he agreed with a death Fatwa against author [[Salman Rushdie]].\n\n10,000 Maniacs' next album, 1989's ''[[Blind Man's Zoo]],'' hit No.&nbsp;13 and went gold, further increasing the group's following. In May 1989, the British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported that 10,000 Maniacs had won the songwriter category prize at the [[New York Music Awards]].<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= 456\n| id= CN 5585}}</ref> In 1990, with the help of Lombardo, they remastered their first two records, ''[[Human Conflict Number Five]]'' and ''[[Secrets of the I Ching]],'' and released them as a compilation called ''Hope Chest: The Fredonia Recordings 1982\u20131983''. Lombardo and [[Mary Ramsey]], who had formed a folk act called [[John & Mary]], opened gigs for the Maniacs on the Hope Chest Tour in 1990.\n\nIn 1991, during the recordings of a new album, Merchant revealed to the other members that she would be leaving 10,000 Maniacs for a solo career in two years' time. The new album, ''[[Our Time in Eden]]'', was released on September 29, 1992.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/our-time-in-eden-mw0000085508 10,000 Maniacs, ''Our Time in Eden'']. allmusic.com.

The revamped band began performing new material almost immediately, initially calling themselves \"John & Mary, Rob, Steve, Dennis, & Jerry,\" before they were able to legally regain control of the 10,000 Maniacs name. 10,000 Maniacs released two albums with Ramsey on vocals. In 1997, they released ''[[Love Among the Ruins (album)|Love Among the Ruins]]'' on [[Geffen Records]], from which their cover of the [[Roxy Music]] song \"[[More than This (Roxy Music song)|More than This]]\" became a moderate hit, and followed up in 1999, with ''[[The Earth Pressed Flat]]'' on [[Bar/None]].\n\nIn December 1998, Buck took some time off from the band, moving to [[Texas]] to focus on a new project called [[League of Blind Women]]. The band recruited Buffalo-based [[Michael Lee Jackson]] of the band Animal Planet to step into the lead guitar role. Buck returned to the band in the summer of 1999. On November 3, 2000, 10,000 Maniacs played with the [[Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra]], in [[Buffalo, New York]]. It was the last concert they performed with Buck. On December 19, 2000, Buck died of [[liver failure]] at the age of 42.<ref>{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435370/10000-maniacs-guitarist-rob-buck-dies-liver-failure.jhtml |title=10,000 Maniacs Guitarist Rob Buck Dies Of Liver Failure \u2013 Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=2000-12-20 |accessdate=2013-02-27}}</ref> He was buried in the Mission Covenant Church Cemetery in [[Sugar Grove, Pennsylvania]].\n\nFollowing Buck's death, 10,000 Maniacs took a break. Gustafson and Drew, with Jeff Erickson, started a band called [[The Mighty Wallop!]]. Augustyniak joined a band called Only Humen. On December 5, 2001, a 10,000 Maniacs line-up comprising Gustafson, Drew, Augustyniak, Lombardo and Ramsey played on a benefit concert in Toronto, with Buck's former guitar technician, Erickson, on lead guitar.\n\n===2002\u20132007===\n[[File:Dennis Drew 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Dennis Drew]]\nIn 2002, Gustafson, Drew, and Augustyniak decided that they wished to continue 10,000 Maniacs with a new lead singer. Lombardo showed up at the first band practice, found out that the band had hired Erickson to play lead guitar and [[Oskar Saville]] of the Chicago-based band [[Rubygrass]] to sing, and quit the band. This lineup toured sporadically between 2002 and 2006, playing at various festivals.\n\nOn January 27, 2004, Elektra/Asylum/Rhino Records released ''[[Campfire Songs: The Popular, Obscure and Unknown Recordings]]'', a two-CD set compilation, with 31 digitally remastered songs, four of them demos and one unreleased. The second disc contained B-sides and outtakes throughout the band's career up to that point, including many covers. [[Jackson Browne]]'s \"[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]\" and [[Tom Waits]]' \"I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love with You\" were among those included.\n\nIn 2006, [[John & Mary]] formed a folk-rock band called the Valkyries. John & Mary & the Valkyries are composed of several longtime Buffalo music scene stalwarts. Ramsey rejoined the current edition of the band for several dates in 2006, playing viola and singing backing vocals. Saville left in 2007, and Ramsey regained the lead vocalist spot.\n\n===2008\u2013present===\n[[File:10kManiacs.jpg|thumb|10,000 Maniacs in 2019 in Rochester, Minnesota]]\nThe band\u2014consisting of Augustyniak, Drew, Erickson, Gustafson and Ramsey\u2014remained active, playing shows throughout the United States. In June 2011, the band released the EP ''[[Triangles (album)|Triangles]]'' on its own label, Ruby Wristwatch Records. The band celebrated its 30th anniversary in October 2011 with two sold out concerts at the Scharmann Theater on the campus of [[Jamestown Community College]]. The band spent most of 2012 recording a new full-length album at their studio in Jamestown, New York. In February 2013, they released the album, entitled ''[[Music from the Motion Picture]]''.\n\nFormer drummer Robert Wachter died on March 26, 2013, at the age of 49 due to a long illness.<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/oleantimesherald/obituary.aspx?pid=163897611 Robert J.
