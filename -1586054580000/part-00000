Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao sent [[Raghunathrao]]. He defeated the Rohillas and Afghan garrisons in Punjab and succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.<ref name=K.RoyIHB>{{cite book | last=Roy |first=Kaushik |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil |publisher=Permanent Black, India |pages=80\u20131 |isbn=978-81-7824-109-8}}</ref> Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Ahmad was forced to return to India and face the formidable attacks of the Maratha Confederacy.\n\nAhmad Shah declared a [[jihad]] (or [[Islam]]ic holy war) against the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], and warriors from various Afghan tribes joined his army, including the [[Baloch people]] under the command of [[Khan of Kalat]] Mir [[Nasir I of Kalat]]. Suba Khan Tanoli  (Zabardast Khan) was selected as army chief of all military forces. Early skirmishes were followed by victory for the Afghans against the much larger Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad Shah and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. Ahmad Shah Durrani was famous for winning wars much larger than his army. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of northern India. The Third Battle of Panipat (14 January 1761), fought between largely Muslim and largely Hindu armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by many challenges. As far as losses are concerned, Afghans too suffered heavily in the Third Battle of Panipat. This weakened his grasp over Punjab which fell to the rising [[Sikh]] [[misls]]. There were rebellions in the north in the region of [[Bukhara]]. The Durranis decisively defeated the Marathas in the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] on 14 January 1761.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpXijlqeRpIC&pg=PA84 |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil |author=Kaushik Roy |publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=2004 |pages=84\u201394}}</ref> The defeat at Panipat resulted in heavy losses for the Marathas, and was a huge setback for Peshwa Balaji Rao.

Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others in this half century. By 1818, the [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] rulers who succeeded Ahmad Shah controlled little more than Kabul and the surrounding territory within a 160-kilometer radius. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated other tribes and lineages among the Durrani Pashtuns.\n\n===Timur Shah (1772\u20131793)===\n{{main|Timur Shah Durrani}}\n\nAhmad Shah was succeeded by his son, Timur Shah, who had been deputed to administer his father's conquests in Northern India, but had been driven out by the Marathas. Upon Ahmad Shah's death, the Durrani chieftains only reluctantly accepted Timur's accession. Most of his reign was spent fighting a civil war and resisting rebellion; Timur was even forced to move his capital from Kandahar to Kabul due to the insurgency. Timur Shah proved an ineffectual ruler, during whose reign the Durrani empire began to crumble. He is notable for having had 24 sons, several of whom became rulers of the Durrani territories. Timur died in 1793 and was then succeeded by his fifth son Zaman Shah\n\n===Zaman Shah (1793\u20131801)===\n{{Main|Zaman Shah Durrani}}\n{{Pashtuns}}\n[[File:The main street in the bazaar at Caubul.jpg|thumb|The main street in the bazaar at [[Kabul]]]]\n\nAfter the death of Timur Shah, three of his sons, the governors of Kandahar, Herat and Kabul, contended for the succession. [[Zaman Shah]], governor of Kabul, held the field by virtue of being in control of the capital, and became shah at the age of twenty-three. Many of his half-brothers were imprisoned on their arrival in the capital for the purpose, ironically, of electing a new shah. The quarrels among Timur's descendants that threw Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the interventions of outside forces.\n\nThe efforts of the Sadozai heirs of Timur to impose a true monarchy on the truculent Pashtun tribes, and their efforts to rule absolutely and without the advice of the other major Pashtun tribal leaders, were ultimately unsuccessful. The [[Sikhs]] started to rise under the command of Sikh chief, [[Ranjit Singh]], who succeeded in wresting power from Zaman's forces. Later when Zaman was blinded by his brother, Ranjit Singh who gave him asylum in Punjab.\n\nZaman's downfall was triggered by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it had been through the support of the Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the [[Nurzai]] and the [[Alizai tribe|Alizai]] Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the [[Qizilbash]] clan. Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's younger brother, [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.\n\n===Mahmud Shah (first reign, 1801\u20131803)===\n{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}\nZeman Shah's overthrow in 1801 was not the end of civil strife in Afghanistan, but the beginning of even greater violence. Mahmud Shah's first reign lasted for only two years before he was replaced by [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shuja Shah]].\n\n===Shuja Shah (1803\u20131809 and 1839\u20131842)===\n{{Main|Shuja Shah Durrani}}\nYet another of Timur Shah's sons, Shuja Shah (or Shah Shuja), ruled for only six years. On June 7, 1809, Shuja Shah signed a treaty with the [[British East India Company|British]], which included a clause stating that he would oppose the passage of foreign troops through his territories. This agreement, the first Afghan pact with a [[Europe]]an power, stipulated joint action in case of [[France|Franco]]-Persian aggression against Afghan or British dominions. Only a few weeks after signing the agreement, Shuja was deposed by his predecessor, Mahmud. Much later, he was reinstated by the British, ruling during 1839\u20131842. Two of his sons also ruled for a brief period in 1842.\n\n===Mahmud Shah (second reign, 1809\u20131818)===\n{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}\n\nMahmud's second reign lasted nine years. Mahmud alienated the Barakzai, especially Fateh Khan, the son of Painda Khan, who was eventually seized and blinded. Revenge would later be sought and obtained by Fateh Khan's youngest brother, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].\n\n===Sultan Ali Shah (1818\u20131819)===\n{{Main|Ali Shah Durrani}}\nAli Shah was another son of [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]]. He seized power for a brief period in 1818\u20131819.\n\n===Ayub Shah (1819\u20131823)===\n{{Main|Ayub Shah Durrani}}\nAyub Shah was another son of Timur Shah, who deposed Sultan Ali Shah. He was himself later deposed, and presumably killed in 1823. The loss of Kashmir during his reign opened a new chapter in South Asian history.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Indian Campaign of Ahmad Shah Durrani]]\n* [[List of Pashtun empires and dynasties]]\n* [[Deoni]]\n\n==Notes==\n<!--<nowiki>\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags.\n</nowiki>-->\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n*Malleson, George Bruce (1879) ''History of Afghanistan, from the Earliest Period to the Outbreak of the War of 1878'' W.H.

In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the [[Tajik people|Tajik]], [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], and other tribes of northern Afghanistan.

''Panipat''.</ref> Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled virtually the whole of India from their capital at [[Pune]] and the Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi (the Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao sent [[Raghunathrao]]. He defeated the Rohillas and Afghan garrisons in Punjab and succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.<ref name=K.RoyIHB>{{cite book | last=Roy |first=Kaushik |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil |publisher=Permanent Black, India |pages=80\u20131 |isbn=978-81-7824-109-8}}</ref> Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Ahmad was forced to return to India and face the formidable attacks of the Maratha Confederacy.\n\nAhmad Shah declared a [[jihad]] (or [[Islam]]ic holy war) against the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], and warriors from various Afghan tribes joined his army, including the [[Baloch people]] under the command of [[Khan of Kalat]] Mir [[Nasir I of Kalat]]. Suba Khan Tanoli  (Zabardast Khan) was selected as army chief of all military forces. Early skirmishes were followed by victory for the Afghans against the much larger Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad Shah and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. Ahmad Shah Durrani was famous for winning wars much larger than his army. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of northern India. The Third Battle of Panipat (14 January 1761), fought between largely Muslim and largely Hindu armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by many challenges.

From this time and on, the domination and control of the Empire began to loosen, and by the time of Durrani's death he had completely lost Punjab to the Sikhs, as well as earlier losses of northern territories to the Uzbeks, necessitating a compromise with them.<ref>Meredith L.

Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others in this half century. By 1818, the [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] rulers who succeeded Ahmad Shah controlled little more than Kabul and the surrounding territory within a 160-kilometer radius. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated other tribes and lineages among the Durrani Pashtuns.\n\n===Timur Shah (1772\u20131793)===\n{{main|Timur Shah Durrani}}\n\nAhmad Shah was succeeded by his son, Timur Shah, who had been deputed to administer his father's conquests in Northern India, but had been driven out by the Marathas. Upon Ahmad Shah's death, the Durrani chieftains only reluctantly accepted Timur's accession. Most of his reign was spent fighting a civil war and resisting rebellion; Timur was even forced to move his capital from Kandahar to Kabul due to the insurgency. Timur Shah proved an ineffectual ruler, during whose reign the Durrani empire began to crumble. He is notable for having had 24 sons, several of whom became rulers of the Durrani territories. Timur died in 1793 and was then succeeded by his fifth son Zaman Shah\n\n===Zaman Shah (1793\u20131801)===\n{{Main|Zaman Shah Durrani}}\n{{Pashtuns}}\n[[File:The main street in the bazaar at Caubul.jpg|thumb|The main street in the bazaar at [[Kabul]]]]\n\nAfter the death of Timur Shah, three of his sons, the governors of Kandahar, Herat and Kabul, contended for the succession. [[Zaman Shah]], governor of Kabul, held the field by virtue of being in control of the capital, and became shah at the age of twenty-three. Many of his half-brothers were imprisoned on their arrival in the capital for the purpose, ironically, of electing a new shah. The quarrels among Timur's descendants that threw Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the interventions of outside forces.\n\nThe efforts of the Sadozai heirs of Timur to impose a true monarchy on the truculent Pashtun tribes, and their efforts to rule absolutely and without the advice of the other major Pashtun tribal leaders, were ultimately unsuccessful. The [[Sikhs]] started to rise under the command of Sikh chief, [[Ranjit Singh]], who succeeded in wresting power from Zaman's forces. Later when Zaman was blinded by his brother, Ranjit Singh who gave him asylum in Punjab.\n\nZaman's downfall was triggered by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it had been through the support of the Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the [[Nurzai]] and the [[Alizai tribe|Alizai]] Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the [[Qizilbash]] clan. Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's younger brother, [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.\n\n===Mahmud Shah (first reign, 1801\u20131803)===\n{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}\nZeman Shah's overthrow in 1801 was not the end of civil strife in Afghanistan, but the beginning of even greater violence. Mahmud Shah's first reign lasted for only two years before he was replaced by [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shuja Shah]].\n\n===Shuja Shah (1803\u20131809 and 1839\u20131842)===\n{{Main|Shuja Shah Durrani}}\nYet another of Timur Shah's sons, Shuja Shah (or Shah Shuja), ruled for only six years. On June 7, 1809, Shuja Shah signed a treaty with the [[British East India Company|British]], which included a clause stating that he would oppose the passage of foreign troops through his territories. This agreement, the first Afghan pact with a [[Europe]]an power, stipulated joint action in case of [[France|Franco]]-Persian aggression against Afghan or British dominions. Only a few weeks after signing the agreement, Shuja was deposed by his predecessor, Mahmud. Much later, he was reinstated by the British, ruling during 1839\u20131842. Two of his sons also ruled for a brief period in 1842.\n\n===Mahmud Shah (second reign, 1809\u20131818)===\n{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}\n\nMahmud's second reign lasted nine years. Mahmud alienated the Barakzai, especially Fateh Khan, the son of Painda Khan, who was eventually seized and blinded. Revenge would later be sought and obtained by Fateh Khan's youngest brother, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].\n\n===Sultan Ali Shah (1818\u20131819)===\n{{Main|Ali Shah Durrani}}\nAli Shah was another son of [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]]. He seized power for a brief period in 1818\u20131819.\n\n===Ayub Shah (1819\u20131823)===\n{{Main|Ayub Shah Durrani}}\nAyub Shah was another son of Timur Shah, who deposed Sultan Ali Shah. He was himself later deposed, and presumably killed in 1823. The loss of Kashmir during his reign opened a new chapter in South Asian history.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Indian Campaign of Ahmad Shah Durrani]]\n* [[List of Pashtun empires and dynasties]]\n* [[Deoni]]\n\n==Notes==\n<!--<nowiki>\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags.\n</nowiki>-->\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n*Malleson, George Bruce (1879) ''History of Afghanistan, from the Earliest Period to the Outbreak of the War of 1878'' W.H.

The episode first aired in [[broadcast syndication]] on May&nbsp;5, 1989. It was written by executive producer [[Maurice Hurley (screenwriter)|Maurice Hurley]] and directed by [[Rob Bowman (director)|Rob Bowman]]. \"Q Who\" marked the first appearance of the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], who were designed by Hurley and originally intended to appear in the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 1)|first season]] episode \"[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]\".\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]].  In this episode, the [[omnipotent]] entity known as \"[[Q (Star Trek)|Q]]\" ([[John de Lancie]]) arrives on the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'' and decides that Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) is ignorant and overconfident. Q then sends the ship across the galaxy where the crew make first contact with the [[cybernetic]]ally enhanced assimilating race known as the Borg. After first trying to make peace and then trying to destroy the ship, and failing both, Picard is forced to beg for Q's help.\n\nCostume designs were created by Dorinda Wood, while [[Michael Westmore]] developed the prosthetics worn on the actor's heads. The designs were reminiscent of creations of [[H. R. Giger]] and the character Lord Dread from the television series ''[[Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future]]''. The episode went over budget and nearly required additional filming time. \"Q Who\" was watched by 10.3 million viewers. The critical reception has been positive, with the episode described as the first \"great episode\" of the series.<ref name=torreview /> It was nominated for three [[Emmy Award]]s, winning two.\n\n==Plot==\nOn his way back to his quarters, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) steps off a turbolift and instead of finding himself in a corridor onboard the ''Enterprise'', ends up on board a [[Shuttlecraft (Star Trek)|shuttlecraft]] with [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] ([[John de Lancie]]) at the controls. Picard demands to be returned to the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]''; Q calls him \"an impossibly stubborn human\" and refuses to take him back until he agrees to at least hear Q's requests. Q then transports them to Ten Forward, where [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), who recognizes him, warns Picard not to trust him. Q reveals that he wants to join the crew to assist them as they push further into unexplored regions of the galaxy, asserting they are not ready for the threats they will encounter. Picard chooses to make their own way into the unknown, and rejects Q's offer. Irritated by Picard's arrogance, Q instantaneously sends the ''Enterprise'' thousands of light years across the galaxy, then disappears. Lt. Commander [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) reports that the nearest starbase is over two years away at maximum warp. A fearful Guinan warns Picard to set course for home immediately, but Picard is curious to explore.\n\nThe crew discover a nearby planet that shows signs of a previous civilization but has been stripped of all industrial and mechanical elements, similar to destruction found several months ago to Federation outposts bordering the Romulan Neutral Zone. Moments later, they detect and are then met by a large, cube-shaped vessel which does not answer their hails. Guinan warns Picard that the ship belongs to the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], a powerful, cyborg-like race that nearly wiped out her people, scattering the survivors across the galaxy, and again urges Picard to leave immediately or face certain destruction. Though Picard orders the ''Enterprise''{{'s}} [[Force field (fiction)|shields]] raised, a single, speechless Borg [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transports]] into Engineering and begins to probe the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s computer systems. Lt. [[Worf]] ([[Michael Dorn]]) initially attempts to incapacitate the intruder with his [[phaser (Star Trek)|phaser]] set on stun, which has no effect. Worf is forced to use the kill setting in order to neutralize the Borg. Immediately afterwards, a second Borg appears and continues probing the computer, now proving to be completely immune to phaser fire. Completing its mission, it strips several components from the dead Borg, then transports itself and the dead Borg away. The Borg ship contacts the ''Enterprise'' and demands their surrender. The Borg then immobilizes the ''Enterprise'' with a tractor beam, disables the shields, and uses a cutting beam to slice into the saucer section to remove a cross-section of the ship, killing eighteen people.\n\nPicard orders return fire, and the ''Enterprise'' apparently disables the Borg ship. Against Guinan's advice, Commander [[William Riker]] ([[Jonathan Frakes]]) takes an away team to the immense Borg cube where they find mostly dormant Borg drones and a Borg nursery.  Data discovers that the Borg ship is regenerating and repairing the damage made by the '' Enterprise''.  The away team is beamed directly to the bridge, and Picard orders that they depart at maximum warp. The Borg ship suddenly reactivates and begins pursuit, gaining on the ''Enterprise''. Q appears on the bridge and warns Picard that the Borg will never stop chasing them, and cannot be defeated. Picard attempts to fight back against the Borg to no avail, and finally admits he needs Q's help. Q obliges, safely returning the ''Enterprise'' to its last position in Federation space. Picard, though thankful for Q's lesson, blames Q for the deaths of his crew. Q disappears, but not before reminding them again of their ill-preparedness. Guinan warns Picard that now that the Borg are aware of the Federation's presence, they will be coming. Picard reflects that perhaps Q did the right thing for the wrong reasons by bringing forward their encounter with the Borg, as it has informed the Federation what lies ahead of them as they continue to explore.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode featured the third appearance of de Lancie as Q after \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\" and \"[[Hide and Q]]\", the latter of which had been written by Hurley under a [[pseudonym]]. [[Lycia Naff]] was introduced as Ensign Sonia Gomez, who was intended to be a recurring character in the same manner as Chief [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] played by [[Colm Meaney]] (who also appeared in this episode). However, Naff made just one more appearance as Gomez, in the following episode, although the character later appeared in the ''[[Starfleet Corps of Engineers]]'' series of [[novella]]s.<ref name=torreview />\n\n\"Q Who\" went $50,000 over budget and at one point had an eighth day of shooting arranged, although this was subsequently cancelled.<ref name=nemecek86/> The overspending on this episode and \"[[Elementary, Dear Data]]\" resulted in the budget-saving production of the [[clip show]] \"[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]\".<ref>[[#grossaltman|Gross & Altman (1995)]]: p. 182</ref> Director [[Rob Bowman (director)|Rob Bowman]] was concerned with \"Q Who\" for a while, saying that \"we didn't know day to day if we were making a stinker or a winner\".<ref name=nemecek86/>\n\n===The Borg===\n\n[[Gene Roddenberry]] was keen not to re-use aliens from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'', and so the [[Ferengi]] were developed to be the main villains for ''The Next Generation''.

While her design showed a suit with tubes running in and out of it, she left the head design up to make-up supervisor [[Michael Westmore]]. The headpieces and the main costumes were made at the same time by the two different departments, with Wood and Westmore working together at times to ensure that they matched.<ref>[[#westmorenazzaro1993|Westmor &, Nazzaro (1993)]]: p. 24</ref> The base of the head pieces was made from foam, and while Westmore initially made casts of model kits using [[polyurethane]] for the electronic parts, he found it more effective to use actual electronics from damaged equipment. He designed a latex attachment to allow for tubes to be attached to skin so that there was not a great deal of bare skin left on the actors' bodies. That skin was covered in a white base make-up in order to achieve a [[zombie]]-like appearance.<ref>[[#westmorenazzaro1993|Westmore & Nazzaro (1993)]]: p. 25</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n |quote = I love the moment when a good show becomes great.

The episode first aired in [[broadcast syndication]] on May&nbsp;5, 1989. It was written by executive producer [[Maurice Hurley (screenwriter)|Maurice Hurley]] and directed by [[Rob Bowman (director)|Rob Bowman]]. \"Q Who\" marked the first appearance of the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], who were designed by Hurley and originally intended to appear in the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 1)|first season]] episode \"[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]\".\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]].  In this episode, the [[omnipotent]] entity known as \"[[Q (Star Trek)|Q]]\" ([[John de Lancie]]) arrives on the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'' and decides that Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) is ignorant and overconfident. Q then sends the ship across the galaxy where the crew make first contact with the [[cybernetic]]ally enhanced assimilating race known as the Borg. After first trying to make peace and then trying to destroy the ship, and failing both, Picard is forced to beg for Q's help.\n\nCostume designs were created by Dorinda Wood, while [[Michael Westmore]] developed the prosthetics worn on the actor's heads. The designs were reminiscent of creations of [[H. R. Giger]] and the character Lord Dread from the television series ''[[Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future]]''. The episode went over budget and nearly required additional filming time. \"Q Who\" was watched by 10.3 million viewers. The critical reception has been positive, with the episode described as the first \"great episode\" of the series.<ref name=torreview /> It was nominated for three [[Emmy Award]]s, winning two.\n\n==Plot==\nOn his way back to his quarters, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) steps off a turbolift and instead of finding himself in a corridor onboard the ''Enterprise'', ends up on board a [[Shuttlecraft (Star Trek)|shuttlecraft]] with [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] ([[John de Lancie]]) at the controls. Picard demands to be returned to the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]''; Q calls him \"an impossibly stubborn human\" and refuses to take him back until he agrees to at least hear Q's requests. Q then transports them to Ten Forward, where [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), who recognizes him, warns Picard not to trust him. Q reveals that he wants to join the crew to assist them as they push further into unexplored regions of the galaxy, asserting they are not ready for the threats they will encounter. Picard chooses to make their own way into the unknown, and rejects Q's offer. Irritated by Picard's arrogance, Q instantaneously sends the ''Enterprise'' thousands of light years across the galaxy, then disappears. Lt. Commander [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) reports that the nearest starbase is over two years away at maximum warp. A fearful Guinan warns Picard to set course for home immediately, but Picard is curious to explore.\n\nThe crew discover a nearby planet that shows signs of a previous civilization but has been stripped of all industrial and mechanical elements, similar to destruction found several months ago to Federation outposts bordering the Romulan Neutral Zone. Moments later, they detect and are then met by a large, cube-shaped vessel which does not answer their hails. Guinan warns Picard that the ship belongs to the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], a powerful, cyborg-like race that nearly wiped out her people, scattering the survivors across the galaxy, and again urges Picard to leave immediately or face certain destruction. Though Picard orders the ''Enterprise''{{'s}} [[Force field (fiction)|shields]] raised, a single, speechless Borg [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transports]] into Engineering and begins to probe the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s computer systems. Lt. [[Worf]] ([[Michael Dorn]]) initially attempts to incapacitate the intruder with his [[phaser (Star Trek)|phaser]] set on stun, which has no effect. Worf is forced to use the kill setting in order to neutralize the Borg. Immediately afterwards, a second Borg appears and continues probing the computer, now proving to be completely immune to phaser fire. Completing its mission, it strips several components from the dead Borg, then transports itself and the dead Borg away. The Borg ship contacts the ''Enterprise'' and demands their surrender. The Borg then immobilizes the ''Enterprise'' with a tractor beam, disables the shields, and uses a cutting beam to slice into the saucer section to remove a cross-section of the ship, killing eighteen people.\n\nPicard orders return fire, and the ''Enterprise'' apparently disables the Borg ship. Against Guinan's advice, Commander [[William Riker]] ([[Jonathan Frakes]]) takes an away team to the immense Borg cube where they find mostly dormant Borg drones and a Borg nursery.  Data discovers that the Borg ship is regenerating and repairing the damage made by the '' Enterprise''.  The away team is beamed directly to the bridge, and Picard orders that they depart at maximum warp. The Borg ship suddenly reactivates and begins pursuit, gaining on the ''Enterprise''. Q appears on the bridge and warns Picard that the Borg will never stop chasing them, and cannot be defeated. Picard attempts to fight back against the Borg to no avail, and finally admits he needs Q's help. Q obliges, safely returning the ''Enterprise'' to its last position in Federation space. Picard, though thankful for Q's lesson, blames Q for the deaths of his crew. Q disappears, but not before reminding them again of their ill-preparedness. Guinan warns Picard that now that the Borg are aware of the Federation's presence, they will be coming. Picard reflects that perhaps Q did the right thing for the wrong reasons by bringing forward their encounter with the Borg, as it has informed the Federation what lies ahead of them as they continue to explore.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode featured the third appearance of de Lancie as Q after \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\" and \"[[Hide and Q]]\", the latter of which had been written by Hurley under a [[pseudonym]]. [[Lycia Naff]] was introduced as Ensign Sonia Gomez, who was intended to be a recurring character in the same manner as Chief [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] played by [[Colm Meaney]] (who also appeared in this episode). However, Naff made just one more appearance as Gomez, in the following episode, although the character later appeared in the ''[[Starfleet Corps of Engineers]]'' series of [[novella]]s.<ref name=torreview />\n\n\"Q Who\" went $50,000 over budget and at one point had an eighth day of shooting arranged, although this was subsequently cancelled.<ref name=nemecek86/> The overspending on this episode and \"[[Elementary, Dear Data]]\" resulted in the budget-saving production of the [[clip show]] \"[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]\".<ref>[[#grossaltman|Gross & Altman (1995)]]: p. 182</ref> Director [[Rob Bowman (director)|Rob Bowman]] was concerned with \"Q Who\" for a while, saying that \"we didn't know day to day if we were making a stinker or a winner\".<ref name=nemecek86/>\n\n===The Borg===\n\n[[Gene Roddenberry]] was keen not to re-use aliens from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'', and so the [[Ferengi]] were developed to be the main villains for ''The Next Generation''.

While her design showed a suit with tubes running in and out of it, she left the head design up to make-up supervisor [[Michael Westmore]]. The headpieces and the main costumes were made at the same time by the two different departments, with Wood and Westmore working together at times to ensure that they matched.<ref>[[#westmorenazzaro1993|Westmor &, Nazzaro (1993)]]: p. 24</ref> The base of the head pieces was made from foam, and while Westmore initially made casts of model kits using [[polyurethane]] for the electronic parts, he found it more effective to use actual electronics from damaged equipment. He designed a latex attachment to allow for tubes to be attached to skin so that there was not a great deal of bare skin left on the actors' bodies. That skin was covered in a white base make-up in order to achieve a [[zombie]]-like appearance.<ref>[[#westmorenazzaro1993|Westmore & Nazzaro (1993)]]: p. 25</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n |quote = I love the moment when a good show becomes great.

That is no longer an issue. From now on, even when the writing sucks and the characters are annoying and the special effects insult our ocular abilities, we know for certain that the series is at least capable of kicking some serious ass.\n |source = Zack Handlen, ''The A.V.
