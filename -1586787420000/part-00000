He played in two regular season contests in 2005, including the nationally televised [[Thanksgiving]] Day game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. In the two contests combined, Orlovsky completed 7-of-17 passes for 63 yards, with no touchdowns or interceptions.\n\nPrior to the 2006 season the Lions traded [[Joey Harrington]] and released [[Jeff Garcia]], while signing [[Jon Kitna]] and [[Josh McCown]]. Orlovsky spent the 2006 season as the third-string QB. Orlovsky was projected to be the second-string quarterback in 2007 because [[Drew Stanton]], who was picked in the second round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]], was placed on [[injured reserve]]; however, the Lions acquired [[J. T. O'Sullivan]], who bumped Orlovsky back to third on the depth chart. Orlovsky did not take a regular season snap in either 2006 or 2007; in 2008, O'Sullivan went to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and emerged as the starting QB there.\n\nOn September 15 against the [[Green Bay Packers]], he finished the game, completing two of four attempts for six yards.\n\nTouchback Danny made his first career NFL start on October 12, 2008, in a 12\u201310 Lions loss against the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. He completed 12 of 21 passes for 150 yards, with one touchdown and no turnovers.  However, early in the first quarter when he lined up in shotgun formation, he inadvertently ran out of the back of his own end zone for a safety, in what turned out to be the margin of victory.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80b8de5f Orlovsky ran out of the back of his own end zone]</ref>  \"When they started blowing the whistle, I was like, 'Did we false start, or were they offsides or something?'\" Orlovsky said. \"And I looked, and I was just like, 'You're an idiot.'\"<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20081013/SPORTS01/810130352/1049 Orlovsky red-faced, but confident in Lions.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016090229/http://www.freep.com/article/20081013/SPORTS01/810130352/1049 |date=October 16, 2008 }}</ref>. \n\nIn the following week of the Lions' winless season, Orlovsky connected with [[Calvin Johnson]] on a 96-yard touchdown pass.\n\nOrlovsky also started the final game of the 2008 season, but was unable to lead his team to their first victory of the season.

His 2,488 yards passing rank fourth on the school's season-record list.\n\nAs a junior, he ranked seventh in the nation in passing, hitting on 279 of 475 passes (58.7 percent) for 3,485 yards, 33 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. His 33 scoring tosses ranked first in the NCAA Division I-A.\n\nOrlovsky did not match his 2003 figures as a senior, but guided the team to victory in its inaugural bowl appearance. He gained 3,354 yards with 23 touchdowns and 15 interceptions on 288 of 456 throws (63.0 percent) in 2004.\n\nOrlovsky holds the school record for most pass completions (916), pass attempts (1,567), yards passing (10,706), touchdown passes (84), interceptions (51), total plays (1,710) and total yards (10,421).\n\nOrlovsky, along with head coach [[Randy Edsall]], served as the \"face\" of the UConn football program durings the early 2000s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105040604/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15118604.html HighBeam]</ref>  Orlovsky was the starting quarterback during the Huskies transitional period from [[Division I-AA]] football, to independent [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] team, to full-fledged member of the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]].\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Detroit Lions===\nWhen [[Jeff Garcia]] went down with an injury in the '05 preseason, Orlovsky emerged as the Lions' primary backup. He played in two regular season contests in 2005, including the nationally televised [[Thanksgiving]] Day game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. In the two contests combined, Orlovsky completed 7-of-17 passes for 63 yards, with no touchdowns or interceptions.\n\nPrior to the 2006 season the Lions traded [[Joey Harrington]] and released [[Jeff Garcia]], while signing [[Jon Kitna]] and [[Josh McCown]]. Orlovsky spent the 2006 season as the third-string QB. Orlovsky was projected to be the second-string quarterback in 2007 because [[Drew Stanton]], who was picked in the second round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]], was placed on [[injured reserve]]; however, the Lions acquired [[J. T. O'Sullivan]], who bumped Orlovsky back to third on the depth chart. Orlovsky did not take a regular season snap in either 2006 or 2007; in 2008, O'Sullivan went to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and emerged as the starting QB there.\n\nOn September 15 against the [[Green Bay Packers]], he finished the game, completing two of four attempts for six yards.\n\nOrlovsky made his first career NFL start on October 12, 2008, in a 12\u201310 Lions loss against the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. He completed 12 of 21 passes for 150 yards, with one touchdown and no turnovers.  However, early in the first quarter when he lined up in shotgun formation, he inadvertently ran out of the back of his own end zone for a safety, in what turned out to be the margin of victory.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80b8de5f Orlovsky ran out of the back of his own end zone]</ref>  \"When they started blowing the whistle, I was like, 'Did we false start, or were they offsides or something?'\" Orlovsky said. \"And I looked, and I was just like, 'You're an idiot.'\"<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20081013/SPORTS01/810130352/1049 Orlovsky red-faced, but confident in Lions.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016090229/http://www.freep.com/article/20081013/SPORTS01/810130352/1049 |date=October 16, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the following week of the Lions' winless season, Orlovsky connected with [[Calvin Johnson]] on a 96-yard touchdown pass.\n\nOrlovsky also started the final game of the 2008 season, but was unable to lead his team to their first victory of the season. Orlovsky announced his intention to explore the free agent market at the end of the 2008 season rather than accept a contract as a backup quarterback in Detroit.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090223/ap_on_sp_fo_ne/fbn_lions_orlovsky;_ylt=Aiy.5Fw845COb6IBEy81r2cLMxIF Orlovsy Plans to Enter Free Agency] Yahoo Sports, February 23, 2009</ref>\n\n===Houston Texans===\n[[File:Dan Orlovsky - Houston Texans.jpg|175pcpx|thumbnail|right|Orlovsky during his tenure with the Texans.]]\nHe signed with the [[Houston Texans]] for a 3-year, $9 million deal on March 1, 2009.

In his enrolment in the University of Vienna (1500), he still latinised his name as ''Udalricus Zwingling de [[Lichtensteig]]'' ({{Harvnb|Jackson|1900|p=57}}).\nHis signature at the Marburg Colloquy (1529) was ''Huldrychus Zwinglius''  ({{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}; Schuler, Schultess (eds.), ''Huldrici Zuinglii opera'', 1830, p. 55). \nModern literature uses either \"Ulrich\" or \"Huldrych\" (e.g. [[George Richard Potter|Potter]] uses \"Ulrich\", while G\u00e4bler, Stephens, and Furcha use \"Huldrych\").}} (1 January 1484&nbsp;\u2013 11 October 1531) was a leader of the [[Reformation in Switzerland]], born during a time of emerging Swiss patriotism and increasing criticism of the [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss mercenary system]]. He attended the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Basel]], a scholarly center of [[Renaissance humanism]]. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in [[Glarus]] and later in [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]], where he was influenced by the writings of [[Erasmus]].\n\nIn 1519, Zwingli became the pastor of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] where he began to preach ideas on reform of the Catholic Church. In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|custom of fasting]] during [[Lent]]. In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of images in places of worship. In 1525, he introduced a new communion liturgy to replace the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. He also clashed with the [[Anabaptists]], which resulted in their persecution. Historians have debated whether or not he turned Z\u00fcrich into a theocracy.<ref>Robert Walton, ''Zwingli's Theocracy'' (Toronto University Press. 1967).</ref>\n\nThe Reformation spread to other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] resisted, preferring to remain [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war was averted at the last moment between the two sides. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of [[Martin Luther]] and other reformers. They met at the [[Marburg Colloquy]] and agreed on many points of doctrine, but they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the [[Real Presence|Real Presence of Christ]] in the [[Eucharist]].\n\nIn 1531, Zwingli's alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons. The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Z\u00fcrich was ill-prepared, and Zwingli died on the battlefield. His legacy lives on in the [[Reformed Christian confessions of faith|confessions]], liturgy, and church orders of the [[Reformed churches]] of today.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:Historische Karte CH 1515.png|thumb|right|260px|Map of the Swiss Confederation in 1515]]\nThe [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] in Huldrych Zwingli's time consisted of ten states ([[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]) as well as affiliated areas and common lordships. Lord Beamer controlled the largest state. Unlike the modern state of [[Switzerland]], which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served as the basis for conflict during the time of the Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]] of 1440\u20131446.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=1\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe wider political environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries the relationship with the Confederation's powerful neighbor, France, determined the foreign policies of the Swiss. Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the [[Swabian War]] in 1499, the Confederation had become ''de facto'' independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the [[Duchy of Milan]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and the [[Papal States]] competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the [[Swiss mercenaries|mercenary pension system]] became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThese internal and external factors contributed to the rise of a Confederation national consciousness, in which the term ''fatherland'' ({{lang-la |patria}}) began to take on meaning beyond a reference to an individual canton. At the same time, [[Renaissance humanism]], with its universal values and emphasis on scholarship (as exemplified by [[Erasmus]] (1466\u20131536), the \"prince of humanism\"), had taken root in the Confederation. Within this environment, defined by the confluence of Swiss [[patriotism]] and humanism, Zwingli was born in 1484.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years (1484\u20131518)===\n[[File:Geburtshaus von Huldrych Zwingli.jpg|thumb|right|260px|House where Zwingli was born in [[Wildhaus]] in what is now the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]]]\nHuldrych Zwingli was born on 1 January 1484 in [[Wildhaus]], in the [[Toggenburg]] valley of [[Switzerland]], to a family of farmers, the third child of nine. His father, Ulrich, played a leading role in the administration of the community (''[[Amtmann]]'' or chief local magistrate).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=6}}</ref> Zwingli's primary schooling was provided by his uncle, Bartholomew, a cleric in [[Weesen]], where he probably met [[Katharina von Zimmern]].<ref name=\"katharina\">{{cite web|url=http://frauen-und-reformation.de/?s=bio&id=93|title=Katharina von Zimmern|publisher=frauen-und-reformation.de|author=|date=|accessdate=25 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331123825/http://www.frauen-und-reformation.de/?s=bio&id=93|archive-date=31 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> At ten years old, Zwingli was sent to [[Basel]] to obtain his secondary education where he learned [[Latin language|Latin]] under Magistrate Gregory B\u00fcnzli. After three years in Basel, he stayed a short time in [[Bern]] with the humanist, Henry W\u00f6lfflin. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in Bern tried to persuade Zwingli to join their order and it is possible that he was received as a novice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}. Potter mentions this possibility. G\u00e4bler states that Zwingli did not refute later claims by opponents that he had been a monk in Bern.</ref> However, his father and uncle disapproved of such a course and he left Bern without completing his Latin studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}</ref> He enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]] in the winter semester of 1498 but was expelled, according to the university's records. However, it is not certain that Zwingli was indeed expelled, and he re-enrolled in the summer semester of 1500; his activities in 1499 are unknown.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=25}}. The word ''exclusus'' (expelled) was added to his matriculation entry. G\u00e4bler notes that without a date and reason, it does not conform to what was customary at the time.</ref> Zwingli continued his studies in Vienna until 1502, after which he transferred to the [[University of Basel]] where he received the Master of Arts degree (''Magister'') in 1506.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=26}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was ordained in [[Constance]], the seat of the local diocese, and he celebrated his first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not considered unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of [[Glarus]], where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly on the side of the [[Holy See|Roman See]]. In return, [[Pope Julius II]] honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]] in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the [[Battle of Marignano]] caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] in the [[canton of Schwyz]]. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as ''The Ox'' (1510) and ''The Labyrinth'' (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=8}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=35, 37}}</ref> Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=29\u201333}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=22\u201340}}</ref>\n\nZwingli's time as the pastor of Glarus and Einsiedeln was characterized by inner growth and development. He perfected his [[Greek language|Greek]] and he took up the study of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which he was able to draw upon [[Classics|classical]], [[patristic]], and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative [[pacifism]] and his focus on preaching can be traced to the influence of Erasmus.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=33\u201341}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1518, the post of the ''Leutpriestertum'' (people's priest) of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] at [[Z\u00fcrich]] became vacant. The [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the foundation that administered the Grossm\u00fcnster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, his opposition to the French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Z\u00fcrich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=43\u201344}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich ministry begins (1519\u20131521)===\n[[File:Prozessionsachse murerplan.jpg|thumb|right|The Grossm\u00fcnster in the centre of the medieval town of Z\u00fcrich ([[Murerplan]], 1576)]]\nOn 1 January 1519, Zwingli gave his first sermon in Z\u00fcrich. Deviating from the prevalent practice of basing a sermon on the Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using [[Erasmus]]' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the [[Gospel of Matthew]], giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of ''[[lectio continua]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Old|1998|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays until he reached the end and then proceeded in the same manner with the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the New Testament [[epistles]], and finally the [[Old Testament]]. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor [[Lutheran]]. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=44\u201345}}</ref> One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Oskar Farner and Walther K\u00f6hler.</ref> Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Arthur Rich and Cornelius Augustijn.</ref> A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=46\u201347}}. A proponent of this view is Gottfried W. Locher.</ref>\n\nZwingli's theological stance was gradually revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption and in the process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the [[veneration]] of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of [[excommunication]]. His attack on the claim that [[Tithe|tithing]] was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=50}}</ref> This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the [[Sola scriptura|sole basis of his teachings was Scripture]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=66}}</ref>\n\nWithin the [[Bishopric of Constance|diocese of Constance]], Bernhardin Sanson was offering a special [[indulgence]] for contributors to the building of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] in Rome. When Sanson arrived at the gates of Z\u00fcrich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after [[Martin Luther]] published his [[Ninety-five theses]] (31 October 1517).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=XII}}</ref> The council of Z\u00fcrich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=44, 66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1519, Z\u00fcrich was struck by an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during which at least one in four persons died. All of those who could afford it left the city, but Zwingli remained and continued his pastoral duties. In September, he caught the disease and nearly died. He described his preparation for death in a poem, Zwingli's ''Pestlied'', consisting of three parts: the onset of the illness, the closeness to death, and the joy of recovery. The final verses of the first part read:<ref>see e.g. {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=69\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n:''Thuo, wie du wilt;''\n:''mich n\u00fct befilt.''\n:''Din haf bin ich.''\n:''Mach gantz ald brich;''\n:''dann nimpst mich hin''\n:''der geiste min von diser Erd,''\n:''thuost du's, dass er nit b\u00f6ser werd,''\n:''ald anderen nit''\n:''befleck ir l\u00e4ben fromm und sit.

When a vacancy occurred among the canons of the Grossm\u00fcnster, Zwingli was elected to fulfill that vacancy on 29 April 1521. In becoming a canon, he became a full citizen of Z\u00fcrich. He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossm\u00fcnster.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=51}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=73}}</ref>\n\n===First rifts (1522\u20131524)===\nThe first public controversy regarding Zwingli's preaching broke out during the season of [[Lent]] in 1522. On the first fasting Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the ''Wurstessen'' in [[Christoph Froschauer]]'s workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title ''Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen'' (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food can be derived from the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin. The event, which came to be referred to as the [[Affair of the Sausages]], is considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland.<ref name=\"Janz2008\">{{cite book|author=Denis Janz|title=A Reformation reader: primary texts with introductions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJWyDNATVwcC&pg=PA183|accessdate=15 January 2012|year=2008|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-6310-0|page=183}}</ref> Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Z\u00fcrich. The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossm\u00fcnster and city council and repeating the traditional position.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=52\u201356}}</ref>\n\nFollowing this event, Zwingli and other humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July to abolish the requirement of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as ''Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen'' (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, [[Anna Reinhart]], earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, three months before the birth of their first child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=80}}</ref> They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Z\u00fcrich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, ''Apologeticus Archeteles'' (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich disputations (1523)===\n[[File:Switzerland Z\u00fcrich Grossm\u00fcnster Zwingli M\u00fcnch 1935.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Relief]] of Zwingli preaching at the pulpit, [[Otto M\u00fcnch]], 1935]]\nThe events of 1522 brought no clarification on the issues. Not only did the unrest between Z\u00fcrich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Z\u00fcrich's Confederation partners in the [[Tagsatzung|Swiss Diet]]. On 22 December, the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Z\u00fcrich. The city council felt obliged to take the initiative and find its own solution.\n\n====First Disputation====\nOn 3 January 1523, the Z\u00fcrich city council invited the clergy of the city and outlying region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a decision on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Z\u00fcrich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=63\u201365}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=97\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nThe meeting attracted a large crowd of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his [[vicar general]], [[Johann Faber|Johannes Fabri]]. Zwingli summarised his position in the ''Schlussreden'' (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=99}}</ref><ref>The Sixty-seven Articles are contained in [https://archive.org/details/selectedworksofh00zwin ''Selected Works of Huldreich Zwingli'', Philadelphia, 1901], pp.&nbsp;111\u2013117.

Accessed 13 March 2015.</ref> Fabri, who had not envisaged an academic disputation in the manner Zwingli had prepared for,<ref>{{Harvnb|Cameron|1991|pp=108}}</ref> was forbidden to discuss high theology before laymen, and simply insisted on the necessity of the ecclesiastical authority. The decision of the council was that Zwingli would be allowed to continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=67\u201371}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=100\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n====Second Disputation====\nIn September 1523, [[Leo Jud]], Zwingli's closest friend and colleague and pastor of [[St. Peter, Z\u00fcrich|St. Peterskirche]], publicly called for the removal of statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Z\u00fcrich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Z\u00fcrich, the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur|Chur]] and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=72, 76\u201377}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nZwingli again took the lead in the disputation. His opponent was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing [[infant baptism]] with [[Credobaptism|adult baptism]]. This group was led by [[Conrad Grebel]], one of the initiators of the [[Anabaptist]] movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led to the question of whether the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from [[Aargau]] and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, ''Kurze, christliche Einleitung'' (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=78\u201381}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\n===Reformation progresses in Z\u00fcrich (1524\u20131525)===\n[[File:Zue Grossmuenster 06.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Above the entrance to the Grossm\u00fcnster doors is inscribed Matthew 11:28, \"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\"]]\nIn December 1523, the council set a deadline of [[Pentecost]] in 1524 for a solution to the elimination of the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in ''Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe'' (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Z\u00fcrich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of the effect of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. [[Candlemas]] was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on [[Palm Sunday]] to the [[Lindenhof]], and [[triptych]]s remained covered and closed after [[Lent]].<ref name=\"Potter138\">{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=138}}</ref> Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=82\u201383}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the council had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the decrease in the exercise of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in ''Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls'' (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before [[Easter]], Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On [[Maundy Thursday]], 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was the focal point of the service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref>\n\nFor some time Zwingli had accused [[mendicant]] orders of hypocrisy and demanded their abolition in order to support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossm\u00fcnster and [[Fraum\u00fcnster]] and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraum\u00fcnster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance [[Katharina von Zimmern]]) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the ''Prophezei'' (Prophecy) or [[Carolinum, Z\u00fcrich|''Carolinum'']], at the Grossm\u00fcnster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The [[Z\u00fcrich Bible]] translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by [[Christoph Froschauer]], bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school.<ref>According to {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=102}}, the first complete Bible was printed in 1531. Other sources say 1529 or 1530. See {{Harvnb|Estep|1986|p=96}} and {{Harvnb|Greenslade|1975|p=106}}. Early editions were called the Froschauer Bible, see {{Harvnb|Chadwick|2001|p=35}}.</ref> Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=97\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n===Conflict with the Anabaptists (1525\u20131527)===\nShortly after the second Z\u00fcrich disputation, many in the [[Radical Reformation|radical wing of the Reformation]] became convinced that Zwingli was making too many concessions to the Z\u00fcrich council. They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful. [[Conrad Grebel]], the leader of the radicals and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private. On 15 August 1524 the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants. Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel's group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions. When talks were broken off, Zwingli published ''Wer Ursache gebe zu Aufruhr'' (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing points-of-view.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> On 17 January 1525 a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli. Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Z\u00fcrich. The radicals ignored these measures and on 21 January, they met at the house of the mother of another radical leader, [[Felix Manz]]. Grebel and a third leader, [[George Blaurock]], performed the first recorded Anabaptist [[Credobaptism|adult baptisms]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=177\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 February, the council repeated the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some who failed to comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Z\u00fcrich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread to other parts of the Confederation as well as a number of [[Swabia]]n towns. On 6\u20138 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossm\u00fcnster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious exchange of views as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=183\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Z\u00fcrich council decided that no compromise was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate that no one shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=187}}</ref> Although Zwingli, technically, had nothing to do with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Z\u00fcrich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the [[Limmat]]. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=186\u2013188}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=John|title=The Reformation and the Anabaptists: Steps to Reconciliation, 26 June, 2004, Zurich, Switzerland|publisher=Mennonite Historical Committee|date=July 2004|url=http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324075102/http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archivedate=24 March 2012|accessdate=23 December 2012}} The descendants of the Zwinglian Reformation, the Reformed Church of Z\u00fcrich, and the descendants of the Anabaptist movement ([[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]]) held a Reconciliation Conference at the Grossm\u00fcnster on 26 June 2004. This link includes the conference program, and all statements made at that conference.</ref>\n\n===Reformation in the Confederation (1526\u20131528)===\n{{further|Swiss Reformation}}\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli Denkmal - Wasserkirche - Limmatquai 2011-08-10 11-47-50.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Statue of Zwingli in front of the ''[[Wasserkirche]]'' church in Z\u00fcrich]]\nOn 8 April 1524, five cantons, [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], formed an alliance, ''die f\u00fcnf Orte'' (the Five States) to defend themselves from Zwingli's Reformation.<ref name=\"Potter138\" /> They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including [[John Eck]], who had debated Luther in the [[Leipzig Disputation]] of 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on the selection of the judging authority, the location of the debate, and the use of the Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]]. Although Z\u00fcrich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] of Basel, a theologian from [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], and [[Appenzell]] as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Basel|Basel]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], and [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]] supported him.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nThe Baden disputation exposed a deep rift in the Confederation on matters of religion. The Reformation was now emerging in other states. The city of [[St Gallen]], an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, [[Joachim Vadian]], and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Z\u00fcrich. In Basel, although Zwingli had a close relationship with Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any reformatory changes until 1 April 1529 when the mass was prohibited. Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Z\u00fcrich's example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529. In the case of Bern, [[Berchtold Haller]], the priest at [[M\u00fcnster of Berne|St Vincent M\u00fcnster]], and [[Niklaus Manuel]], the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause. But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation. Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Wolfgang Capito]] from [[Strasbourg]], [[Ambrosius Blarer]] from [[Konstanz|Constance]], and [[Andreas Althamer]] from [[Nuremberg]]. Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives. The meeting started on 6 January 1528 and lasted nearly three weeks. Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the M\u00fcnster. On 7 February 1528 the council decreed that the Reformation be established in Bern.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=113\u2013119}}</ref>\n\n===First Kappel War (1529)===\n{{Further|First war of Kappel}}\nEven before the Bern disputation, Zwingli was canvassing for an alliance of reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, ''das Christliche [[Burgrecht]]'' (the Christian Civic Union) was created.<ref>{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|p=109}}. Potter also translates ''Burgrecht'' as \"Civic Union\", while {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=119}} translates it as \"Fortress Law\".</ref> The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Z\u00fcrich on 5\u20136 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, [[Biel]], [[M\u00fclhausen]], Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed ''die Christliche Vereinigung'' (the Christian Alliance) with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] on 22 April 1529.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=352\u2013355}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bild Zwingli Asper.jpg|thumb|left|1549 painting by [[Hans Asper]]]]\nSoon after the Austrian treaty was signed, a reformed preacher, Jacob Kaiser, was captured in [[Uznach]] and executed in Schwyz. This triggered a strong reaction from Zwingli; he drafted ''Ratschlag \u00fcber den Krieg'' (Advice About the War) for the government. He outlined justifications for an attack on the Catholic states and other measures to be taken. Before Z\u00fcrich could implement his plans, a delegation from Bern that included Niklaus Manuel arrived in Z\u00fcrich. The delegation called on Z\u00fcrich to settle the matter peacefully. Manuel added that an attack would expose Bern to further dangers as Catholic [[Valais]] and the Duchy of Savoy bordered its southern flank. He then noted, \"You cannot really bring faith by means of spears and halberds.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=364}}. In [[Early Modern German]], \"Warlich man mag mit spiess und halberten den glouben nit ingeben.\"</ref> Z\u00fcrich, however, decided that it would act alone, knowing that Bern would be obliged to acquiesce. War was declared on 8 June 1529. Z\u00fcrich was able to raise an army of 30,000 men. The Five States were abandoned by Austria and could raise only 9,000 men. The two forces met near [[Kappel am Albis|Kappel]], but war was averted due to the intervention of Hans Aebli, a relative of Zwingli, who pleaded for an armistice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=362\u2013367}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was obliged to state the terms of the armistice. He demanded the dissolution of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Z\u00fcrich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=367\u2013369}}</ref> The first Land Peace of Kappel, ''der erste [[Landfriede]]'', ended the war on 24 June.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=371}}</ref>\n\n===Marburg Colloquy (1529)===\n{{Further|Marburg Colloquy}}\n[[File:Marburger-Religionsgespr\u00e4ch.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coloured [[woodcut]] of the Marburg Colloquy, anonymous, 1557]]\nWhile Zwingli carried on the political work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on the interpretation of the [[eucharist]] originated when [[Andreas Karlstadt]], Luther's former colleague from [[Wittenberg]], published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a [[real presence]] in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including ''de Eucharistia'' (On the Eucharist). Understanding that Christ had ascended to heaven and was sitting at the Father's right hand, Zwingli criticized the idea that Christ's humanity could be in two places at once. Unlike his divinity, Christ's human body was not omnipresent and so could not be in heaven and at the same time be present in the elements. Timothy George, evangelical author, editor of Christianity Today and professor of Historical Theology at Beeson Divinity School at Samford University, has firmly refuted a long-standing misreading of Zwingli that erroneously claimed the Reformer denied all notions of real presence and believed in a memorial view of the Supper, where it was purely symbolic.<ref name=\"George, Timothy pp. 157-158\">George, Timothy. Theology of the Reformers (pp. 157-158). B&H Publishing Group.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nBy spring 1527, Luther reacted strongly to Zwingli's views in the treatise ''Dass Diese Worte Christi \"Das ist mein Leib etc.\" noch fest stehen wider die Schwarmgeister'' (That These Words of Christ \"This is My Body etc.\" Still Stand Firm Against the Fanatics). The controversy continued until 1528 when efforts to build bridges between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian views began. [[Martin Butzer|Martin Bucer]] tried to mediate while [[Philip of Hesse]], who wanted to form a political coalition of all Protestant forces, invited the two parties to [[Marburg]] to discuss their differences. This event became known as the [[Marburg Colloquy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nZwingli accepted Philip's invitation fully believing that he would be able to convince Luther. In contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529, with Luther and [[Philipp Melanchthon]] arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, [[Andreas Osiander]], [[Johannes Brenz]], and [[Justus Jonas]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}</ref> The debates were held from 1\u20134 October and the results were published in the fifteen ''Marburg Articles''. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=136\u2013138}}</ref> Professor George summarized the incompatible views, \"On this issue, they parted without having reached an agreement. Both Luther and Zwingli agreed that the bread in the Supper was a sign. For Luther, however, that which the bread signified, namely the body of Christ, was present \u201cin, with, and under\u201d the sign itself. For Zwingli, though, sign and thing signified were separated by a distance\u2014the width between heaven and earth.\"<ref>George, Timothy. Theology of the Reformers (p. 156). B&H Publishing Group.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=\"Luther claimed that the body of Christ was not eaten in a gross, material way but rather in some mysterious way, which is beyond human understanding. Yet, Zwingli replied, if the words were taken in their literal sense, the body had to be eaten in the most grossly material way. \u201cFor this is the meaning they carry: this bread is that body of mine which is given for you. It was given for us in grossly material form, subject to wounds, blows and death. As such, therefore, it must be the material of the supper.\u201d Indeed, to press the literal meaning of the text even farther, it follows that Christ would have again to suffer pain, as his body was broken again\u2014this time by the teeth of communicants. Even more absurdly, Christ\u2019s body would have to be swallowed, digested, even eliminated through the bowels! Such thoughts were repulsive to Zwingli. They smacked of cannibalism on the one hand and of the pagan mystery religions on the other. The main issue for Zwingli, however, was not the irrationality or exegetical fallacy of Luther\u2019s views. It was rather that Luther put \u201cthe chief point of salvation in physically eating the body of Christ,\u201d for he connected it with the forgiveness of sins. The same motive that had moved Zwingli so strongly to oppose images, the invocation of saints, and baptismal regeneration was present also in the struggle over the Supper: the fear of idolatry. Salvation was by Christ alone, through faith alone, not through faith and bread. The object of faith was that which is not seen (Heb 11:1) and which therefore cannot be eaten except, again, in a nonliteral, figurative sense. \u201cCredere est edere,\u201d said Zwingli: \u201cTo believe is to eat.\u201d To eat the body and to drink the blood of Christ in the Supper, then, simply meant to have the body and blood of Christ present in the mind.\"<ref name=\"George, Timothy pp. 157-158\">George, Timothy.

He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States. Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=141\u2013143}}</ref>\n\nAs Zwingli was working on establishing these political alliances, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the [[Augsburg Diet]] to present their views so that he could make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the [[Augsburg Confession]]. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, [[Memmingen]], and [[Lindau]] produced the [[Tetrapolitan Confession]]. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the ''Burgrecht'' cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, ''Fidei ratio'' (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the [[Apostles' Creed]]. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, [[Johann Eck]], counter-attacked with a publication, ''Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor''.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=143\u2013146}}</ref>\n\nWhen Philip of Hesse formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] at the end of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined on the basis of a Lutheran interpretation of that confession. Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed. The ''Burgrecht'' cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=148}}</ref>\n\nThe peace treaty of the First Kappel War did not define the right of unhindered preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The ''Burgrecht'' cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Z\u00fcrich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated an attack on the Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Z\u00fcrich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Z\u00fcrich urged its continuation and the ''Burgrecht'' cities began to quarrel among themselves.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=148\u2013150}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 October 1531, in a surprise move, the Five States declared war on Z\u00fcrich. Z\u00fcrich's mobilisation was slow due to internal squabbling and on 11 October, 3500 poorly deployed men encountered a Five States force nearly double their size near Kappel. Many pastors, including Zwingli, were among the soldiers. The battle lasted less than one hour and Zwingli was among the 500 casualties in the Z\u00fcrich army.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=150\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nZwingli had considered himself first and foremost a soldier of Christ; second a defender of his country, the Confederation; and third a leader of his city, Z\u00fcrich, where he had lived for the previous twelve years. Ironically, he died at the age of 47, not for Christ nor for the Confederation, but for Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=414}}</ref>  \n  \nIn Tabletalk, Luther is recorded saying: \"They say that Zwingli recently died thus; if his error had prevailed, we would have perished, and our church with us. It was a judgment of God. That was always a proud people. The others, the papists, will probably also be dealt with by our Lord God.\"<ref>Luther Works Tabletalk No. 94: God\u2019s Punishment of the Godless (Early November 1531)</ref> Erasmus wrote, \"We are freed from great fear by the death of the two preachers, Zwingli and [[Oecolampadius]], whose fate has wrought an incredible change in the mind of many.

Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. He placed its authority above other sources such as the [[ecumenical councils]] or the [[Church Fathers]], although he did not hesitate to use other sources to support his arguments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his rationalist humanist education and his Reformed understanding of the Bible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=59}}</ref> He rejected literalist interpretations of a passage, such as those of the Anabaptists, and used [[synecdoche]] <ref>{{citation|last=Yoder|first=John Howard|title=Anabaptism and Reformation in Switzerland: An Historical and Theological Analysis of the Dialogues Between Anabaptists and Reformers|publication-place=Kitchener, Ontario|pages=197\u2013202|year=2004|publisher=Pandora Press|isbn=1-894710-44-4}}</ref> and analogies, methods he describes in ''A Friendly Exegesis'' (1527). Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and [[circumcision]] and between the eucharist and [[Passover]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=64\u201366}}</ref> He also paid attention to the immediate context and attempted to understand the purpose behind it, comparing passages of scripture with each other.\n\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|A rendition of Huldrych Zwingli from the 1906 edition of the ''[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]'']]\nZwingli rejected the word ''sacrament'' in the popular usage of his time. For ordinary people, the word meant some kind of holy action of which there is inherent power to free the conscience from sin. For Zwingli, a sacrament was an initiatory ceremony or a pledge, pointing out that the word was derived from ''sacramentum'' meaning an oath.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=180\u2013185}}</ref> (However, the word is also translated \"mystery\".) In his early writings on baptism, he noted that baptism was an example of such a pledge. He challenged Catholics by accusing them of superstition when they ascribed the water of baptism a certain power to wash away sin. Later, in his conflict with the Anabaptists, he defended the practice of infant baptism, noting that there is no law forbidding the practice. He argued that baptism was a sign of a covenant with God, thereby replacing circumcision in the Old Testament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=194\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nZwingli approached the eucharist in a similar manner to baptism. During the first Z\u00fcrich disputation in 1523, he denied that an actual sacrifice occurred during the mass, arguing that Christ made the sacrifice only once and for all eternity. Hence, the eucharist was \"a memorial of the sacrifice\".<ref>''Huldreich Zwinglis Samtliche Werke'', Vol. I, 460.6\u201310, as quoted in {{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=219}}</ref> Following this argument, he further developed his view, coming to the conclusion of the \"signifies\" interpretation for the words of the institution. He used various passages of scripture to argue against [[transubstantiation]] as well as Luther's views, the key text being John 6:63, \"It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh is of no avail\". Zwingli's approach and interpretation of scripture to understand the meaning of the eucharist was one reason he could not reach a consensus with Luther.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=218\u2013250}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of Luther on Zwingli's theological development has long been a source of interest and discussion among Lutheran scholars, who seek to firmly establish Luther as the first Reformer. Zwingli himself asserted vigorously his independence of Luther and the most recent studies have lent credibility to this claim. Zwingli appears to have read Luther's books in search of confirmation from Luther for his own views. He agreed with the stand Luther took against the pope.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=22}}</ref> Like Luther, Zwingli was also a student and admirer of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=17}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nZwingli enjoyed music and could play several instruments, including the [[violin]], [[harp]], [[flute]], [[dulcimer]] and [[hunting horn]]. He would sometimes amuse the children of his congregation on his [[lute]] and was so well known for his playing that his enemies mocked him as \"the evangelical lute-player and fifer\". <!-- Aber der gute Zwingli pfiff darauf. ;) --> Three of Zwingli's ''[[Lied]]er'' or hymns have been preserved: the ''Pestlied'' mentioned above, an adaptation of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 65 (c. 1525), and the ''Kappeler Lied'', which is believed to have been composed during the campaign of the first war of Kappel (1529).<ref>Hannes Reimann, ''Huldrych Zwingli \u2013 der Musiker'', ''[[Archiv f\u00fcr Musikwissenschaft]]'' 17 2./3. (1960), pp. 126\u2013141</ref> These songs were not meant to be sung during worship services and are not identified as hymns of the Reformation, though they were published in some 16th-century hymnals.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=108}}</ref>\n\nZwingli criticised the practice of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices under the rubric of \"prayer\". He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches. Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship.<ref>Leith, John H, ''Introduction to the Reformed Tradition'', Westminster John Knox Press, {{ISBN|0-8042-0479-9}} pp. 210\u2013211</ref> The organist of the People's Church in Z\u00fcrich is recorded as weeping upon seeing the great organ broken up.<ref name=\"Chadwick439\">Chadwick, Owen, ''The Reformation'', Penguin, 1990, p. 439</ref> Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, \"The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer&nbsp;... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs\". Locher goes on to say that \"Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing. In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative\". Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: \"The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'\u2014'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned\".<ref name=\"zwinglis thought\">{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|pp=61\u201362}}</ref>\n\nToday's [[Musikabteilung]] (literally: music departement), located in the choir of the [[Predigerkirche Z\u00fcrich|''Predigern'' church in Z\u00fcrich]] was founded in 1971, and forms a scientific music collection of European importance. It publishes the materials entrusted to it at irregular intervals as CDs.

Bullinger immediately removed any doubts about Zwingli's orthodoxy and defended him as a prophet and a martyr. During Bullinger's ascendancy, the confessional divisions of the Swiss Confederation stabilised.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp= 157\u2013158}}</ref> Bullinger rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them to recover from the defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms; Bullinger consolidated and refined them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinmetz|2001|p= 98}}</ref>\n\nScholars have found it difficult to assess Zwingli's impact on history, for several reasons. There is no consensus on the definition of \"Zwinglianism\"; by any definition, Zwinglianism evolved under his successor, Heinrich Bullinger; and research into Zwingli's influence on Bullinger and [[John Calvin]] remains rudimentary.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp= 155\u2013156}}</ref> Bullinger adopted most of Zwingli's points of doctrine. Like Zwingli, he summarised his theology several times, the best-known example being the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] of 1566. Meanwhile, Calvin had taken over the Reformation in [[Geneva]].<ref name=\"Geneva Before Calvin\">{{cite journal|last= Foster|first= Herbert Darling|title= Geneva Before Calvin (1387\u20131536).

In 1549, however, Bullinger and Calvin succeeded in overcoming the differences in doctrine and produced the ''[[Consensus Tigurinus]]'' (Z\u00fcrich Consensus). They declared that the eucharist was not just symbolic of the meal, but they also rejected the Lutheran position that the body and blood of Christ is in [[Sacramental union|union with the elements]]. With this rapprochement, Calvin established his role in the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]es and eventually in the wider world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Furcha|1985|pp= 179\u2013195}}, J. C.

In his enrolment in the University of Vienna (1500), he still latinised his name as ''Udalricus Zwingling de [[Lichtensteig]]'' ({{Harvnb|Jackson|1900|p=57}}).\nHis signature at the Marburg Colloquy (1529) was ''Huldrychus Zwinglius''  ({{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}; Schuler, Schultess (eds.), ''Huldrici Zuinglii opera'', 1830, p. 55). \nModern literature uses either \"Ulrich\" or \"Huldrych\" (e.g. [[George Richard Potter|Potter]] uses \"Ulrich\", while G\u00e4bler, Stephens, and Furcha use \"Huldrych\").}} (1 January 1484&nbsp;\u2013 11 October 1531) was a leader of the [[Reformation in Switzerland]], born during a time of emerging Swiss patriotism and increasing criticism of the [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss mercenary system]]. He attended the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Basel]], a scholarly center of [[Renaissance humanism]]. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in [[Glarus]] and later in [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]], where he was influenced by the writings of [[Erasmus]].\n\nIn 1519, Zwingli became the pastor of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] where he began to preach ideas on reform of the Catholic Church. In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|custom of fasting]] during [[Lent]]. In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of images in places of worship. In 1525, he introduced a new communion liturgy to replace the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. He also clashed with the [[Anabaptists]], which resulted in their persecution. Historians have debated whether or not he turned Z\u00fcrich into a theocracy.<ref>Robert Walton, ''Zwingli's Theocracy'' (Toronto University Press. 1967).</ref>\n\nThe Reformation spread to other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] resisted, preferring to remain [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war was averted at the last moment between the two sides. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of [[Martin Luther]] and other reformers. They met at the [[Marburg Colloquy]] and agreed on many points of doctrine, but they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the [[Real Presence|Real Presence of Christ]] in the [[Eucharist]].\n\nIn 1531, Zwingli's alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons. The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Z\u00fcrich was ill-prepared, and Zwingli died on the battlefield. His legacy lives on in the [[Reformed Christian confessions of faith|confessions]], liturgy, and church orders of the [[Reformed churches]] of today.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:Historische Karte CH 1515.png|thumb|right|260px|Map of the Swiss Confederation in 1515]]\nThe [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] in Huldrych Zwingli's time consisted of thirteen states ([[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]) as well as affiliated areas and common lordships. Unlike the modern state of [[Switzerland]], which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served as the basis for conflict during the time of the Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]] of 1440\u20131446.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=1\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe wider political environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries the relationship with the Confederation's powerful neighbour, France, determined the foreign policies of the Swiss. Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the [[Swabian War]] in 1499, the Confederation had become ''de facto'' independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the [[Duchy of Milan]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and the [[Papal States]] competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the [[Swiss mercenaries|mercenary pension system]] became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThese internal and external factors contributed to the rise of a Confederation national consciousness, in which the term ''fatherland'' ({{lang-la |patria}}) began to take on meaning beyond a reference to an individual canton. At the same time, [[Renaissance humanism]], with its universal values and emphasis on scholarship (as exemplified by [[Erasmus]] (1466\u20131536), the \"prince of humanism\"), had taken root in the Confederation. Within this environment, defined by the confluence of Swiss [[patriotism]] and humanism, Zwingli was born in 1484.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years (1484\u20131518)===\n[[File:Geburtshaus von Huldrych Zwingli.jpg|thumb|right|260px|House where Zwingli was born in [[Wildhaus]] in what is now the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]]]\nHuldrych Zwingli was born on 1 January 1484 in [[Wildhaus]], in the [[Toggenburg]] valley of [[Switzerland]], to a family of farmers, the third child of nine. His father, Ulrich, played a leading role in the administration of the community (''[[Amtmann]]'' or chief local magistrate).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=6}}</ref> Zwingli's primary schooling was provided by his uncle, Bartholomew, a cleric in [[Weesen]], where he probably met [[Katharina von Zimmern]].<ref name=\"katharina\">{{cite web|url=http://frauen-und-reformation.de/?s=bio&id=93|title=Katharina von Zimmern|publisher=frauen-und-reformation.de|author=|date=|accessdate=25 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331123825/http://www.frauen-und-reformation.de/?s=bio&id=93|archive-date=31 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> At ten years old, Zwingli was sent to [[Basel]] to obtain his secondary education where he learned [[Latin language|Latin]] under Magistrate Gregory B\u00fcnzli. After three years in Basel, he stayed a short time in [[Bern]] with the humanist, Henry W\u00f6lfflin. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in Bern tried to persuade Zwingli to join their order and it is possible that he was received as a novice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}. Potter mentions this possibility. G\u00e4bler states that Zwingli did not refute later claims by opponents that he had been a monk in Bern.</ref> However, his father and uncle disapproved of such a course and he left Bern without completing his Latin studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}</ref> He enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]] in the winter semester of 1498 but was expelled, according to the university's records. However, it is not certain that Zwingli was indeed expelled, and he re-enrolled in the summer semester of 1500; his activities in 1499 are unknown.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=25}}. The word ''exclusus'' (expelled) was added to his matriculation entry. G\u00e4bler notes that without a date and reason, it does not conform to what was customary at the time.</ref> Zwingli continued his studies in Vienna until 1502, after which he transferred to the [[University of Basel]] where he received the Master of Arts degree (''Magister'') in 1506.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=26}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was ordained in [[Constance]], the seat of the local diocese, and he celebrated his first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not considered unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of [[Glarus]], where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly on the side of the [[Holy See|Roman See]]. In return, [[Pope Julius II]] honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]] in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the [[Battle of Marignano]] caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] in the [[canton of Schwyz]]. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as ''The Ox'' (1510) and ''The Labyrinth'' (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=8}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=35, 37}}</ref> Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=29\u201333}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=22\u201340}}</ref>\n\nZwingli's time as the pastor of Glarus and Einsiedeln was characterized by inner growth and development. He perfected his [[Greek language|Greek]] and he took up the study of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which he was able to draw upon [[Classics|classical]], [[patristic]], and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative [[pacifism]] and his focus on preaching can be traced to the influence of Erasmus.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=33\u201341}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1518, the post of the ''Leutpriestertum'' (people's priest) of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] at [[Z\u00fcrich]] became vacant. The [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the foundation that administered the Grossm\u00fcnster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, his opposition to the French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Z\u00fcrich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=43\u201344}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich ministry begins (1519\u20131521)===\n[[File:Prozessionsachse murerplan.jpg|thumb|right|The Grossm\u00fcnster in the centre of the medieval town of Z\u00fcrich ([[Murerplan]], 1576)]]\nOn 1 January 1519, Zwingli gave his first sermon in Z\u00fcrich. Deviating from the prevalent practice of basing a sermon on the Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using [[Erasmus]]' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the [[Gospel of Matthew]], giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of ''[[lectio continua]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Old|1998|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays until he reached the end and then proceeded in the same manner with the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the New Testament [[epistles]], and finally the [[Old Testament]]. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor [[Lutheran]]. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=44\u201345}}</ref> One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Oskar Farner and Walther K\u00f6hler.</ref> Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Arthur Rich and Cornelius Augustijn.</ref> A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=46\u201347}}. A proponent of this view is Gottfried W. Locher.</ref>\n\nZwingli's theological stance was gradually revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption and in the process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the [[veneration]] of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of [[excommunication]]. His attack on the claim that [[Tithe|tithing]] was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=50}}</ref> This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the [[Sola scriptura|sole basis of his teachings was Scripture]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=66}}</ref>\n\nWithin the [[Bishopric of Constance|diocese of Constance]], Bernhardin Sanson was offering a special [[indulgence]] for contributors to the building of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] in Rome. When Sanson arrived at the gates of Z\u00fcrich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after [[Martin Luther]] published his [[Ninety-five theses]] (31 October 1517).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=XII}}</ref> The council of Z\u00fcrich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=44, 66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1519, Z\u00fcrich was struck by an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during which at least one in four persons died. All of those who could afford it left the city, but Zwingli remained and continued his pastoral duties. In September, he caught the disease and nearly died. He described his preparation for death in a poem, Zwingli's ''Pestlied'', consisting of three parts: the onset of the illness, the closeness to death, and the joy of recovery. The final verses of the first part read:<ref>see e.g. {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=69\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n:''Thuo, wie du wilt;''\n:''mich n\u00fct befilt.''\n:''Din haf bin ich.''\n:''Mach gantz ald brich;''\n:''dann nimpst mich hin''\n:''der geiste min von diser Erd,''\n:''thuost du's, dass er nit b\u00f6ser werd,''\n:''ald anderen nit''\n:''befleck ir l\u00e4ben fromm und sit.

When a vacancy occurred among the canons of the Grossm\u00fcnster, Zwingli was elected to fulfill that vacancy on 29 April 1521. In becoming a canon, he became a full citizen of Z\u00fcrich. He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossm\u00fcnster.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=51}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=73}}</ref>\n\n===First rifts (1522\u20131524)===\nThe first public controversy regarding Zwingli's preaching broke out during the season of [[Lent]] in 1522. On the first fasting Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the ''Wurstessen'' in [[Christoph Froschauer]]'s workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title ''Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen'' (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food can be derived from the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin. The event, which came to be referred to as the [[Affair of the Sausages]], is considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland.<ref name=\"Janz2008\">{{cite book|author=Denis Janz|title=A Reformation reader: primary texts with introductions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJWyDNATVwcC&pg=PA183|accessdate=15 January 2012|year=2008|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-6310-0|page=183}}</ref> Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Z\u00fcrich. The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossm\u00fcnster and city council and repeating the traditional position.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=52\u201356}}</ref>\n\nFollowing this event, Zwingli and other humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July to abolish the requirement of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as ''Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen'' (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, [[Anna Reinhart]], earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, three months before the birth of their first child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=80}}</ref> They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Z\u00fcrich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, ''Apologeticus Archeteles'' (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich disputations (1523)===\n[[File:Switzerland Z\u00fcrich Grossm\u00fcnster Zwingli M\u00fcnch 1935.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Relief]] of Zwingli preaching at the pulpit, [[Otto M\u00fcnch]], 1935]]\nThe events of 1522 brought no clarification on the issues. Not only did the unrest between Z\u00fcrich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Z\u00fcrich's Confederation partners in the [[Tagsatzung|Swiss Diet]]. On 22 December, the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Z\u00fcrich. The city council felt obliged to take the initiative and find its own solution.\n\n====First Disputation====\nOn 3 January 1523, the Z\u00fcrich city council invited the clergy of the city and outlying region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a decision on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Z\u00fcrich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=63\u201365}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=97\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nThe meeting attracted a large crowd of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his [[vicar general]], [[Johann Faber|Johannes Fabri]]. Zwingli summarised his position in the ''Schlussreden'' (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=99}}</ref><ref>The Sixty-seven Articles are contained in [https://archive.org/details/selectedworksofh00zwin ''Selected Works of Huldreich Zwingli'', Philadelphia, 1901], pp.&nbsp;111\u2013117.

The decision of the council was that Zwingli would be allowed to continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=67\u201371}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=100\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n====Second Disputation====\nIn September 1523, [[Leo Jud]], Zwingli's closest friend and colleague and pastor of [[St. Peter, Z\u00fcrich|St. Peterskirche]], publicly called for the removal of statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Z\u00fcrich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Z\u00fcrich, the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur|Chur]] and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=72, 76\u201377}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nZwingli again took the lead in the disputation. His opponent was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing [[infant baptism]] with [[Credobaptism|adult baptism]]. This group was led by [[Conrad Grebel]], one of the initiators of the [[Anabaptist]] movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led to the question of whether the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from [[Aargau]] and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, ''Kurze, christliche Einleitung'' (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=78\u201381}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\n===Reformation progresses in Z\u00fcrich (1524\u20131525)===\n[[File:Zue Grossmuenster 06.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Above the entrance to the Grossm\u00fcnster doors is inscribed Matthew 11:28, \"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\"]]\nIn December 1523, the council set a deadline of [[Pentecost]] in 1524 for a solution to the elimination of the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in ''Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe'' (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Z\u00fcrich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of the effect of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. [[Candlemas]] was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on [[Palm Sunday]] to the [[Lindenhof]], and [[triptych]]s remained covered and closed after [[Lent]].<ref name=\"Potter138\">{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=138}}</ref> Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=82\u201383}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the council had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the decrease in the exercise of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in ''Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls'' (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before [[Easter]], Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On [[Maundy Thursday]], 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was the focal point of the service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref>\n\nFor some time Zwingli had accused [[mendicant]] orders of hypocrisy and demanded their abolition in order to support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossm\u00fcnster and [[Fraum\u00fcnster]] and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraum\u00fcnster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance [[Katharina von Zimmern]]) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the ''Prophezei'' (Prophecy) or [[Carolinum, Z\u00fcrich|''Carolinum'']], at the Grossm\u00fcnster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The [[Z\u00fcrich Bible]] translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by [[Christoph Froschauer]], bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school.<ref>According to {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=102}}, the first complete Bible was printed in 1531. Other sources say 1529 or 1530. See {{Harvnb|Estep|1986|p=96}} and {{Harvnb|Greenslade|1975|p=106}}. Early editions were called the Froschauer Bible, see {{Harvnb|Chadwick|2001|p=35}}.</ref> Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=97\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n===Conflict with the Anabaptists (1525\u20131527)===\nShortly after the second Z\u00fcrich disputation, many in the [[Radical Reformation|radical wing of the Reformation]] became convinced that Zwingli was making too many concessions to the Z\u00fcrich council. They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful. [[Conrad Grebel]], the leader of the radicals and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private. On 15 August 1524 the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants. Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel's group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions. When talks were broken off, Zwingli published ''Wer Ursache gebe zu Aufruhr'' (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing points-of-view.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> On 17 January 1525 a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli. Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Z\u00fcrich. The radicals ignored these measures and on 21 January, they met at the house of the mother of another radical leader, [[Felix Manz]]. Grebel and a third leader, [[George Blaurock]], performed the first recorded Anabaptist [[Credobaptism|adult baptisms]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=177\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 February, the council repeated the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some who failed to comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Z\u00fcrich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread to other parts of the Confederation as well as a number of [[Swabia]]n towns. On 6\u20138 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossm\u00fcnster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious exchange of views as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=183\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Z\u00fcrich council decided that no compromise was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate that no one shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=187}}</ref> Although Zwingli, technically, had nothing to do with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Z\u00fcrich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the [[Limmat]]. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=186\u2013188}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=John|title=The Reformation and the Anabaptists: Steps to Reconciliation, 26 June, 2004, Zurich, Switzerland|publisher=Mennonite Historical Committee|date=July 2004|url=http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324075102/http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archivedate=24 March 2012|accessdate=23 December 2012}} The descendants of the Zwinglian Reformation, the Reformed Church of Z\u00fcrich, and the descendants of the Anabaptist movement ([[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]]) held a Reconciliation Conference at the Grossm\u00fcnster on 26 June 2004. This link includes the conference program, and all statements made at that conference.</ref>\n\n===Reformation in the Confederation (1526\u20131528)===\n{{further|Swiss Reformation}}\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli Denkmal - Wasserkirche - Limmatquai 2011-08-10 11-47-50.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Statue of Zwingli in front of the ''[[Wasserkirche]]'' church in Z\u00fcrich]]\nOn 8 April 1524, five cantons, [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], formed an alliance, ''die f\u00fcnf Orte'' (the Five States) to defend themselves from Zwingli's Reformation.<ref name=\"Potter138\" /> They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including [[John Eck]], who had debated Luther in the [[Leipzig Disputation]] of 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on the selection of the judging authority, the location of the debate, and the use of the Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]]. Although Z\u00fcrich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] of Basel, a theologian from [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], and [[Appenzell]] as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Basel|Basel]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], and [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]] supported him.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nThe Baden disputation exposed a deep rift in the Confederation on matters of religion. The Reformation was now emerging in other states. The city of [[St Gallen]], an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, [[Joachim Vadian]], and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Z\u00fcrich. In Basel, although Zwingli had a close relationship with Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any reformatory changes until 1 April 1529 when the mass was prohibited. Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Z\u00fcrich's example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529. In the case of Bern, [[Berchtold Haller]], the priest at [[M\u00fcnster of Berne|St Vincent M\u00fcnster]], and [[Niklaus Manuel]], the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause. But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation. Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Wolfgang Capito]] from [[Strasbourg]], [[Ambrosius Blarer]] from [[Konstanz|Constance]], and [[Andreas Althamer]] from [[Nuremberg]]. Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives. The meeting started on 6 January 1528 and lasted nearly three weeks. Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the M\u00fcnster. On 7 February 1528 the council decreed that the Reformation be established in Bern.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=113\u2013119}}</ref>\n\n===First Kappel War (1529)===\n{{Further|First war of Kappel}}\nEven before the Bern disputation, Zwingli was canvassing for an alliance of reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, ''das Christliche [[Burgrecht]]'' (the Christian Civic Union) was created.<ref>{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|p=109}}. Potter also translates ''Burgrecht'' as \"Civic Union\", while {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=119}} translates it as \"Fortress Law\".</ref> The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Z\u00fcrich on 5\u20136 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, [[Biel]], [[M\u00fclhausen]], Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed ''die Christliche Vereinigung'' (the Christian Alliance) with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] on 22 April 1529.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=352\u2013355}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bild Zwingli Asper.jpg|thumb|left|1549 painting by [[Hans Asper]]]]\nSoon after the Austrian treaty was signed, a reformed preacher, Jacob Kaiser, was captured in [[Uznach]] and executed in Schwyz. This triggered a strong reaction from Zwingli; he drafted ''Ratschlag \u00fcber den Krieg'' (Advice About the War) for the government. He outlined justifications for an attack on the Catholic states and other measures to be taken. Before Z\u00fcrich could implement his plans, a delegation from Bern that included Niklaus Manuel arrived in Z\u00fcrich. The delegation called on Z\u00fcrich to settle the matter peacefully. Manuel added that an attack would expose Bern to further dangers as Catholic [[Valais]] and the Duchy of Savoy bordered its southern flank. He then noted, \"You cannot really bring faith by means of spears and halberds.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=364}}. In [[Early Modern German]], \"Warlich man mag mit spiess und halberten den glouben nit ingeben.\"</ref> Z\u00fcrich, however, decided that it would act alone, knowing that Bern would be obliged to acquiesce. War was declared on 8 June 1529. Z\u00fcrich was able to raise an army of 30,000 men. The Five States were abandoned by Austria and could raise only 9,000 men. The two forces met near [[Kappel am Albis|Kappel]], but war was averted due to the intervention of Hans Aebli, a relative of Zwingli, who pleaded for an armistice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=362\u2013367}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was obliged to state the terms of the armistice. He demanded the dissolution of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Z\u00fcrich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=367\u2013369}}</ref> The first Land Peace of Kappel, ''der erste [[Landfriede]]'', ended the war on 24 June.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=371}}</ref>\n\n===Marburg Colloquy (1529)===\n{{Further|Marburg Colloquy}}\n[[File:Marburger-Religionsgespr\u00e4ch.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coloured [[woodcut]] of the Marburg Colloquy, anonymous, 1557]]\nWhile Zwingli carried on the political work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on the interpretation of the [[eucharist]] originated when [[Andreas Karlstadt]], Luther's former colleague from [[Wittenberg]], published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a [[real presence]] in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including ''de Eucharistia'' (On the Eucharist). Understanding that Christ had ascended to heaven and was sitting at the Father's right hand, Zwingli criticized the idea that Christ's humanity could be in two places at once. Unlike his divinity, Christ's human body was not omnipresent and so could not be in heaven and at the same time be present in the elements. Timothy George, evangelical author, editor of Christianity Today and professor of Historical Theology at Beeson Divinity School at Samford University, has firmly refuted a long-standing misreading of Zwingli that erroneously claimed the Reformer denied all notions of real presence and believed in a memorial view of the Supper, where it was purely symbolic.<ref name=\"George, Timothy pp. 157-158\">George, Timothy. Theology of the Reformers (pp. 157-158). B&H Publishing Group.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nBy spring 1527, Luther reacted strongly to Zwingli's views in the treatise ''Dass Diese Worte Christi \"Das ist mein Leib etc.\" noch fest stehen wider die Schwarmgeister'' (That These Words of Christ \"This is My Body etc.\" Still Stand Firm Against the Fanatics). The controversy continued until 1528 when efforts to build bridges between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian views began. [[Martin Butzer|Martin Bucer]] tried to mediate while [[Philip of Hesse]], who wanted to form a political coalition of all Protestant forces, invited the two parties to [[Marburg]] to discuss their differences. This event became known as the [[Marburg Colloquy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nZwingli accepted Philip's invitation fully believing that he would be able to convince Luther. In contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529, with Luther and [[Philipp Melanchthon]] arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, [[Andreas Osiander]], [[Johannes Brenz]], and [[Justus Jonas]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}</ref> The debates were held from 1\u20134 October and the results were published in the fifteen ''Marburg Articles''. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=136\u2013138}}</ref> Professor George summarized the incompatible views, \"On this issue, they parted without having reached an agreement. Both Luther and Zwingli agreed that the bread in the Supper was a sign. For Luther, however, that which the bread signified, namely the body of Christ, was present \u201cin, with, and under\u201d the sign itself. For Zwingli, though, sign and thing signified were separated by a distance\u2014the width between heaven and earth.\"<ref>George, Timothy. Theology of the Reformers (p. 156). B&H Publishing Group.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=\"Luther claimed that the body of Christ was not eaten in a gross, material way but rather in some mysterious way, which is beyond human understanding. Yet, Zwingli replied, if the words were taken in their literal sense, the body had to be eaten in the most grossly material way. \u201cFor this is the meaning they carry: this bread is that body of mine which is given for you. It was given for us in grossly material form, subject to wounds, blows and death. As such, therefore, it must be the material of the supper.\u201d Indeed, to press the literal meaning of the text even farther, it follows that Christ would have again to suffer pain, as his body was broken again\u2014this time by the teeth of communicants. Even more absurdly, Christ\u2019s body would have to be swallowed, digested, even eliminated through the bowels! Such thoughts were repulsive to Zwingli. They smacked of cannibalism on the one hand and of the pagan mystery religions on the other. The main issue for Zwingli, however, was not the irrationality or exegetical fallacy of Luther\u2019s views. It was rather that Luther put \u201cthe chief point of salvation in physically eating the body of Christ,\u201d for he connected it with the forgiveness of sins. The same motive that had moved Zwingli so strongly to oppose images, the invocation of saints, and baptismal regeneration was present also in the struggle over the Supper: the fear of idolatry. Salvation was by Christ alone, through faith alone, not through faith and bread. The object of faith was that which is not seen (Heb 11:1) and which therefore cannot be eaten except, again, in a nonliteral, figurative sense. \u201cCredere est edere,\u201d said Zwingli: \u201cTo believe is to eat.\u201d To eat the body and to drink the blood of Christ in the Supper, then, simply meant to have the body and blood of Christ present in the mind.\"<ref name=\"George, Timothy pp. 157-158\">George, Timothy.

He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States. Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=141\u2013143}}</ref>\n\nAs Zwingli was working on establishing these political alliances, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the [[Augsburg Diet]] to present their views so that he could make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the [[Augsburg Confession]]. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, [[Memmingen]], and [[Lindau]] produced the [[Tetrapolitan Confession]]. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the ''Burgrecht'' cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, ''Fidei ratio'' (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the [[Apostles' Creed]]. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, [[Johann Eck]], counter-attacked with a publication, ''Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor''.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=143\u2013146}}</ref>\n\nWhen Philip of Hesse formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] at the end of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined on the basis of a Lutheran interpretation of that confession. Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed. The ''Burgrecht'' cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=148}}</ref>\n\nThe peace treaty of the First Kappel War did not define the right of unhindered preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The ''Burgrecht'' cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Z\u00fcrich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated an attack on the Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Z\u00fcrich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Z\u00fcrich urged its continuation and the ''Burgrecht'' cities began to quarrel among themselves.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=148\u2013150}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 October 1531, in a surprise move, the Five States declared war on Z\u00fcrich. Z\u00fcrich's mobilisation was slow due to internal squabbling and on 11 October, 3500 poorly deployed men encountered a Five States force nearly double their size near Kappel. Many pastors, including Zwingli, were among the soldiers. The battle lasted less than one hour and Zwingli was among the 500 casualties in the Z\u00fcrich army.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=150\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nZwingli had considered himself first and foremost a soldier of Christ; second a defender of his country, the Confederation; and third a leader of his city, Z\u00fcrich, where he had lived for the previous twelve years. Ironically, he died at the age of 47, not for Christ nor for the Confederation, but for Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=414}}</ref>  \n  \nIn Tabletalk, Luther is recorded saying: \"They say that Zwingli recently died thus; if his error had prevailed, we would have perished, and our church with us. It was a judgment of God. That was always a proud people. The others, the papists, will probably also be dealt with by our Lord God.\"<ref>Luther Works Tabletalk No. 94: God\u2019s Punishment of the Godless (Early November 1531)</ref> Erasmus wrote, \"We are freed from great fear by the death of the two preachers, Zwingli and [[Oecolampadius]], whose fate has wrought an incredible change in the mind of many.  This is the wonderful hand of God on high.\"  Oecolampadius had died on 24 November.  Erasmus also wrote, \"If [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] had favoured them, it would have been all over with us.\"<ref>[[Philip Hughes (historian)|Philip Hughes]] (1957), ''A Popular History of the Reformation'', 1960 reprint, Garden City, NY:  Image Books, Ch. 4, \"Luther.

Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. He placed its authority above other sources such as the [[ecumenical councils]] or the [[Church Fathers]], although he did not hesitate to use other sources to support his arguments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his rationalist humanist education and his Reformed understanding of the Bible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=59}}</ref> He rejected literalist interpretations of a passage, such as those of the Anabaptists, and used [[synecdoche]] <ref>{{citation|last=Yoder|first=John Howard|title=Anabaptism and Reformation in Switzerland: An Historical and Theological Analysis of the Dialogues Between Anabaptists and Reformers|publication-place=Kitchener, Ontario|pages=197\u2013202|year=2004|publisher=Pandora Press|isbn=1-894710-44-4}}</ref> and analogies, methods he describes in ''A Friendly Exegesis'' (1527). Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and [[circumcision]] and between the eucharist and [[Passover]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=64\u201366}}</ref> He also paid attention to the immediate context and attempted to understand the purpose behind it, comparing passages of scripture with each other.\n\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|A rendition of Huldrych Zwingli from the 1906 edition of the ''[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]'']]\nZwingli rejected the word ''sacrament'' in the popular usage of his time. For ordinary people, the word meant some kind of holy action of which there is inherent power to free the conscience from sin. For Zwingli, a sacrament was an initiatory ceremony or a pledge, pointing out that the word was derived from ''sacramentum'' meaning an oath.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=180\u2013185}}</ref> (However, the word is also translated \"mystery\".) In his early writings on baptism, he noted that baptism was an example of such a pledge. He challenged Catholics by accusing them of superstition when they ascribed the water of baptism a certain power to wash away sin. Later, in his conflict with the Anabaptists, he defended the practice of infant baptism, noting that there is no law forbidding the practice. He argued that baptism was a sign of a covenant with God, thereby replacing circumcision in the Old Testament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=194\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nZwingli approached the eucharist in a similar manner to baptism. During the first Z\u00fcrich disputation in 1523, he denied that an actual sacrifice occurred during the mass, arguing that Christ made the sacrifice only once and for all eternity. Hence, the eucharist was \"a memorial of the sacrifice\".<ref>''Huldreich Zwinglis Samtliche Werke'', Vol. I, 460.6\u201310, as quoted in {{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=219}}</ref> Following this argument, he further developed his view, coming to the conclusion of the \"signifies\" interpretation for the words of the institution. He used various passages of scripture to argue against [[transubstantiation]] as well as Luther's views, the key text being John 6:63, \"It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh is of no avail\". Zwingli's approach and interpretation of scripture to understand the meaning of the eucharist was one reason he could not reach a consensus with Luther.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=218\u2013250}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of Luther on Zwingli's theological development has long been a source of interest and discussion among Lutheran scholars, who seek to firmly establish Luther as the first Reformer. Zwingli himself asserted vigorously his independence of Luther and the most recent studies have lent credibility to this claim. Zwingli appears to have read Luther's books in search of confirmation from Luther for his own views. He agreed with the stand Luther took against the pope.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=22}}</ref> Like Luther, Zwingli was also a student and admirer of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=17}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nZwingli enjoyed music and could play several instruments, including the [[violin]], [[harp]], [[flute]], [[dulcimer]] and [[hunting horn]]. He would sometimes amuse the children of his congregation on his [[lute]] and was so well known for his playing that his enemies mocked him as \"the evangelical lute-player and fifer\". <!-- Aber der gute Zwingli pfiff darauf. ;) --> Three of Zwingli's ''[[Lied]]er'' or hymns have been preserved: the ''Pestlied'' mentioned above, an adaptation of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 65 (c. 1525), and the ''Kappeler Lied'', which is believed to have been composed during the campaign of the first war of Kappel (1529).<ref>Hannes Reimann, ''Huldrych Zwingli \u2013 der Musiker'', ''[[Archiv f\u00fcr Musikwissenschaft]]'' 17 2./3. (1960), pp. 126\u2013141</ref> These songs were not meant to be sung during worship services and are not identified as hymns of the Reformation, though they were published in some 16th-century hymnals.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=108}}</ref>\n\nZwingli criticised the practice of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices under the rubric of \"prayer\". He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches. Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship.<ref>Leith, John H, ''Introduction to the Reformed Tradition'', Westminster John Knox Press, {{ISBN|0-8042-0479-9}} pp. 210\u2013211</ref> The organist of the People's Church in Z\u00fcrich is recorded as weeping upon seeing the great organ broken up.<ref name=\"Chadwick439\">Chadwick, Owen, ''The Reformation'', Penguin, 1990, p. 439</ref> Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, \"The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer&nbsp;... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs\". Locher goes on to say that \"Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing. In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative\". Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: \"The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'\u2014'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned\".<ref name=\"zwinglis thought\">{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|pp=61\u201362}}</ref>\n\nToday's [[Musikabteilung]] (literally: music departement), located in the choir of the [[Predigerkirche Z\u00fcrich|''Predigern'' church in Z\u00fcrich]] was founded in 1971, and forms a scientific music collection of European importance. It publishes the materials entrusted to it at irregular intervals as CDs.

Bullinger immediately removed any doubts about Zwingli's orthodoxy and defended him as a prophet and a martyr. During Bullinger's ascendancy, the confessional divisions of the Swiss Confederation stabilised.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp= 157\u2013158}}</ref> Bullinger rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them to recover from the defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms; Bullinger consolidated and refined them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinmetz|2001|p= 98}}</ref>\n\nScholars have found it difficult to assess Zwingli's impact on history, for several reasons. There is no consensus on the definition of \"Zwinglianism\"; by any definition, Zwinglianism evolved under his successor, Heinrich Bullinger; and research into Zwingli's influence on Bullinger and [[John Calvin]] remains rudimentary.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp= 155\u2013156}}</ref> Bullinger adopted most of Zwingli's points of doctrine. Like Zwingli, he summarised his theology several times, the best-known example being the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] of 1566. Meanwhile, Calvin had taken over the Reformation in [[Geneva]].<ref name=\"Geneva Before Calvin\">{{cite journal|last= Foster|first= Herbert Darling|title= Geneva Before Calvin (1387\u20131536).

In 1549, however, Bullinger and Calvin succeeded in overcoming the differences in doctrine and produced the ''[[Consensus Tigurinus]]'' (Z\u00fcrich Consensus). They declared that the eucharist was not just symbolic of the meal, but they also rejected the Lutheran position that the body and blood of Christ is in [[Sacramental union|union with the elements]]. With this rapprochement, Calvin established his role in the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]es and eventually in the wider world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Furcha|1985|pp= 179\u2013195}}, J. C.

Rowling]] and the seventh and final novel of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. It was released on 21 July 2007 in the United Kingdom by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], in the United States by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], and in Canada by [[Raincoast Books]]. The novel chronicles the events directly following ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' (2005) and the final confrontation between the wizards [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\n''Deathly Hallows'' shattered sales records upon release, surpassing marks set by previous titles of the ''Harry Potter'' series. It holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for most novels sold within 24 hours of release, with 8.3 million sold in the US and 2.65 million in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/22cnd-potter.html|title=Record First-Day Sales for Last \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Book|work=The New York Times|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=15 December 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216034954/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/22cnd-potter.html|archivedate=16 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Guinness Book of World Records\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Fastestsellingbook-of-fiction-in-24-hours/53237.htm|title=Fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours|work=Guinness Book of World Records|date=21 July 2007|accessdate=5 February 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919082714/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Fastestsellingbook-of-fiction-in-24-hours/53237.htm|archivedate=19 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Generally well received by critics, the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and the American Library Association named it the \"Best Book for Young Adults\". A film adaptation of the novel was released in two parts: ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' in November 2010 and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2|Part 2]]'' in July 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Background===\nThroughout the six previous novels in the [[Harry Potter|series]], the main character [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] has struggled with the difficulties of adolescence along with being famous as the only person ever to survive the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]], Avada Kedavra. What the wizarding community found most impressive was that he was just a baby when this curse was inflicted. The curse was cast by the evil [[Tom Riddle]], better known as [[Lord Voldemort]], a powerful evil wizard who murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby in the belief this would frustrate a [[prophecy]] that Harry would become his equal. [[Lord Voldemort]] had not heard the full [[prophecy]], so he did not know attacking [[Harry Potter]] would transfer power to him. As an [[orphan]], Harry was placed in the care of his [[Muggle]] (non-magical) relatives [[Petunia Dursley]] and [[Vernon Dursley]].\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|The Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry re-enters the wizarding world at age 11 and enrolls in [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He makes friends with fellow students [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] and is [[mentor]]ed by the school's headmaster, [[Albus Dumbledore]]. He also meets Professor [[Severus Snape]], who intensely dislikes and bullies him. Harry fights Voldemort several times while at school as the wizard tries to regain a physical form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]'', Harry is mysteriously entered in a dangerous magical competition called the Triwizard Tournament, which he discovers is a trap designed to allow the return of Lord Voldemort to full strength. During ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'', Harry and several of his friends face off against Voldemort's [[Death Eaters]], a group of Dark witches and wizards, and narrowly defeat them. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]'', Harry learns that Voldemort has divided his soul into several parts, creating \"[[Horcrux]]es\" from various unknown objects to contain them. In this way, he has ensured his immortality as long as at least one of the Horcruxes still exists.<ref>Rowling (2005), ''et al''. p. 503.</ref> Two of these had already been destroyed: a diary destroyed by Harry in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and a ring destroyed by Dumbledore shortly before the events of ''Half-Blood Prince''. Dumbledore takes Harry along in the attempt to destroy a third Horcrux contained in a [[locket]]. However, the Horcrux had been taken by an unknown wizard, and upon their return, Dumbledore is ambushed and disarmed by [[Draco Malfoy]], although Draco cannot bring himself to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore is subsequently killed by Snape, who finishes what Malfoy started.\n\n===Summary===\nFollowing Albus Dumbledore's death, Voldemort consolidates support and power, including by attempting to take control of the Ministry of Magic. Meanwhile, Harry is about to turn seventeen, at which time he will lose the protection of his home. Members of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] explain the situation to the Dursleys and move them to a new location for protection. Using several of Harry's peers and friends as decoys, the Order plans to move Harry to the Burrow under protection. Due to perceived infiltration of  communication by the Death Eaters, members of the Order decide that Harry must be flown to the Burrow.  However, the Death Eaters have been tipped off about this plan, and the group is attacked upon departure. In the ensuing battle, [[Alastor Moody|\"Mad-Eye\" Moody]] and Hedwig are killed and [[George Weasley]] severely wounded. Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Harry's wand fends him off of its own.\n\nAt the Burrow, Harry, Ron, and Hermione make preparations to abandon Hogwarts and hunt down Voldemort's four remaining [[Horcrux]]es but have few clues as to their identities and locations. They also inherit strange bequests from among Dumbledore's possessions: a [[Golden Snitch]] for Harry, a [[Deluminator]] for Ron, and a book of short tales collectively called [[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]] for Hermione. During Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, the [[Ministry of Magic]] finally falls to Voldemort, with a Death Eater assuming the position of Minister for Magic, and the wedding is attacked by Death Eaters. Harry, Ron, and Hermione flee to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, the family home of [[Sirius Black]] that Harry inherited a year before.all while \n\nHarry and Hermione continue the quest for the Horcruxes, discovering more about Dumbledore's past, including the death of Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the dark wizard [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace, and meet the elderly magical historian Bathilda Bagshot. However, they discover that the real Bathilda has been killed, and it is instead [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] in disguise. The snake attacks, and they barely escape to [[Forest of Dean]], but Harry's wand is damaged beyond repair in the fight. A mysterious silver doe [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] guides Harry to a pond containing the [[Godric Gryffindor's Sword|Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor]], one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes. When Harry tries to recover the sword, the locket Horcrux tries to kill him. Ron, who was guided back to Harry and Hermione by the Deluminator, saves him and destroys the locket using the sword. \n\nHermione identifies in Dumbledore's book a symbol also worn at Bill and Fleur's wedding by [[Xenophilius Lovegood]], the father of fellow Hogwarts student [[Luna Lovegood]]. They visit Xenophilius and are told the symbol represents the mythical [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], three objects from an old [[fairy tale]] titled ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'': the [[Elder Wand]], an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, which is able to summon the dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. After noticing inconsistencies in his behavior, however, the trio realise that Xenophilius is stalling to allow Death Eaters to catch Harry, in exchange for his daughter [[Luna Lovegood]]'s freedom. After a near miss, the three analyze the information provided by Xenophilius. Although Ron and Hermione are skeptical, Harry believes the Hallows are real and suspects Voldemort is hunting the Elder Wand, believing it to be in Dumbledore's possession after defeating Grindelwald. The description of the third Hallow also matches that of his own inherited Invisibility Cloak. \n\nThe trio are captured by Snatchers and taken to [[Malfoy]] Manor. Ron and Harry are imprisoned, and Bellatrix tortures Hermione, believing they stole Gryffindor's sword from her vault at [[Gringotts]]. With the help of [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]] the house-elf, they escape to Bill and Fleur's house along with fellow prisoners Luna Lovegood, wandmaker [[Mr. Ollivander]], Dean Thomas, and the goblin [[Griphook]]. During the escape, [[Peter Pettigrew (character)|Peter Pettigrew]] is strangled by his own silver hand after Harry reminds him of his debts, and Dobby is killed by Bellatrix. At Bill and Fleur's, they devise a plan to break into Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts, believing another Horcrux to be hidden there as well. While there, Harry's suspicions are confirmed when he has a vision of Voldemort breaking open Dumbledore's tomb and stealing the Elder Wand.\nWith Griphook's help, they succeed in breaking in, retrieving Hufflepuff's golden cup, and escape on a dragon that was guarding Bellatrix's vault. In the chaos, Griphook steals the Sword of Gryffindor from them. Harry has another vision of Voldemort and sees that Voldemort now understands their plan and intends to protect the Horcruxes even further but also confirms the unidentified Horcrux is at Hogwarts.\n\nThey enter the school through a secret entrance in the [[Hog's Head]], a bar in [[Hogsmeade]] owned by Dumbledore's brother [[Aberforth]]. Harry alerts the teachers that Voldemort is planning an assault on the school, and they mobilize the student body to defend Hogwarts and buy Harry time to locate the Horcrux. After speaking with the ghost of Ravenclaw, Rowena Ravenclaw's daughter, Harry confirms that the Horcrux is Ravenclaw's lost [[diadem]], and he recalls such a diadem being hidden in the [[Room of Requirement]]. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione destroy Hufflepuff's cup with [[basilisk]] fangs taken from the [[Chamber of Secrets]] as Voldemort and his army besiege the castle. They find the diadem but are ambushed by Draco Malfoy and his friends [[Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. Crabbe tries to kill them using Fiendfyre, a cursed fire, but is unable to control it; the fire destroys the diadem and kills Crabbe. Meanwhile, many are killed in the Battle of Hogwarts, including [[Remus Lupin]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Colin Creevey]], and [[Fred Weasley]].\n\nIn his encampment, Voldemort feels the Elder Wand is not performing as he expected. Reasoning that Snape, having killed Dumbledore is the true owner of the Elder Wand, Voldemort murders Snape. Harry arrives as Snape is dying, and Snape passes him memories to view in the [[Pensieve]]. They reveal Snape had a lifelong love for Harry's mother, and despite hating Harry's father, he agreed at Dumbledore's request to act as a [[double agent]] against Voldemort. He had been watching over the trio as they searched for the Horcruxes, conjuring the doe Patronus. It is also revealed that Dumbledore was slowly dying after mishandling the ring Horcrux, and his \"murder\" by Snape was planned to prove Snape's allegiance to Voldemort. The memories also explain that Harry himself is a Horcrux, and therefore he must die at Voldemort's hands if Voldemort is to become mortal, which Voldemort does not know. Harry accepts his death and gives himself up to Voldemort, telling [[Neville Longbottom]] that Voldemort's snake Nagini, another Horcrux, must be killed. On the way, he finally manages to open the Snitch and uses the Resurrection Stone within to seek comfort and courage from his dead loved ones. Voldemort uses the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]], and Harry does not defend himself.\n\nHarry awakens in a dreamlike location resembling [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] and is greeted by Dumbledore. He explains that Voldemort's original Killing Curse left a fragment of Voldemort's soul in Harry, which caused the connection they felt and made Harry an unintended Horcrux. The fragment had been destroyed by the Killing Curse, allowing Harry the choice to return to life or to \"go on.\" Dumbledore also admits some of his mysterious history, in which his friendship with Gellert Grindelwald resulted in the murder of his younger sister Ariana and estrangement from Aberforth. Harry chooses to return to life and feigns death. Voldemort calls for a truce at Hogwarts and displays Harry's body, offering to spare most of the defenders if they surrender. Neville, however, pulls the Sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat and uses it to behead Nagini, leaving Voldemort unprotected by Horcruxes. \n\nHarry escapes under his cloak as the battle resumes. In a final onslaught, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] is killed by [[Molly Weasley]] by using the blast to oblivion spell, and Harry reveals himself to Voldemort. He explains to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Harry also reveals that Snape had never been the Elder Wand's master because Draco Malfoy had disarmed Dumbledore before Snape arrived to kill him, and Harry had disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior. Voldemort attempts one final Killing Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against its true master and the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort. Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his original wand, intending to return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb, where its power will vanish if Harry dies undefeated. However, he plans to keep the Invisibility Cloak he inherited. The wizarding world returns to peace once more.\n\n;Epilogue\nIn an epilogue set in [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] 19 years later, the primary characters are seeing their own children off to Hogwarts. Harry and [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] have three children: [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#James Potter|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], and [[Lily Luna Potter|Lily Luna]]. Ron and Hermione also have two children, [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]]. Harry's godson [[Teddy Lupin]] is found kissing [[Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s daughter [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]]; [[Neville Longbottom]] is now a Hogwarts professor; and [[Draco Malfoy]] and his wife are also at the station to send off their son, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]]. Albus is departing for his first year at Hogwarts and worries he will be placed in Slytherin House.

Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a [[loss leader]]. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even [[Waterstone's]], the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the [[UK Booksellers Association]], said, \"It is a war we can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans.\" Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: \"You are not only lowering the price of the book.

It was released on 21 July 2007 in the United Kingdom by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], in the United States by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], and in Canada by [[Raincoast Books]]. The novel chronicles the events directly following ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' (2005) and the final confrontation between the wizards [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\n''Deathly Hallows'' shattered sales records upon release, surpassing marks set by previous titles of the ''Harry Potter'' series. It holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for most novels sold within 24 hours of release, with 8.3 million sold in the US and 2.65 million in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/22cnd-potter.html|title=Record First-Day Sales for Last \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Book|work=The New York Times|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=15 December 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216034954/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/22cnd-potter.html|archivedate=16 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Guinness Book of World Records\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Fastestsellingbook-of-fiction-in-24-hours/53237.htm|title=Fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours|work=Guinness Book of World Records|date=21 July 2007|accessdate=5 February 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919082714/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Fastestsellingbook-of-fiction-in-24-hours/53237.htm|archivedate=19 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Generally well received by critics, the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and the American Library Association named it the \"Best Book for Young Adults\". A film adaptation of the novel was released in two parts: ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' in November 2010 and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2|Part 2]]'' in July 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Background===\nThroughout the six previous novels in the [[Harry Potter|series]], the main character [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] has struggled with the difficulties of adolescence along with being famous as the only person ever to survive the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]], Avada Kedavra. What the wizarding community found most impressive was that he was just a baby when this curse was inflicted. The curse was cast by the evil [[Tom Riddle]], better known as [[Lord Voldemort]], a powerful evil wizard who murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby in the belief this would frustrate a [[prophecy]] that Harry would become his equal. [[Lord Voldemort]] had not heard the full [[prophecy]], so he did not know attacking [[Harry Potter]] would transfer power to him. As an [[orphan]], Harry was placed in the care of his [[Muggle]] (non-magical) relatives [[Petunia Dursley]] and [[Vernon Dursley]].\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|The Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry re-enters the wizarding world at age 11 and enrolls in [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He makes friends with fellow students [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] and is [[mentor]]ed by the school's headmaster, [[Albus Dumbledore]]. He also meets Professor [[Severus Snape]], who intensely dislikes and bullies him. Harry fights Voldemort several times while at school as the wizard tries to regain a physical form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]'', Harry is mysteriously entered in a dangerous magical competition called the Triwizard Tournament, which he discovers is a trap designed to allow the return of Lord Voldemort to full strength. During ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'', Harry and several of his friends face off against Voldemort's [[Death Eaters]], a group of Dark witches and wizards, and narrowly defeat them. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]'', Harry learns that Voldemort has divided his soul into several parts, creating \"[[Horcrux]]es\" from various unknown objects to contain them. In this way, he has ensured his immortality as long as at least one of the Horcruxes still exists.<ref>Rowling (2005), ''et al''. p. 503.</ref> Two of these had already been destroyed: a diary destroyed by Harry in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and a ring destroyed by Dumbledore shortly before the events of ''Half-Blood Prince''. Dumbledore takes Harry along in the attempt to destroy a third Horcrux contained in a [[locket]]. However, the Horcrux had been taken by an unknown wizard, and upon their return, Dumbledore is ambushed and disarmed by [[Draco Malfoy]], although Draco cannot bring himself to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore is subsequently killed by Snape, who finishes what Malfoy started.\n\n===Summary===\nFollowing Albus Dumbledore's death, Voldemort consolidates support and power, including by attempting to take control of the Ministry of Magic. Meanwhile, Harry is about to turn seventeen, at which time he will lose the protection of his home. Members of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] explain the situation to the Dursleys and move them to a new location for protection. Using several of Harry's peers and friends as decoys, the Order plans to move Harry to the Burrow under protection. Due to perceived infiltration of  communication by the Death Eaters, members of the Order decide that Harry must be flown to the Burrow.  However, the Death Eaters have been tipped off about this plan, and the group is attacked upon departure. In the ensuing battle, [[Alastor Moody|\"Mad-Eye\" Moody]] and Hedwig are killed and [[George Weasley]] severely wounded. Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Harry's wand fends him off of its own.\n\nAt the Burrow, Harry, Ron, and Hermione make preparations to abandon Hogwarts and hunt down Voldemort's four remaining [[Horcrux]]es but have few clues as to their identities and locations. They also inherit strange bequests from among Dumbledore's possessions: a [[Golden Snitch]] for Harry, a [[Deluminator]] for Ron, and a book of short tales collectively called [[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]] for Hermione. During Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, the [[Ministry of Magic]] finally falls to Voldemort, with a Death Eater assuming the position of Minister for Magic, and the wedding is attacked by Death Eaters. Harry, Ron, and Hermione flee to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, the family home of [[Sirius Black]] that Harry inherited a year before.all while \n\nHarry and Hermione continue the quest for the Horcruxes, discovering more about Dumbledore's past, including the death of Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the dark wizard [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace, and meet the elderly magical historian Bathilda Bagshot. However, they discover that the real Bathilda has been killed, and it is instead [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] in disguise. The snake attacks, and they barely escape to [[Forest of Dean]], but Harry's wand is damaged beyond repair in the fight. A mysterious silver doe [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] guides Harry to a pond containing the [[Godric Gryffindor's Sword|Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor]], one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes. When Harry tries to recover the sword, the locket Horcrux tries to kill him. Ron, who was guided back to Harry and Hermione by the Deluminator, saves him and destroys the locket using the sword. \n\nHermione identifies in Dumbledore's book a symbol also worn at Bill and Fleur's wedding by [[Xenophilius Lovegood]], the father of fellow Hogwarts student [[Luna Lovegood]]. They visit Xenophilius and are told the symbol represents the mythical [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], three objects from an old [[fairy tale]] titled ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'': the [[Elder Wand]], an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, which is able to summon the dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. After noticing inconsistencies in his behavior, however, the trio realise that Xenophilius is stalling to allow Death Eaters to catch Harry, in exchange for his daughter [[Luna Lovegood]]'s freedom. After a near miss, the three analyze the information provided by Xenophilius. Although Ron and Hermione are skeptical, Harry believes the Hallows are real and suspects Voldemort is hunting the Elder Wand, believing it to be in Dumbledore's possession after defeating Grindelwald. The description of the third Hallow also matches that of his own inherited Invisibility Cloak. \n\nThe trio are captured by Snatchers and taken to [[Malfoy]] Manor. Ron and Harry are imprisoned, and Bellatrix tortures Hermione, believing they stole Gryffindor's sword from her vault at [[Gringotts]]. With the help of [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]] the house-elf, they escape to Bill and Fleur's house along with fellow prisoners Luna Lovegood, wandmaker [[Mr. Ollivander]], Dean Thomas, and the goblin [[Griphook]]. During the escape, [[Peter Pettigrew (character)|Peter Pettigrew]] is strangled by his own silver hand after Harry reminds him of his debts, and Dobby is killed by Bellatrix. At Bill and Fleur's, they devise a plan to break into Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts, believing another Horcrux to be hidden there as well. While there, Harry's suspicions are confirmed when he has a vision of Voldemort breaking open Dumbledore's tomb and stealing the Elder Wand.\nWith Griphook's help, they succeed in breaking in, retrieving Hufflepuff's golden cup, and escape on a dragon that was guarding Bellatrix's vault. In the chaos, Griphook steals the Sword of Gryffindor from them. Harry has another vision of Voldemort and sees that Voldemort now understands their plan and intends to protect the Horcruxes even further but also confirms the unidentified Horcrux is at Hogwarts.\n\nThey enter the school through a secret entrance in the [[Hog's Head]], a bar in [[Hogsmeade]] owned by Dumbledore's brother [[Aberforth]]. Harry alerts the teachers that Voldemort is planning an assault on the school, and they mobilize the student body to defend Hogwarts and buy Harry time to locate the Horcrux. After speaking with the ghost of Ravenclaw, Rowena Ravenclaw's daughter, Harry confirms that the Horcrux is Ravenclaw's lost [[diadem]], and he recalls such a diadem being hidden in the [[Room of Requirement]]. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione destroy Hufflepuff's cup with [[basilisk]] fangs taken from the [[Chamber of Secrets]] as Voldemort and his army besiege the castle. They find the diadem but are ambushed by Draco Malfoy and his friends [[Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. Crabbe tries to kill them using Fiendfyre, a cursed fire, but is unable to control it; the fire destroys the diadem and kills Crabbe. Meanwhile, many are killed in the Battle of Hogwarts, including [[Remus Lupin]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Colin Creevey]], and [[Fred Weasley]].\n\nIn his encampment, Voldemort feels the Elder Wand is not performing as he expected. Reasoning that Snape, having killed Dumbledore is the true owner of the Elder Wand, Voldemort murders Snape. Harry arrives as Snape is dying, and Snape passes him memories to view in the [[Pensieve]]. They reveal Snape had a lifelong love for Harry's mother, and despite hating Harry's father, he agreed at Dumbledore's request to act as a [[double agent]] against Voldemort. He had been watching over the trio as they searched for the Horcruxes, conjuring the doe Patronus. It is also revealed that Dumbledore was slowly dying after mishandling the ring Horcrux, and his \"murder\" by Snape was planned to prove Snape's allegiance to Voldemort. The memories also explain that Harry himself is a Horcrux, and therefore he must die at Voldemort's hands if Voldemort is to become mortal, which Voldemort does not know. Harry accepts his death and gives himself up to Voldemort, telling [[Neville Longbottom]] that Voldemort's snake Nagini, another Horcrux, must be killed. On the way, he finally manages to open the Snitch and uses the Resurrection Stone within to seek comfort and courage from his dead loved ones. Voldemort uses the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]], and Harry does not defend himself.\n\nHarry awakens in a dreamlike location resembling [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] and is greeted by Dumbledore. He explains that Voldemort's original Killing Curse left a fragment of Voldemort's soul in Harry, which caused the connection they felt and made Harry an unintended Horcrux. The fragment had been destroyed by the Killing Curse, allowing Harry the choice to return to life or to \"go on.\" Dumbledore also admits some of his mysterious history, in which his friendship with Gellert Grindelwald resulted in the murder of his younger sister Ariana and estrangement from Aberforth. Harry chooses to return to life and feigns death. Voldemort calls for a truce at Hogwarts and displays Harry's body, offering to spare most of the defenders if they surrender. Neville, however, pulls the Sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat and uses it to behead Nagini, leaving Voldemort unprotected by Horcruxes. \n\nHarry escapes under his cloak as the battle resumes. In a final onslaught, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] is killed by [[Molly Weasley]] by using the blast to oblivion spell, and Harry reveals himself to Voldemort. He explains to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Harry also reveals that Snape had never been the Elder Wand's master because Draco Malfoy had disarmed Dumbledore before Snape arrived to kill him, and Harry had disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior. Voldemort attempts one final Killing Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against its true master and the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort. Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his original wand, intending to return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb, where its power will vanish if Harry dies undefeated. However, he plans to keep the Invisibility Cloak he inherited. The wizarding world returns to peace once more.\n\n;Epilogue\nIn an epilogue set in [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] 19 years later, the primary characters are seeing their own children off to Hogwarts. Harry and [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] have three children: [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#James Potter|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], and [[Lily Luna Potter|Lily Luna]]. Ron and Hermione also have two children, [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]]. Harry's godson [[Teddy Lupin]] is found kissing [[Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s daughter [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]]; [[Neville Longbottom]] is now a Hogwarts professor; and [[Draco Malfoy]] and his wife are also at the station to send off their son, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]]. Albus is departing for his first year at Hogwarts and worries he will be placed in Slytherin House. Harry reassures him by telling his son he is named after two Hogwarts headmasters, one of them a Slytherin and \"the bravest man he had ever met,\" and that the [[Sorting Hat]] could also take account of personal preferences as it did for Harry. Harry also notes that his scar has not hurt in nineteen years and all is well.\n\n==Background==\n===Franchise===\n''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' was published by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], the publisher of all ''Harry Potter'' books in the United Kingdom, on 30 June 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/820885.stm|title=The Potter phenomenon|date=18 February 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=27 September 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123221520/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/820885.stm|archivedate=23 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]]\u2014the American publisher of the books\u2014as ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07022007/news/nationalnews/wild_about_harry_nationalnews_.htm |title=Wild about Harry |work=New York Post |accessdate=27 September 2008 |date=2 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517123016/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07022007/news/nationalnews/wild_about_harry_nationalnews_.htm |archivedate=17 May 2008 }}</ref> after Rowling had received US$105,000 for the American rights\u2014an unprecedented amount for a children's book by a then-unknown author.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/business/web21interview.html|title=A Brief Walk Through Time at Scholastic|last=Rozhon|first=Tracie|work=The New York Times|date=21 April 2007|accessdate=21 April 2007|page=C3|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416133919/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/business/web21interview.html|archivedate=16 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The second book, ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998, and in the US on 2 June 1999.

Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a [[loss leader]]. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions.
