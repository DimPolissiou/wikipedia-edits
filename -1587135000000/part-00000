She first appeared as a [[Player character|playable character]] and [[protagonist]] in the [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', in which she features as a resident of the artificial world of Cocoon. After her sister [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Serah Farron|Serah]] is declared an enemy of Cocoon, Lightning attempts to save her. She and others are then chosen by the fal'Cie, a divided race of demigods who rule the worlds of Gran Pulse and Cocoon, to destroy Cocoon. Lightning reappears as a supporting character in ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]'', acting as protector of the Goddess Etro. She is the sole playable character in ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'', wherein she sets out to save her world, which is destined to end in thirteen days. Outside the ''XIII'' series, Lightning has been featured in multiple ''Final Fantasy'' games and had [[cameo appearance]]s in other video games.\n\nLightning was created by [[Motomu Toriyama]], the director and scenario writer of ''XIII'', and designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a regular character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series. Their idea was to create a [[Strong female character|strong female protagonist]] who was adept at combat and less feminine than previous ''Final Fantasy'' heroines. Aspects of her early design and personality were later altered, or transferred to other characters. After ''XIII'', Lightning's design was revised several times to reflect her role and development in each game, particularly in ''Lightning Returns''. Her name in Japanese, {{nihongo|\u00c9clair Farron|\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30ed\u30f3|Ekur\u0113ru Faron}}, was originally a [[Placeholder name|placeholder]]. Because of its similarity to the name of a pastry, her first name was changed to \"Claire\" in other countries.\n\nLightning has received mixed commentary from critics\u2014much of it relating to her cold personality, which was compared to that of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'''s protagonist [[Cloud Strife]]. She was criticized for her relative absence in ''XIII-2''. Her role in ''Lightning Returns'' met with mixed reception: some critics saw her as underdeveloped and unlikable, while others found her better developed and more human than in previous games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by [[video game]] publications, of the best characters in the ''Final Fantasy'' series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls of public opinion by ''[[Famitsu]]'', Square Enix, and other organizations.\n\n== Character design ==\n[[File:Motomu Toriyama - Game Developers Conference 2010.jpg|thumb|left|300pxs|[[Motomu Toriyama]] was responsible for most of Lightning's character traits.]]\nLightning was created by [[Motomu Toriyama]], the director of ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''.<ref name=\"1UP 2006\" /><ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Her character design was by regular ''Final Fantasy'' artist [[Tetsuya Nomura]], who had previously served as the character designer for ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X|X]]''. Nomura has said that multiple designs\u2014including some by staff members other than himself\u2014were considered for Lightning,<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> while Toriyama has claimed that Nomura's first draft \"looked so cool and strong that there was no need for any retakes.\"<ref name=\"1upHeorines\"/> Because of the [[Video game graphics|graphical capacities]] of ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''{{'}}s prospective platforms, Nomura was able to include far more detail in Lightning's design than in his previous character designs, such as her cape and facial features.<ref name=\"SU1\"/> This necessitated far more effort on his part.<ref name=\"SU2\"/> Commenting on an early form of her design, Nomura explained that she is essentially a \"cool character\", in that she is serious and unforgiving. However, he could not make the character too masculine for fear of losing player empathy.<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Characteristics from earlier versions of the design included blond or silver hair and [[Asian people|Asian]]-looking facial features. Her final art was made less Asian-looking than these early drafts and her hair color changed to pink, while [[Hope Estheim]] was given silver hair.<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /><ref name=\"IGN TGS2009\"/> Lightning's final hair color and hairstyle were intended to reflect her femininity, and to counterbalance her athletic body.<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Creating her promotional CG render was fairly easy due to the number of details available concerning her.<ref name=\"IkumoriLecture\"/>\n\nLightning's real name is Claire Farron in English and {{nihongo|\u00c9clair Farron|\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30ed\u30f3|Ekur\u0113ru Faron}} in Japanese. During the early stages of production, Lightning's real name was Averia: \"Eclair\" was used to keep this name secret, but it was eventually chosen as her official name.<ref name=\"SU3\"/> Her English name, Claire, was chosen because the name \"Eclair\" is closely associated with a type of pastry.<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> The name \"Lightning\" was not chosen by Nomura but by other members of the development team: Nomura had wanted to abandon the tradition of [[Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Art design|naming ''Final Fantasy'' protagonists]] after weather events, and was surprised by the choice.<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Several models of Lightning's house were constructed for ''XIII'' but were removed due to space issues.<ref name=sil1 /> Her weapon in ''XIII'', the Blazefire Saber (known as {{nihongo|Blaze Edge|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30ba\u30a8\u30c3\u30b8|Bureizu Ejji}} in the Japanese version) was designed to mirror the ability of the game's [[Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Recurring mechanics|summoned monsters]], the Eidolons, to transform into animal-, human- and vehicle-like shapes.<ref name=\"BladeTransform\"/> The game's version of Odin, Lightning's Eidolon and a recurring summoned monster in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, was intended to present Lightning as a knight on horseback. He was written as a father figure for Lightning.<ref name=\"XIIIUO\"/> In later games in the ''XIII'' series, Odin was developed into a friend to whom Lightning could show her deeper feelings.<ref name=\"LRXIII_U2\"/> [[Daisuke Watanabe]], while writing the script for ''XIII'', paid particular attention to fleshing out Lightning's non-romantic relationship with [[Snow Villiers]] and to showing her development as a person while protecting Hope.<ref name=\"FamitsuWatanabe\"/>\n\nDue to global demand and the development staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to ''XIII''. The game tackles the question of whether Lightning is happy after the events of ''XIII''.<ref name=\"fnc\"/> Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had wanted to create a truly happy ending for the character.<ref name=\"SUcontinue\"/> Lightning's outfit in ''XIII-2'' was designed by [[Isamu Kamikokuryo]]. He worked from a rough sketch by Nomura of how Lightning should appear.<ref name=nomura/> Nomura \"fought hard\" to create the draft design.<ref name=\"LightningNomuraXIII2\"/> The outfit was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a [[Cheongsam|qipao]] and a [[science fiction]]-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the [[valkyrie]]s of [[Norse mythology]].<ref name= \"XIII-2design\"/> The outfit was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning.<ref name=\"GamestopArt\"/> It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers.<ref name= \"XIII-2design\"/><ref name= \"LightningMotif\"/> She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a normal person.<ref name=\"LightXIII-2\"/>\n\nHer outfit in ''Lightning Returns'' was designed by Nomura. He was told by Toriyama to create something representative of her final battle, with \"strength\" as the main guideline. The resultant outfit, which resembles a leather [[bodysuit]], has spinal column patterns on its sleeves and is primarily colored red and white.<ref name= \"LRdesigns\"/> Nomura later commented that he felt \"a strong reaction within [himself]\" while creating Lightning's final look.<ref name=\"FamitsuLR\"/> Nomura's design was Kamikokuryo's favorite out of the many outfits created for the character.<ref name=\"LRkamikokuryo\"/> Her other outfits for the game were designed by Kamikokuryo, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Toshitaka Matsuda:<ref name= \"LRdesigns\"/><ref name= \"LRoutfits\"/> many of them drew inspiration from the character designs of regular ''Final Fantasy'' artist [[Yoshitaka Amano]].<ref name=\"LRamano\"/> In addition to the new costumes, Lightning's in-game model was rebuilt from the ground-up.<ref name= \"LRmodel\"/> Her breasts were enlarged and several of her outfits were designed to present her in a more feminine way.<ref name=\"LightXIII-2\"/> For the game's epilogue, Toriyama wished for Lightning to appear in an everyday setting and normal clothes. The team considered ending the game with Lightning either meeting or speaking with her allies, but Toriyama wished the story to begin and end with her alone.<ref name=\"LRXIII_U2\"/> He has claimed that Lightning, with her solo role in ''Lightning Returns'', was the ''Final Fantasy'' series' \"first female protagonist\".<ref name=\"FemProtag\"/>{{efn|Director Motomu Toriyama's full quote: \"We feel that every person within the party is a main character, but we feel Lightning is very impactful as the main female protagonist in the ''Final Fantasy'' series. Not only is she the first female protagonist, she is very powerful, cool, calm, and collected. So we believe that is another attractive feature of hers.\" This official statement addressed the common claim that ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''{{'}}s [[Terra Branford|Terra]] was the first female protagonist; but it does not address ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'' or ''Final Fantasy XIII'' itself. According to this official statement, Square Enix identifies Lightning as the first female protagonist, without specifying whether that refers to the female protagonist in a single character title or conventional definitions of female protagonists.<ref name=\"FemProtag\"/>}}\n\n===Influences===\nToriyama wanted Lightning to be a type of female character previously unseen in ''Final Fantasy'' games, one with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature.<ref name=\"1UP 2006\" /><ref name=\"1UP E3 2008\" /> His guideline to Nomura was to make her strong, beautiful, and \"like a female version of [[Cloud Strife]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''\".<ref name=\"1UP 2006\" /><ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Commenting on the resemblance, Toriyama stated that the similarities between the characters only extend to their cold personalities and their military backgrounds, and that otherwise \"Lightning really [is] her own person.\"<ref name=\"NowGamer\" /> Nomura compared the two shortly before the Japanese release of ''Lightning Returns'', saying that he had \"desired for her to be carefully developed and loved for a long time, like Cloud.\"<ref name=\"FamitsuLR\"/> Toriyama has said that, among the characters he had been involved in creating, Lightning was his favorite female character from a video game, alongside [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]] from ''Final Fantasy X'' and Yoyo from ''[[Bahamut Lagoon]]''.<ref name=\"1upHeorines\"/>\n\n===Personality===\n[[File:Ali Hillis LF2.jpg|upright|thumb|American actress [[Ali Hillis]] voices Lightning in her English appearances.<ref name=\"AliHillisE3Interview\"/>]]\nIn contrast to other characters in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose personality traits were molded to fit a story, Toriyama conceived Lightning's basic personality before ''XIII''{{'}}s narrative had been finalized.<ref name=\"1upHeorines\"/> She has a cold demeanor, which was meant to clash in an entertaining way with Snow's outspokenness.<ref name=\"NowGamer\" /> Nomura commented that Lightning has \"a strong element of mystery about her character\".<ref name=\"OPM AUS\" /> She originally had a flirtatious aspect to her personality, which was transferred to [[Oerba Yun Fang]] when Fang was changed from male to female.<ref name=\"IGNupdate\"/> For ''Lightning Returns'', the developers wanted to portray Lightning in several different lights, in contrast to her static personalities in prior appearances. One of their highest priorities was to make Lightning a character who had lost much in her life and become deeply vulnerable as a result.<ref name=\"PolygonInterview\"/> Designer Yuji Abe elaborated that, because of her losses and newfound vulnerability, Lightning came across as darker, slightly numbed to her surroundings, and \"like a puppet, like someone who doesn't quite have her real self inside.\" He elaborated that this effect shows \"the kind of vulnerability she has, and it's the point from which she starts to change afterward.\"<ref name=\"GamescomInterview\"/> The decision to expand her personality in this way was originally suggested by [[Yoshinori Kitase]], who was concerned that Lightning's coolness in previous games had made it difficult for players to bond with her.<ref name=\"LRXIII_U\"/>\n\nAcross her speaking appearances, Lightning is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] in English and [[Maaya Sakamoto]] in Japanese.<ref name=\"LightningVoice\"/> Sakamoto was impressed by Lightning, whom she called \"cold\" and \"strong\". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength and to betray the character's hidden vulnerabilities. She initially found it strange to voice Lightning, as she was used to gentler roles such as [[Aerith Gainsborough]], a central character in ''Final Fantasy VII'' and its [[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII|companion media]].<ref name=\"XIIIOU\"/> Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a professionally trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity.<ref name=\"Dengeki incomplete\" /> Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' universe, which she found a little \"overwhelming\" when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition.<ref name=\"AliHillisSpikeInterview\"/> She tried to help the staff of the ''XIII'' games portray Lightning as a real person: \"I think that was my main priority, to make sure that Lightning had every single layer of who she was as a person, not just a game character, but a real person with layers and history and relationships to every single character in the game...even the Chocobo!\" Over the course of the ''XIII'' trilogy, Hillis felt that Lightning becomes \"a little more sarcastic ... a little more hardened to everything that's going on around her and ... [evolves] into a real warrior\".<ref name=\"AliHillisE3Interview\"/>\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n===''Final Fantasy XIII'' series===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| footer    = Lightning in ''XIII-2'' and ''Lightning Returns''.

Each of these regions is controlled by a sect of the fal'Cie, a race of demigods whose two factions, the \"Sanctum\" population on Cocoon and the \"Pulse\" fal'Cie from Gran Pulse, are hostile toward one another.<ref name=\"DATALOGfal'cieA\"/><ref name=\"DATALOGfal'cieB\"/> In ''Final Fantasy XIII: Episode Zero: Promise'', a novel set before the events of ''XIII'', it is revealed that Lightning and Serah's parents died when their children were young, and that Lightning resolved to become her sister's protector but ended up neglecting her in the process.<ref name=\"EPISODEzeroB\"/> She grows to resent Snow's romantic relationship with Serah and the anti-government activities of his group NORA.<ref name=\"EPISODEzeroA\"/> Lightning discovers too late that Serah has been branded as a l'Cie\u2014a human cursed with magical powers and a task to complete\u2014by the Gran Pulse fal'Cie Anima: Lightning initially thinks that Serah is using her condition as an excuse to marry Snow and drives her away.<ref name= \"QUOTEdisbelief\"/> When Serah is taken prisoner by Anima, Lightning resigns from the service as a member of the Guardian Corps and volunteers herself for the Purge, a forced relocation of citizens believed to have come into contact with Anima,<ref name= \"QUOTEpurge\"/> to save her sister.\n\nIn ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', Lightning, accompanied by [[Sazh Katzroy]], reaches Anima along with Snow, Hope and [[Oerba Dia Vanille]], two surviving Purge exiles. When they find Serah, she turns to crystal. Then Lightning and the party fight Anima and are marked as l'Cie when PSICOM, Cocoon's main military force, destroys Anima. Skeptical of Snow's resolve to save her sister, Lightning abandons him and Serah, both of whom are then rescued by [[Oerba Yun Fang]] and a rogue Cocoon military force called the Cavalry. Splitting up from Sazh and Vanille, Lightning ends up traveling with Hope. During their time together, Lightning inadvertently summons Odin and unknowingly supports Hope's plan to assassinate Snow as she protects and mentors him.<ref name=\"DATALOGassassinate\"/> Throughout the game, Lightning struggles to deal with her nature as a l'Cie, her anger at being made Cocoon's enemy, and her guilt at disbelieving Serah's story.<ref name= \"QUOTErevelation\"/><ref name= \"QUOTEfacingit\"/> After overcoming these issues, she acknowledges Snow's relationship with Serah and his faith that they will restore her.<ref name=\"QUOTEserah\"/> When they kill the Sanctum fal'Cie Orphan to save Cocoon, Lightning, Serah and the party except for Vanille and Fang are allowed to return to their normal lives as Vanille and Fang form a crystal pillar to stop Cocoon from colliding with Gran Pulse.\n\n''Final Fantasy XIII: Episode I'', a short novel set immediately after ''XIII'', shows Lightning uneasy about whether her battle is over or not. She leaves to save Fang and Vanille, but first gives her blessing to Snow and Serah's marriage. Eventually, Lightning finds herself caught in a dark void, but she decides to keep moving forward.<ref name=\"EPISODEiVIII\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]'', Lightning has disappeared, and all but Serah believe that she died with Vanille and Fang to save Cocoon.<ref name= \"QUOTEserah_belief\"/> In reality, Lightning was brought to Valhalla, capital of the Unseen Realm ruled by the Goddess Etro, as a direct result of Etro releasing her and the others from their fate as l'Cie. These events had distorted time and erased Lightning from history after Cocoon's fall.<ref name= \"QUOTEvanishing\"/> Hoping to atone for the deaths she caused as a l'Cie, Lightning chooses to stay in Valhalla and protect the dying Etro from [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Caius Ballad|Caius Ballad]], an immortal man with a grudge against the goddess.<ref name=\"FragAfterLight\"/><ref name= \"QUOTEatonement\"/> Lightning eventually asks [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Noel Kreiss|Noel Kreiss]] and Serah to help her stop Caius from ending time, which he plans to do by releasing \"Chaos\", a supernatural energy controlled by Etro, into the mortal world.<ref name= \"QUOTEfight\"/> Serah and Noel travel forward in time to fix distortions in history caused by Caius' interference, and Serah eventually dies when history is restored. In the [[Downloadable content|DLC]] episode ''Requiem of the Goddess'', Lightning is defeated by Caius and loses hope after learning of her role in Serah's death. Lightning is comforted by Serah's spirit, who asks not to be forgotten.<ref name= \"QUOTEcomfort\"/> Vowing to preserve Serah's memory, Lightning turns to crystal, which prevents her from being affected when Etro's death releases chaos and merges the mortal and unseen realms together.<ref name= \"QUOTEremember\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'', Lightning is revived after 500 years by the god [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Bhunivelze|Bhunivelze]]. The world is set to end in thirteen days, and Lightning is chosen as the Savior, a [[Psychopomp|spiritual guide]] for humanity, which has ceased to age due to the influence of chaos. In return for Lightning's help, Serah will be resurrected.<ref name=\"QUOTEsavior\"/> Aided by Hope, Lightning frees her former allies of their emotional burdens, reunites with Odin in the form of a white [[Chocobo]], and frequently crosses paths with [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Lumina|Lumina]], the physical manifestation of Lightning's suppressed vulnerabilities.<ref name=\"QUOTElumina\"/> Lightning begins to doubt her humanity, and, when she learns that Bhunivelze stole Serah's soul and manipulated Lightning's memories, she plans to betray him after he has finished building the new world.<ref name=\"QUOTEhumanity\"/><ref name=\"DATALOGplan\"/> When the end of the world arrives, Lightning fights Bhunivelze, who wants to transform humanity into his ideal image and has been shaping Lightning to become Etro's replacement.<ref name=\"QUOTEgoddess\"/> Although she is prepared to fulfill her new role and abandon her human life, Lightning instead chooses to call for help and accept Lumina as a part of herself.<ref name=\"DATALOGsalvation\"/> Everyone she has saved, including Serah, unites with her and defeats Bhunivelze. Lightning then witnesses the creation of a new universe, into which she goes with her allies and the souls of humanity. In the epilogue, she is seen traveling to reunite with one of her friends.<ref name=\"FamitsuWatanabe\"/>{{efn|During the cited ''Famitsu'' interview, Daisuke Watanabe said that he wrote both the ending of ''Lightning Returns'' and the novella ''Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence: tracer of memories'' to give readers freedom to speculate on who Lightning was meeting. The most he says is that she is going to meet someone she has not seen for a long time.<ref name=\"FamitsuWatanabe\"/>}}\n\n===Other appearances===\nBeyond the ''XIII'' games, Lightning has appeared in several spin-offs within the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise. In the fighting game ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]'', Lightning is one of the warriors summoned by the goddess Cosmos.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> She was meant to debut in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', but the idea was scrapped as ''Final Fantasy XIII'' had yet to be released and Square Enix did not want to reveal her abilities ahead of time.<ref name=\"interultimania\"/> During ''Dissidia 012'', Lightning's group is confronted by beings called Manikins, which inflict permanent death on those they defeat, thereby threatening the world's cycle of rebirth.<ref name=\"Dissidia012quote1\"/> She leads an expedition to the portal from which the Manikins are emerging, and the group sacrifice their lives to close it.<ref name=\"Dissidia012quote2\"/> Lightning has three alternate outfits in the game.<ref name=\"Diss012outfits\"/> She again appeared as a playable character in the 2015 [[arcade game|arcade]] title,<ref name= \"DissidiaArcade\"/> and its home console version ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT]]''.<ref name=\"LightDissidiaNT\"/>\n\nThe character was featured in a series of special [[Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn#Character progression|player events]] in ''[[Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn]]'': Lightning and monsters from her world appeared in the land of Eorzea while she was in crystal stasis between ''XIII-2'' and ''Lightning Returns''.<ref name= \"QUOTElightXIV1\"/> It is hinted that she was sent to Eorzea by Bhunivelze to hone her skills in preparation for future battles in her world.<ref name= \"QUOTElightXIV2\"/> After the events were completed, Lightning met up with the player one last time, saying that she was thankful for the time spent in Eorzea. As she was summoned back to her world, she asked the player to remember her time there.<ref name= \"QUOTElightXIV3\"/> Players who participated in the events received gear and outfits modeled after items, weapons and clothing from the ''XIII'' games.<ref name=\"LightningXIV\"/> Lightning also plays a role as an ally in ''[[World of Final Fantasy]]'', appearing in her ''Lightning Returns'' outfit.<ref name= \"LightWoFF\"/> Lightning was also featured in both Japanese and international versions of the mobile title ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]'' as part of a special story event titled \"''Lightning Resurrection''\".<ref name=\"LightMFF\"/><ref name=\"LightMFFwest\"/>\n\nIn the [[rhythm game]] ''[[Theatrhythm Final Fantasy]]'' and its sequel ''[[Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call|Curtain Call]]'', Lightning is a playable character representing the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' games.<ref name= \"TheatrythmLightning\"/><ref name= \"TheatrythmLightning2\"/> She is featured, sporting her ''XIII-2'' design, in ''[[Final Fantasy Airborne Brigade]]''.<ref name= \"ABLightning\"/> Lightning is a playable character in the mobile crossover games ''[[Final Fantasy: All the Bravest]]'' and ''Final Fantasy: Record Keeper'',<ref name=\"ATBlightning\"/><ref name= \"SilRecord\"/> a powered-up character form in ''[[Final Fantasy Explorers]]'',<ref name= \"LigtExplorers\"/> a [[Chibi (term)|chibi]] figure in ''[[Fortune Street|Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Mobile]]'',<ref name=\"ChibiLightning\"/> and a character card in ''[[Final Fantasy Artniks]]''.<ref name=\"FamGREE\"/> In response to speculation about her continued role in the ''Final Fantasy'' series after ''Lightning Returns''{{'}} release, Kitase clarified in 2013 that she would appear in spin-off titles, but that her role in the main series had ended.<ref name=\"LightFuture\"/>\n\nOutside the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise, Lightning features in a minigame in ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded|Kingdom Hearts Re:coded]]'',<ref name=\"SilKHcoded\"/> was part of a collaboration between the ''Final Fantasy'' series and ''[[Puzzle & Dragons]]'' alongside other established series characters,<ref name=\"LightP&D\"/> and versions of her outfit from ''XIII'' may be worn by protagonist [[Aya Brea]] in ''[[The 3rd Birthday]]'' and a character from arcade shooter ''[[Gunslinger Stratos|Gunslinger Stratos 2]]''.<ref name= \"AyaLightningVoice\"/><ref name=\"FFgunslinger\"/> Maaya Sakamoto, who portrays both Aya and Lightning, voiced Aya to sound like Lightning when the outfit is equipped.<ref name= \"AyaLightningVoice\"/>\n\n===In merchandise and promotion===\nLightning has been featured in ''Final Fantasy XIII''-themed merchandise produced by Square Enix. The two pieces directly inspired by the character are necklaces<ref name= \"SqareEnixMerch1\"/><ref name= \"SqareEnixMerch2\"/> and a mild perfume called \"Lightning eau de toilette\".<ref name= \"LightningPerfume\"/> Action figures of Lightning in her three main iterations were produced by Play Arts Kai, a company often hired to make figurines of characters and creatures from the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name=\"AliHillisE3Interview\"/> Cards depicting the character are available in the ''Final Fantasy'' Trading Card Game.<ref name=\"TradingCard\"/> Lightning appears in a live-action [[PlayStation]] commercial titled \"Michael\", alongside characters such as [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]], [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] and [[Cole McGrath]].<ref name=\"LightningAd\"/> An actress portrayed the character at the ''Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Event'' during [[Asia Game Show]] 2013.<ref name=\"CPLightning25\"/> She was portrayed again in a Japanese live-action/CGI TV commercial for ''Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name= \"LRliveaction\"/> In April 2012, Lightning and other characters from ''XIII-2'' were used to showcase [[Prada]] designs in a 12-page section in the male fashion magazine ''[[Arena Homme +]]''.<ref name= \"XIIIfashion\"/><ref name=\"ArenaHomeMag\"/> To promote ''Lightning Returns'', Lightning was featured on the packaging of snacks produced by [[Ezaki Glico]].<ref name= \"LightPocky\"/> In 2015, she was used in a CGI advertising video by French fashion house [[Louis Vuitton]]. The video was animated by Visual Works, designed by Nomura and directed by Louis Vuttion\u2019s Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re.<ref name= \"GSLightningVuitton\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\nWhile ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was in development, Todd Ciolek of [[Anime News Network]] was unimpressed by Lightning, whom he called a \"businesslike blank\".<ref name= \"AnimeLightning\"/> Reviewing the finished game, Ciolek opined that Lightning is initially \"far too distant and cold, as though the writers were so intent on creating a tough, competent heroine that they forgot to make her at all compelling\". However, he admitted that Lightning becomes a more appealing lead character by the game's end.<ref name= \"AnimeReview\"/> Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com simply referred to Lightning as a female version of Cloud.<ref name= \"VGreview\"/> [[1UP.com]]'s Jeremy Parrish commented that, barring scenes in which Lightning shows a thoughtful side, she is \"your typical, sullen [Square Enix] protagonist\".<ref name= \"1UPreview\"/> Conversely, [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd called Lightning a \"likeable, strong-willed beauty\".<ref name=\"gspot_review\"/> Martin Robinson of [[IGN|IGN UK]] said that Lightning \"instantly endears herself\" in comparison with Hope or Snow, but he found that, when Lightning's backstory \"gets bogged down in generic swash\", Sazh becomes the more appealing character.<ref name= \"IGNreview\"/> [[GamesRadar]]'s Carolyin Gudmundson was unenthusiastic: she opined that, while Lightning's narrative has its merits, it \"certainly isn't above and beyond what we'd typically expect\". She commented that this lack of originality makes Lightning \"one-dimensional and boring\".<ref name= \"GRveview\"/> [[Gamasutra]] writer Christian Nutt believed that Lightning's relationships with the cast add humanity to the narrative.<ref name=\"GamasutraAnalysis\"/>\n\nFor ''XIII-2'', ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Joe Juba was disappointed that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning.<ref name=\"XIII-2GIreview\"/> Simon Parkin of [[Eurogamer]] found that the story suffers without the driving force of Lightning's single-minded determination.<ref name=\"XIII-2EGreview\"/> VanOrd was disappointed that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.<ref name=\"XIII-2GSreview\"/>\n\nIn ''Lightning Returns'', Juba criticized Lightning's lack of personal growth during the narrative,<ref name=\"GILRreview\"/> and IGN's Marty Silva felt that her increased coldness makes her \"downright unlikable.\"<ref name=\"IGNLRreview\"/> VanOrd argued that Lightning is not \"interesting in and of herself\" and that she had turned into \"a vessel for holding and pouring plot devices\", whose stoicism makes it difficult for the player to connect with her.<ref name=\"GSLRreview\"/> Parrish, writing for [[Eurogamer|USGamer]], stated that Lightning had become \"downright apathetic\", showing \"no personality whatsoever\", and that this clashed with the ability to dress her in costumes.<ref name= \"USgLRreview\"/> By contrast, Parkin commented that certain [[Quest (video gaming)|side quests]], such as herding sheep or retrieving a girl's doll, helped to humanize Lightning and make her likable.<ref name=\"EGLRreview\"/> Similarly, [[Destructoid]]'s Dale North found that the costumes and dialogue lighten her character: he argued that these elements make her less \"flat and lifeless now, which is a big improvement.\"<ref name= \"DesLRreview\"/> Dave Riley of Anime News Network felt that Lightning's stoic attitude, although out of place in ''XIII'' and ''XIII-2'', fit her role as a god's servant in ''Lightning Returns''.<ref name= \"ANNLRreview\"/> Tech Reviewer, in a feature about the portrayal of female characters in video games, was impressed with the character's depth and portrayal.<ref name= \"TechRevLightning\"/>\n\nIn a VideoGamer.com list of the ten best ''Final Fantasy'' characters, Lightning was placed sixth; writer Yin-Poole found her interesting in her own right despite her similarities to Cloud.<ref name= \"TopTen\"/> In 2011, IGN ranked Lightning among the best characters in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, saying that she demonstrated that \"a delicate balance can exist between strength and tenderness, even in the midst of ... incredible acrobatic feats.\"<ref name=\"IGNFFcharacters\"/> Lightning was ranked eighth in a similar list by GameZone's Heath Hooker: points of praise were her visual appearance and determination, which made her \"one of the strongest female leaders of the ''Final Fantasy'' series\" in Hooker's opinion.<ref name= \"Strong\"/> Cheat Code Central listed her as one of the top ten \"badass\" women of video games for her independence, which the writer felt distanced her from previous ''Final Fantasy'' heroines.<ref name= \"CCClist\"/> Lightning ranked second in [[AfterEllen]]'s list of the \"hottest\" video game characters.<ref name= \"AfterEllenHot\"/> In ''Game Informer''{{'}}s list of top ten heroes of 2010, Lightning was ranked eighth and praised as the only protagonist in ''Final Fantasy XIII'' who \"seemed capable of taking on the corrupt government of Cocoon\": another comment was that her \"no-nonsense approach to her mission makes her the game's standout hero\".<ref name= \"GStopten\"/> She was included in two lists by ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', which ranked her as the 19th greatest ''Final Fantasy'' character<ref name= \"TopFFcharacters\"/> and the 39th greatest heroine in video game history.<ref name= \"TopHeroines\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Lightning placed 34th in a ''[[Famitsu]]'' poll regarding the most popular video game character in Japan.<ref name= \"FamPoll\"/> She was voted the best-liked female ''Final Fantasy'' character in a 2013 poll by Square Enix,<ref name= \"SquarePoll\"/> and, in that year's ''[[Dengeki PlayStation]]'' Awards, she was voted best video game character of the year for her appearance in ''Lightning Returns''.<ref name= \"LightningDengeki\"/> She came first in a [[Microsoft]] poll to determine the most popular character of the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' games.<ref name= \"MicrosoftPoll\"/> In 2014, readers of IGN voted her the best character in ''XIII''.<ref name=\"IGNFFcharacters2\"/> At [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX]] Prime 2013, she took third place in a list, compiled by journalists and game developers, of the top female characters in western and Japanese [[role-playing video game]]s.<ref name=\"ForbesPAXreport\"/> In a ''Famitsu'' poll from 2017, Lightning was voted as the second most wanted character fans expect to be featured in another Square Enix's franchise, ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', being surpassed only by [[Noctis Lucis Caelum]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''.<ref>{{cite

Seeing herself honestly for the first time, Lightning wished desperately to be saved. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"interultimania\">{{Cite book | date=2009-01-29 | title=Dissidia Final Fantasy Ultimania| publisher=Studio Bentstuff| language=Japanese | isbn= 978-4-7575-2488-0 | pages=696\u2013699}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Diss012outfits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/03/01/dissidia-012duodecim-final-fantasys-cast-gathers-for-alternate-costume-photo-op/|title=Dissidia 012[duodecim]: Final Fantasy's Cast Gathers For Alternate Costume Photo Op|last=Yip|first=Spencer|publisher=Siliconera|date=2011-03-01|accessdate=2013-10-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020051713/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/03/01/dissidia-012duodecim-final-fantasys-cast-gathers-for-alternate-costume-photo-op/|archivedate=2012-10-20 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name= \"DissidiaArcade\">{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/02/dissidia-final-fantasy-announced-arcades|title=Dissidia Final Fantasy announced for arcades|last=Romano|first=Sal|publisher=Gematsu|date=2015-02-13|accessdate=2015-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214083539/http://gematsu.com/2015/02/dissidia-final-fantasy-announced-arcades|archivedate=2015-02-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name= \"TheatrythmLightning\">{{cite web| url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/11/12/aerith-snow-vivi-and-faris-are-in-theatrhythm-final-fantasy-too/ |title=Aerith, Snow, Vivi, And Faris Are In Theatrhythm: Final Fantasy Too|publisher=Siliconera|last=Yip|first=Spencer|date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2012-06-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010031057/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/11/12/aerith-snow-vivi-and-faris-are-in-theatrhythm-final-fantasy-too/|archivedate=2013-10-10|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name= \"TheatrythmLightning2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/12/18/theatrhythm-final-fantasy-curtain-calls-final-fantasy-xiv-guest-another-lightning/|title=Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call's Final Fantasy XIV Guest And Lightning Again|publisher=Siliconera|last=Yip|first=Spencer|date=2013-12-18|accessdate=2014-06-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140612161757/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/12/18/theatrhythm-final-fantasy-curtain-calls-final-fantasy-xiv-guest-another-lightning/|archivedate=2014-06-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name= \"ABLightning\">{{cite web| url=http://andriasang.com/comz6k/lightning_in_brigade/ |title=Final Fantasy XIII-2's Lightning Appears in Final Fantasy Brigade|publisher=Andriasang.com|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|date=2011-12-03 |accessdate=2012-07-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731071858/http://andriasang.com/comz6k/lightning_in_brigade/ |archivedate=2014-07-31|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ATBlightning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/07/29/final-fantasy-all-the-bravest-cashes-in-on-nostalgia-again/|title=Final Fantasy: All The Bravest Cashes In On Nostalgia Again|last=Yip|first=Spencer|publisher=Siliconera|date=2013-07-29|accessdate=2013-10-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025052904/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/07/29/final-fantasy-all-the-bravest-cashes-in-on-nostalgia-again/|archivedate=2013-10-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TradingCard\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/105716-Square-Enix-Shuffles-a-Final-Fantasy-Trading-Card-Game|title=Square Enix Shuffles a Final Fantasy Trading Card Game|last=Goldman|first=Tom|magazine=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=2010-11-30|accessdate=2013-10-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102034702/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/105716-Square-Enix-Shuffles-a-Final-Fantasy-Trading-Card-Game|archivedate=2013-11-02 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Announcement\">{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5632350/final-fantasy-fighting-game-gets-a-sequel-struck-by-lightning |title=Final Fantasy Fighting Game Gets A Sequel Struck By Lightning |last=McWhertor |first=Michael |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2010-09-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108232250/http://kotaku.com/5632350/final-fantasy-fighting-game-gets-a-sequel-struck-by-lightning|archivedate=2013-11-08|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Dissidia012quote1\">{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2011-03-22 |platform=PlayStation Portable |quote='''Garland:''' Manikins are merciless.

She first appeared as a [[Player character|playable character]] and [[protagonist]] in the [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', in which she features as a resident of the artificial world of Cocoon. After her sister [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Serah Farron|Serah]] is declared an enemy of Cocoon, Lightning attempts to save her. She and others are then chosen by the fal'Cie, a divided race of demigods who rule the worlds of Gran Pulse and Cocoon, to destroy Cocoon. Lightning reappears as a supporting character in ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]'', acting as protector of the Goddess Etro. She is the sole playable character in ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'', wherein she sets out to save her world, which is destined to end in thirteen days. Outside the ''XIII'' series, Lightning has been featured in multiple ''Final Fantasy'' games and had [[cameo appearance]]s in other video games.\n\nLightning was created by [[Motomu Toriyama]], the director and scenario writer of ''XIII'', and designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a regular character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series. Their idea was to create a [[Strong female character|strong female protagonist]] who was adept at combat and less feminine than previous ''Final Fantasy'' heroines. Aspects of her early design and personality were later altered, or transferred to other characters. After ''XIII'', Lightning's design was revised several times to reflect her role and development in each game, particularly in ''Lightning Returns''. Her name in Japanese, {{nihongo|\u00c9clair Farron|\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30ed\u30f3|Ekur\u0113ru Faron}}, was originally a [[Placeholder name|placeholder]]. Because of its similarity to the name of a pastry, her first name was changed to \"Claire\" in other countries.\n\nLightning has received mixed commentary from critics\u2014much of it relating to her cold personality, which was compared to that of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'''s protagonist [[Cloud Strife]]. She was criticized for her relative absence in ''XIII-2''. Her role in ''Lightning Returns'' met with mixed reception: some critics saw her as underdeveloped and unlikable, while others found her better developed and more human than in previous games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by [[video game]] publications, of the best characters in the ''Final Fantasy'' series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls of public opinion by ''[[Famitsu]]'', Square Enix, and other organizations.\n\n== Character design ==\n[[File:Motomu Toriyama - Game Developers Conference 2010.jpg|thumb|left|300pxs|[[Motomu Toriyama]] was responsible for most of Lightning's character traits.]]\nLightning was created by [[Motomu Toriyama]], the director of ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''.<ref name=\"1UP 2006\" /><ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Her character design was by regular ''Final Fantasy'' artist [[Tetsuya Nomura]], who had previously served as the character designer for ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X|X]]''. Nomura has said that multiple designs\u2014including some by staff members other than himself\u2014were considered for Lightning,<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> while Toriyama has claimed that Nomura's first draft \"looked so cool and strong that there was no need for any retakes.\"<ref name=\"1upHeorines\"/> Because of the [[Video game graphics|graphical capacities]] of ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''{{'}}s prospective platforms, Nomura was able to include far more detail in Lightning's design than in his previous character designs, such as her cape and facial features.<ref name=\"SU1\"/> This necessitated far more effort on his part.<ref name=\"SU2\"/> Commenting on an early form of her design, Nomura explained that she is essentially a \"cool character\", in that she is serious and unforgiving. However, he could not make the character too masculine for fear of losing player empathy.<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Characteristics from earlier versions of the design included blond or silver hair and [[Asian people|Asian]]-looking facial features. Her final art was made less Asian-looking than these early drafts and her hair color changed to pink, while [[Hope Estheim]] was given silver hair.<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /><ref name=\"IGN TGS2009\"/> Lightning's final hair color and hairstyle were intended to reflect her femininity, and to counterbalance her athletic body.<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Creating her promotional CG render was fairly easy due to the number of details available concerning her.<ref name=\"IkumoriLecture\"/>\n\nLightning's real name is Claire Farron in English and {{nihongo|\u00c9clair Farron|\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30ed\u30f3|Ekur\u0113ru Faron}} in Japanese. During the early stages of production, Lightning's real name was Averia: \"Eclair\" was used to keep this name secret, but it was eventually chosen as her official name.<ref name=\"SU3\"/> Her English name, Claire, was chosen because the name \"Eclair\" is closely associated with a type of pastry.<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> The name \"Lightning\" was not chosen by Nomura but by other members of the development team: Nomura had wanted to abandon the tradition of [[Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Art design|naming ''Final Fantasy'' protagonists]] after weather events, and was surprised by the choice.<ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Several models of Lightning's house were constructed for ''XIII'' but were removed due to space issues.<ref name=sil1 /> Her weapon in ''XIII'', the Blazefire Saber (known as {{nihongo|Blaze Edge|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30ba\u30a8\u30c3\u30b8|Bureizu Ejji}} in the Japanese version) was designed to mirror the ability of the game's [[Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Recurring mechanics|summoned monsters]], the Eidolons, to transform into animal-, human- and vehicle-like shapes.<ref name=\"BladeTransform\"/> The game's version of Odin, Lightning's Eidolon and a recurring summoned monster in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, was intended to present Lightning as a knight on horseback. He was written as a father figure for Lightning.<ref name=\"XIIIUO\"/> In later games in the ''XIII'' series, Odin was developed into a friend to whom Lightning could show her deeper feelings.<ref name=\"LRXIII_U2\"/> [[Daisuke Watanabe]], while writing the script for ''XIII'', paid particular attention to fleshing out Lightning's non-romantic relationship with [[Snow Villiers]] and to showing her development as a person while protecting Hope.<ref name=\"FamitsuWatanabe\"/>\n\nDue to global demand and the development staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to ''XIII''. The game tackles the question of whether Lightning is happy after the events of ''XIII''.<ref name=\"fnc\"/> Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had wanted to create a truly happy ending for the character.<ref name=\"SUcontinue\"/> Lightning's outfit in ''XIII-2'' was designed by [[Isamu Kamikokuryo]]. He worked from a rough sketch by Nomura of how Lightning should appear.<ref name=nomura/> Nomura \"fought hard\" to create the draft design.<ref name=\"LightningNomuraXIII2\"/> The outfit was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a [[Cheongsam|qipao]] and a [[science fiction]]-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the [[valkyrie]]s of [[Norse mythology]].<ref name= \"XIII-2design\"/> The outfit was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning.<ref name=\"GamestopArt\"/> It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers.<ref name= \"XIII-2design\"/><ref name= \"LightningMotif\"/> She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a normal person.<ref name=\"LightXIII-2\"/>\n\nHer outfit in ''Lightning Returns'' was designed by Nomura. He was told by Toriyama to create something representative of her final battle, with \"strength\" as the main guideline. The resultant outfit, which resembles a leather [[bodysuit]], has spinal column patterns on its sleeves and is primarily colored red and white.<ref name= \"LRdesigns\"/> Nomura later commented that he felt \"a strong reaction within [himself]\" while creating Lightning's final look.<ref name=\"FamitsuLR\"/> Nomura's design was Kamikokuryo's favorite out of the many outfits created for the character.<ref name=\"LRkamikokuryo\"/> Her other outfits for the game were designed by Kamikokuryo, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Toshitaka Matsuda:<ref name= \"LRdesigns\"/><ref name= \"LRoutfits\"/> many of them drew inspiration from the character designs of regular ''Final Fantasy'' artist [[Yoshitaka Amano]].<ref name=\"LRamano\"/> In addition to the new costumes, Lightning's in-game model was rebuilt from the ground-up.<ref name= \"LRmodel\"/> Her breasts were enlarged and several of her outfits were designed to present her in a more feminine way.<ref name=\"LightXIII-2\"/> For the game's epilogue, Toriyama wished for Lightning to appear in an everyday setting and normal clothes. The team considered ending the game with Lightning either meeting or speaking with her allies, but Toriyama wished the story to begin and end with her alone.<ref name=\"LRXIII_U2\"/> He has claimed that Lightning, with her solo role in ''Lightning Returns'', was the ''Final Fantasy'' series' \"first female protagonist\".<ref name=\"FemProtag\"/>{{efn|Director Motomu Toriyama's full quote: \"We feel that every person within the party is a main character, but we feel Lightning is very impactful as the main female protagonist in the ''Final Fantasy'' series. Not only is she the first female protagonist, she is very powerful, cool, calm, and collected. So we believe that is another attractive feature of hers.\" This official statement addressed the common claim that ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''{{'}}s [[Terra Branford|Terra]] was the first female protagonist; but it does not address ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'' or ''Final Fantasy XIII'' itself. According to this official statement, Square Enix identifies Lightning as the first female protagonist, without specifying whether that refers to the female protagonist in a single character title or conventional definitions of female protagonists.<ref name=\"FemProtag\"/>}}\n\n===Influences===\nToriyama wanted Lightning to be a type of female character previously unseen in ''Final Fantasy'' games, one with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature.<ref name=\"1UP 2006\" /><ref name=\"1UP E3 2008\" /> His guideline to Nomura was to make her strong, beautiful, and \"like a female version of [[Cloud Strife]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''\".<ref name=\"1UP 2006\" /><ref name=\"Famitsu1001\" /> Commenting on the resemblance, Toriyama stated that the similarities between the characters only extend to their cold personalities and their military backgrounds, and that otherwise \"Lightning really [is] her own person.\"<ref name=\"NowGamer\" /> Nomura compared the two shortly before the Japanese release of ''Lightning Returns'', saying that he had \"desired for her to be carefully developed and loved for a long time, like Cloud.\"<ref name=\"FamitsuLR\"/> Toriyama has said that, among the characters he had been involved in creating, Lightning was his favorite female character from a video game, alongside [[Yuna (Final Fantasy)|Yuna]] from ''Final Fantasy X'' and Yoyo from ''[[Bahamut Lagoon]]''.<ref name=\"1upHeorines\"/>\n\n===Personality===\n[[File:Ali Hillis LF2.jpg|upright|thumb|American actress [[Ali Hillis]] voices Lightning in her English appearances.<ref name=\"AliHillisE3Interview\"/>]]\nIn contrast to other characters in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose personality traits were molded to fit a story, Toriyama conceived Lightning's basic personality before ''XIII''{{'}}s narrative had been finalized.<ref name=\"1upHeorines\"/> She has a cold demeanor, which was meant to clash in an entertaining way with Snow's outspokenness.<ref name=\"NowGamer\" /> Nomura commented that Lightning has \"a strong element of mystery about her character\".<ref name=\"OPM AUS\" /> She originally had a flirtatious aspect to her personality, which was transferred to [[Oerba Yun Fang]] when Fang was changed from male to female.<ref name=\"IGNupdate\"/> For ''Lightning Returns'', the developers wanted to portray Lightning in several different lights, in contrast to her static personalities in prior appearances. One of their highest priorities was to make Lightning a character who had lost much in her life and become deeply vulnerable as a result.<ref name=\"PolygonInterview\"/> Designer Yuji Abe elaborated that, because of her losses and newfound vulnerability, Lightning came across as darker, slightly numbed to her surroundings, and \"like a puppet, like someone who doesn't quite have her real self inside.\" He elaborated that this effect shows \"the kind of vulnerability she has, and it's the point from which she starts to change afterward.\"<ref name=\"GamescomInterview\"/> The decision to expand her personality in this way was originally suggested by [[Yoshinori Kitase]], who was concerned that Lightning's coolness in previous games had made it difficult for players to bond with her.<ref name=\"LRXIII_U\"/>\n\nAcross her speaking appearances, Lightning is voiced by [[Ali Hillis]] in English and [[Maaya Sakamoto]] in Japanese.<ref name=\"LightningVoice\"/> Sakamoto was impressed by Lightning, whom she called \"cold\" and \"strong\". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength and to betray the character's hidden vulnerabilities. She initially found it strange to voice Lightning, as she was used to gentler roles such as [[Aerith Gainsborough]], a central character in ''Final Fantasy VII'' and its [[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII|companion media]].<ref name=\"XIIIOU\"/> Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a professionally trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity.<ref name=\"Dengeki incomplete\" /> Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' universe, which she found a little \"overwhelming\" when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition.<ref name=\"AliHillisSpikeInterview\"/> She tried to help the staff of the ''XIII'' games portray Lightning as a real person: \"I think that was my main priority, to make sure that Lightning had every single layer of who she was as a person, not just a game character, but a real person with layers and history and relationships to every single character in the game...even the Chocobo!\" Over the course of the ''XIII'' trilogy, Hillis felt that Lightning becomes \"a little more sarcastic ... a little more hardened to everything that's going on around her and ... [evolves] into a real warrior\".<ref name=\"AliHillisE3Interview\"/>\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n===''Final Fantasy XIII'' series===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| footer    = Lightning in ''XIII-2'' and ''Lightning Returns''.

Each of these regions is controlled by a sect of the fal'Cie, a race of demigods whose two factions, the \"Sanctum\" population on Cocoon and the \"Pulse\" fal'Cie from Gran Pulse, are hostile toward one another.<ref name=\"DATALOGfal'cieA\"/><ref name=\"DATALOGfal'cieB\"/> In ''Final Fantasy XIII: Episode Zero: Promise'', a novel set before the events of ''XIII'', it is revealed that Lightning and Serah's parents died when their children were young, and that Lightning resolved to become her sister's protector but ended up neglecting her in the process.<ref name=\"EPISODEzeroB\"/> She grows to resent Snow's romantic relationship with Serah and the anti-government activities of his group NORA.<ref name=\"EPISODEzeroA\"/> Lightning discovers too late that Serah has been branded as a l'Cie\u2014a human cursed with magical powers and a task to complete\u2014by the Gran Pulse fal'Cie Anima: Lightning initially thinks that Serah is using her condition as an excuse to marry Snow and drives her away.<ref name= \"QUOTEdisbelief\"/> When Serah is taken prisoner by Anima, Lightning resigns from the service as a member of the Guardian Corps and volunteers herself for the Purge, a forced relocation of citizens believed to have come into contact with Anima,<ref name= \"QUOTEpurge\"/> to save her sister.\n\nIn ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', Lightning, accompanied by [[Sazh Katzroy]], reaches Anima along with Snow, Hope and [[Oerba Dia Vanille]], two surviving Purge exiles. When they find Serah, she turns to crystal. Then Lightning and the party fight Anima and are marked as l'Cie when PSICOM, Cocoon's main military force, destroys Anima. Skeptical of Snow's resolve to save her sister, Lightning abandons him and Serah, both of whom are then rescued by [[Oerba Yun Fang]] and a rogue Cocoon military force called the Cavalry. Splitting up from Sazh and Vanille, Lightning ends up traveling with Hope. During their time together, Lightning inadvertently summons Odin and unknowingly supports Hope's plan to assassinate Snow as she protects and mentors him.<ref name=\"DATALOGassassinate\"/> Throughout the game, Lightning struggles to deal with her nature as a l'Cie, her anger at being made Cocoon's enemy, and her guilt at disbelieving Serah's story.<ref name= \"QUOTErevelation\"/><ref name= \"QUOTEfacingit\"/> After overcoming these issues, she acknowledges Snow's relationship with Serah and his faith that they will restore her.<ref name=\"QUOTEserah\"/> When they kill the Sanctum fal'Cie Orphan to save Cocoon, Lightning, Serah and the party except for Vanille and Fang are allowed to return to their normal lives as Vanille and Fang form a crystal pillar to stop Cocoon from colliding with Gran Pulse.\n\n''Final Fantasy XIII: Episode I'', a short novel set immediately after ''XIII'', shows Lightning uneasy about whether her battle is over or not. She leaves to save Fang and Vanille, but first gives her blessing to Snow and Serah's marriage. Eventually, Lightning finds herself caught in a dark void, but she decides to keep moving forward.<ref name=\"EPISODEiVIII\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]'', Lightning has disappeared, and all but Serah believe that she died with Vanille and Fang to save Cocoon.<ref name= \"QUOTEserah_belief\"/> In reality, Lightning was brought to Valhalla, capital of the Unseen Realm ruled by the Goddess Etro, as a direct result of Etro releasing her and the others from their fate as l'Cie. These events had distorted time and erased Lightning from history after Cocoon's fall.<ref name= \"QUOTEvanishing\"/> Hoping to atone for the deaths she caused as a l'Cie, Lightning chooses to stay in Valhalla and protect the dying Etro from [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Caius Ballad|Caius Ballad]], an immortal man with a grudge against the goddess.<ref name=\"FragAfterLight\"/><ref name= \"QUOTEatonement\"/> Lightning eventually asks [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Noel Kreiss|Noel Kreiss]] and Serah to help her stop Caius from ending time, which he plans to do by releasing \"Chaos\", a supernatural energy controlled by Etro, into the mortal world.<ref name= \"QUOTEfight\"/> Serah and Noel travel forward in time to fix distortions in history caused by Caius' interference, and Serah eventually dies when history is restored. In the [[Downloadable content|DLC]] episode ''Requiem of the Goddess'', Lightning is defeated by Caius and loses hope after learning of her role in Serah's death. Lightning is comforted by Serah's spirit, who asks not to be forgotten.<ref name= \"QUOTEcomfort\"/> Vowing to preserve Serah's memory, Lightning turns to crystal, which prevents her from being affected when Etro's death releases chaos and merges the mortal and unseen realms together.<ref name= \"QUOTEremember\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'', Lightning is revived after 500 years by the god [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Bhunivelze|Bhunivelze]]. The world is set to end in thirteen days, and Lightning is chosen as the Savior, a [[Psychopomp|spiritual guide]] for humanity, which has ceased to age due to the influence of chaos. In return for Lightning's help, Serah will be resurrected.<ref name=\"QUOTEsavior\"/> Aided by Hope, Lightning frees her former allies of their emotional burdens, reunites with Odin in the form of a white [[Chocobo]], and frequently crosses paths with [[Characters of the Final Fantasy XIII series#Lumina|Lumina]], the physical manifestation of Lightning's suppressed vulnerabilities.<ref name=\"QUOTElumina\"/> Lightning begins to doubt her humanity, and, when she learns that Bhunivelze stole Serah's soul and manipulated Lightning's memories, she plans to betray him after he has finished building the new world.<ref name=\"QUOTEhumanity\"/><ref name=\"DATALOGplan\"/> When the end of the world arrives, Lightning fights Bhunivelze, who wants to transform humanity into his ideal image and has been shaping Lightning to become Etro's replacement.<ref name=\"QUOTEgoddess\"/> Although she is prepared to fulfill her new role and abandon her human life, Lightning instead chooses to call for help and accept Lumina as a part of herself.<ref name=\"DATALOGsalvation\"/> Everyone she has saved, including Serah, unites with her and defeats Bhunivelze. Lightning then witnesses the creation of a new universe, into which she goes with her allies and the souls of humanity. In the epilogue, she is seen traveling to reunite with one of her friends.<ref name=\"FamitsuWatanabe\"/>{{efn|During the cited ''Famitsu'' interview, Daisuke Watanabe said that he wrote both the ending of ''Lightning Returns'' and the novella ''Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence: tracer of memories'' to give readers freedom to speculate on who Lightning was meeting. The most he says is that she is going to meet someone she has not seen for a long time.<ref name=\"FamitsuWatanabe\"/>}}\n\n===Other appearances===\nBeyond the ''XIII'' games, Lightning has appeared in several spin-offs within the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise. In the fighting game ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]'', Lightning is one of the warriors summoned by the goddess Cosmos.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> She was meant to debut in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', but the idea was scrapped as ''Final Fantasy XIII'' had yet to be released and Square Enix did not want to reveal her abilities ahead of time.<ref name=\"interultimania\"/> During ''Dissidia 012'', Lightning's group is confronted by beings called Manikins, which inflict permanent death on those they defeat, thereby threatening the world's cycle of rebirth.<ref name=\"Dissidia012quote1\"/> She leads an expedition to the portal from which the Manikins are emerging, and the group sacrifice their lives to close it.<ref name=\"Dissidia012quote2\"/> Lightning has three alternate outfits in the game.<ref name=\"Diss012outfits\"/> She again appeared as a playable character in the 2015 [[arcade game|arcade]] title,<ref name= \"DissidiaArcade\"/> and its home console version ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT]]''.<ref name=\"LightDissidiaNT\"/>\n\nThe character was featured in a series of special [[Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn#Character progression|player events]] in ''[[Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn]]'': Lightning and monsters from her world appeared in the land of Eorzea while she was in crystal stasis between ''XIII-2'' and ''Lightning Returns''.<ref name= \"QUOTElightXIV1\"/> It is hinted that she was sent to Eorzea by Bhunivelze to hone her skills in preparation for future battles in her world.<ref name= \"QUOTElightXIV2\"/> After the events were completed, Lightning met up with the player one last time, saying that she was thankful for the time spent in Eorzea. As she was summoned back to her world, she asked the player to remember her time there.<ref name= \"QUOTElightXIV3\"/> Players who participated in the events received gear and outfits modeled after items, weapons and clothing from the ''XIII'' games.<ref name=\"LightningXIV\"/> Lightning also plays a role as an ally in ''[[World of Final Fantasy]]'', appearing in her ''Lightning Returns'' outfit.<ref name= \"LightWoFF\"/> Lightning was also featured in both Japanese and international versions of the mobile title ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]'' as part of a special story event titled \"''Lightning Resurrection''\".<ref name=\"LightMFF\"/><ref name=\"LightMFFwest\"/>\n\nIn the [[rhythm game]] ''[[Theatrhythm Final Fantasy]]'' and its sequel ''[[Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call|Curtain Call]]'', Lightning is a playable character representing the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' games.<ref name= \"TheatrythmLightning\"/><ref name= \"TheatrythmLightning2\"/> She is featured, sporting her ''XIII-2'' design, in ''[[Final Fantasy Airborne Brigade]]''.<ref name= \"ABLightning\"/> Lightning is a playable character in the mobile crossover games ''[[Final Fantasy: All the Bravest]]'' and ''Final Fantasy: Record Keeper'',<ref name=\"ATBlightning\"/><ref name= \"SilRecord\"/> a powered-up character form in ''[[Final Fantasy Explorers]]'',<ref name= \"LigtExplorers\"/> a [[Chibi (term)|chibi]] figure in ''[[Fortune Street|Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Mobile]]'',<ref name=\"ChibiLightning\"/> and a character card in ''[[Final Fantasy Artniks]]''.<ref name=\"FamGREE\"/> In response to speculation about her continued role in the ''Final Fantasy'' series after ''Lightning Returns''{{'}} release, Kitase clarified in 2013 that she would appear in spin-off titles, but that her role in the main series had ended.<ref name=\"LightFuture\"/>\n\nOutside the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise, Lightning features in a minigame in ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded|Kingdom Hearts Re:coded]]'',<ref name=\"SilKHcoded\"/> was part of a collaboration between the ''Final Fantasy'' series and ''[[Puzzle & Dragons]]'' alongside other established series characters,<ref name=\"LightP&D\"/> and versions of her outfit from ''XIII'' may be worn by protagonist [[Aya Brea]] in ''[[The 3rd Birthday]]'' and a character from arcade shooter ''[[Gunslinger Stratos|Gunslinger Stratos 2]]''.<ref name= \"AyaLightningVoice\"/><ref name=\"FFgunslinger\"/> Maaya Sakamoto, who portrays both Aya and Lightning, voiced Aya to sound like Lightning when the outfit is equipped.<ref name= \"AyaLightningVoice\"/>\n\n===In merchandise and promotion===\nLightning has been featured in ''Final Fantasy XIII''-themed merchandise produced by Square Enix. The two pieces directly inspired by the character are necklaces<ref name= \"SqareEnixMerch1\"/><ref name= \"SqareEnixMerch2\"/> and a mild perfume called \"Lightning eau de toilette\".<ref name= \"LightningPerfume\"/> Action figures of Lightning in her three main iterations were produced by Play Arts Kai, a company often hired to make figurines of characters and creatures from the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name=\"AliHillisE3Interview\"/> Cards depicting the character are available in the ''Final Fantasy'' Trading Card Game.<ref name=\"TradingCard\"/> Lightning appears in a live-action [[PlayStation]] commercial titled \"Michael\", alongside characters such as [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]], [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] and [[Cole McGrath]].<ref name=\"LightningAd\"/> An actress portrayed the character at the ''Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Event'' during [[Asia Game Show]] 2013.<ref name=\"CPLightning25\"/> She was portrayed again in a Japanese live-action/CGI TV commercial for ''Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name= \"LRliveaction\"/> In April 2012, Lightning and other characters from ''XIII-2'' were used to showcase [[Prada]] designs in a 12-page section in the male fashion magazine ''[[Arena Homme +]]''.<ref name= \"XIIIfashion\"/><ref name=\"ArenaHomeMag\"/> To promote ''Lightning Returns'', Lightning was featured on the packaging of snacks produced by [[Ezaki Glico]].<ref name= \"LightPocky\"/> In 2015, she was used in a CGI advertising video by French fashion house [[Louis Vuitton]]. The video was animated by Visual Works, designed by Nomura and directed by Louis Vuttion\u2019s Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re.<ref name= \"GSLightningVuitton\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\nWhile ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was in development, Todd Ciolek of [[Anime News Network]] was unimpressed by Lightning, whom he called a \"businesslike blank\".<ref name= \"AnimeLightning\"/> Reviewing the finished game, Ciolek opined that Lightning is initially \"far too distant and cold, as though the writers were so intent on creating a tough, competent heroine that they forgot to make her at all compelling\". However, he admitted that Lightning becomes a more appealing lead character by the game's end.<ref name= \"AnimeReview\"/> Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com simply referred to Lightning as a female version of Cloud.<ref name= \"VGreview\"/> [[1UP.com]]'s Jeremy Parrish commented that, barring scenes in which Lightning shows a thoughtful side, she is \"your typical, sullen [Square Enix] protagonist\".<ref name= \"1UPreview\"/> Conversely, [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd called Lightning a \"likeable, strong-willed beauty\".<ref name=\"gspot_review\"/> Martin Robinson of [[IGN|IGN UK]] said that Lightning \"instantly endears herself\" in comparison with Hope or Snow, but he found that, when Lightning's backstory \"gets bogged down in generic swash\", Sazh becomes the more appealing character.<ref name= \"IGNreview\"/> [[GamesRadar]]'s Carolyin Gudmundson was unenthusiastic: she opined that, while Lightning's narrative has its merits, it \"certainly isn't above and beyond what we'd typically expect\". She commented that this lack of originality makes Lightning \"one-dimensional and boring\".<ref name= \"GRveview\"/> [[Gamasutra]] writer Christian Nutt believed that Lightning's relationships with the cast add humanity to the narrative.<ref name=\"GamasutraAnalysis\"/>\n\nFor ''XIII-2'', ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Joe Juba was disappointed that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning.<ref name=\"XIII-2GIreview\"/> Simon Parkin of [[Eurogamer]] found that the story suffers without the driving force of Lightning's single-minded determination.<ref name=\"XIII-2EGreview\"/> VanOrd was disappointed that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.<ref name=\"XIII-2GSreview\"/>\n\nIn ''Lightning Returns'', Juba criticized Lightning's lack of personal growth during the narrative,<ref name=\"GILRreview\"/> and IGN's Marty Silva felt that her increased coldness makes her \"downright unlikable.\"<ref name=\"IGNLRreview\"/> VanOrd argued that Lightning is not \"interesting in and of herself\" and that she had turned into \"a vessel for holding and pouring plot devices\", whose stoicism makes it difficult for the player to connect with her.<ref name=\"GSLRreview\"/> Parrish, writing for [[Eurogamer|USGamer]], stated that Lightning had become \"downright apathetic\", showing \"no personality whatsoever\", and that this clashed with the ability to dress her in costumes.<ref name= \"USgLRreview\"/> By contrast, Parkin commented that certain [[Quest (video gaming)|side quests]], such as herding sheep or retrieving a girl's doll, helped to humanize Lightning and make her likable.<ref name=\"EGLRreview\"/> Similarly, [[Destructoid]]'s Dale North found that the costumes and dialogue lighten her character: he argued that these elements make her less \"flat and lifeless now, which is a big improvement.\"<ref name= \"DesLRreview\"/> Dave Riley of Anime News Network felt that Lightning's stoic attitude, although out of place in ''XIII'' and ''XIII-2'', fit her role as a god's servant in ''Lightning Returns''.<ref name= \"ANNLRreview\"/> Tech Reviewer, in a feature about the portrayal of female characters in video games, was impressed with the character's depth and portrayal.<ref name= \"TechRevLightning\"/>\n\nIn a VideoGamer.com list of the ten best ''Final Fantasy'' characters, Lightning was placed sixth; writer Yin-Poole found her interesting in her own right despite her similarities to Cloud.<ref name= \"TopTen\"/> In 2011, IGN ranked Lightning among the best characters in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, saying that she demonstrated that \"a delicate balance can exist between strength and tenderness, even in the midst of ... incredible acrobatic feats.\"<ref name=\"IGNFFcharacters\"/> Lightning was ranked eighth in a similar list by GameZone's Heath Hooker: points of praise were her visual appearance and determination, which made her \"one of the strongest female leaders of the ''Final Fantasy'' series\" in Hooker's opinion.<ref name= \"Strong\"/> Cheat Code Central listed her as one of the top ten \"badass\" women of video games for her independence, which the writer felt distanced her from previous ''Final Fantasy'' heroines.<ref name= \"CCClist\"/> Lightning ranked second in [[AfterEllen]]'s list of the \"hottest\" video game characters.<ref name= \"AfterEllenHot\"/> In ''Game Informer''{{'}}s list of top ten heroes of 2010, Lightning was ranked eighth and praised as the only protagonist in ''Final Fantasy XIII'' who \"seemed capable of taking on the corrupt government of Cocoon\": another comment was that her \"no-nonsense approach to her mission makes her the game's standout hero\".<ref name= \"GStopten\"/> She was included in two lists by ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', which ranked her as the 19th greatest ''Final Fantasy'' character<ref name= \"TopFFcharacters\"/> and the 39th greatest heroine in video game history.<ref name= \"TopHeroines\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Lightning placed 34th in a ''[[Famitsu]]'' poll regarding the most popular video game character in Japan.<ref name= \"FamPoll\"/> She was voted the best-liked female ''Final Fantasy'' character in a 2013 poll by Square Enix,<ref name= \"SquarePoll\"/> and, in that year's ''[[Dengeki PlayStation]]'' Awards, she was voted best video game character of the year for her appearance in ''Lightning Returns''.<ref name= \"LightningDengeki\"/> She came first in a [[Microsoft]] poll to determine the most popular character of the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' games.<ref name= \"MicrosoftPoll\"/> In 2014, readers of IGN voted her the best character in ''XIII''.<ref name=\"IGNFFcharacters2\"/> At [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX]] Prime 2013, she took third place in a list, compiled by journalists and game developers, of the top female characters in western and Japanese [[role-playing video game]]s.<ref name=\"ForbesPAXreport\"/> In a ''Famitsu'' poll from 2017, Lightning was voted as the second most wanted character fans expect to be featured in another Square Enix's franchise, ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', being surpassed only by [[Noctis Lucis Caelum]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''.<ref>{{cite
