Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]\", Spears is regarded as a [[pop icon]] and is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Spears' personal struggles led her to be placed on a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), respectively. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58&nbsp;million, having last topped the list in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her [[Conservatorship|conservator]], leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\n\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.<ref name=\"billboard_472190\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\", \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\", and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\".

Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''.

Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineer|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day.

Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she appeared in stage productions and television series, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]\", Spears is regarded as a [[pop icon]] and is credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSpears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'' (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-blackout-a-salute-to-her-misunderstood-punk-masterpiece-121525/|title=Britney Spears' 'Blackout': A Salute to Her Misunderstood Punk Masterpiece|last=|first=|date=|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Spears' personal struggles led her to be placed on a still ongoing [[conservatorship]]. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011), respectively. In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58&nbsp;million, having last topped the list in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman in Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]] in Las Vegas, which became one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her [[Conservatorship|conservator]], leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by Spears's team.\n\nSpears has scored six number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.<ref name=\"billboard_472190\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472190/britney-spears-snares-sixth-no-1-on-billboard-200-with-femme-fatale |title=Britney Spears Snares Sixth No. 1 on Billboard 200 with 'Femme Fatale' |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> Five of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\", \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", \"[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]\", \"[[Hold It Against Me]]\", and \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\". Other singles, \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]\" and \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\", topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after [[Mariah Carey]] in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.

Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' alongside [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ryan Gosling]], and [[Keri Russell]].

Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored.

Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made.

Later, they might remember the content of the memory but not its source and mistakenly attribute the recalled information to a real experience.<ref name=\"Devon\" />\n\nThis effect is relevant to the study of [[memory]] and [[cognition]], particularly [[Confabulation|false memory]]. Imagination inflation often occurs during attempts to retrieve [[repressed memory|repressed memories]] (i.e. via [[recovered memory therapy]]) and may lead to the development of false or distorted memories.<ref name=\"Devon\" /> In criminal justice, imagination inflation is tied to [[False confession|false confessions]] because police interrogation practices involving suspects to imagine committing or planning the crime in question.<ref name=\"Garry\" /><ref name=\"false\" />\n\n==Early research==\nIn 1996, [[Elizabeth Loftus]], [[Maryanne Garry]], Charles Manning, and Steven Sherman, conducted the original imagination inflation study. The study examined the effect of imagining a childhood event on childhood memories.<ref name=\"Garry\" /> It was the first study to examine the effects of imagining false events on memory in the absence of other factors present in previous studies, such as social pressure.<ref name=\"Garry\" /><ref name=\"Devon\" /> In the study, the act of imagining unexperienced childhood events, such as being rescued by a lifeguard or breaking a window with one's hand, increased confidence that the events had occurred. After people imagined events with low initial confidence ratings (i.e. ones which they originally said they had not experienced) they became more confident that the events took place compared with unimagined ones.<ref name=\"Garry\" />\n\nDue to the [[seven sins of memory|unreliability of memory]], it is not possible to be certain whether or not someone has had a given experience based solely self-reports.<ref name=Goff /> This leaves open the possibility that imagination does not actually have any effect on beliefs about false past events, but instead helps people retrieve actual memories of true experiences. In 1998, Lyn Goff and Henry Roediger used a different method to study imagination inflation effect for events that ''could'' be confirmed. It also looked at the effect of imagination on [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] reports rather than confidence ratings. Participants performed certain actions (such as breaking a toothpick) but not others, then imagined doing other actions in the overall set, and finally were given a list of old actions encountered in the first two parts of the study and brand new actions. Participants were more likely to mistakenly say that they had performed imagined actions compared to unimagined actions.<ref name=Goff>{{cite journal|last1=Goff|first1=Lyn M.|author2=Roediger III, Henry L.|title=Imagination inflation for action events: Repeated imaginings lead to illusory recollections.|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=1998|volume=26|issue=1|pages=20\u201333|doi=10.3758/BF03211367|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Further research==\nSome later studies have used similar methods with a pre-test rating of a series of events, an intervening [[cognitive]] task using the events, and a post-test confidence rating. These have shown that a similar imagination inflation effect occurs when instead of imagining, people simply explain how events could have happened<ref name=Sharman>{{cite journal |last1=Sharman |first1=Stefanie J. |author2=Manning, Charles, G., Garry, Maryanne |year=2005 |title=Explain this: explaining childhood events inflates confidence for these events |journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=67\u201374 |doi=10.1002/acp.1041}}</ref> or paraphrase them.<ref name=fluency>{{cite journal |last1=Sharman |first1=Stefanie J. |author2=Garry, M., Beurke, C.J. |year=2004 |title=Imagination or exposure causes imagination inflation|journal=The American Journal of Psychology |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=157\u2013168 |jstor=41409020 |doi=10.2307/4149020}}</ref> These findings suggest that vivid imagining is not always necessary for \"imagination inflation\" to occur; explanation or paraphrasing may function to make the false event seem more [[processing fluency|fluent]] and thus more familiar without producing a detailed image of it.<ref name=fluency />\n\nOther research has investigated what types of events can show an imagination inflation effect, often using a method similar to Goff and Roediger's,<ref name=Goff /> in which participants perform some actions but not others, then imagine some of them, and later mistakenly believe they have performed imagined actions but not control unimagined ones. One comparison found a similar imagination inflation effect for actions identical to those in Goff and Roediger's study  (i.e. \"break the toothpick\") and altered, bizarre versions of such actions (i.e. \"kiss the magnifying glass\").<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Ayanna K. |last2=Loftus |first2=Elizabeth F. |year=2002 |title=Creating bizarre false memories through imagination |journal=Memory & Cognition |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=423\u2013431 |doi=10.3758/BF03194942|doi-access=free }}</ref> Another found an effect when people imagined a highly unusual action such as kissing a vending machine or lying on a couch and talking to [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref name=Seamon>{{cite journal |last1=Seamon |first1=John G. |author2=Philbin, M.M., Harrison, Liza G. |year=2006 |title=Do you remember proposing marriage to the Pepsi machine?

In 1998, Lyn Goff and Henry Roediger used a different method to study imagination inflation effect for events that ''could'' be confirmed. It also looked at the effect of imagination on [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] reports rather than confidence ratings. Participants performed certain actions (such as breaking a toothpick) but not others, then imagined doing other actions in the overall set, and finally were given a list of old actions encountered in the first two parts of the study and brand new actions.

The French hyperinflation took place after the introduction of a non-convertible paper currency, the [[assignat]]s.\n\n===Money supply===\nHyperinflation occurs when there is a continuing (and often accelerating) rapid increase in the amount of money that is not supported by a corresponding growth in the output of goods and services.\n\nThe increases in price that result from the rapid [[money creation]] creates a vicious circle, requiring ever growing amounts of new money creation to fund government deficits. Hence both [[monetary inflation]] and price inflation proceed at a rapid pace. Such rapidly increasing prices cause widespread unwillingness of the local population to hold the local currency as it rapidly loses its buying power. Instead they quickly spend any money they receive, which increases the [[velocity of money]] flow; this in turn causes further acceleration in prices. This means that the increase in the price level is greater than that of the money supply.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parsson |first=Jens |authorlink=Jens O.

Here M refers to the money stock and P to the price level.\n\nThis results in an imbalance between the [[supply and demand]] for the money (including currency and bank deposits), causing rapid inflation. Very high inflation rates can result in a loss of confidence in the currency, similar to a [[bank run]]. Usually, the excessive money supply growth results from the government being either unable or unwilling to fully finance the government budget through taxation or borrowing, and instead it finances the government budget deficit through the printing of money.<ref name=\"z\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080408131232/http://www.fingaz.co.zw/fingaz/2003/October/October2/1365.shtml Hyperinflation: causes, cures] Bernard Mufute, 2003-10-02, \"Hyperinflation has its root cause in money growth, which is not supported by growth in the output of goods and services.

Monetary inflation is effectively a flat tax on creditors that also redistributes proportionally to private debtors.

Inflation can obscure quantitative assessments of the true cost of living, as published price indices only look at data in retrospect, so may increase only months later. [[Monetary inflation]] can become hyperinflation if monetary authorities fail to fund increasing government expenses from [[tax]]es, [[government debt]], cost cutting, or by other means, because either\n* during the time between recording or levying taxable transactions and collecting the taxes due, the value of the taxes collected falls in real value to a small fraction of the original taxes receivable; or\n* government debt issues fail to find buyers except at very deep discounts; or\n* a combination of the above.\n\nTheories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between [[seigniorage]] and the [[inflation tax]]. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position. Thus when [[fiat money]] is printed, government obligations that are not denominated in money increase in cost by more than the value of the money created.\n\n[[File:German Hyperinflation.jpg|right|thumb|The price of gold in Germany, 1 January 1918 \u2013 30 November 1923. (The vertical scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]).]]\n\nFrom this, it might be wondered why any rational government would engage in actions that cause or continue hyperinflation. One reason for such actions is that often the alternative to hyperinflation is either [[depression (economics)|depression]] or military defeat. The root cause is a matter of more dispute. In both [[classical economics]] and [[monetarism]], it is always the result of the monetary authority irresponsibly borrowing money to pay all its expenses. These models focus on the unrestrained [[seigniorage]] of the monetary authority, and the gains from the [[inflation tax]].\n\nIn neo-classical economic theory, hyperinflation is rooted in a deterioration of the [[monetary base]], that is the confidence that there is a store of value that the currency will be able to command later. In this model, the perceived risk of holding currency rises dramatically, and sellers demand increasingly high premiums to accept the currency. This in turn leads to a greater fear that the currency will collapse, causing even higher premiums. One example of this is during periods of warfare, civil war, or intense internal conflict of other kinds: governments need to do whatever is necessary to continue fighting, since the alternative is defeat. Expenses cannot be cut significantly since the main outlay is armaments. Further, a civil war may make it difficult to raise taxes or to collect existing taxes. While in peacetime the deficit is financed by selling bonds, during a war it is typically difficult and expensive to borrow, especially if the war is going poorly for the government in question. The banking authorities, whether central or not, \"monetize\" the deficit, printing money to pay for the government's efforts to survive. The hyperinflation under the [[Chinese Nationalists]] from 1939 to 1945 is a classic example of a government printing money to pay civil war costs. By the end, currency was flown in over the Himalayas, and then old currency was flown out to be destroyed.\n\nHyperinflation is a complex phenomenon and one explanation may not be applicable to all cases. In both of these models, however, whether loss of confidence comes first, or central bank [[seigniorage]], the other phase is ignited. In the case of rapid expansion of the money supply, prices rise rapidly in response to the increased supply of money relative to the supply of goods and services, and in the case of loss of confidence, the monetary authority responds to the risk premiums it has to pay by \"running the printing presses.\"\n\nNevertheless, the immense acceleration process that occurs during hyperinflation (such as during the German hyperinflation of 1922/23) still remains unclear and unpredictable. The transformation of an inflationary development into the hyperinflation has to be identified as a very complex phenomenon, which could be a further advanced research avenue of the [[complexity economics]] in conjunction with research areas like [[mass hysteria]], [[bandwagon effect]], social brain, and [[mirror neuron]]s.<ref>Wolfgang Chr.

Economists see both a rapid increase in the [[money supply]] and an increase in the [[velocity of money]] if the (monetary) inflating is not stopped. Either one, or both of these together are the root causes of inflation and hyperinflation. A dramatic increase in the velocity of money as the cause of hyperinflation is central to the \"crisis of confidence\" model of hyperinflation, where the risk premium that sellers demand for the paper currency over the nominal value grows rapidly. The second theory is that there is first a radical increase in the amount of circulating medium, which can be called the \"monetary model\" of hyperinflation. In either model, the second effect then follows from the first\u2014either too little confidence forcing an increase in the money supply, or too much money destroying confidence.\n\nIn the ''confidence model'', some event, or series of events, such as defeats in battle, or a run on stocks of the specie that back a currency, removes the belief that the authority issuing the money will remain solvent\u2014whether a bank or a government. Because people do not want to hold notes that may become valueless, they want to spend them. Sellers, realizing that there is a higher risk for the currency, demand a greater and greater premium over the original value. Under this model, the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the backing of the currency, often by issuing a completely new one. War is one commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence, particularly losing in a war, as occurred during Napoleonic [[Vienna]], and capital flight, sometimes because of \"contagion\" is another. In this view, the increase in the circulating medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself.\n\nIn the ''monetary model'', hyperinflation is a [[positive feedback]] cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiraling costs, often from lax fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When business people perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot \"win\" and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the [[Washington consensus]] of the 1990s.\n\nWhatever the cause, hyperinflation involves both the supply and [[velocity of money]]. Which comes first is a matter of debate, and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases. But once the hyperinflation is established, the pattern of increasing the money stock, by whichever agencies are allowed to do so, is universal. Because this practice increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for it, the price of the currency, that is the exchange rate, naturally falls relative to other currencies. Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the increase in money supply turns specific areas of pricing power into a general frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless. The purchasing power of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an unacceptable loss of purchasing power. As a result, no one holds currency, which increases the velocity of money, and worsens the crisis.\n\nBecause rapidly rising prices undermine the role of money as a [[store of value]], people try to spend it on real goods or services as quickly as possible. Thus, the monetary model predicts that the velocity of money will increase as a result of an excessive increase in the money supply. At the point when money velocity and prices rapidly accelerate in a [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]], hyperinflation is out of control, because ordinary policy mechanisms, such as increasing reserve requirements, raising interest rates, or cutting government spending will be ineffective and be responded to by shifting away from the rapidly devalued money and towards other means of exchange.\n\nDuring a period of hyperinflation, bank runs, loans for 24-hour periods, switching to alternate currencies, the return to use of gold or silver or even barter become common. Many of the people who hoard gold today expect hyperinflation, and are hedging against it by holding specie. There may also be extensive [[capital flight]] or flight to a \"hard\" currency such as the US dollar. This is sometimes met with [[capital control]]s, an idea that has swung from standard, to anathema, and back into semi-respectability. All of this constitutes an economy that is operating in an \"abnormal\" way, which may lead to decreases in real production. If so, that intensifies the hyperinflation, since it means that the amount of goods in \"too much money chasing too few goods\" formulation is also reduced. This is also part of the vicious circle of hyperinflation.\n\nOnce the vicious circle of hyperinflation has been ignited, dramatic policy means are almost always required. Simply raising interest rates is insufficient. Bolivia, for example, underwent a period of hyperinflation in 1985, where prices increased 12,000% in the space of less than a year. The government raised the price of gasoline, which it had been selling at a huge loss to quiet popular discontent, and the hyperinflation came to a halt almost immediately, since it was able to bring in hard currency by selling its oil abroad. The crisis of confidence ended, and people returned deposits to banks. The German hyperinflation (1919\u2013November 1923) was ended by producing a currency based on assets loaned against by banks, called the [[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]]. Hyperinflation often ends when a civil conflict ends with one side winning.\n\nAlthough [[incomes policy|wage and price controls]] are sometimes used to control or prevent inflation, no episode of hyperinflation has been ended by the use of price controls alone, because price controls that force merchants to sell at prices far below their restocking costs result in shortages that cause prices to rise still further.\n\n[[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel prize]] winner [[Milton Friedman]] said \"We economists don't know much, but we do know how to create a shortage. If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can't sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you'll have a tomato shortage. It's the same with oil or gas.\"<ref>\"Controls blamed for U.S. energy woes\", ''Los Angeles Times'', 13 February 1977, Milton Friedman press conference in Los Angeles.</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00104, Inflation, Tapezieren mit Geldscheinen.jpg|right|thumb|[[inflation in the Weimar Republic|Germany, 1923]]: banknotes had lost so much value that they were used as wallpaper.]]\n\nHyperinflation effectively wipes out the purchasing power of private and public savings; distorts the economy in favor of the hoarding of real assets; causes the monetary base, whether [[money|specie]] or hard currency, to flee the country; and makes the afflicted area anathema to investment.\n\nOne of the most important characteristics of hyperinflation is the accelerating substitution of the inflating money by stable money\u2014gold and silver in former times, then relatively stable foreign currencies after the breakdown of the gold or silver standards ([[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]]' [[Thiers' law|Law]]). If inflation is high enough, government regulations like heavy penalties and fines, often combined with exchange controls, cannot prevent this currency substitution. As a consequence, the inflating currency is usually heavily undervalued compared to stable foreign money in terms of purchasing power parity. So foreigners can live cheaply and buy at low prices in the countries hit by high inflation. It follows that governments that do not succeed in engineering a successful currency reform in time must finally legalize the stable foreign currencies (or, formerly, gold and silver) that threaten to fully substitute the inflating money. Otherwise, their tax revenues, including the inflation tax, will approach zero.<ref name=\"Bernholz, Peter 2003\">Bernholz, Peter 2003</ref> The last episode of hyperinflation in which this process could be observed was in [[Zimbabwe]] in the first decade of the 21st century. In this case, the local money was mainly driven out by the US dollar and the South African rand.\n\nEnactment of price controls to prevent discounting the value of [[paper money]] relative to gold, silver, [[hard currency]], or other commodities fail to force acceptance of a paper money that lacks intrinsic value. If the entity responsible for printing a currency promotes excessive money printing, with other factors contributing a reinforcing effect, hyperinflation usually continues. Hyperinflation is generally associated with paper money, which can easily be used to increase the money supply: add more zeros to the plates and print, or even stamp old notes with new numbers.<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/03/06/jefferson-county-memories/ Jefferson County Miracles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120102/https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/03/06/jefferson-county-memories/ |date=19 January 2018 }}, ''Wall Street Journal'', 6 March 2008.</ref> Historically, there have been numerous episodes of hyperinflation in various countries followed by a return to \"hard money\". Older economies would revert to [[hard currency]] and [[barter (economics)|barter]] when the circulating medium became excessively devalued, generally following a \"run\" on the [[store of value]].\n\nMuch attention on hyperinflation centers on the effect on savers whose investments become worthless. Interest rate changes often cannot keep up with hyperinflation or even high inflation, certainly with contractually fixed interest rates. For example, in the 1970s in the United Kingdom inflation reached 25% per annum, yet interest rates did not rise above 15%\u2014and then only briefly\u2014and many fixed interest rate loans existed. Contractually, there is often no bar to a debtor clearing his long term debt with \"hyperinflated cash\", nor could a lender simply somehow suspend the loan. Contractual \"early redemption penalties\" were (and still are) often based on a penalty of ''n'' months of interest/payment; again no real bar to paying off what had been a large loan. In interwar Germany, for example, much private and corporate debt was effectively wiped out\u2014certainly for those holding fixed interest rate loans.\n\n[[Ludwig von Mises]] used the term \"crack-up boom\" (German: Katastrophenhausse) to describe the economic consequences of an unmitigated increasing in the base-money supply.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ludwig von Mises |title=Human Action |publisher=Fox & Wilkes, San Francisco, 4th edition, 1986 |page=428 |isbn=0-930073-18-5|author-link=Ludwig von Mises |title-link=Human Action |year=1996 }}</ref> As more and more money is provided, interest rates decline towards zero. Realizing that fiat money is losing value, investors will try to place money in assets such as real estate, stocks, even art; as these appear to represent \"real\" value. Asset prices are thus becoming inflated. This potentially spiraling process will ultimately lead to the collapse of the monetary system. The Cantillon effect<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://azizonomics.com/2012/08/07/the-cantillon-effect/|title=The Cantillon Effect|first=John|last=Aziz|date=7 August 2012}}</ref> says that those institutions that receive the new money first are the beneficiaries of the policy.\n\n===Aftermath===\nHyperinflation is ended by drastic remedies, such as imposing the [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] of slashing government expenditures or altering the currency basis. One form this may take is [[dollarization]], the use of a foreign currency (not necessarily the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]) as a national unit of currency. An example was dollarization in Ecuador, initiated in September 2000 in response to a 75% loss of value of the [[Ecuadorian sucre]] in early 2000. But usually the \"dollarization\" takes place in spite of all efforts of the government to prevent it by exchange controls, heavy fines and penalties. The government has thus to try to engineer a successful currency reform stabilizing the value of the money. If it does not succeed with this reform the substitution of the inflating by stable money goes on. Thus it is not surprising that there have been at least seven historical cases in which the good (foreign) money did fully drive out the use of the inflating currency. In the end the government had to legalize the former, for otherwise its revenues would have fallen to zero.<ref name=\"Bernholz, Peter 2003\"/>\n\nHyperinflation has always been a traumatic experience for the people who suffer it, and the next political regime almost always enacts policies to try to prevent its recurrence. Often this means making the central bank very aggressive about maintaining price stability, as was the case with the German [[Bundesbank]], or moving to some hard basis of currency, such as a [[currency board]]. Many governments have enacted extremely stiff [[wage and price controls]] in the wake of hyperinflation, but this does not prevent further inflation of the money supply by the [[central bank]], and always leads to widespread shortages of consumer goods if the controls are rigidly enforced.\n\n===Currency===\nIn countries experiencing hyperinflation, the [[central bank]] often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the smaller denomination notes become worthless. This can result in the production of unusually large denominations of [[banknote]]s, including those denominated in amounts of 1,000,000,000 or more.\n* By late 1923, the [[Weimar Republic]] of Germany was issuing two-trillion mark banknotes and postage stamps with a face value of fifty billion marks. The highest value banknote issued by the Weimar government's Reichsbank had a face value of 100 trillion marks (10<sup>14</sup>; 100,000,000,000,000; 100 million million).<ref>1 billion in the German long scale = 1000 milliard = 1 trillion US scale.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sammler.com/coins/inflation.htm |title=Values of the most important German Banknotes of the Inflation Period from 1920 \u2013 1923 |access-date=3 May 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040413214534/http://sammler.com/COINS/inflation.htm |archive-date=13 April 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the height of the inflation, one US dollar was worth 4 trillion German marks.

(As an example, instead of 10,000,000,000 dollars, a central bank might set 1 new dollar = 1,000,000,000 old dollars, so the new note would read \"10 new dollars\".) A recent example of this is Turkey's revaluation of the [[Lira]] on 1 January 2005, when the old [[Turkish lira]] (TRL) was converted to the [[New Turkish lira]] (TRY) at a rate of 1,000,000 old to 1 new Turkish Lira. While this does not lessen the actual value of a currency, it is called [[redenomination]] or [[revaluation]] and also occasionally happens in countries with lower inflation rates. During hyperinflation, currency inflation happens so quickly that bills reach large numbers before revaluation.\n\nSome banknotes were stamped to indicate changes of denomination, as it would have taken too long to print new notes. By the time new notes were printed, they would be obsolete (that is, they would be of too low a denomination to be useful).\n\nMetallic coins were rapid casualties of hyperinflation, as the scrap value of metal enormously exceeded its face value. Massive amounts of coinage were melted down, usually illicitly, and exported for hard currency.\n\nGovernments will often try to disguise the true rate of inflation through a variety of techniques. None of these actions addresses the root causes of inflation; and if discovered, they tend to further undermine trust in the currency, causing further increases in inflation.

Paper currency was introduced during the [[Tang Dynasty]], and was generally welcomed. It maintained its value, as successive Chinese governments put in place strict controls on issuance. The convenience of paper currency for trade purposes led to strong demand for paper currency. It was only when discipline on quantity supplied broke down that hyperinflation emerged.<ref>''The Truth About Inflation'', Chapter 2, [[Paul Donovan (economist)|Paul Donovan]], Routledge 2015</ref> The [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271\u20131368) was the first to print large amounts of fiat paper money to fund its wars, resulting in hyperinflation. Much later, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] went through hyperinflation from 1948 to 1949. In 1947, the highest denomination bill was 50,000 [[Chinese yuan#First yuan, 1889\u20131948|yuan]]. By mid-1948, the highest denomination was 180,000,000 yuan. The 1948 currency reform replaced the yuan by the gold yuan at an exchange rate of 1 gold yuan = 3,000,000 yuan. In less than a year, the highest denomination was 10,000,000 gold yuan. In the final days of the civil war, the silver yuan was briefly introduced at the rate of 500,000,000 gold yuan. Meanwhile, the highest denomination issued by a regional bank was 6,000,000,000 yuan (issued by Xinjiang Provincial Bank in 1949).

This was due to psychological factors related to the fear of shortages and to the hoarding of goods. During the German and Italian [[Axis occupation of Greece]] (1941\u20131944), the agricultural, mineral, industrial etc. production of Greece were used to sustain the occupation forces, but also to secure provisions for the [[Afrika Korps]]. One part of these \"sales\" of provisions was settled with bilateral clearing through the German [[DEGRIGES]] and the Italian Sagic companies at very low prices. As the value of Greek exports in drachmas fell, the demand for drachmas followed suit and so did its forex rate. While shortages started due to naval blockades and hoarding, the prices of commodities soared. The other part of the \"purchases\" was settled with drachmas secured from the Bank of Greece and printed for this purpose by private printing presses. As prices soared, the Germans and Italians started requesting more and more drachmas from the Bank of Greece to offset price increases; each time prices increased, the note circulation followed suit soon afterwards. For the year starting November 1943, the inflation rate was 2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup>%, the circulation was 6.28 \u00d7 10<sup>18</sup> drachmae and one gold sovereign cost 43,167 billion drachmas.

The resolution of the crisis is attributed to [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]], who became [[prime minister of Poland]] in December 1923. Having nominated an all-new government and being granted extraordinary lawmaking powers by the [[Sejm]] for a period of six months, he introduced a new currency, established a new national bank and scrapped the inflation tax, which took place throughout 1924.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbportal.pl/slownik/pozycje-slownika/hiperinflacja|title=Hiperinflacja - Polish National Bank|date=7 May 2015|website=www.nbportal.pl|language=PL|access-date=11 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211235445/https://www.nbportal.pl/slownik/pozycje-slownika/hiperinflacja|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe economic crisis in Poland in the 1980s was accompanied by rising inflation when new money was printed to cover a budget deficit. Although inflation was not as acute as in 1920s, it is estimated that its annual rate reached around 600% in a period of over a year spanning parts of 1989 and 1990. The economy was stabilised by the adoption of the [[Balcerowicz Plan]] in 1989, named after the main author of the reforms, minister of finance [[Leszek Balcerowicz]]. The plan was largely inspired by the previous Grabski's reforms.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Philippines===\nThe Japanese government occupying the Philippines during [[World War II]] issued fiat currencies for general circulation. The Japanese-sponsored [[Second Philippine Republic]] government led by [[Jose P. Laurel]] at the same time outlawed possession of other currencies, most especially \"guerrilla money\". The fiat money's lack of value earned it the derisive nickname \"Mickey Mouse money\". Survivors of the war often tell tales of bringing suitcases or ''bayong'' (native bags made of woven coconut or [[Corypha|buri]] leaf strips) overflowing with Japanese-issued bills.

The Japanese issued [[banana money]] as the official currency to replace the [[Straits dollar|Straits currency]] issued by the British.

As the occupation proceeded, the Japanese authorities printed more money to fund their wartime activities, which resulted in hyperinflation and a severe depreciation in value of the banana note.\n\nFrom February to December 1942, $100 of Straits currency was worth $100 in Japanese [[scrip]], after which the value of Japanese scrip began to erode, reaching $385 on December 1943 and $1,850 one year later.

It does not establish an absolute rule on when hyperinflation arises. Instead, it lists factors that indicate the existence of hyperinflation:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iasplus.com/en/standards/standard28 |title=IAS 29 \u2014 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies |accessdate=10 April 2012 |author=International Accounting Standards |publisher=IASB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404011354/http://www.iasplus.com/en/standards/standard28/ |archive-date=4 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power\n* The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;\n* Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;\n* Interest rates, wages, and prices are linked to a price index; and\n* The cumulative inflation rate over three years approaches, or exceeds, 100%.\n\n==Causes==\nWhile there can be a number of causes of high inflation, most hyperinflations have been caused by government [[budget deficit]]s financed by money creation. [[Peter Bernholz]] analysed 29 hyperinflations (following Cagan's definition) and concludes that at least 25 of them have been caused in this way.<ref>Bernholz, Peter 2003, chapter 5.2 and Table 5.1</ref> A necessary condition for hyperinflation is the use of [[paper money]], instead of gold or silver coins. Most hyperinflations in history, with some exceptions, such as the French hyperinflation of 1789\u20131796, occurred after the use of [[fiat currency]] became widespread in the late 19th century. The French hyperinflation took place after the introduction of a non-convertible paper currency, the [[assignat]]s.\n\n===Money supply===\nHyperinflation occurs when there is a continuing (and often accelerating) rapid increase in the amount of money that is not supported by a corresponding growth in the output of goods and services.\n\nThe increases in price that result from the rapid [[money creation]] creates a vicious circle, requiring ever growing amounts of new money creation to fund government deficits. Hence both [[monetary inflation]] and price inflation proceed at a rapid pace. Such rapidly increasing prices cause widespread unwillingness of the local population to hold the local currency as it rapidly loses its buying power. Instead they quickly spend any money they receive, which increases the [[velocity of money]] flow; this in turn causes further acceleration in prices. This means that the increase in the price level is greater than that of the money supply.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parsson |first=Jens |authorlink=Jens O.

Here M refers to the money stock and P to the price level.\n\nThis results in an imbalance between the [[supply and demand]] for the money (including currency and bank deposits), causing rapid inflation. Very high inflation rates can result in a loss of confidence in the currency, similar to a [[bank run]]. Usually, the excessive money supply growth results from the government being either unable or unwilling to fully finance the government budget through taxation or borrowing, and instead it finances the government budget deficit through the printing of money.<ref name=\"z\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080408131232/http://www.fingaz.co.zw/fingaz/2003/October/October2/1365.shtml Hyperinflation: causes, cures] Bernard Mufute, 2003-10-02, \"Hyperinflation has its root cause in money growth, which is not supported by growth in the output of goods and services.

Inflation can obscure quantitative assessments of the true cost of living, as published price indices only look at data in retrospect, so may increase only months later. [[Monetary inflation]] can become hyperinflation if monetary authorities fail to fund increasing government expenses from [[tax]]es, [[government debt]], cost cutting, or by other means, because either\n* during the time between recording or levying taxable transactions and collecting the taxes due, the value of the taxes collected falls in real value to a small fraction of the original taxes receivable; or\n* government debt issues fail to find buyers except at very deep discounts; or\n* a combination of the above.\n\nTheories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between [[seigniorage]] and the [[inflation tax]]. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position. Thus when [[fiat money]] is printed, government obligations that are not denominated in money increase in cost by more than the value of the money created.\n\n[[File:German Hyperinflation.jpg|right|thumb|The price of gold in Germany, 1 January 1918 \u2013 30 November 1923. (The vertical scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]).]]\n\nFrom this, it might be wondered why any rational government would engage in actions that cause or continue hyperinflation. One reason for such actions is that often the alternative to hyperinflation is either [[depression (economics)|depression]] or military defeat. The root cause is a matter of more dispute. In both [[classical economics]] and [[monetarism]], it is always the result of the monetary authority irresponsibly borrowing money to pay all its expenses. These models focus on the unrestrained [[seigniorage]] of the monetary authority, and the gains from the [[inflation tax]].\n\nIn neo-classical economic theory, hyperinflation is rooted in a deterioration of the [[monetary base]], that is the confidence that there is a store of value that the currency will be able to command later. In this model, the perceived risk of holding currency rises dramatically, and sellers demand increasingly high premiums to accept the currency. This in turn leads to a greater fear that the currency will collapse, causing even higher premiums. One example of this is during periods of warfare, civil war, or intense internal conflict of other kinds: governments need to do whatever is necessary to continue fighting, since the alternative is defeat. Expenses cannot be cut significantly since the main outlay is armaments. Further, a civil war may make it difficult to raise taxes or to collect existing taxes. While in peacetime the deficit is financed by selling bonds, during a war it is typically difficult and expensive to borrow, especially if the war is going poorly for the government in question. The banking authorities, whether central or not, \"monetize\" the deficit, printing money to pay for the government's efforts to survive. The hyperinflation under the [[Chinese Nationalists]] from 1939 to 1945 is a classic example of a government printing money to pay civil war costs. By the end, currency was flown in over the Himalayas, and then old currency was flown out to be destroyed.\n\nHyperinflation is a complex phenomenon and one explanation may not be applicable to all cases. In both of these models, however, whether loss of confidence comes first, or central bank [[seigniorage]], the other phase is ignited. In the case of rapid expansion of the money supply, prices rise rapidly in response to the increased supply of money relative to the supply of goods and services, and in the case of loss of confidence, the monetary authority responds to the risk premiums it has to pay by \"running the printing presses.\"\n\nNevertheless, the immense acceleration process that occurs during hyperinflation (such as during the German hyperinflation of 1922/23) still remains unclear and unpredictable. The transformation of an inflationary development into the hyperinflation has to be identified as a very complex phenomenon, which could be a further advanced research avenue of the [[complexity economics]] in conjunction with research areas like [[mass hysteria]], [[bandwagon effect]], social brain, and [[mirror neuron]]s.<ref>Wolfgang Chr.

Economists see both a rapid increase in the [[money supply]] and an increase in the [[velocity of money]] if the (monetary) inflating is not stopped. Either one, or both of these together are the root causes of inflation and hyperinflation. A dramatic increase in the velocity of money as the cause of hyperinflation is central to the \"crisis of confidence\" model of hyperinflation, where the risk premium that sellers demand for the paper currency over the nominal value grows rapidly. The second theory is that there is first a radical increase in the amount of circulating medium, which can be called the \"monetary model\" of hyperinflation. In either model, the second effect then follows from the first\u2014either too little confidence forcing an increase in the money supply, or too much money destroying confidence.\n\nIn the ''confidence model'', some event, or series of events, such as defeats in battle, or a run on stocks of the specie that back a currency, removes the belief that the authority issuing the money will remain solvent\u2014whether a bank or a government. Because people do not want to hold notes that may become valueless, they want to spend them. Sellers, realizing that there is a higher risk for the currency, demand a greater and greater premium over the original value. Under this model, the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the backing of the currency, often by issuing a completely new one. War is one commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence, particularly losing in a war, as occurred during Napoleonic [[Vienna]], and capital flight, sometimes because of \"contagion\" is another. In this view, the increase in the circulating medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself.\n\nIn the ''monetary model'', hyperinflation is a [[positive feedback]] cycle of rapid monetary expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies, central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiraling costs, often from lax fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When business people perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot \"win\" and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency. Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the [[Washington consensus]] of the 1990s.\n\nWhatever the cause, hyperinflation involves both the supply and [[velocity of money]]. Which comes first is a matter of debate, and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases. But once the hyperinflation is established, the pattern of increasing the money stock, by whichever agencies are allowed to do so, is universal. Because this practice increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for it, the price of the currency, that is the exchange rate, naturally falls relative to other currencies. Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the increase in money supply turns specific areas of pricing power into a general frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless. The purchasing power of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an unacceptable loss of purchasing power. As a result, no one holds currency, which increases the velocity of money, and worsens the crisis.\n\nBecause rapidly rising prices undermine the role of money as a [[store of value]], people try to spend it on real goods or services as quickly as possible. Thus, the monetary model predicts that the velocity of money will increase as a result of an excessive increase in the money supply. At the point when money velocity and prices rapidly accelerate in a [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]], hyperinflation is out of control, because ordinary policy mechanisms, such as increasing reserve requirements, raising interest rates, or cutting government spending will be ineffective and be responded to by shifting away from the rapidly devalued money and towards other means of exchange.\n\nDuring a period of hyperinflation, bank runs, loans for 24-hour periods, switching to alternate currencies, the return to use of gold or silver or even barter become common. Many of the people who hoard gold today expect hyperinflation, and are hedging against it by holding specie. There may also be extensive [[capital flight]] or flight to a \"hard\" currency such as the US dollar. This is sometimes met with [[capital control]]s, an idea that has swung from standard, to anathema, and back into semi-respectability. All of this constitutes an economy that is operating in an \"abnormal\" way, which may lead to decreases in real production. If so, that intensifies the hyperinflation, since it means that the amount of goods in \"too much money chasing too few goods\" formulation is also reduced. This is also part of the vicious circle of hyperinflation.\n\nOnce the vicious circle of hyperinflation has been ignited, dramatic policy means are almost always required. Simply raising interest rates is insufficient. Bolivia, for example, underwent a period of hyperinflation in 1985, where prices increased 12,000% in the space of less than a year. The government raised the price of gasoline, which it had been selling at a huge loss to quiet popular discontent, and the hyperinflation came to a halt almost immediately, since it was able to bring in hard currency by selling its oil abroad. The crisis of confidence ended, and people returned deposits to banks. The German hyperinflation (1919\u2013November 1923) was ended by producing a currency based on assets loaned against by banks, called the [[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]]. Hyperinflation often ends when a civil conflict ends with one side winning.\n\nAlthough [[incomes policy|wage and price controls]] are sometimes used to control or prevent inflation, no episode of hyperinflation has been ended by the use of price controls alone, because price controls that force merchants to sell at prices far below their restocking costs result in shortages that cause prices to rise still further.\n\n[[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel prize]] winner [[Milton Friedman]] said \"We economists don't know much, but we do know how to create a shortage. If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can't sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you'll have a tomato shortage. It's the same with oil or gas.\"<ref>\"Controls blamed for U.S. energy woes\", ''Los Angeles Times'', 13 February 1977, Milton Friedman press conference in Los Angeles.</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00104, Inflation, Tapezieren mit Geldscheinen.jpg|right|thumb|[[inflation in the Weimar Republic|Germany, 1923]]: banknotes had lost so much value that they were used as wallpaper.]]\n\nHyperinflation effectively wipes out the purchasing power of private and public savings; distorts the economy in favor of the hoarding of real assets; causes the monetary base, whether [[money|specie]] or hard currency, to flee the country; and makes the afflicted area anathema to investment.\n\nOne of the most important characteristics of hyperinflation is the accelerating substitution of the inflating money by stable money\u2014gold and silver in former times, then relatively stable foreign currencies after the breakdown of the gold or silver standards ([[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]]' [[Thiers' law|Law]]). If inflation is high enough, government regulations like heavy penalties and fines, often combined with exchange controls, cannot prevent this currency substitution. As a consequence, the inflating currency is usually heavily undervalued compared to stable foreign money in terms of purchasing power parity. So foreigners can live cheaply and buy at low prices in the countries hit by high inflation. It follows that governments that do not succeed in engineering a successful currency reform in time must finally legalize the stable foreign currencies (or, formerly, gold and silver) that threaten to fully substitute the inflating money. Otherwise, their tax revenues, including the inflation tax, will approach zero.<ref name=\"Bernholz, Peter 2003\">Bernholz, Peter 2003</ref> The last episode of hyperinflation in which this process could be observed was in [[Zimbabwe]] in the first decade of the 21st century. In this case, the local money was mainly driven out by the US dollar and the South African rand.\n\nEnactment of price controls to prevent discounting the value of [[paper money]] relative to gold, silver, [[hard currency]], or other commodities fail to force acceptance of a paper money that lacks intrinsic value. If the entity responsible for printing a currency promotes excessive money printing, with other factors contributing a reinforcing effect, hyperinflation usually continues. Hyperinflation is generally associated with paper money, which can easily be used to increase the money supply: add more zeros to the plates and print, or even stamp old notes with new numbers.<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/03/06/jefferson-county-memories/ Jefferson County Miracles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120102/https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/03/06/jefferson-county-memories/ |date=19 January 2018 }}, ''Wall Street Journal'', 6 March 2008.</ref> Historically, there have been numerous episodes of hyperinflation in various countries followed by a return to \"hard money\". Older economies would revert to [[hard currency]] and [[barter (economics)|barter]] when the circulating medium became excessively devalued, generally following a \"run\" on the [[store of value]].\n\nMuch attention on hyperinflation centers on the effect on savers whose investments become worthless. Interest rate changes often cannot keep up with hyperinflation or even high inflation, certainly with contractually fixed interest rates. For example, in the 1970s in the United Kingdom inflation reached 25% per annum, yet interest rates did not rise above 15%\u2014and then only briefly\u2014and many fixed interest rate loans existed. Contractually, there is often no bar to a debtor clearing his long term debt with \"hyperinflated cash\", nor could a lender simply somehow suspend the loan. Contractual \"early redemption penalties\" were (and still are) often based on a penalty of ''n'' months of interest/payment; again no real bar to paying off what had been a large loan. In interwar Germany, for example, much private and corporate debt was effectively wiped out\u2014certainly for those holding fixed interest rate loans.\n\n[[Ludwig von Mises]] used the term \"crack-up boom\" (German: Katastrophenhausse) to describe the economic consequences of an unmitigated increasing in the base-money supply.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ludwig von Mises |title=Human Action |publisher=Fox & Wilkes, San Francisco, 4th edition, 1986 |page=428 |isbn=0-930073-18-5|author-link=Ludwig von Mises |title-link=Human Action |year=1996 }}</ref> As more and more money is provided, interest rates decline towards zero. Realizing that fiat money is losing value, investors will try to place money in assets such as real estate, stocks, even art; as these appear to represent \"real\" value. Asset prices are thus becoming inflated. This potentially spiraling process will ultimately lead to the collapse of the monetary system. The Cantillon effect<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://azizonomics.com/2012/08/07/the-cantillon-effect/|title=The Cantillon Effect|first=John|last=Aziz|date=7 August 2012}}</ref> says that those institutions that receive the new money first are the beneficiaries of the policy.\n\n===Aftermath===\nHyperinflation is ended by drastic remedies, such as imposing the [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] of slashing government expenditures or altering the currency basis. One form this may take is [[dollarization]], the use of a foreign currency (not necessarily the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]) as a national unit of currency. An example was dollarization in Ecuador, initiated in September 2000 in response to a 75% loss of value of the [[Ecuadorian sucre]] in early 2000. But usually the \"dollarization\" takes place in spite of all efforts of the government to prevent it by exchange controls, heavy fines and penalties. The government has thus to try to engineer a successful currency reform stabilizing the value of the money. If it does not succeed with this reform the substitution of the inflating by stable money goes on. Thus it is not surprising that there have been at least seven historical cases in which the good (foreign) money did fully drive out the use of the inflating currency. In the end the government had to legalize the former, for otherwise its revenues would have fallen to zero.<ref name=\"Bernholz, Peter 2003\"/>\n\nHyperinflation has always been a traumatic experience for the people who suffer it, and the next political regime almost always enacts policies to try to prevent its recurrence. Often this means making the central bank very aggressive about maintaining price stability, as was the case with the German [[Bundesbank]], or moving to some hard basis of currency, such as a [[currency board]]. Many governments have enacted extremely stiff [[wage and price controls]] in the wake of hyperinflation, but this does not prevent further inflation of the money supply by the [[central bank]], and always leads to widespread shortages of consumer goods if the controls are rigidly enforced.\n\n===Currency===\nIn countries experiencing hyperinflation, the [[central bank]] often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the smaller denomination notes become worthless. This can result in the production of unusually large denominations of [[banknote]]s, including those denominated in amounts of 1,000,000,000 or more.\n* By late 1923, the [[Weimar Republic]] of Germany was issuing two-trillion mark banknotes and postage stamps with a face value of fifty billion marks. The highest value banknote issued by the Weimar government's Reichsbank had a face value of 100 trillion marks (10<sup>14</sup>; 100,000,000,000,000; 100 million million).<ref>1 billion in the German long scale = 1000 milliard = 1 trillion US scale.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sammler.com/coins/inflation.htm |title=Values of the most important German Banknotes of the Inflation Period from 1920 \u2013 1923 |access-date=3 May 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040413214534/http://sammler.com/COINS/inflation.htm |archive-date=13 April 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the height of the inflation, one US dollar was worth 4 trillion German marks.

The banknotes did not show the numbers in full: \"hundred million b.-peng\u0151\" (\"hundred million trillion peng\u0151\") and \"one milliard b.-peng\u0151\" were spelled out instead. This makes the 100,000,000,000,000 [[Zimbabwean dollar]] banknotes the note with the greatest number of zeros shown.\n* The Post-World War II hyperinflation of Hungary held the record for the most extreme monthly inflation rate ever \u2013 41.9 quadrillion percent (4.19 \u00d7 10<sup>16</sup>%; 41,900,000,000,000,000%) for July 1946, amounting to prices doubling every 15.3 hours. By comparison, recent figures (as of 14 November 2008) estimate Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate at 89.7 [[sextillion]] (10<sup>21</sup>) percent.<ref name=\"cato\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/zimbabwe |title=New Hyperinflation Index (HHIZ) Puts Zimbabwe Inflation at 89.7 sextillion percent |author=Hanke, Steve H. |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |date=17 November 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113221554/http://www.cato.org/zimbabwe |archive-date=13 November 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The highest monthly inflation rate of that period was 79.6 billion percent (7.96 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup>%; 79,600,000,000%), and a doubling time of 24.7 hours.\n\nOne way to avoid the use of large numbers is by declaring a new unit of currency. (As an example, instead of 10,000,000,000 dollars, a central bank might set 1 new dollar = 1,000,000,000 old dollars, so the new note would read \"10 new dollars\".) A recent example of this is Turkey's revaluation of the [[Lira]] on 1 January 2005, when the old [[Turkish lira]] (TRL) was converted to the [[New Turkish lira]] (TRY) at a rate of 1,000,000 old to 1 new Turkish Lira. While this does not lessen the actual value of a currency, it is called [[redenomination]] or [[revaluation]] and also occasionally happens in countries with lower inflation rates. During hyperinflation, currency inflation happens so quickly that bills reach large numbers before revaluation.\n\nSome banknotes were stamped to indicate changes of denomination, as it would have taken too long to print new notes. By the time new notes were printed, they would be obsolete (that is, they would be of too low a denomination to be useful).\n\nMetallic coins were rapid casualties of hyperinflation, as the scrap value of metal enormously exceeded its face value. Massive amounts of coinage were melted down, usually illicitly, and exported for hard currency.\n\nGovernments will often try to disguise the true rate of inflation through a variety of techniques. None of these actions addresses the root causes of inflation; and if discovered, they tend to further undermine trust in the currency, causing further increases in inflation. [[Price controls]] will generally result in shortages and hoarding and extremely high demand for the controlled goods, causing disruptions of [[supply chain]]s. Products available to consumers may diminish or disappear as businesses no longer find it economic to continue producing and/or distributing such goods at the legal prices, further exacerbating the shortages.\n\nThere are also issues with computerized money-handling systems. In Zimbabwe, during the hyperinflation of the Zimbabwe dollar, many [[automated teller machines]] and payment card machines struggled with [[arithmetic overflow]] errors as customers required many billions and trillions of dollars at one time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/31/zimbabwe |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=Tran |title=Zimbabwe knocks 10 zeros off currency amid world's highest inflation |date=31 July 2008 |access-date=17 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202084334/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/31/zimbabwe |archive-date=2 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Notable hyperinflationary episodes==\n\n===Rome===\nDuring the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], Rome underwent hyperinflation caused by years of coinage [[devaluation]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-currency-debasement-contributed-to-fall-of-rome-2016-2|title=This infographic shows how currency debasement contributed to the fall of Rome|work=Business Insider|access-date=18 October 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011080246/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-currency-debasement-contributed-to-fall-of-rome-2016-2|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\n[[File:The Hanke Krus Hyperinflation Table.pdf|right|thumb|Hanke Krus Hyperinflation Table that lists 56 episodes of hyperinflation (following Cagan's definition)]]\nIn 1922, inflation in Austria reached 1,426%, and from 1914 to January 1923, the consumer price index rose by a factor of 11,836, with the highest banknote in denominations of 500,000 [[Austrian krone]]s.<ref>[http://www.fee.org/pdf/the-freeman/0604RMEbeling.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219200751/http://www.fee.org/pdf/the-freeman/0604RMEbeling.pdf|date=19 February 2012}}</ref>{{efn|A banknote with a value of one million krones was printed, but not issued.<ref>{{cite web |title=Austria - 1,000,000 Kronen (1 July 1924) |url=http://www.banknote.ws/COLLECTION/countries/EUR/AUT/AUT0086.htm |website=Bank Note Museum |accessdate=18 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118180937/http://www.banknote.ws/COLLECTION/countries/EUR/AUT/AUT0086.htm |archivedate=18 January 2019}}</ref>}} After [[World War I]], essentially all State enterprises ran at a loss, and the number of state employees in the capital, Vienna, was greater than in the earlier monarchy, even though the new republic was nearly one-eighth of the size.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adam Fergusson|title=When Money Dies: The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxUBAwAAQBAJ|date=12 October 2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-994-6}}</ref>\n\nObserving the Austrian response to developing hyperinflation, which included the hoarding of food and the speculation in foreign currencies, Owen S.

This was due to psychological factors related to the fear of shortages and to the hoarding of goods. During the German and Italian [[Axis occupation of Greece]] (1941\u20131944), the agricultural, mineral, industrial etc. production of Greece were used to sustain the occupation forces, but also to secure provisions for the [[Afrika Korps]]. One part of these \"sales\" of provisions was settled with bilateral clearing through the German [[DEGRIGES]] and the Italian Sagic companies at very low prices. As the value of Greek exports in drachmas fell, the demand for drachmas followed suit and so did its forex rate. While shortages started due to naval blockades and hoarding, the prices of commodities soared. The other part of the \"purchases\" was settled with drachmas secured from the Bank of Greece and printed for this purpose by private printing presses. As prices soared, the Germans and Italians started requesting more and more drachmas from the Bank of Greece to offset price increases; each time prices increased, the note circulation followed suit soon afterwards. For the year starting November 1943, the inflation rate was 2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup>%, the circulation was 6.28 \u00d7 10<sup>18</sup> drachmae and one gold sovereign cost 43,167 billion drachmas.

Both events resulted in the introduction of new currencies. In 1924, the ''z\u0142oty'' replaced the original currency of post-war Poland, the mark. This currency was subsequently replaced by another of the same name in 1950, which was assigned the ISO code of PLZ. As a result of the second hyperinflation crisis, the current ''new z\u0142oty'' was introduced in 1990 (ISO code: PLN). See the article on [[Polish z\u0142oty]] for more information about the currency's history.\n\nThe newly independent Poland had been struggling with a large budget deficit since its inception in 1918 but it was in 1923 when inflation reached its peak. The exchange rate to the American dollar went from 9 Polish marks per dollar in 1918 to 6,375,000 marks per dollar at the end of 1923. A new personal 'inflation tax' was introduced. The resolution of the crisis is attributed to [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]], who became [[prime minister of Poland]] in December 1923. Having nominated an all-new government and being granted extraordinary lawmaking powers by the [[Sejm]] for a period of six months, he introduced a new currency, established a new national bank and scrapped the inflation tax, which took place throughout 1924.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbportal.pl/slownik/pozycje-slownika/hiperinflacja|title=Hiperinflacja - Polish National Bank|date=7 May 2015|website=www.nbportal.pl|language=PL|access-date=11 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211235445/https://www.nbportal.pl/slownik/pozycje-slownika/hiperinflacja|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe economic crisis in Poland in the 1980s was accompanied by rising inflation when new money was printed to cover a budget deficit. Although inflation was not as acute as in 1920s, it is estimated that its annual rate reached around 600% in a period of over a year spanning parts of 1989 and 1990. The economy was stabilised by the adoption of the [[Balcerowicz Plan]] in 1989, named after the main author of the reforms, minister of finance [[Leszek Balcerowicz]].

The Belgrade government of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 backed ethnic Serbian forces in the conflict, resulting in a United Nations boycott of Yugoslavia. The UN boycott collapsed an economy already weakened by regional war, with the projected monthly inflation rate accelerating to one million percent by December 1993 (prices double every 2.3 days).<ref>{{cite news|date=31 December 1993|work=The New York Times|title=Where Zillion Loses Meaning}}</ref>\n\nThe highest denomination in 1988 was 50,000 [[Yugoslav dinar|dinars]].

The highest denomination in 1992 was 50,000 dinars. By 1993, it was 10,000,000,000 dinars. In the 1993 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000 old dinars. Before the year was over, however, the highest denomination was 500,000,000,000 dinars. In the 1994 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000,000 old dinars. In another currency reform a month later, 1 novi dinar was exchanged for 13 million dinars (1 novi dinar = 1 [[German mark]] at the time of exchange).

It features no members of the [[Lou Reed]]-era group other than multi-instrumentalist [[Doug Yule]], who wrote and recorded the album almost entirely by himself. Yule had joined the Velvet Underground prior to recording [[The Velvet Underground (album)|their self-titled third album]], replacing founding member [[John Cale]], and had contributed significantly to the fourth album, ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]''. Following the departures of the remaining founding members (Reed and [[Sterling Morrison]]), Yule took control of the band. Longtime drummer [[Maureen Tucker]] was slated to appear on ''Squeeze'' by Yule, but she was dismissed by the band's manager, [[Steve Sesnick]].\n\nFollowing a promotional tour for the album by Yule and a backing band, Yule called it quits, bringing the Velvet Underground to an end until the group reformed for a tour in 1993. ''Squeeze'' failed to chart and quickly fell into obscurity after its release. Critics generally dismiss the record as \"a Velvet Underground album in name only\".<ref name=\"NME\" />{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\nIn 1971, the Velvet Underground consisted of Doug Yule (vocals, guitar), [[Willie Alexander]] (keyboards, vocals), [[Walter Powers (musician)|Walter Powers]] (bass guitar) and [[Maureen Tucker]] (drums). This version of the band had toured the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in October and November 1971 to support its latest album, ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]'', which had been written and recorded when [[Lou Reed]] was in the band, and which had seen a European release in March 1971. The plan was to record a second and final album for their record company, [[Atlantic Records]], afterwards,<ref>{{Citation | author=\u2014 | title=Velvet Underground (...) ist wieder da | journal=Sounds | date=November\u2013December 1971 | issue=#34}}. Archived on [http://www.thomas-oestreicher.de/vu/sounds/ thomas-oestreicher.de], with English translation included.</ref> but Atlantic lost faith and decided to issue an archive audience recording from 1970 featuring Lou Reed, ''[[Live at Max's Kansas City]]'', instead.\n\nAfter the tour, band manager [[Steve Sesnick]] managed to get a recording deal with [[Polydor]] UK to record a final Velvet Underground album. Alexander, Powers and Tucker were sent back to the United States by Sesnick, however, presumably for him to retain maximum control over the finished product. Thus, although ''Squeeze'' was released nominally as a Velvet Underground album, Yule was the only Velvet to actually perform on it. Yule later said, \"I don't think Moe [Tucker] would have been expensive in money, but too costly in terms of 'management', meaning that she didn't take a lot of bullshit and would have taken a lot of 'handling' on Sesnick's part.\"<ref name=\"Jennifer_Yule\">{{cite web | first= Jennifer| last=Yule | title=The Artist Formerly Unknown as Doug Yule | url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/dougyule/dystory.html | year=1998}} From a Doug Yule fansite.</ref> Yule also recalled that the album \"was done with just me. All the basic tracks were laid down with drums and me. [[Ian Paice]] of [[Deep Purple]] played the drums. So he and I would lay down a track. How much interplay can you have when all it is one guitar or a piano? You can hear that, it's kind of dead. I think you get more when you have 3 or 4 people playing together, they feed off each other, they work together and something comes out of it, it's bigger.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web | first=Pat | last=Thomas | title=Doug Yule interview (Part 2) | url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/yule2.html | date=21 October 1995 | work=Perfect Sound Forever}}</ref>\n\nThe eleven songs that make up ''Squeeze'' were written by Yule and recorded with the help of Ian Paice, with additional occasional saxophone and backing singer assistance.

It features no members of the [[Lou Reed]]-era group other than multi-instrumentalist [[Doug Yule]], who wrote and recorded the album almost entirely by himself. Yule had joined the Velvet Underground prior to recording [[The Velvet Underground (album)|their self-titled third album]], replacing founding member [[John Cale]], and had contributed significantly to the fourth album, ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]''. Following the departures of the remaining founding members (Reed and [[Sterling Morrison]]), Yule took control of the band. Longtime drummer [[Maureen Tucker]] was slated to appear on ''Squeeze'' by Yule, but she was dismissed by the band's manager, [[Steve Sesnick]].\n\nFollowing a promotional tour for the album by Yule and a backing band, Yule called it quits, bringing the Velvet Underground to an end until the group reformed for a tour in 1993. ''Squeeze'' failed to chart and quickly fell into obscurity after its release. Critics generally dismiss the record as \"a Velvet Underground album in name only\".<ref name=\"NME\" />{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\nIn 1971, the Velvet Underground consisted of Doug Yule (vocals, guitar), [[Willie Alexander]] (keyboards, vocals), [[Walter Powers (musician)|Walter Powers]] (bass guitar) and [[Maureen Tucker]] (drums). This version of the band had toured the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in October and November 1971 to support its latest album, ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]'', which had been written and recorded when [[Lou Reed]] was in the band, and which had seen a European release in March 1971. The plan was to record a second and final album for their record company, [[Atlantic Records]], afterwards,<ref>{{Citation | author=\u2014 | title=Velvet Underground (...) ist wieder da | journal=Sounds | date=November\u2013December 1971 | issue=#34}}. Archived on [http://www.thomas-oestreicher.de/vu/sounds/ thomas-oestreicher.de], with English translation included.</ref> but Atlantic lost faith and decided to issue an archive audience recording from 1970 featuring Lou Reed, ''[[Live at Max's Kansas City]]'', instead.\n\nAfter the tour, band manager [[Steve Sesnick]] managed to get a recording deal with [[Polydor]] UK to record a final Velvet Underground album. Alexander, Powers and Tucker were sent back to the United States by Sesnick, however, presumably for him to retain maximum control over the finished product. Thus, although ''Squeeze'' was released nominally as a Velvet Underground album, Yule was the only Velvet to actually perform on it. Yule later said, \"I don't think Moe [Tucker] would have been expensive in money, but too costly in terms of 'management', meaning that she didn't take a lot of bullshit and would have taken a lot of 'handling' on Sesnick's part.\"<ref name=\"Jennifer_Yule\">{{cite web | first= Jennifer| last=Yule | title=The Artist Formerly Unknown as Doug Yule | url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/dougyule/dystory.html | year=1998}} From a Doug Yule fansite.</ref> Yule also recalled that the album \"was done with just me. All the basic tracks were laid down with drums and me. [[Ian Paice]] of [[Deep Purple]] played the drums. So he and I would lay down a track. How much interplay can you have when all it is one guitar or a piano? You can hear that, it's kind of dead. I think you get more when you have 3 or 4 people playing together, they feed off each other, they work together and something comes out of it, it's bigger.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web | first=Pat | last=Thomas | title=Doug Yule interview (Part 2) | url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/yule2.html | date=21 October 1995 | work=Perfect Sound Forever}}</ref>\n\nThe eleven songs that make up ''Squeeze'' were written by Yule and recorded with the help of Ian Paice, with additional occasional saxophone and backing singer assistance. They range from [[The Beatles|Beatles]]-like whimsy (\"Crash\") via pop to typical 1970s [[rock and roll|rock]] (\"Mean Old Man\"). Yule later recalled, \"I remember sitting on a plane writing extensive notes on the mixing of the album. I sent it to Steve and none of my suggestions were taken, I'm sure he didn't even read it.

The parasitic cycle is [[homogonic]], while the free-living cycle is heterogonic. The heterogonic life cycle is advantageous to the parasite because it allows reproduction for one or more generations in the absence of a host.\n\nIn the free-living cycle, the [[rhabditiform]] [[larva]]e passed in the [[human feces|stool]] can either molt twice and become infective filariform larvae (direct development) or molt four times and become free-living adult males and females that mate and produce [[egg (biology)|eggs]] from which rhabditiform larvae hatch. In the direct development, first-stage larvae (L1) transform into infective larvae (IL) via three molts. The indirect route results first in the development of free-living adults that mate; the female lays eggs, which hatch and then develop into IL. The direct route gives IL faster (three days) versus the indirect route (seven to 10 days). However, the indirect route results in an increase in the number of IL produced. Speed of development of IL is traded for increased numbers. The free-living males and females of ''S. stercoralis'' die after one generation; they do not persist in the soil. The latter, in turn, can either develop into a new generation of free-living adults or develop into infective [[filariform]] larvae. The filariform larvae penetrate the human host [[skin]] to initiate the parasitic cycle.\n\nThe infectious larvae penetrate the skin when it contacts soil. While ''S. stercoralis'' is attracted to chemicals such as carbon dioxide or sodium chloride, these chemicals are not specific. Larvae have been thought to locate their hosts via chemicals in the skin, the predominant one being [[urocanic acid]], a [[histidine]] metabolite on the uppermost layer of skin that is removed by sweat or the daily skin-shedding cycle.<ref name=\"acid\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0610193104|title=Urocanic acid is a major chemoattractant for the skin-penetrating parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis|year=2007|last1=Safer|first1=D.|last2=Brenes|first2=M.|last3=Dunipace|first3=S.|last4=Schad|first4=G.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=5|pages=1627\u201330|pmid=17234810|pmc=1785286|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.1627S}}</ref> Urocanic acid concentrations can be up to five times greater in the foot than any other part of the human body. Some of them enter the superficial veins and are carried in the blood to the lungs, where they enter the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]. They are then coughed up and swallowed into the gut, where they parasitise the [[intestinal]] mucosa of the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]]. In the small intestine, they molt twice and become adult female [[worm]]s.  The females live threaded in the [[epithelium]] of the small intestine and, by [[parthenogenesis]], produce eggs, which yield rhabditiform larvae. Only females will reach reproductive adulthood in the intestine. Female strongyloids reproduce through parthenogenesis. The eggs hatch in the intestine and young larvae are then excreted in the feces. It takes about two weeks to reach egg development from the initial skin penetration. By this process, ''S. stercoralis'' can cause both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. The worms also participate in autoinfection, in which the rhabditiform larvae become infective filariform larvae, which can penetrate either the intestinal mucosa (internal autoinfection) or the skin of the perianal area (external autoinfection); in either case, the filariform larvae may follow the previously described route, being carried successively to the lungs, the bronchial tree, the [[pharynx]], and the [[small intestine]], where they mature into adults; or they may disseminate widely in the body.  To date, occurrence of autoinfection in humans with helminthic infections is recognized only in ''Strongyloides stercoralis'' and ''[[Capillaria philippinensis]]'' infections.  In the case of ''Strongyloides'', autoinfection may explain the possibility of persistent infections for many years in persons not having been in an endemic area and of hyperinfections in immunodepressed individuals.\n\n==Zoonotic transmission==\n\nDogs can act as a host for this parasite both in the wild and in the laboratory but [[zoonosis|transmission from dog to human]] has been difficult to prove. Molecular genetic analyses have shown that there are two populations of this parasite in dogs, one of which (type B) is exclusive to dogs and a second (type A) that is common to dogs and humans.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-05049-x|pmid=28687738|title=A possible origin population of pathogenic intestinal nematodes, Strongyloides stercoralis, unveiled by molecular phylogeny|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=7|issue=1|pages=4844|year=2017|last1=Nagayasu|first1=Eiji|last2=Thet Hnin Htwe Aung|first2=Myo Pa Pa|last3=Hortiwakul|first3=Thanaporn|last4=Hino|first4=Akina|last5=Tanaka|first5=Teruhisa|last6=Higashiarakawa|first6=Miwa|last7=Olia|first7=Alex|last8=Tomoyo|first8=Taniguchi|last9=Thu Win|first9=Soe Moe|last10=Ohashi|first10=Isao|last11=Odongo-Aginya|first11=Emmanuel I.|last12=Aye|first12=Khin Myo|last13=Mon|first13=Mon|last14=Win|first14=Kyu Kyu|last15=Ota|first15=Kei|last16=Torisu|first16=Yukari|last17=Panthuwong|first17=Siripen|last18=Kimura|first18=Eisaku|last19=Palacpac|first19=Nirianne M.Q.|last20=Kikuchi|first20=Taisei|last21=Hirata|first21=Tetsuo|last22=Torisu|first22=Shidow|last23=Hisaeda|first23=Hajime|last24=Horii|first24=Toshihiro|last25=Fujita|first25=Jiro|last26=Htike|first26=Wah Win|last27=Maruyama|first27=Haruhiko|pmc=5501853}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005752|pmid=28793306|title=Different but overlapping populations of Strongyloides stercoralis in dogs and humans\u2014Dogs as a possible source for zoonotic strongyloidiasis|journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases|volume=11|issue=8|pages=e0005752|year=2017|last1=Jaleta|first1=Tegegn G.|last2=Zhou|first2=Siyu|last3=Bemm|first3=Felix M.|last4=Sch\u00e4r|first4=Fabian|last5=Khieu|first5=Virak|last6=Muth|first6=Sinuon|last7=Odermatt|first7=Peter|last8=Lok|first8=James B.|last9=Streit|first9=Adrian|pmc=5565190}}</ref> These two genotypes may be separate species.

Males can be distinguished from females by two structures: the [[spicule (nematode)|spicules]] and [[Gubernaculum (nematode anatomy)|gubernaculum]].\n\n==Autoinfection==\nAn unusual feature of ''S. stercoralis'' is autoinfection. Only one other species in the genus ''Strongyloides'', ''S. felis'', has this trait. Autoinfection is the development of L1 into small infective larvae in the gut of the host. These autoinfective larvae penetrate the wall of the lower ileum or colon or the skin of the perianal region, enter the circulation again, travel to the lungs, and then to the small intestine, thus repeating the cycle. Autoinfection makes strongyloidiasis due to ''S. stercoralis'' an infection with several unusual features.\n\nPersistence of infection is the first of these important features. Because of autoinfection, humans have been known to still be infected up to 65 years after they were first exposed to the parasite (e.g., [[World War II]] or [[Vietnam War]] veterans). Once a host is infected with ''S. stercoralis'', infection is lifelong unless effective treatment eliminates all adult parasites and migrating autoinfective larvae.\n\n==Symptoms==\n{{main|Strongyloidiasis}}\nMany people infected are asymptomatic at first. Symptoms include [[dermatitis]]: swelling, itching, [[larva currens]], and mild hemorrhage at the site where the skin has been penetrated. Spontaneous scratch-like lesions may be seen on the face or elsewhere. If the parasite reaches the lungs, the chest may feel as if it is burning, and wheezing and coughing may result, along with pneumonia-like symptoms ([[L\u00f6ffler's syndrome]]). The intestines could eventually be invaded, leading to burning pain, tissue damage, sepsis, and ulcers. Stools may have yellow [[mucus]] with a recognizable smell. Chronic [[diarrhea]] can be a symptom.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thamwiwat|first1=Alisa|last2=Mejia|first2=Rojelio|last3=Nutman|first3=Thomas B.|last4=Bates|first4=Jeffrey T.|title=Strongyloidiasis as a Cause of Chronic Diarrhea, Identified Using Next-Generation Strongyloides stercoralis-Specific Immunoassays|journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports|date=6 July 2014|volume=1|issue=3|pages=145\u2013147|doi=10.1007/s40475-014-0026-7|doi-access=free}}</ref> In severe cases, edema may result in obstruction of the intestinal tract, as well as loss of [[peristalsis|peristaltic]] contractions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=L. |last2=Janovy |first2=J., Jr. |title=Foundations of Parasitology |year=2005 |pages=414\u2013415 |location=Boston |publisher=McGraw Hill |edition=7th |isbn=0071112715 }}</ref>\n\nStrongyloidiasis in immunocompetent individuals is usually an indolent disease.

In addition, diseases such as [[human T-lymphotropic virus 1]], which enhance the Th1 arm of the immune system and lessen the Th2 arm, increase the disease state.<ref name=HS/> Another consequence of autoinfection is the autoinfective larvae can carry gut bacteria back into the body. About 50% of people with hyperinfection present with bacterial disease due to enteric bacteria. Also, a unique effect of autoinfective larvae is larva currens due to the rapid migration of the larvae through the skin. Larva currens appears as a red line that moves rapidly (more than {{convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} per day), and then quickly disappears. It is pathognomonic for autoinfective larvae and can be used as a diagnostic criterion for strongyloidiasis due to ''S. stercoralis''.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nLocating juvenile larvae, either rhabditiform or filariform, in recent stool samples will confirm the presence of this parasite.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=L. |last2=Janovy |first2=J., Jr. |title=Foundations of Parasitology |year=2005 |page=415 |location=Boston |publisher=McGraw Hill |edition=7th |isbn=0071112715 }}</ref> Other techniques used include direct fecal smears, culturing fecal samples on [[agar]] plates, serodiagnosis through [[ELISA]], and duodenal fumigation.

Hence, repeated treatments with ivermectin must be administered to kill adult parasites that develop from the autoinfective larvae.

The parasitic cycle is [[homogonic]], while the free-living cycle is heterogonic. The heterogonic life cycle is advantageous to the parasite because it allows reproduction for one or more generations in the absence of a host.\n\nIn the free-living cycle, the [[rhabditiform]] [[larva]]e passed in the [[human feces|stool]] can either molt twice and become infective filariform larvae (direct development) or molt four times and become free-living adult males and females that mate and produce [[egg (biology)|eggs]] from which rhabditiform larvae hatch. In the direct development, first-stage larvae (L1) transform into infective larvae (IL) via three molts. The indirect route results first in the development of free-living adults that mate; the female lays eggs, which hatch and then develop into IL. The direct route gives IL faster (three days) versus the indirect route (seven to 10 days). However, the indirect route results in an increase in the number of IL produced. Speed of development of IL is traded for increased numbers. The free-living males and females of ''S. stercoralis'' die after one generation; they do not persist in the soil. The latter, in turn, can either develop into a new generation of free-living adults or develop into infective [[filariform]] larvae. The filariform larvae penetrate the human host [[skin]] to initiate the parasitic cycle.\n\nThe infectious larvae penetrate the skin when it contacts soil. While ''S. stercoralis'' is attracted to chemicals such as carbon dioxide or sodium chloride, these chemicals are not specific. Larvae have been thought to locate their hosts via chemicals in the skin, the predominant one being [[urocanic acid]], a [[histidine]] metabolite on the uppermost layer of skin that is removed by sweat or the daily skin-shedding cycle.<ref name=\"acid\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0610193104|title=Urocanic acid is a major chemoattractant for the skin-penetrating parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis|year=2007|last1=Safer|first1=D.|last2=Brenes|first2=M.|last3=Dunipace|first3=S.|last4=Schad|first4=G.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=5|pages=1627\u201330|pmid=17234810|pmc=1785286|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.1627S}}</ref> Urocanic acid concentrations can be up to five times greater in the foot than any other part of the human body. Some of them enter the superficial veins and are carried in the blood to the lungs, where they enter the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]. They are then coughed up and swallowed into the gut, where they parasitise the [[intestinal]] mucosa of the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]]. In the small intestine, they molt twice and become adult female [[worm]]s.  The females live threaded in the [[epithelium]] of the small intestine and, by [[parthenogenesis]], produce eggs, which yield rhabditiform larvae. Only females will reach reproductive adulthood in the intestine. Female strongyloids reproduce through parthenogenesis. The eggs hatch in the intestine and young larvae are then excreted in the feces. It takes about two weeks to reach egg development from the initial skin penetration. By this process, ''S. stercoralis'' can cause both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. The worms also participate in autoinfection, in which the rhabditiform larvae become infective filariform larvae, which can penetrate either the intestinal mucosa (internal autoinfection) or the skin of the perianal area (external autoinfection); in either case, the filariform larvae may follow the previously described route, being carried successively to the lungs, the bronchial tree, the [[pharynx]], and the [[small intestine]], where they mature into adults; or they may disseminate widely in the body even in brain<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oktar|first=Nezih|last2=\u00d6zer|first2=Haluk|last3=Demirta\u015f|first3=Eren|date=2018-09-28|title=Central nervous system Strongyloides stercoralis.

Males can be distinguished from females by two structures: the [[spicule (nematode)|spicules]] and [[Gubernaculum (nematode anatomy)|gubernaculum]].\n\n==Autoinfection==\nAn unusual feature of ''S. stercoralis'' is autoinfection. Only one other species in the genus ''Strongyloides'', ''S. felis'', has this trait. Autoinfection is the development of L1 into small infective larvae in the gut of the host. These autoinfective larvae penetrate the wall of the lower ileum or colon or the skin of the perianal region, enter the circulation again, travel to the lungs, and then to the small intestine, thus repeating the cycle. Autoinfection makes strongyloidiasis due to ''S. stercoralis'' an infection with several unusual features.\n\nPersistence of infection is the first of these important features. Because of autoinfection, humans have been known to still be infected up to 65 years after they were first exposed to the parasite (e.g., [[World War II]] or [[Vietnam War]] veterans). Once a host is infected with ''S. stercoralis'', infection is lifelong unless effective treatment eliminates all adult parasites and migrating autoinfective larvae.\n\n==Symptoms==\n{{main|Strongyloidiasis}}\nMany people infected are asymptomatic at first. Symptoms include [[dermatitis]]: swelling, itching, [[larva currens]], and mild hemorrhage at the site where the skin has been penetrated. Spontaneous scratch-like lesions may be seen on the face or elsewhere. If the parasite reaches the lungs, the chest may feel as if it is burning, and wheezing and coughing may result, along with pneumonia-like symptoms ([[L\u00f6ffler's syndrome]]). The intestines could eventually be invaded, leading to burning pain, tissue damage, sepsis, and ulcers. Stools may have yellow [[mucus]] with a recognizable smell. Chronic [[diarrhea]] can be a symptom.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thamwiwat|first1=Alisa|last2=Mejia|first2=Rojelio|last3=Nutman|first3=Thomas B.|last4=Bates|first4=Jeffrey T.|title=Strongyloidiasis as a Cause of Chronic Diarrhea, Identified Using Next-Generation Strongyloides stercoralis-Specific Immunoassays|journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports|date=6 July 2014|volume=1|issue=3|pages=145\u2013147|doi=10.1007/s40475-014-0026-7|doi-access=free}}</ref> In severe cases, edema may result in obstruction of the intestinal tract, as well as loss of [[peristalsis|peristaltic]] contractions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=L. |last2=Janovy |first2=J., Jr. |title=Foundations of Parasitology |year=2005 |pages=414\u2013415 |location=Boston |publisher=McGraw Hill |edition=7th |isbn=0071112715 }}</ref>\n\nStrongyloidiasis in immunocompetent individuals is usually an indolent disease.

In addition, diseases such as [[human T-lymphotropic virus 1]], which enhance the Th1 arm of the immune system and lessen the Th2 arm, increase the disease state.<ref name=HS/> Another consequence of autoinfection is the autoinfective larvae can carry gut bacteria back into the body. About 50% of people with hyperinfection present with bacterial disease due to enteric bacteria. Also, a unique effect of autoinfective larvae is larva currens due to the rapid migration of the larvae through the skin. Larva currens appears as a red line that moves rapidly (more than {{convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} per day), and then quickly disappears. It is pathognomonic for autoinfective larvae and can be used as a diagnostic criterion for strongyloidiasis due to ''S. stercoralis''.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nLocating juvenile larvae, either rhabditiform or filariform, in recent stool samples will confirm the presence of this parasite.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=L. |last2=Janovy |first2=J., Jr. |title=Foundations of Parasitology |year=2005 |page=415 |location=Boston |publisher=McGraw Hill |edition=7th |isbn=0071112715 }}</ref> Other techniques used include direct fecal smears, culturing fecal samples on [[agar]] plates, serodiagnosis through [[ELISA]], and duodenal fumigation.

Hence, repeated treatments with ivermectin must be administered to kill adult parasites that develop from the autoinfective larvae. This means the full treatment dose of ivermectin every two weeks, to kill all non-larvae adult strongyloids before further reproduction leading to auto-infection, until all larvae capable of maturing into adult strongyloides are extirpated.

In September 1950, he convened a meeting of [[American Jewish]] leaders at Jerusalem's [[King David Hotel]], where he proposed issuing bonds to help provide Israel with a more secure economic foundation.

Compounding the dire situation, Israel faced unique economic demands, especially the arrival of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from post [[World War II]] Europe and the [[Middle East]].\n\nShort on economic resources, Israel suffered food shortages and imposed rationing, and new arrivals had to be housed in primitive shelters.<ref name=\"UK website\">{{cite web|url=http://www.israelukbonds.com/about.html|title=IsraelUKbonds \u2013 About Us|publisher=Development Company for Israel (UK) Ltd|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nWith the country financially overwhelmed, Ben-Gurion turned to the [[Diaspora]] community for help. Ben-Gurion's goals were two-fold: to obtain millions of dollars in funding for immigrant absorption and the construction of national infrastructure, and to engage Diaspora Jewry as active partners in building the new Jewish state. In September 1950, he convened a meeting of [[American Jewish]] leaders at Jerusalem's [[King David Hotel]], where he proposed issuing bonds to help provide Israel with a more secure economic foundation. The American Jewish leaders supported Ben-Gurion's plan and, the following spring, the prime minister traveled to [[New York City]] to help launch the inaugural Independence Issue at a [[Madison Square Garden]] ceremony.

A second film, called ''Nightmare 2'' was released in December 2014.{{CN|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe show's gay storyline between [[Elias Vikstedt|Elias]] (Petteri Paavola) and [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Lari]] (Ronny R\u00f6sl\u00f6f), nicknamed \"Larias\", initially proved very popular on [[YouTube]]. Scenes featuring their storyline were uploaded by a user called \"missfinlandia88\". As her account got terminated, she created a new one, \"Elias' Story\". She claims to have had the permission of MTV3 and FremantleMedia to post the clips.<ref>http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat.shtml/kotimaiset/salatut_elamat/uutiset_kevat_2013/1684854/ (Finnish)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928101025/http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat.shtml/kotimaiset/salatut_elamat/uutiset_kevat_2013/1684854/ |date=28 September 2013 }}</ref> Elias was killed off in November 2016 but was seen in some dream scenes later on. The final parts, up to 459, can be seen on the \"Lauri K\" channel on YouTube.\n\n==Themes==\nThe series has dealt with a wider range of subjects such as [[abortion]], [[drug abuse]], [[alcoholism]], [[homosexuality]], [[incest]], [[animal rights]], [[rape]], [[religious fanaticism]], [[gambling addiction]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[domestic violence]], [[cancer]], [[eating disorder]], [[school bullying]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and its effects to the family, the search of biological parents, [[stealing]] and [[racism]]; many episodes involving these themes have caused public debate.\n\nAn exceptionally widespread controversy was started by the season finale aired on 1 June 2009. In the episode, a pregnant woman, [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Paula Sievinen]] ([[Johanna Nurmimaa]]), was seemingly [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and a caf\u00e9 exploded during a wedding celebration, which implied death of many main characters. Many, including Finland's Minister of Communications [[Suvi Lind\u00e9n]], questioned the show's suitability for school children. FICORA (Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority) decided later that the episode was not suitable for children under the age of 11, but the show's programming slot was late enough to meet the regulations.<ref>http://www.ficora.fi/index/viestintavirasto/uutiset/2009/P_51.html FICORA's report concernig the episode (Finnish)</ref><ref>http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/Salatut+el%C3%A4m%C3%A4t+kirvoitti+keskustelun+v%C3%A4kivallasta/1135246466933 A news article about the controversy published by [[Helsingin Sanomat]] (Finnish)</ref> In 2013, the original main character [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Jenni Vainio]] played by [[Anu Palevaara]], was shot on front of the main house and it caused a lot of talk among the fans of the series. Jenni left the series after 14 years presence. However, producer Marko \u00c4ij\u00f6 said that the biggest sensation of the series was in the early days, when [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Kalle Laitela]], played by Pete Lattu, kissed another man. At that time, the channel MTV3 received over 40 meters of [[fax]] about the kiss.<ref>[[:fi:Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t(Finnish)]]</ref>\n\nDuring the series' entire run in Finland, a 30-minute episode has aired every weekday in an early-evening slot at 7:30 pm. A new season usually premieres in either late August or early September and concludes by the beginning of June. Normally, the series is on a hiatus during the Christmas holidays, approximately 3 or 4 weeks. The series' episodes are also available online at the website http://katsomo.fi/ for 30 days after their original airing.\n\n==Settings==\n''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t's'' main focus is the fictional street ''Pihlajakatu'', located in [[Ullanlinna]], Helsinki. Other locations include a high school, a hospital, ''Caf\u00e9 Moose'' and an inn, ''Amanda'', which contains the hotel, a restaurant and a gym ''Amadeus''. Former \"main caf\u00e9\" was ''Kentauri'' which, however, exploded during a wedding celebration in the season finale of the 11th season.\n\nAll of the houses and other locations featured in the show are filmed at the FremantleMedia studio in Konala, Helsinki. In real life, Pihlajakatu is Huvilakatu, which is located in Ullanlinna, Helsinki. ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4''t has also filmed scenes in [[Tampere]] and in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. A few episodes have also been filmed in the [[Canary Islands]], [[Lithuania]] and [[London]].\n\n==Theme song==\nThe original theme song was called ''Tunteisiin'' and performed by Anna Hanski but in 2001, the theme was changed to a version performed by Jore Marjaranta. In 2004, the theme song was replaced by an electronic version of the theme music. In 2014, the theme song was switched back to the original one, first heard on 1999. In 2019, the series got completely new theme song again.\n\n==Television ratings==\nSince its first episode aired in January 1999, it has been one of the most popular TV shows in Finland, regularly attracting around a [[million]] viewers (1/5 of Finland's population). At the moment ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t'' is the highest-rated drama series in Finland, although its viewership has declined during the past few years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n!

The series' storylines follow the daily lives of several families who live in the same apartment block in [[Helsinki]].

The teen thriller movie ''Nightmare \u2013 Painajainen merell\u00e4'' (''\"Nightmare \u2013 Nightmare at Sea\"'') was one of the most watched Finnish films of 2012. The film was directed by Marko \u00c4ij\u00f6 and the main characters are [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Peppi]] (Sara S\u00e4kkinen), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Heidi]] (Venla Savikuja), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Jiri]] (Mikko Parikka), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Joonatan]] (Markku Pulli), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Miro]] (Patrik Borodavkin), [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Oona]] (Sara Lohiniva) and [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Sampo]] (Sampsa Tuomala). Nightmare - Painajainen merell\u00e4 also won the [[Jussi Award]] in the category Public Favorite. A second film, called ''Nightmare 2'' was released in December 2014.{{CN|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe show's gay storyline between [[Elias Vikstedt|Elias]] (Petteri Paavola) and [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Lari]] (Ronny R\u00f6sl\u00f6f), nicknamed \"Larias\", initially proved very popular on [[YouTube]]. Scenes featuring their storyline were uploaded by a user called \"missfinlandia88\". As her account got terminated, she created a new one, \"Elias' Story\". She claims to have had the permission of MTV3 and FremantleMedia to post the clips.<ref>http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat.shtml/kotimaiset/salatut_elamat/uutiset_kevat_2013/1684854/ (Finnish)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928101025/http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat.shtml/kotimaiset/salatut_elamat/uutiset_kevat_2013/1684854/ |date=28 September 2013 }}</ref> Elias was killed off in November 2016 but was seen in some dream scenes later on. The final parts, up to 459, can be seen on the \"Lauri K\" channel on YouTube.\n\n==Themes==\nThe series has dealt with a wider range of subjects such as [[abortion]], [[drug abuse]], [[alcoholism]], [[homosexuality]], [[incest]], [[animal rights]], [[rape]], [[religious fanaticism]], [[gambling addiction]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[domestic violence]], [[cancer]], [[eating disorder]], [[school bullying]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and its effects to the family, the search of biological parents, [[stealing]] and [[racism]]; many episodes involving these themes have caused public debate.\n\nAn exceptionally widespread controversy was started by the season finale aired on 1 June 2009. In the episode, a pregnant woman, [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Paula Sievinen]] ([[Johanna Nurmimaa]]), was seemingly [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and a caf\u00e9 exploded during a wedding celebration, which implied death of many main characters. Many, including Finland's Minister of Communications [[Suvi Lind\u00e9n]], questioned the show's suitability for school children. FICORA (Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority) decided later that the episode was not suitable for children under the age of 11, but the show's programming slot was late enough to meet the regulations.<ref>http://www.ficora.fi/index/viestintavirasto/uutiset/2009/P_51.html FICORA's report concernig the episode (Finnish)</ref><ref>http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/Salatut+el%C3%A4m%C3%A4t+kirvoitti+keskustelun+v%C3%A4kivallasta/1135246466933 A news article about the controversy published by [[Helsingin Sanomat]] (Finnish)</ref> In 2013, the original main character [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Jenni Vainio]] played by [[Anu Palevaara]], was shot on front of the main house and it caused a lot of talk among the fans of the series. Jenni left the series after 14 years presence. However, producer Marko \u00c4ij\u00f6 said that the biggest sensation of the series was in the early days, when [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t#Recent characters|Kalle Laitela]], played by Pete Lattu, kissed another man. At that time, the channel MTV3 received over 40 meters of [[fax]] about the kiss.<ref>[[:fi:Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t(Finnish)]]</ref>\n\nDuring the series' entire run in Finland, a 30-minute episode has aired every weekday in an early-evening slot at 7:30 pm. A new season usually premieres in either late August or early September and concludes by the beginning of June. Normally, the series is on a hiatus during the Christmas holidays, approximately 3 or 4 weeks. The series' episodes are also available online at the website http://katsomo.fi/ for 30 days after their original airing.\n\n==Settings==\n''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t's'' main focus is the fictional street ''Pihlajakatu'', located in [[Ullanlinna]], Helsinki. Other locations include a high school, a hospital, ''Caf\u00e9 Moose'' and an inn, ''Amanda'', which contains the hotel, a restaurant and a gym ''Amadeus''. Former \"main caf\u00e9\" was ''Kentauri'' which, however, exploded during a wedding celebration in the season finale of the 11th season.\n\nAll of the houses and other locations featured in the show are filmed at the FremantleMedia studio in Konala, Helsinki. In real life, Pihlajakatu is Huvilakatu, which is located in Ullanlinna, Helsinki. ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4''t has also filmed scenes in [[Tampere]] and in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. A few episodes have also been filmed in the [[Canary Islands]], [[Lithuania]] and [[London]].\n\n==Theme song==\nThe original theme song was called ''Tunteisiin'' and performed by Anna Hanski but in 2001, the theme was changed to a version performed by Jore Marjaranta. In 2004, the theme song was replaced by an electronic version of the theme music. In 2014, the theme song was switched back to the original one, first heard on 1999. In 2019, the series got completely new theme song again.\n\n==Television ratings==\nSince its first episode aired in January 1999, it has been one of the most popular TV shows in Finland, regularly attracting around a [[million]] viewers (1/5 of Finland's population). At the moment ''Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t'' is the highest-rated drama series in Finland, although its viewership has declined during the past few years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n!

His musical style spans several genres, including [[Rock music|rock]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[jazz]], [[Classical music|classical]], and [[J-pop]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early life===\nBorn in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], Meguro became familiar with [[technology]] from a young age, due to his parents running a factory.<ref name=\"GMO\">{{cite web|last1=Greening|first1=Chris|title=Shoji Meguro Profile|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/shojimeguro/|publisher=Video Game Music Online|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401123315/http://www.vgmonline.net/shojimeguro/|archivedate=April 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As a child, Meguro did not take an interest in [[popular music]], and instead listened to and enjoyed [[classical music|classical]]. In junior high, he became interested in the likes of [[jazz]] artists such as [[T-Square (band)|T-Square]], [[Herb Alpert]], and [[Casiopea]]. It was in junior high that he became particularly fond of writing and profiteering music.<ref name=\"GMO\"/> He then majored in [[fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]] at the College of Industrial Technology at [[Nihon University]].<ref name=\"GMO\"/>\n\n===Atlus===\nAfter sending a [[Demo (music)|demo]] tape and attending two interviews, Meguro was hired by [[Atlus]] in 1995. He got his start in the company by working on ''[[Revelations: Persona]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], for which he composed 16 tracks, including one that became a staple in the series: \"Aria of the Soul\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Shoji Meguro interview |url=http://interviews.rocketbaby.net/interviews_meguro_2.html |publisher=RocketBaby |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020826234017/http://interviews.rocketbaby.net/interviews_meguro_2.html |archivedate=August 26, 2002 }}</ref> Meguro continued to work on several projects in the mid to late 1990s, including ''[[Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers]]'' on the [[Sega Saturn]], composing around 50 pieces for the game, as well as ''[[Maken X]]'' on the [[Dreamcast]].<ref name=\"GMO\"/>\n\nThe first time he became a leading composer was on ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne]]'' in 2003, where he somewhat diverged from the music in the prior games for the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series, giving the game a more [[orchestral]] and [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] sound. A crucial point of his career was ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga|Digital Devil Saga]]''; he had creative freedom that let him establish his own sound.<ref name=\"GMO\"/> In 2005, Meguro took a break from the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' series to work on titles such as ''[[Trauma Center: Under the Knife]]'', ''[[Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army]]'', and ''[[Trauma Center: Second Opinion]]''.\n\nMeguro's career was propelled to international stardom in his craft with his work on ''[[Persona 3]]'', where he used a pop-based vocal style, and the soundtrack to the game sold over 100,000 copies. In 2008, Meguro continued upon his success with ''[[Persona 4]]'', where he blended genres to craft a unique sound. A concert at [[Akasaka Blitz]] was held to celebrate Meguro's work on the ''Persona'' series, where ''Persona'' favorites were played. During this time, he also worked on the music on ''[[Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon]]''.<ref name=\"GMO\"/>\n\nMeguro was promoted to game director for the [[PlayStation Portable]] remake of ''Persona''. During this time he received some criticism from some fans for changing the soundtrack for the remake, but overall received a warm response. He later directed the PSP ports of both ''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin]]'' and ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment|Eternal Punishment]]''. In the mid-2010s, Meguro served as the sound director for three spin-off ''Persona'' titles, as well as composing and producing the majority of the soundtrack for ''[[Persona 5]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greening|first1=Chris|title=Atlus releases three-disc Persona 5 album|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/atlus-releases-three-disc-persona-5-album/|website=Video Game Music Online|accessdate=January 22, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118070143/http://www.vgmonline.net/atlus-releases-three-disc-persona-5-album/|archivedate=January 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Glixel\">{{cite web|last1=Mielke|first1=James|title='Persona 5' Creators Talk Series' Legacy, Character Design and J-Pop|url=http://www.glixel.com/interviews/persona-5-creators-talk-legacy-character-design-and-j-pop-w480818|website=Glixel|accessdate=May 12, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707024530/http://www.glixel.com/interviews/persona-5-creators-talk-legacy-character-design-and-j-pop-w480818|archivedate=July 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Meguro also contributed to the upcoming ''Project Re Fantasy'' game, the film ''Mint'', and ''[[Persona 5 Royal]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Sal|title=First details on Atlus\u2019 new fantasy RPG, \u201cProject Re Fantasy\u201d [Update]|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/12/first-details-atlus-new-fantasy-rpg-project-re-fantasy|website=Gematsu|accessdate=December 22, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222153823/http://gematsu.com/2016/12/first-details-atlus-new-fantasy-rpg-project-re-fantasy|archivedate=December 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=First |first1=Marlene |title=NEGA, Persona Creators Make Anime-Live Action Film Mint |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-07-22/nega-persona-creators-make-anime-live-action-film-mint |website=Anime News Network |accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Sal |title=Persona 5 Royal launches October 31 in Japan, 2020 in the west; first details, trailer, and screenshots |url=https://gematsu.com/2019/04/persona-5-royal-launches-october-31-in-japan-2020-in-the-west-first-details-trailer-and-screenshots |website=Gematsu |accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref> He also served as the lead composer for ''[[Persona 5: The Animation]]'', arranging various tracks from the original game in addition to writing new material.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Reilly|title=Shoji Meguro returning for Persona 5 anime|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/shoji-meguro-returning-for-persona-5-anime/|website=Video Game Music Online|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Musical style and influences==\nAlthough many of his works feature a signature [[Rock music|rock]] style, Meguro experiments with different musical genres, such as [[orchestral]], [[electronica]], [[jazz]], and [[hip hop]] on various projects.<ref name=\"Glixel\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wan|first1=Zhiqing|title=Twinfinite\u2019s Endless Playlist: Persona 5\u2019s Soundtrack and the Definition of Smoothness|url=http://twinfinite.net/2017/07/twinfinites-endless-playlist-persona-5-soundtrack/|website=Twinfinite|accessdate=July 31, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801000447/http://twinfinite.net/2017/07/twinfinites-endless-playlist-persona-5-soundtrack/|archivedate=August 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Meguro cites video game composers [[Koichi Sugiyama]], [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (composer)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]], and [[Takenobu Mitsuyoshi]], as well as [[T-Square (band)|T-Square]], [[Casiopea]], [[Beethoven]], and [[Tchaikovsky]] as some of his musical influences.<ref name=\"Glixel\"/><ref name=\"GMO\"/> Regarding the use of English lyrics in many of the ''Persona'' games, Meguro stated that due to the Japanese people not fully understanding the language, it helped create music that was not as distracting to them as Japanese would be.<ref name=\"Glixel\"/>\n\n==Works==\nAll works listed below were composed by Meguro unless otherwise noted.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"auto\"\n|+ Video games\n!

In junior high, he became interested in the likes of [[jazz]] artists such as [[T-Square (band)|T-Square]], [[Herb Alpert]], and [[Casiopea]]. It was in junior high that he became particularly fond of writing and profiteering music.<ref name=\"GMO\"/> He then majored in [[fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]] at the College of Industrial Technology at [[Nihon University]].<ref name=\"GMO\"/>\n\n===Atlus===\nAfter sending a [[Demo (music)|demo]] tape and attending two interviews, Meguro was hired by [[Atlus]] in 1995. He got his start in the company by working on ''[[Revelations: Persona]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], for which he composed 16 tracks, including one that became a staple in the series: \"Aria of the Soul\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Shoji Meguro interview |url=http://interviews.rocketbaby.net/interviews_meguro_2.html |publisher=RocketBaby |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020826234017/http://interviews.rocketbaby.net/interviews_meguro_2.html |archivedate=August 26, 2002 }}</ref> Meguro continued to work on several projects in the mid to late 1990s, including ''[[Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers]]'' on the [[Sega Saturn]], composing around 50 pieces for the game, as well as ''[[Maken X]]'' on the [[Dreamcast]].<ref name=\"GMO\"/>\n\nThe first time he became a leading composer was on ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne]]'' in 2003, where he somewhat diverged from the music in the prior games for the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series, giving the game a more [[orchestral]] and [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] sound. A crucial point of his career was ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga|Digital Devil Saga]]''; he had creative freedom that let him establish his own sound.<ref name=\"GMO\"/> In 2005, Meguro took a break from the ''Shin Megami Tensei'' series to work on titles such as ''[[Trauma Center: Under the Knife]]'', ''[[Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army]]'', and ''[[Trauma Center: Second Opinion]]''.\n\nMeguro's career was propelled to international stardom in his craft with his work on ''[[Persona 3]]'', where he used a pop-based vocal style, and the soundtrack to the game sold over 100,000 copies. In 2008, Meguro continued upon his success with ''[[Persona 4]]'', where he blended genres to craft a unique sound. A concert at [[Akasaka Blitz]] was held to celebrate Meguro's work on the ''Persona'' series, where ''Persona'' favorites were played. During this time, he also worked on the music on ''[[Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon]]''.<ref name=\"GMO\"/>\n\nMeguro was promoted to game director for the [[PlayStation Portable]] remake of ''Persona''. During this time he received some criticism from some fans for changing the soundtrack for the remake, but overall received a warm response. He later directed the PSP ports of both ''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin]]'' and ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment|Eternal Punishment]]''. In the mid-2010s, Meguro served as the sound director for three spin-off ''Persona'' titles, as well as composing and producing the majority of the soundtrack for ''[[Persona 5]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greening|first1=Chris|title=Atlus releases three-disc Persona 5 album|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/atlus-releases-three-disc-persona-5-album/|website=Video Game Music Online|accessdate=January 22, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118070143/http://www.vgmonline.net/atlus-releases-three-disc-persona-5-album/|archivedate=January 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Glixel\">{{cite web|last1=Mielke|first1=James|title='Persona 5' Creators Talk Series' Legacy, Character Design and J-Pop|url=http://www.glixel.com/interviews/persona-5-creators-talk-legacy-character-design-and-j-pop-w480818|website=Glixel|accessdate=May 12, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707024530/http://www.glixel.com/interviews/persona-5-creators-talk-legacy-character-design-and-j-pop-w480818|archivedate=July 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Meguro also contributed to the upcoming ''Project Re Fantasy'' game, the film ''Mint'', and ''[[Persona 5 Royal]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Sal|title=First details on Atlus\u2019 new fantasy RPG, \u201cProject Re Fantasy\u201d [Update]|url=http://gematsu.com/2016/12/first-details-atlus-new-fantasy-rpg-project-re-fantasy|website=Gematsu|accessdate=December 22, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222153823/http://gematsu.com/2016/12/first-details-atlus-new-fantasy-rpg-project-re-fantasy|archivedate=December 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=First |first1=Marlene |title=NEGA, Persona Creators Make Anime-Live Action Film Mint |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-07-22/nega-persona-creators-make-anime-live-action-film-mint |website=Anime News Network |accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Sal |title=Persona 5 Royal launches October 31 in Japan, 2020 in the west; first details, trailer, and screenshots |url=https://gematsu.com/2019/04/persona-5-royal-launches-october-31-in-japan-2020-in-the-west-first-details-trailer-and-screenshots |website=Gematsu |accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref> He also served as the lead composer for ''[[Persona 5: The Animation]]'', arranging various tracks from the original game in addition to writing new material.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Reilly|title=Shoji Meguro returning for Persona 5 anime|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/shoji-meguro-returning-for-persona-5-anime/|website=Video Game Music Online|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Musical style and influences==\nAlthough many of his works feature a signature [[Rock music|rock]] style, Meguro experiments with different musical genres, such as [[orchestral]], [[electronica]], [[jazz]], and [[hip hop]] on various projects.<ref name=\"Glixel\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wan|first1=Zhiqing|title=Twinfinite\u2019s Endless Playlist: Persona 5\u2019s Soundtrack and the Definition of Smoothness|url=http://twinfinite.net/2017/07/twinfinites-endless-playlist-persona-5-soundtrack/|website=Twinfinite|accessdate=July 31, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801000447/http://twinfinite.net/2017/07/twinfinites-endless-playlist-persona-5-soundtrack/|archivedate=August 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Meguro cites video game composers [[Koichi Sugiyama]], [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (composer)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]], and [[Takenobu Mitsuyoshi]], as well as [[T-Square (band)|T-Square]], [[Casiopea]], [[Beethoven]], and [[Tchaikovsky]] as some of his musical influences.<ref name=\"Glixel\"/><ref name=\"GMO\"/> Regarding the use of English lyrics in many of the ''Persona'' games, Meguro stated that due to the Japanese people not fully understanding the language, it helped create music that was not as distracting to them as Japanese would be.<ref name=\"Glixel\"/>\n\n==Works==\nAll works listed below were composed by Meguro unless otherwise noted.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"auto\"\n|+ Video games\n!
