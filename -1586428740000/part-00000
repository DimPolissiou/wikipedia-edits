Originally a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative universe]] storyline. The group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under [[Big Hit Entertainment]] and released their debut single album, ''[[2 Cool 4 Skool]]'' (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] entries ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2]]'' (2015), ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]'' (2016), and ''[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]'' (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. ''Wings'' became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the [[Korean Wave]] into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for their single \"[[Mic Drop (song)|Mic Drop]]\". The band is the first Korean act to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with their studio album ''[[Love Yourself: Tear]]'' (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums ''[[Love Yourself: Answer]]'' (2018), ''[[Map of the Soul: Persona]]'' (2019) and ''[[Map of the Soul: 7]]'' (2020), making BTS the fastest group since [[the Beatles]] to earn four number one albums in less than two years. ''Love Yourself: Answer'' also broke South Korea's [[Gaon Album Chart]]'s all-time monthly record previously set by ''Love Yourself: Tear'' and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States.\n\nHaving sold over 20 million albums on the [[Gaon Music Chart]], BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the [[List of best-selling albums in South Korea|best-selling album in South Korea]] with ''Map of the Soul: 7''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=202004091116052410&search=title&searchstring=%B9%E6%C5%BA%BC%D2%B3%E2%B4%DC|title=\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8, \uc74c\ubc18 \ub204\uc801 \ud310\ub9e4\ub7c9 2032\ub9cc\uc7a5\u2026\u97d3 \uac00\uc694 \uc5ed\uc0ac \ucd5c\ucd08|trans-title=Bulletproof Boy Scouts, cumulative sales volume of 20.3 million copies\u2026 first time in South Korea's Music history|date=April 9, 2020|url-status=live|accessdate=April 9, 2020||last=Lee|first=Min-ji|language=ko|work=Newsen}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200409005900315|title=BTS becomes bestselling K-pop singers|date=April 9, 2020|url-status=live|accessdate=April 9, 2020|work=[[Yonhap News Agency]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=421&aid=0004574631|title=\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8, \uc74c\ubc18 \ucd1d \ud310\ub9e4\ub7c9 2032\ub9cc\uc7a5\u2026\u97d3 \uac00\uc694 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc0c1 \ucc98\uc74c|trans-title=Bulletproof Boy Scouts, total sales of 20.3 million albums\u2026 \u97d3 It's the first time in history|date=April 9, 2020|url-status=live|accessdate=April 9, 2020|language=ko|work=News1|via=[[Naver]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=241&aid=0003009896|script-title=ko:\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 \u2018MAP OF THE SOUL : 7\u2019, \ud310\ub9e4\ub7c9 411\ub9cc \uc7a5..\u97d3 \uac00\uc218 \uc2e0\uae30\ub85d|trans-title=BTS 'MAP OF THE SOUL: 7', sales volume 4.11 million copies|last=Kim|first=Yeon-ji|work=Daily Sports|via=[[Naver]]|date=March 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312162135/https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=241&aid=0003009896|archive-date=March 12, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref> BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the [[IFPI]]'s Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart.

Originally a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative universe]] storyline. The group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under [[Big Hit Entertainment]] and released their debut single album, ''[[2 Cool 4 Skool]]'' (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] entries ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2]]'' (2015), ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]'' (2016), and ''[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]'' (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. ''Wings'' became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the [[Korean Wave]] into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for their single \"[[Mic Drop (song)|Mic Drop]]\". The band is the first Korean act to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with their studio album ''[[Love Yourself: Tear]]'' (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums ''[[Love Yourself: Answer]]'' (2018), ''[[Map of the Soul: Persona]]'' (2019) and ''[[Map of the Soul: 7]]'' (2020), making BTS the fastest group since [[the Beatles]] to earn four number one albums in less than two years. ''Love Yourself: Answer'' also broke South Korea's [[Gaon Album Chart]]'s all-time monthly record previously set by ''Love Yourself: Tear'' and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States.\n\nHaving sold over 20 million albums on the [[Gaon Music Chart]], BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the [[List of best-selling albums in South Korea|best-selling album in South Korea]] with ''Map of the Soul: 7''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=202004091116052410&search=title&searchstring=%B9%E6%C5%BA%BC%D2%B3%E2%B4%DC|title=\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8, \uc74c\ubc18 \ub204\uc801 \ud310\ub9e4\ub7c9 2032\ub9cc\uc7a5\u2026\u97d3 \uac00\uc694 \uc5ed\uc0ac \ucd5c\ucd08|trans-title=Bulletproof Boy Scouts, cumulative sales volume of 203.2 million copies\u2026 first time in South Korea's Music history|date=April 9, 2020|url-status=live|accessdate=April 9, 2020||last=Lee|first=Min-ji|language=ko|work=Newsen}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200409005900315|title=BTS becomes bestselling K-pop singers|date=April 9, 2020|url-status=live|accessdate=April 9, 2020|work=[[Yonhap News Agency]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=421&aid=0004574631|title=\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8, \uc74c\ubc18 \ucd1d \ud310\ub9e4\ub7c9 2032\ub9cc\uc7a5\u2026\u97d3 \uac00\uc694 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc0c1 \ucc98\uc74c|trans-title=Bulletproof Boy Scouts, total sales of 23.2 million albums\u2026 \u97d3 It's the first time in history|date=April 9, 2020|url-status=live|accessdate=April 9, 2020|language=ko|work=News1|via=[[Naver]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=241&aid=0003009896|script-title=ko:\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 \u2018MAP OF THE SOUL : 7\u2019, \ud310\ub9e4\ub7c9 411\ub9cc \uc7a5..\u97d3 \uac00\uc218 \uc2e0\uae30\ub85d|trans-title=BTS 'MAP OF THE SOUL: 7', sales volume 4.11 million copies|last=Kim|first=Yeon-ji|work=Daily Sports|via=[[Naver]]|date=March 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312162135/https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=241&aid=0003009896|archive-date=March 12, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref> BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the [[IFPI]]'s Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart.
