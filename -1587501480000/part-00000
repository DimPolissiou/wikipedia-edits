The park is {{convert|63|mi|km}} north to south, and {{convert|54|mi|km}} west to east by air. Yellowstone is {{convert|2219789|acre|km2 sqmi|0}}<ref name=\"acres\"/> in area, larger than either of the states of [[Rhode Island]] or [[Delaware]]. Rivers and lakes cover five percent of the land area, with the largest water body being [[Yellowstone Lake]] at {{convert|87040|acre|km2 sqmi|0}}. Yellowstone Lake is up to {{convert|400|ft|m}} deep and has {{convert|110|mi|km}} of shoreline. At an elevation of {{convert|7733|ft|m}} above [[sea level]], Yellowstone Lake is the largest high elevation lake in North America. [[Forest|Forests]] comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is [[prairie|grassland]].<ref name=\"facts\"/>\n\nThe [[Continental Divide]] of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a [[topography|topographic]] feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]] and [[Snake River]]s are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the [[Pacific Ocean]], while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\n[[File:Yellowstone-TF.jpg|thumb|left|A 3D computer-generated aerial image]]\nThe park sits on the [[Yellowstone Plateau]], at an average elevation of {{convert|8000|ft|m}} above sea level.

The highest point in the park is atop [[Eagle Peak (Wyoming)|Eagle Peak]] ({{convert|11358|ft|m|disp=or}}) and the lowest is along Reese Creek ({{convert|5282|ft|m|disp=or}}).<ref name=\"facts\"/> Nearby mountain ranges include the [[Gallatin Range]] to the northwest, the [[Beartooth Mountains]] in the north, the [[Absaroka Range]] to the east, the [[Teton Range]] to the south, and the [[Madison Range]] to the west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is [[Mount Washburn]] at {{convert|10243|ft|m}}.\n\nYellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest [[petrified wood|petrified forests]], trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. This ash and other volcanic debris are believed to have come from the park area itself as the central part of Yellowstone is the massive caldera of a supervolcano.

[[Controlled burn]]s are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas.<ref name=\"prescribed \">{{cite web |title=Prescribed Fire |website=Yellowstone Wildland Fire |publisher=National Park Service |date=October 25, 2006 |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/prescribed.htm |accessdate=March 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610004917/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/prescribed.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2007}}</ref> Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.\n\n[[File:Crown fire Old Faithful.jpg|thumb|A crown fire approaches the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988.]]\n1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from {{convert|8500|acre|ha sqmi}} throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to {{convert|99000|acre|ha sqmi}} on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than {{convert|150000|acre|ha sqmi}} were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the {{convert|793000|acre|ha sqmi}} that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage.<ref name=\"fires\"/> Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.\n\nContrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals\u2014surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000\u201350,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the United States, based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires.<ref name=\"fires\"/>\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Yellowstonewinter.jpg|thumb|Winter scene in Yellowstone]]\nYellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year-round.

Visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with the bears, who had learned to beg for food. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year.

The park is {{convert|63|mi|km}} north to south, and {{convert|54|mi|km}} west to east by air. Yellowstone is {{convert|2219789|acre|km2 sqmi|0}}<ref name=\"acres\"/> in area, larger than either of the states of [[Rhode Island]] or [[Delaware]]. Rivers and lakes cover five percent of the land area, with the largest water body being [[Yellowstone Lake]] at {{convert|87040|acre|km2 sqmi|0}}. Yellowstone Lake is up to {{convert|400|ft|m}} deep and has {{convert|110|mi|km}} of shoreline. At an elevation of {{convert|7733|ft|m}} above [[sea level]], Yellowstone Lake is the largest high elevation lake in North America. [[Forest|Forests]] comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is [[prairie|grassland]].<ref name=\"facts\"/>\n\nThe [[Continental Divide]] of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a [[topography|topographic]] feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]] and [[Snake River]]s are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the [[Pacific Ocean]], while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\n[[File:Yellowstone-TF.jpg|thumb|left|A 3D computer-generated aerial image]]\nThe park sits on the [[Yellowstone Plateau]], at an average elevation of {{convert|8000|ft|m}} above sea level. The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by [[mountain range]]s of the [[Rocky Mountains|Middle Rocky Mountains]], which range from {{convert|9000|to|11000|ft|m}} in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop [[Eagle Peak (Wyoming)|Eagle Peak]] ({{convert|11358|ft|m|disp=or}}) and the lowest is along Reese Creek ({{convert|5282|ft|m|disp=or}}).<ref name=\"facts\"/> Nearby mountain ranges include the [[Gallatin Range]] to the northwest, the [[Beartooth Mountains]] in the north, the [[Absaroka Range]] to the east, the [[Teton Range]] to the south, and the [[Madison Range]] to the west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is [[Mount Washburn]] at {{convert|10243|ft|m}}.\n\nYellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest [[petrified wood|petrified forests]], trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. This ash and other volcanic debris are believed to have come from the park area itself as the central part of Yellowstone is the massive caldera of a supervolcano. The park contains 290 [[waterfall]]s of at least {{convert|15|ft|m}}, the highest being the [[Yellowstone Falls|Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River]] at {{convert|308|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"facts\"/>\n\nThree deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the [[Tuff|volcanic tuff]] of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000&nbsp;years.

[[Lodgepole Pine]]s\u2014the most common tree species in the park\u2014generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire.

[[Subalpine Fir]], [[Engelmann Spruce]], [[Whitebark Pine]], and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur.

[[Controlled burn]]s are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas.<ref name=\"prescribed \">{{cite web |title=Prescribed Fire |website=Yellowstone Wildland Fire |publisher=National Park Service |date=October 25, 2006 |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/prescribed.htm |accessdate=March 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610004917/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/prescribed.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2007}}</ref> Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.\n\n[[File:Crown fire Old Faithful.jpg|thumb|A crown fire approaches the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988.]]\n1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from {{convert|8500|acre|ha sqmi}} throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to {{convert|99000|acre|ha sqmi}} on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than {{convert|150000|acre|ha sqmi}} were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the {{convert|793000|acre|ha sqmi}} that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage.<ref name=\"fires\"/> Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.\n\nContrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals\u2014surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000\u201350,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the United States, based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires.<ref name=\"fires\"/>\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Yellowstonewinter.jpg|thumb|Winter scene in Yellowstone]]\nYellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year-round.

Each colony, which consists of about 1,200 workers, inhabits a single tree; however, the ants are spread among the leaf pockets, with typically 40 workers per pocket. Their diet primarily consists of large insects that are captured on the plant, but they also eat some kinds of [[Beltian body|food bodies]] produced by the plant as well as its [[nectar]]. They are able to capture their [[prey]], which is much larger than themselves, by constructing a platform that acts as a trap for the unsuspecting prey.

''H. physophora'' is a small tree in the Amazonian [[rainforest]] that resides in the [[undergrowth]].<ref name=\"Dejean\" /> It is also an example of a [[myrmecophyte]], because it contains ant-[[domatia]], leaf pouches and hollow chambers where the ants nest permanently. These leaf pouches occur when the edge of a leaf adjacent to the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] curls under. The result is two hollow spheres on both sides of the stem of the leaf. The ants live inside of these domatia. There is only one colony per tree, but that colony divides up into many different domatia. Also located in the leaf pouches are [[Nectar#Extrafloral nectaries|extrafloral nectaries]], which provide the ants with nectar made by the plant, and also some food bodies that provide the ants with further nutrition as they mature to become foragers and insect predators. This is the first known instance of extrafloral nectaries being observed inside of ant-domatia.<ref name=\"Leroy\" />\n\nSo far this looks like simple [[parasitism]] by the ants, as if they simply take advantage of the plant for food and shelter. However, the plant also benefits greatly from this relationship. With the help of their traps and predation, the ants defend the plant from other insects and parasitic plants. Any insect that may kill or eat the plant is quickly captured and killed by the ants, which is also to their own benefit.<ref name=\"Dejean\" /><ref name=\"Grangier\" /><ref name=\"Leroy\" />\n\nThe specialized structures of the plant reveal a very interesting [[coevolution]] and symbiosis between these two species. A recent study performed by C\u00e9line Leroy et al. (2008) revealed many characteristics that the plant has adapted to support the ants. First, the domatia are located next to the stems that the ants use for hunting. Second, they contain extrafloral nectaries and food bodies to feed the ants if they do not have other sources of food. Third, there are less [[chloroplast]]s found inside of the domatia, which means that it has a lower [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] capacity. Fourth, [[stoma]]ta were found inside of the domatia, although at a lower density, possibly to capture the [[carbon dioxide]] from the ants\u2019 [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] taking place inside. Finally, there was a greater deposit of [[cellulose]] found in the domatia, which would result in a thicker [[cell wall]] and a more rigid surface to support the weight of the ants. These findings show that the areas destined to become domatia are inherited and a result of coevolution; they were solely produced to support this specific species of ant.<ref name=\"Leroy\" />\n\n==Fungal symbiosis==\nThere are many different species of fungus that grow alongside the domatia where the ants live. In fact, when the founding queen first starts laying eggs in the domatia of a new ''H. physophora'', the [[hypha]]e of multiple different species of fungi will entirely cover the entrance to the domatia. When the worker ants mature, they actually have to dig their way through the fungal covering to get to the outside of the plant. However, almost even more remarkably, out of all of these fungal species, ''A. decemarticulatus'' will only cultivate one specific species. This fungus is a sooty [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] which, according to one study by Mario X. Ruiz-Gonzalez et al.

They strictly manipulate the [[physiology]] of the fungus to construct a mortar for a trap that is able to catch much larger prey.<ref name=\"RuizGonzalez\" />\n\n== Trap-making ==\nManufacturing this trap is an incredible act in itself. The workers construct the traps on the stems of the plant, basically by making a raised and hollow platform on one section of the stem. The structure itself simply looks like a part of the plant, as if it grew in width slightly. The ants will also make small holes in this platform which are slightly wider than their own bodies. The individual workers will hide in these holes underneath the surface, invisible to their prey from the outside.

The ants will then arrange these hairs to outline the structure of the trap and regurgitate the mold that acts as a paste and holds the trichomes together. They use their fungal relationship to gather this mold, by collecting the [[mycelium]] from the fungus grown on the plant. This mold will continue to grow in between the trichomes and around the holes to fill out and reinforce the structure.<ref name=\"Dejean\" /><ref name=\"RuizGonzalez\" />\n\n==Predatory behavior==\nNormally, there are only a small number of ants in any given area on the plant stem. There are about 40 workers per leaf, but generally only a few will be patrolling outside. Once an insect lands on the plant, the closest ant will immediately surface and grab on to a [[Arthropod leg|leg]], [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]], [[Insect wing|wing]], or some other [[appendage]] of the prey. This ant will pull the prey, which will try to escape by pulling in the opposite direction. However, the ant will rarely let go of its grip. The ant immobilizes the prey and, using an extreme feat of strength, will hold the much larger prey to the plant as more ants from around that area arrive. This ability to hold the prey is extremely important because the ants move and congregate fairly slowly.<ref name=\"Dejean\" />\n\nAfter the first ant has immobilized the prey, it releases pheromones to call other ants to the area. The first few ants to arrive will each grab a different leg and pull in opposite directions, \"spread-eagling\" the prey.<ref name=\"Dejean\" /> This is basically identical to the [[medieval]] torture tactic of \"[[Rack (torture)|rack torture]]\". Anywhere between six and 16 ants will participate in this spread-eagling. As the prey lies motionless and helpless, worker ants will congregate and either help to hold the prey down, if that is necessary, or start stinging and biting it. In doing this, they use a venom that they produce to paralyze and kill the prey. Afterwards, the group of workers will carry the body back to the colony, where it is dismembered and cut up into little pieces to be eaten by the group.<ref name=\"Dejean\" />\n\nThis amazingly gruesome predatory behavior is a great example of a collaboration between solitary and cooperative predation. The first ant will initially act alone in her<!--Male ants are rare. Their only real use is mating.--> predation, but after that other ants will come and join in the hunt, and still other will travel back to the domatia to recruit even more ants to aid in holding down and eventually dismembering the prey. This also demonstrates how much more effective a group of individuals can be than an individual working on its own. A single ant would never be able to kill such large prey; they are only able to do so by incorporating communication and cooperation.<ref name=\"Dejean\" />\n\nThis predatory behavior is very effective against the relatively large prey that the ants consume. Dejean and other researchers (2001) tested the limits of its effectiveness by exposing the ants to [[termite]]s and [[grasshopper]]s, which are about 40 and 142.2 times the size of the worker ants, respectively. So a single ''Allomerus decemarticulatus'' worker restraining a grasshopper is about the equivalence of a 175-pound person holding down a struggling 25,000&nbsp;pound object that is actively trying to escape. When the termites were exposed, each was captured by the ants; none got away. However, with grasshoppers, all were seized by at least one leg, but out of the 20 introduced, five were captured completely, 12 escaped but lost their leg that was clasped on to by the worker, and seven jumped away.<ref name=\"Dejean\" />\n\nAny prey that has the ability to jump or fly away will always be more effective in escaping than non-flying insects like the termites. However, many times those that do escape will still lose a leg or other appendage in the process, like 60% of the grasshoppers in this experiment. Because the prey is so much larger than the ants, even just getting this one appendage as a food source is a victory. For example, a hind leg of a grasshopper is still about 12.4 times the size of a single ant and a great resource in itself.<ref name=\"Dejean\" />\n\n== Other animal interactions ==\nIf the multiple relationships of ''A. decemarticulatus'' were not complex enough, they also commonly interact with an assassin bug, ''[[Zelus annulosus]]'', which often resides on ''H. physophora'' plants. However, these bugs have adapted physiological and behavioral characteristics that allow them to avoid the predation of ''A. decemarticulatus'', while also maintaining a mutualistic relationship with the plant.<ref name=\"Revel\">{{cite journal | last1 = Revel | first1 = M. | last2 = Dejean | first2 = A. | last3 = C\u00e9r\u00e9ghino | first3 = R. | last4 = Roux | first4 = O. | year = 2010 | title = An assassin among predators: the relationship between plant-ants, their host Myrmecophytes and the Reduviidae ''Zelus annulosus'' | journal = [[PLoS ONE]] | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | page = e13110 | pmid = 20957040 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013110 | pmc=2948506}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to the ants, ''Z. annulosus'' normally lives on younger ''H. physophora'' individuals, where the females lay eggs on the stem.

The relationship between the assassin bug and the plant acts independently from that between the ants and the plant. One difference between the two relationships, however, is that the assassin bugs do not take any food source from the plant like the ants do.<ref name=\"Revel\" />\n\n''Z. annulosus'' has basically adapted to live and hunt around ''A. decemarticulatus''. The assassin bug species uses this particular plant to raise their [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] because the trichomes of the plant deter larger ant species that may kill the young developing bugs. Also, the bugs secrete a sticky substance that allows them to walk on top of these trichomes, thus avoiding the traps of ''A. decemarticulatus''. So in the relationship between ''Z. annulosus'' and ''H. physophora'', the bug receives shelter from potential large predator ants, and the plant received a second line of defense against herbivores. The assassin bug also cohabitates the plant peacefully with the ants. They hunt in similar areas on the plant, but the assassin bugs are suspected to actively avoid any of the ants because they are much quicker than the ants.<ref name=\"Revel\" />\n\n== Relevance to sociobiology ==\nBy simply observing the stem of one ''H. physophora'' individual, we see the complex interactions between four different species: an ant, a plant, a fungus, and an assassin bug, as well as all of the prey that lands on the plant. The plant gives a little of its own resources to the predators, but it gets two forms of defense against herbivores and parasitic plants. To the plant, this defense is worth much more than the loss of some food. The plant has maximized its own fitness by establishing two separate and independent relationships that are not very costly but very rewarding. The insects both benefit as well, given a safe habitat and a steady food supply of other insects that land on the prey. In the perspective of ''A. decemarticulatus'', they do not actively give any of their own resources to the plant or to the assassin bug.

These leaf pockets are areas inside of the plant between the [[leaf|leaves]] and the [[Plant stem|stem]]. Each colony, which consists of about 1,200 workers, inhabits a single tree; however, the ants are spread among the leaf pockets, with typically 40 workers per pocket. Their diet primarily consists of large insects that are captured on the plant, but they also eat some kinds of [[Beltian body|food bodies]] produced by the plant as well as its [[nectar]]. They are able to capture their [[prey]], which is much larger than themselves, by constructing a platform that acts as a trap for the unsuspecting prey. The ants hide in the trap and attack when any [[insect]] lands on it. This technique is an example of [[Ambush predator|ambush predation]].<ref name=\"Dejean\" />\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nThe worker is about 2&nbsp;mm long, with a head width and length at about .6&nbsp;mm. The [[Queen ant|queen]] is approximately double that size, with a head width of 1.05&nbsp;mm, head length of .98&nbsp;mm, and a total length of 5.53&nbsp;mm.

They also have abundant hair, with long hairs on their head (greater than .13&nbsp;mm) and shorter hairs on their abdomen (less than .07&nbsp;mm). They have brownish yellow colored bodies and whitish hair.<ref name=\"Fernandez\" />\n\n== Habitat ==\n''A. decemarticulatus'' is a [[Neotropical realm|Neotropical]] species<!--The neotropical zone stretches from Mexico to Patagonia, so being neotropical does not mean that it has to live in the Amazon.--> that lives in the Amazonian tropics of South America.

''H. physophora'' is a small tree in the Amazonian [[rainforest]] that resides in the [[undergrowth]].<ref name=\"Dejean\" /> It is also an example of a [[myrmecophyte]], because it contains ant-[[domatia]], leaf pouches and hollow chambers where the ants nest permanently. These leaf pouches occur when the edge of a leaf adjacent to the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] curls under. The result is two hollow spheres on both sides of the stem of the leaf. The ants live inside of these domatia. There is only one colony per tree, but that colony divides up into many different domatia. Also located in the leaf pouches are [[Nectar#Extrafloral nectaries|extrafloral nectaries]], which provide the ants with nectar made by the plant, and also some food bodies that provide the ants with further nutrition as they mature to become foragers and insect predators. This is the first known instance of extrafloral nectaries being observed inside of ant-domatia.<ref name=\"Leroy\" />\n\nSo far this looks like simple [[parasitism]] by the ants, as if they simply take advantage of the plant for food and shelter. However, the plant also benefits greatly from this relationship. With the help of their traps and predation, the ants defend the plant from other insects and parasitic plants. Any insect that may kill or eat the plant is quickly captured and killed by the ants, which is also to their own benefit.<ref name=\"Dejean\" /><ref name=\"Grangier\" /><ref name=\"Leroy\" />\n\nThe specialized structures of the plant reveal a very interesting [[coevolution]] and symbiosis between these two species. A recent study performed by C\u00e9line Leroy et al. (2008) revealed many characteristics that the plant has adapted to support the ants. First, the domatia are located next to the stems that the ants use for hunting. Second, they contain extrafloral nectaries and food bodies to feed the ants if they do not have other sources of food. Third, there are less [[chloroplast]]s found inside of the domatia, which means that it has a lower [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] capacity. Fourth, [[stoma]]ta were found inside of the domatia, although at a lower density, possibly to capture the [[carbon dioxide]] from the ants\u2019 [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] taking place inside. Finally, there was a greater deposit of [[cellulose]] found in the domatia, which would result in a thicker [[cell wall]] and a more rigid surface to support the weight of the ants. These findings show that the areas destined to become domatia are inherited and a result of coevolution; they were solely produced to support this specific species of ant.<ref name=\"Leroy\" />\n\n==Fungal symbiosis==\nThere are many different species of fungus that grow alongside the domatia where the ants live. In fact, when the founding queen first starts laying eggs in the domatia of a new ''H. physophora'', the [[hypha]]e of multiple different species of fungi will entirely cover the entrance to the domatia. When the worker ants mature, they actually have to dig their way through the fungal covering to get to the outside of the plant. However, almost even more remarkably, out of all of these fungal species, ''A. decemarticulatus'' will only cultivate one specific species. This fungus is a sooty [[mold]] which, according to one study by Mario X. Ruiz-Gonzalez et al. (2010), is characterized by closely related [[haplotype]]s (genetic markers) in the order [[Chaetothyriales]]. The ants use this mold to construct their traps.<ref name=\"RuizGonzalez\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ruiz-Gonz\u00e1lez | first1 = M. | last2 = Mal\u00e9 | first2 = P.

Biphenyl is an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] with a [[molecular formula]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. It is notable as a starting material for the production of [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), which were once widely used as [[dielectric]] fluids and [[heat transfer]] agents.\n\nBiphenyl is also an intermediate for the production of a host of other [[organic compound]]s such as [[emulsifier]]s, [[optical brightener]]s, [[fungicide|crop protection]] products, and [[plastic]]s. Biphenyl is [[solubility|insoluble]] in water, but soluble in typical [[organic solvent]]s. The biphenyl molecule consists of two connected [[phenyl ring]]s.\n\n==Properties and occurrence==\nBiphenyl occurs naturally in [[coal tar]], [[crude oil]], and [[natural gas]] and can be isolated from these sources via [[distillation]].<ref>Adams, N.

In the laboratory, biphenyl is mainly used as a heat transfer agent as a [[eutectic mixture]] with [[diphenyl ether]]. This mixture is stable to 400&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nBiphenyl does undergo [[sulfonation]] followed by base hydrolysis produces ''p''-hydroxybiphenyl and ''p'',''p''\u2032-dihydroxybiphenyl, which are useful fungicides.

It is notable as a starting material for the production of [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), which were once widely used as [[dielectric]] fluids and [[heat transfer]] agents.\n\nBiphenyl is also an intermediate for the production of a host of other [[organic compound]]s such as [[emulsifier]]s, [[optical brightener]]s, [[fungicide|crop protection]] products, and [[plastic]]s. Biphenyl is [[solubility|insoluble]] in water, but soluble in typical [[organic solvent]]s. The biphenyl molecule consists of two connected [[phenyl ring]]s.\n\n==Properties and occurrence==\nBiphenyl occurs naturally in [[coal tar]], [[crude oil]], and [[natural gas]] and can be isolated from these sources via [[distillation]].<ref>Adams, N.

Filters meeting the HEPA standard have many applications, including use in clean rooms for IC fabrication, medical facilities, automobiles, aircraft and homes. The filter must satisfy certain standards of efficiency such as those set by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE).\n\nVarying standards define what qualifies as a HEPA filter. The two most common standards require that an air filter must remove (from the air that passes through) 99.95% (European Standard)<ref>European Standard EN 1822-1:2009, \"High efficiency air filters (EPA, HEPA and ULPA)\", 2009</ref> or 99.97% (ASME standard)<ref>American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME AG-1a\u20132004, \"Addenda to ASME AG-1\u20132003 Code on Nuclear Air and Gas Treatment\", 2004</ref> of particles that have a size greater than or equal to 0.3&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].\n\n== Automotive cabin air filters ==\nThe cabin air filter is typically a pleated-paper filter that is placed in the outside-air intake for the vehicle's passenger compartment. Some of these filters are rectangular and similar in shape to the combustion air filter. Others are uniquely shaped to fit the available space of particular vehicles' outside-air intakes.\n\nThe first automaker to include a disposable filter to clean the ventilation system was the [[Nash Motors]] \"[[Weather Eye]]\", introduced in 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vwlarry.blogspot.com/2009/05/ive-been-wanting-to-do-piece-about-this.html|title=Nils Wahlberg and Nash - Salute To A Great Engineer And Unsung Automobiles|first=|last=Vwlarry|date=19 May 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBeing a relatively recent addition to automobile equipment, this filter is often overlooked. Clogged or dirty cabin air filters can significantly reduce airflow from the cabin vents, as well as introduce [[allergen]]s into the cabin air stream, and since the cabin air temperature depends upon the flow rate of the air passing through the [[heater core]], the [[evaporator]] or both, they can greatly reduce the effectiveness of the vehicle's [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]] and the heating performance.  The poor performance of these filters is obscured by manufacturers by not using the [[minimum efficiency reporting value]] (MERV) rating system.  Some people mistakenly believe that some of these are [[HEPA]] filters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Internal combustion engine air filters ==\n[[Image:Air filter, opel astra(2).JPG|thumb|right|Used auto engine air filter, clean side]]\n[[Image:Air filter, opel astra(1).JPG|thumb|right|Used auto engine air filter, dirty side]]\n[[Image:Dirty-air-filter.jpg|thumb|right|Auto engine air filter clogged with dust and grime]]\n[[Image:Low Temperature Oxidation Catalyst.jpeg|thumb|right|Low-temperature oxidation catalyst used to convert [[carbon monoxide]] to less toxic [[carbon dioxide]] at room temperature. It can also remove [[formaldehyde]] from the [[air]].]]\n\nThe combustion air filter prevents abrasive particulate matter from entering the engine's cylinders, where it would cause mechanical wear and oil contamination.\n\nMost [[Fuel injection|fuel injected]] vehicles use a pleated paper filter element in the form of a flat panel. This filter is usually placed inside a plastic box connected to the [[throttle#Throttle body|throttle body]] with duct work. Older vehicles that use [[carburetor]]s or throttle body fuel injection typically use a cylindrical air filter, usually between {{Convert|100|mm|0}} and {{Convert|400|mm}} in diameter. This is positioned above or beside the carburetor or throttle body, usually in a metal or plastic container which may incorporate ducting to provide cool and/or warm inlet air, and secured with a metal or plastic lid. The overall unit (filter and housing together) is called the '''air cleaner'''.\n\n=== Paper ===\n{{Main|Filter paper}}\nPleated paper filter elements are the nearly exclusive choice for [[automobile]] engine air cleaners, because they are efficient, easy to service, and cost-effective. The \"paper\" term is somewhat misleading, as the filter media are considerably different from [[paper]]s used for writing or packaging, etc. There is a persistent belief among [[Car tuning|tuners]], fomented by advertising for aftermarket non-paper replacement filters, that paper filters flow poorly and thus restrict engine performance. In fact, as long as a pleated-paper filter is sized appropriately for the airflow volumes encountered in a particular application, such filters present only trivial restriction to flow until the filter has  become significantly clogged with dirt. Construction equipment engines also use this. The reason is that the paper is bent in zig-zag shape, and the total area of the paper is very large, in the range of 50 times of the air opening.\n\n=== Foam ===\nOil-wetted [[polyurethane foam]] elements are used in some aftermarket replacement automobile air filters. Foam was in the past widely used in air cleaners on small engines on [[lawnmowers]] and other power equipment, but automotive-type paper filter elements have largely supplanted oil-wetted foam in these applications. Foam filters are still commonly used on [[air compressors]] for air tools up to 5Hp. Depending on the grade and thickness of foam employed, an oil-wetted foam filter element can offer minimal airflow restriction or very high dirt capacity, the latter property making foam filters a popular choice in off-road rallying and other motorsport applications where high levels of [[dust]] will be encountered. Due to the way dust is captured on foam filters, large amounts may be trapped without measurable change in airflow restriction.\n\n=== Cotton ===\nOiled [[cotton]] [[gauze]] is employed in a growing number of aftermarket automotive air filters marketed as high-performance items. In the past, cotton gauze saw limited use in original-equipment automotive air filters. However, since the introduction of the [[Abarth]] SS versions, the Fiat subsidiary supplies cotton gauze air filters as OE filters.\n\n===Stainless steel===\nStainless steel mesh is another example of medium which allow more air to pass through. \nStainless steel mesh comes with different mesh counts, offering different filtration standards. \nIn an extreme modified engine lacking in space for a cone based air filter, some will opt to install a simple stainless steel mesh over the turbo to ensure no particles enter the engine via the turbo.\n\n=== Oil bath ===\nAn oil bath air cleaner consists of a [[sump]] containing a pool of oil, and an insert which is filled with fiber, mesh, foam, or another coarse filter media. When the cleaner is assembled, the media-containing body of the insert sits a short distance above the surface of the oil pool. The rim of the insert overlaps the rim of the sump. This arrangement forms a [[labyrinth]]ine path through which the air must travel in a series of U-turns: up through the gap between the rims of the insert and the sump, down through the gap between the outer wall of the insert and the inner wall of the sump, and up through the filter media in the body of the insert. This U-turn takes the air at high velocity across the surface of the oil pool. Larger and heavier dust and dirt particles in the air cannot make the turn due to their [[inertia]], so they fall into the oil and settle to the bottom of the base bowl. Lighter and smaller particles are trapped by the filtration media in the insert, which is wetted by oil droplets aspirated there into by normal airflow.\n  \nOil bath air cleaners were very widely used in automotive and [[small engine]] applications until the widespread industry adoption of the paper filter in the early 1960s. Such cleaners are still used in off-road equipment where very high levels of dust are encountered, for oil bath air cleaners can sequester a great deal of dirt relative to their overall size without loss of filtration efficiency or airflow. However, the liquid oil makes cleaning and servicing such air cleaners messy and inconvenient, they must be relatively large to avoid excessive restriction at high airflow rates, and they tend to increase [[Automobile emissions control|exhaust emissions]] of unburned [[hydrocarbon]]s due to oil aspiration when used on spark-ignition engines.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n=== Water bath ===\nIn the early 20th century (about 1900 to 1930), water bath air cleaners were used in some applications (cars, trucks, tractors, and portable and stationary engines). They worked on roughly the same principles as [[#Oil bath|oil bath air cleaners]]. For example, the original [[Fordson tractor]] had a water bath air cleaner. By the 1940s, oil bath designs had displaced water bath designs because of better filtering performance.\n\n== Bulk solids handling filters ==\n\nBulk solids handling involves the transport of solids (mechanical transport, pneumatic transport) which may be in a powder form. Many industries are handling bulk solids (mining industries, chemical industries, food industries) which requires the treatment of air streams escaping the process so that fine particles are not emitted, for regulatory reasons or economical reasons (loss of materials). As a consequence, air filters are positioned at many places in the process, especially at the reception of pneumatic conveying lines<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Filters.html | title = Air filtration - Dust collectors}}</ref> where the quantity of air is important and the load in fine particle quite important. Filters can also be placed at any point of air exchange in the process to avoid that pollutants enter the process, which is particularly true in pharmaceuticals and food industries. The physical phenomena involved in catching particles with a filter are mainly inertial and diffusional<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.powderprocess.net/Solid_gas_separation.html | title = Solid Gas separation (cyclone - filtration)}}</ref>\n\n== Filter classes ==\n\nUnder European normalization standards EN 779, the following filter classes were recognized:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Clogged or dirty cabin air filters can significantly reduce airflow from the cabin vents, as well as introduce [[allergen]]s into the cabin air stream, and since the cabin air temperature depends upon the flow rate of the air passing through the [[heater core]], the [[evaporator]] or both, they can greatly reduce the effectiveness of the vehicle's [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]] and the heating performance.  The poor performance of these filters is obscured by manufacturers by not using the [[minimum efficiency reporting value]] (MERV) rating system.  Some people mistakenly believe that some of these are [[HEPA]] filters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Internal combustion engine air filters ==\n[[Image:Air filter, opel astra(2).JPG|thumb|right|Used auto engine air filter, clean side]]\n[[Image:Air filter, opel astra(1).JPG|thumb|right|Used auto engine air filter, dirty side]]\n[[Image:Dirty-air-filter.jpg|thumb|right|Auto engine air filter clogged with dust and grime]]\n[[Image:Low Temperature Oxidation Catalyst.jpeg|thumb|right|Low-temperature oxidation catalyst used to convert [[carbon monoxide]] to less toxic [[carbon dioxide]] at room temperature. It can also remove [[formaldehyde]] from the [[air]].]]\n\nThe combustion air filter prevents abrasive particulate matter from entering the engine's cylinders, where it would cause mechanical wear and oil contamination.\n\nMost [[Fuel injection|fuel injected]] vehicles use a pleated paper filter element in the form of a flat panel. This filter is usually placed inside a plastic box connected to the [[throttle#Throttle body|throttle body]] with duct work. Older vehicles that use [[carburetor]]s or throttle body fuel injection typically use a cylindrical air filter, usually between {{Convert|100|mm|0}} and {{Convert|400|mm}} in diameter. This is positioned above or beside the carburetor or throttle body, usually in a metal or plastic container which may incorporate ducting to provide cool and/or warm inlet air, and secured with a metal or plastic lid. The overall unit (filter and housing together) is called the '''air cleaner'''.\n\n=== Paper ===\n{{Main|Filter paper}}\nPleated paper filter elements are the nearly exclusive choice for [[automobile]] engine air cleaners, because they are efficient, easy to service, and cost-effective. The \"paper\" term is somewhat misleading, as the filter media are considerably different from [[paper]]s used for writing or packaging, etc. There is a persistent belief among [[Car tuning|tuners]], fomented by advertising for aftermarket non-paper replacement filters, that paper filters flow poorly and thus restrict engine performance. In fact, as long as a pleated-paper filter is sized appropriately for the airflow volumes encountered in a particular application, such filters present only trivial restriction to flow until the filter has  become significantly clogged with dirt. Construction equipment engines also use this. The reason is that the paper is bent in zig-zag shape, and the total area of the paper is very large, in the range of 50 times of the air opening.\n\n=== Foam ===\nOil-wetted [[polyurethane foam]] elements are used in some aftermarket replacement automobile air filters. Foam was in the past widely used in air cleaners on small engines on [[lawnmowers]] and other power equipment, but automotive-type paper filter elements have largely supplanted oil-wetted foam in these applications. Foam filters are still commonly used on [[air compressors]] for air tools up to 5Hp. Depending on the grade and thickness of foam employed, an oil-wetted foam filter element can offer minimal airflow restriction or very high dirt capacity, the latter property making foam filters a popular choice in off-road rallying and other motorsport applications where high levels of [[dust]] will be encountered. Due to the way dust is captured on foam filters, large amounts may be trapped without measurable change in airflow restriction.\n\n=== Cotton ===\nOiled [[cotton]] [[gauze]] is employed in a growing number of aftermarket automotive air filters marketed as high-performance items. In the past, cotton gauze saw limited use in original-equipment automotive air filters. However, since the introduction of the [[Abarth]] SS versions, the Fiat subsidiary supplies cotton gauze air filters as OE filters.\n\n===Stainless steel===\nStainless steel mesh is another example of medium which allow more air to pass through. \nStainless steel mesh comes with different mesh counts, offering different filtration standards. \nIn an extreme modified engine lacking in space for a cone based air filter, some will opt to install a simple stainless steel mesh over the turbo to ensure no particles enter the engine via the turbo.\n\n=== Oil bath ===\nAn oil bath air cleaner consists of a [[sump]] containing a pool of oil, and an insert which is filled with fiber, mesh, foam, or another coarse filter media. When the cleaner is assembled, the media-containing body of the insert sits a short distance above the surface of the oil pool. The rim of the insert overlaps the rim of the sump. This arrangement forms a [[labyrinth]]ine path through which the air must travel in a series of U-turns: up through the gap between the rims of the insert and the sump, down through the gap between the outer wall of the insert and the inner wall of the sump, and up through the filter media in the body of the insert. This U-turn takes the air at high velocity across the surface of the oil pool. Larger and heavier dust and dirt particles in the air cannot make the turn due to their [[inertia]], so they fall into the oil and settle to the bottom of the base bowl. Lighter and smaller particles are trapped by the filtration media in the insert, which is wetted by oil droplets aspirated there into by normal airflow.\n  \nOil bath air cleaners were very widely used in automotive and [[small engine]] applications until the widespread industry adoption of the paper filter in the early 1960s. Such cleaners are still used in off-road equipment where very high levels of dust are encountered, for oil bath air cleaners can sequester a great deal of dirt relative to their overall size without loss of filtration efficiency or airflow. However, the liquid oil makes cleaning and servicing such air cleaners messy and inconvenient, they must be relatively large to avoid excessive restriction at high airflow rates, and they tend to increase [[Automobile emissions control|exhaust emissions]] of unburned [[hydrocarbon]]s due to oil aspiration when used on spark-ignition engines.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n=== Water bath ===\nIn the early 20th century (about 1900 to 1930), water bath air cleaners were used in some applications (cars, trucks, tractors, and portable and stationary engines). They worked on roughly the same principles as [[#Oil bath|oil bath air cleaners]]. For example, the original [[Fordson tractor]] had a water bath air cleaner. By the 1940s, oil bath designs had displaced water bath designs because of better filtering performance.\n\n== Bulk solids handling filters ==\n\nBulk solids handling involves the transport of solids (mechanical transport, pneumatic transport) which may be in a powder form. Many industries are handling bulk solids (mining industries, chemical industries, food industries) which requires the treatment of air streams escaping the process so that fine particles are not emitted, for regulatory reasons or economical reasons (loss of materials). As a consequence, air filters are positioned at many places in the process, especially at the reception of pneumatic conveying lines<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Filters.html | title = Air filtration - Dust collectors}}</ref> where the quantity of air is important and the load in fine particle quite important. Filters can also be placed at any point of air exchange in the process to avoid that pollutants enter the process, which is particularly true in pharmaceuticals and food industries. The physical phenomena involved in catching particles with a filter are mainly inertial and diffusional<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.powderprocess.net/Solid_gas_separation.html | title = Solid Gas separation (cyclone - filtration)}}</ref>\n\n== Filter classes ==\n\nUnder European normalization standards EN 779, the following filter classes were recognized:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At the time [[Travem\u00fcnde]] was the closest port to Finland in mainland [[Western Europe]], being located in the Federal German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] just west of the border with [[East Germany]].\n\nIn addition to being the largest and fastest ship of her time, ''Finnjet'' is also widely considered to have been the first genuine [[cruiseferry]]. Her cabins were very much ahead of their time for a ferry, it was not until over a decade later when other ferries would match the size and fittings of ''Finnjet'' 's cabins. Her restaurants and other services were also superior to other ferries of her time. ''Finnjet'' 's influence can be clearly seen on the first genuine cruiseferries built for Finland\u2013Sweden traffic in 1980\u201381, ships such as [[MS Viking Song|MS ''Viking Song'']], [[MS Viking Sally|MS ''Viking Sally'']] and [[MS Finlandia|MS ''Finlandia'']].\n\nPartially due to being such a ground-breaking ship, ''Finnjet'' was also extremely prestigious, which helps explain why she remained in traffic on the [[Baltic Sea]] for such a long time even though she was often unprofitable. Famous Finnish painter [[Kimmo Kaivanto]] provided paintings and drawings to decorate the ship, and he even designed a ''Finnjet'' medallion to commemorate the ship's commission.

The study projected notable growth, with 300,000 to 800,000 passenger projected to make a crossing in 1980, with the likeliest number projected at 500,000. At the time Finnlines and [[Finland Steamship Company]] were maintaining a joint service on the route with two ships built during the latter half of the 1960s ({{MS|Finnhansa|1966}} and {{MS|Finlandia|1966}}, respectively), both capable of transporting a maximum of 100,000 passengers per year. Based on the estimates made [[Enso-Gutzeit]], one of the owners of Finnlines, begun planning a new, larger and faster ferry for the service. Initial plans made in 1971 called for a ship with 800 passenger berths (the ''Finnhansa'' had only 300 at the time), but these were abandoned in favour of an even larger ship.<ref name=Karonen>{{cite book |title=Enso-Gutzeit Oy laivanvarustajana: Oy Finnlines Ltd ja Merivienti Oy 1947\u20131982 |last=Karonen |first=Petri |year=1992 |publisher=Enso-Gutzeit |location=Imatra |isbn=952-9690-00-2 |pages=106\u2013109 |url= |language=Finnish }}</ref> The plans for the new ship, codenamed ''Finnjet'',<ref name=FoF /> were developed within the next two years.<ref name=Karonen />\n\nProject ''Finnjet'' was developed into a much larger ship than the ''Finnhansa'' or ''Finlandia''.

The [[Kustaanmiekka]] strait leading to [[Helsinki South Harbour]] had to be widened so that ''Finnjet'' could safely sail through it.<ref name=Karisto /> A former warehouse at [[Katajanokka]], Helsinki was rebuilt as a ferry terminal that would be exclusively used by ''Finnjet'' (today the same terminal is used by [[Viking Line]]).\n\n''Finnjet'' undertook her first test-drive between 9 and 12 December 1976.<ref name=\"Chronicle\" /> Testing the gas turbines of the ship revealed that the original hull structure could not withstand the water pressure caused by the {{convert|30.5|kn}} service speed, and on returning to the shipyard various parts of the ship had to be strengthened.<ref>Karonen. pp. 131.</ref> On 1 March 1977 the ship sailed from Helsinki to [[Kiel]] in Germany, where she was drydocked and her bottom painted.

However, this was delayed due to an engine officers' strike. Finally the ship left on her maiden voyage on 13 May 1977, after a final turbine test drive had been carried out on 12 May 1977.<ref name=\"Chronicle\" />\n\n''Finnjet''{{'}}s estimated fuel consumption for the 22-hour travel time was 300&nbsp;tonnes of fuel; approx 350,000&nbsp;litres total or 16,000&nbsp;litres per hour.  Initially ''Finnjet'' was not a very profitable ship and after only a few years of service there were rumours that she would be sold. The ship had been ordered in the same year as the beginning of the [[1973 oil crisis]], which reached its peak around the time of the ship's launch. Yet another huge leap of the oil price occurred near the turn of the decade. To increase her profitability, the ship was converted to a [[combined diesel-electric and gas]] propulsion with the addition of diesel-[[electric generator]]s in 1981 in [[Amsterdamse Droogdok Maatschappij]], Amsterdam. The change allowed to operate the ship at slower speeds, using cheaper fuel during the winter months. On the way to the shipyard she became the largest ship to have passed through the [[Kiel Canal]] at that time. A year later 75% of ''Finnjet''{{'}}s shares were sold to [[Effoa]] (one of the owners of [[Silja Line]]), and Finnjet Line was established as a joint venture of Finnlines and Effoa to operate the Finnjet. Starting from November 1985, ''Finnjet'' made 24-hour (later 22-hour) backtracking cruises from Helsinki during the winter season. The final batch of these cruises in October\u2013December 1995 included a short stop in [[Tallinn]]. In January 1986 another major renovation was carried out at W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Helsinki, with new Commodore-class cabins added in place of the old sundeck. Shortly after the refit the Denmark-based [[DFDS]] made an offer to buy the ''Finnjet'', but the offer was refused. Instead, in June of the same year Finnlines sold their remaining shares of the ''Finnjet'' to Effoa. In the beginning of 1987 the ship was painted in Silja Line's colors and incorporated in Silja's fleet. However, the technical responsibility for operating the ''Finnjet'' remained with Finnlines until May 1989 (this was of little consequence as Finnlines was almost entirely owned by Effoa at the time).\n[[Image:Finnjet model Effoa livery.jpg|thumb|left|A model of the ''Finnjet'' in the Effoa/Silja Line livery she carried 1987\u20131990]]\n\n===1987\u20132005===\n[[File:Finnjet Kustaanmiekka.webm|thumb|GTS ''Finnjet'' passing through the [[Kustaanmiekka]] strait near Helsinki]]\nAfter the ship had become a part of the Silja Line fleet, further renovations at [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft]] Kiel (HDW) in 1987, 1988 and 1989 saw almost all of the ship's public spaces rebuilt. In 1990 Effoa merged with its fellow Silja Line partner [[Johnson Line (company)|Johnson Line]] to form [[EffJohn]]. In 1991 an extremely large-scale reconstruction was planned, where the ship would have been lengthened by {{convert|20|m|ft}}, cabins enlarged, a new outdoor swimming pool added, and much of the superstructure built to a sleeker appearance. Unfortunately the plan proved to be too costly and was abandoned; the funds that had been raised for this reconstruction went to the rebuilding of [[MS Svea|MS ''Svea'']] and [[MS Wellamo|MS ''Wellamo'']] into ''Silja Karneval'' and ''Silja Festival''.\n\nStarting from 1992 Finnjet was used to monitor surface-layer chlorophyll, temperature and salinity in waters she sailed through for research by the [[Finnish Institute of Marine Research]].<ref>[http://www4.fimr.fi/project/algaline/algali1.htm Phytoplankton Blooms in the Baltic Sea in 1994] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024918/http://www4.fimr.fi/project/algaline/algali1.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}.

Finnjet was amongst the ferries used to search for survivors on the disaster area but she had to leave soon when cars carried on her upper cardeck started moving in the heavy seas, creating another potentially dangerous situation. In 1997 Finnjet was docked at [[G\u00f6taverken]] [[Cityvarvet]], [[Gothenburg]] and rebuilt with a larger tax-free shop in preparation for her new itenaries where she served on the Helsinki\u2013Travem\u00fcnde route only during the summer months, the rest of the year sailing on the Helsinki\u2013Tallinn route. Originally the port in Tallinn was [[Port of Muuga|Muuga]], but when the ship-way of [[Tallinn Passenger Port|Tallinn's old harbour]] was reconstructed in 1998, Finnjet moved there from the start of January 1999. Between 1997 and 2000 segments for the Finnish comedy series Huuliveikot were shot on board the Finnjet.\n\nIn 1999 the summer-route was altered to Helsinki\u2013Tallinn\u2013[[Rostock]]. In autumn of the same year the Finnish Institute of Marine Research installed new equipment for monitoring water quality and algae. In 2001 the ship was docked with modifications made to the turbines and propeller shaft. These and a new bottom paint allowed her to increase her top speed once more, to {{convert|33.5|kn}}.<ref name=\"Speed\" /> In mid-May 2002, only a few days after Finnjet's 25th anniversary cruise, Finnish newspaper [[Helsingin Sanomat]] reported the ship was for sale. At the time the information was thought to be false but later reports indicate the Finland-based [[Ecker\u00f6 Line]] did consider buying her around that time. In April 2004 Finnjet called in Helsinki for the last time, after which she left for another refit at [[Aker Finnyards]] [[Rauma shipyard]] in preparation for her new [[Saint Petersburg]] \u2013 Tallinn \u2013 Rostock route. During the refit most of her interiors were entirely rebuilt, new rudders were installed and bridge wings covered. The new route was believed to be profitable all year round, but this proved not to be the case. After the first summer season Finnjet was laid up for the winter 2004/2005. The route was eventually terminated after the 2005 summer season, and the ship was put up for sale.\n\n===2005\u20132008===\n[[File:GTS Finnjet Louisiana-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|GTS ''Finnjet'' when she was housing for the students, faculty, and staff of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center]]\nDuring the winter of 2005\u20132006, ''Finnjet'' was chartered to the faculty of medicine of [[Louisiana State University|Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans]] as a [[dormitory ship]] to provide housing to students, faculty, and staff displaced by [[Hurricane Katrina]].

At the time of her delivery, ''Finnjet'' was the fastest, longest and largest car ferry in the world, and the only one powered by [[gas turbine]]s.

At the time [[Travem\u00fcnde]] was the closest port to Finland in mainland [[Western Europe]], being located in the Federal German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] just west of the border with [[East Germany]].\n\nIn addition to being the largest and fastest ship of her time, ''Finnjet'' is also widely considered to have been the first genuine [[cruiseferry]]. Her cabins were very much ahead of their time for a ferry, it was not until over a decade later when other ferries would match the size and fittings of ''Finnjet'' 's cabins. Her restaurants and other services were also superior to other ferries of her time. ''Finnjet'' 's influence can be clearly seen on the first genuine cruiseferries built for Finland\u2013Sweden traffic in 1980\u201381, ships such as [[MS Viking Song|MS ''Viking Song'']], [[MS Viking Sally|MS ''Viking Sally'']] and [[MS Finlandia|MS ''Finlandia'']].\n\nPartially due to being such a ground-breaking ship, ''Finnjet'' was also extremely prestigious, which helps explain why she remained in traffic on the [[Baltic Sea]] for such a long time even though she was often unprofitable. Famous Finnish painter [[Kimmo Kaivanto]] provided paintings and drawings to decorate the ship, and he even designed a ''Finnjet'' medallion to commemorate the ship's commission. Kaivanto's main work for the ship, the three-deck high ''Pictures of Finland'', was given to the Finnish Maritime Museum in 2007, destined for display in the museum from 2008 onwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tallinksilja.com/fi/mainMenu/company/news/PicturesOfFinland.htm |title=Tallink Silja on lahjoittanut Kimmo Kaivannon Suomalaisia kuvia -teoksen Suomen Merimuseolle |accessdate=14 May 2007 |date=14 May 2007 |work=Tallink Silja press release |publisher=Tallink Silja |language=Finnish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210059/http://www.tallinksilja.com/fi/mainMenu/company/news/PicturesOfFinland.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1977 a [[7\" single]], Finnjet Waltz, was recorded in honour of the ship, and she was the first ship ever to have a [[Lego]] model of her for sale on board.

''Finnjet'' still remains the best-known individual ship in Finland. She also has a very good reputation in Germany still, and recently (August 2006) Silja Line's new owners [[Tallink]] went on record considering adapting the name 'Finnjet' for their Finland\u2013Germany ferries (to the dismay of ferry enthusiasts in Finland and Germany).<ref>[http://www.siljaweb.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=36 Finnjetweb forums \u2013 Finnjet II?

The study projected notable growth, with 300,000 to 800,000 passenger projected to make a crossing in 1980, with the likeliest number projected at 500,000. At the time Finnlines and [[Finland Steamship Company]] were maintaining a joint service on the route with two ships built during the latter half of the 1960s ({{MS|Finnhansa|1966}} and {{MS|Finlandia|1966}}, respectively), both capable of transporting a maximum of 100,000 passengers per year. Based on the estimates made [[Enso-Gutzeit]], one of the owners of Finnlines, begun planning a new, larger and faster ferry for the service. Initial plans made in 1971 called for a ship with 800 passenger berths (the ''Finnhansa'' had only 300 at the time), but these were abandoned in favour of an even larger ship.<ref name=Karonen>{{cite book |title=Enso-Gutzeit Oy laivanvarustajana: Oy Finnlines Ltd ja Merivienti Oy 1947\u20131982 |last=Karonen |first=Petri |year=1992 |publisher=Enso-Gutzeit |location=Imatra |isbn=952-9690-00-2 |pages=106\u2013109 |url= |language=Finnish }}</ref> The plans for the new ship, codenamed ''Finnjet'',<ref name=FoF /> were developed within the next two years.<ref name=Karonen />\n\nProject ''Finnjet'' was developed into a much larger ship than the ''Finnhansa'' or ''Finlandia''. ''Finnjet'' was to have 1,500 passenger berths and the ship would be powered by two [[gas turbine]]s instead of the traditional [[diesel engine]]s. Gas turbines would give her a service speed of {{convert|30.5|kn}} (compared to the {{convert|20|kn}} of the ''Finnhansa''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/finnhansa_1966.htm |title=M/S ''Finnhansa'' (1966) |accessdate=6 December 2008 |last=Asklander |first=Micke |work=Fakta om Fartyg |language=Swedish }}</ref>), making it possible to cut the passage time between Helsinki and [[Travem\u00fcnde]] from 36 hours to just 22 hours.

However, this was delayed due to an engine officers' strike. Finally the ship left on her maiden voyage on 13 May 1977, after a final turbine test drive had been carried out on 12 May 1977.<ref name=\"Chronicle\" />\n\n''Finnjet''{{'}}s estimated fuel consumption for the 22-hour travel time was 300&nbsp;tonnes of fuel; approx 350,000&nbsp;litres total or 16,000&nbsp;litres per hour.  Initially ''Finnjet'' was not a very profitable ship and after only a few years of service there were rumours that she would be sold. The ship had been ordered in the same year as the beginning of the [[1973 oil crisis]], which reached its peak around the time of the ship's launch. Yet another huge leap of the oil price occurred near the turn of the decade. To increase her profitability, the ship was converted to a [[combined diesel-electric and gas]] propulsion with the addition of diesel-[[electric generator]]s in 1981 in [[Amsterdamse Droogdok Maatschappij]], Amsterdam. The change allowed to operate the ship at slower speeds, using cheaper fuel during the winter months. On the way to the shipyard she became the largest ship to have passed through the [[Kiel Canal]] at that time. A year later 75% of ''Finnjet''{{'}}s shares were sold to [[Effoa]] (one of the owners of [[Silja Line]]), and Finnjet Line was established as a joint venture of Finnlines and Effoa to operate the Finnjet. Starting from November 1985, ''Finnjet'' made 24-hour (later 22-hour) backtracking cruises from Helsinki during the winter season. The final batch of these cruises in October\u2013December 1995 included a short stop in [[Tallinn]]. In January 1986 another major renovation was carried out at W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Helsinki, with new Commodore-class cabins added in place of the old sundeck. Shortly after the refit the Denmark-based [[DFDS]] made an offer to buy the ''Finnjet'', but the offer was refused. Instead, in June of the same year Finnlines sold their remaining shares of the ''Finnjet'' to Effoa. In the beginning of 1987 the ship was painted in Silja Line's colors and incorporated in Silja's fleet. However, the technical responsibility for operating the ''Finnjet'' remained with Finnlines until May 1989 (this was of little consequence as Finnlines was almost entirely owned by Effoa at the time).\n[[Image:Finnjet model Effoa livery.jpg|thumb|left|A model of the ''Finnjet'' in the Effoa/Silja Line livery she carried 1987\u20131990]]\n\n===1987\u20132005===\n[[File:Finnjet Kustaanmiekka.webm|thumb|GTS ''Finnjet'' passing through the [[Kustaanmiekka]] strait near Helsinki]]\nAfter the ship had become a part of the Silja Line fleet, further renovations at [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft]] Kiel (HDW) in 1987, 1988 and 1989 saw almost all of the ship's public spaces rebuilt. In 1990 Effoa merged with its fellow Silja Line partner [[Johnson Line (company)|Johnson Line]] to form [[EffJohn]]. In 1991 an extremely large-scale reconstruction was planned, where the ship would have been lengthened by {{convert|20|m|ft}}, cabins enlarged, a new outdoor swimming pool added, and much of the superstructure built to a sleeker appearance. Unfortunately the plan proved to be too costly and was abandoned; the funds that had been raised for this reconstruction went to the rebuilding of [[MS Svea|MS ''Svea'']] and [[MS Wellamo|MS ''Wellamo'']] into ''Silja Karneval'' and ''Silja Festival''.\n\nStarting from 1992 Finnjet was used to monitor surface-layer chlorophyll, temperature and salinity in waters she sailed through for research by the [[Finnish Institute of Marine Research]].<ref>[http://www4.fimr.fi/project/algaline/algali1.htm Phytoplankton Blooms in the Baltic Sea in 1994] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024918/http://www4.fimr.fi/project/algaline/algali1.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}.

Finnjet was amongst the ferries used to search for survivors on the disaster area but she had to leave soon when cars carried on her upper cardeck started moving in the heavy seas, creating another potentially dangerous situation. In 1997 Finnjet was docked at [[G\u00f6taverken]] [[Cityvarvet]], [[Gothenburg]] and rebuilt with a larger tax-free shop in preparation for her new itenaries where she served on the Helsinki\u2013Travem\u00fcnde route only during the summer months, the rest of the year sailing on the Helsinki\u2013Tallinn route. Originally the port in Tallinn was [[Port of Muuga|Muuga]], but when the ship-way of [[Tallinn Passenger Port|Tallinn's old harbour]] was reconstructed in 1998, Finnjet moved there from the start of January 1999. Between 1997 and 2000 segments for the Finnish comedy series Huuliveikot were shot on board the Finnjet.\n\nIn 1999 the summer-route was altered to Helsinki\u2013Tallinn\u2013[[Rostock]]. In autumn of the same year the Finnish Institute of Marine Research installed new equipment for monitoring water quality and algae. In 2001 the ship was docked with modifications made to the turbines and propeller shaft. These and a new bottom paint allowed her to increase her top speed once more, to {{convert|33.5|kn}}.<ref name=\"Speed\" /> In mid-May 2002, only a few days after Finnjet's 25th anniversary cruise, Finnish newspaper [[Helsingin Sanomat]] reported the ship was for sale. At the time the information was thought to be false but later reports indicate the Finland-based [[Ecker\u00f6 Line]] did consider buying her around that time. In April 2004 Finnjet called in Helsinki for the last time, after which she left for another refit at [[Aker Finnyards]] [[Rauma shipyard]] in preparation for her new [[Saint Petersburg]] \u2013 Tallinn \u2013 Rostock route. During the refit most of her interiors were entirely rebuilt, new rudders were installed and bridge wings covered. The new route was believed to be profitable all year round, but this proved not to be the case. After the first summer season Finnjet was laid up for the winter 2004/2005. The route was eventually terminated after the 2005 summer season, and the ship was put up for sale.\n\n===2005\u20132008===\n[[File:GTS Finnjet Louisiana-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|GTS ''Finnjet'' when she was housing for the students, faculty, and staff of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center]]\nDuring the winter of 2005\u20132006, ''Finnjet'' was chartered to the faculty of medicine of [[Louisiana State University|Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans]] as a [[dormitory ship]] to provide housing to students, faculty, and staff displaced by [[Hurricane Katrina]].

In 1952, after Dassin had been out of work for two years, actress [[Bette Davis]] hired him to direct her in the Broadway revue ''[[Two's Company (musical)|Two's Company]]''. The show closed early, however, and Dassin left for Europe. \n\n===Move to Europe===\nDassin did not work as a film director again until ''[[Rififi]]'' in 1955 (a French production), his most influential film and an early work in the [[heist film|\"heist film\" genre]].  He won the Best Director award for the film at the 1955 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIt inspired later heist films, such as ''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (1960).<ref name=\"Luther\"/> Another film it  inspired was Dassin's own heist film ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'' (1964), filmed in France and [[Istanbul, Turkey]] with his future second wife, [[Melina Mercouri]] and Oscar winner [[Peter Ustinov]].\n\nMost of Dassin's films in the decades following the blacklist are European productions.<ref name=\"Luther\"/> His prolific later career in Europe and the affiliation with Greece through his second wife, combined with a common pronunciation of his surname as \"Da-SAN\" in Europe, as opposed to \"DASS-in\" in the United States leads to a common misconception that he was a European director.<ref name=\"dassin_interview\"/>\n\n===Melina Mercouri===\nAt the Cannes Film Festival in May 1955 he met Melina Mercouri, Greek actress and wife of Panos Harokopos.<ref name=\"Luther\"/> At about the same time, he discovered the literary works of [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]; these two elements created a bond with Greece. Dassin next made ''[[He Who Must Die]]'' (1957) based on Kazantzakis' ''[[Christ Recrucified]]'' and in which Mercouri appeared.

Along with Mercouri, he opposed the [[Greek military junta]]. \n\nThe couple had to leave Greece after the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|colonels' coup]] in 1967.

In 1974 he and Mercouri made ''[[The Rehearsal (1974 film)|The Rehearsal]]'' about the junta. \n\nWhile Mercouri became involved with politics and won a parliamentary seat, Dassin stayed with movie-making in Europe.
