Completed in the 1710s, it forms a half-length group portrait, possibly the rarest case in Watteau's body of work, and has been given various interpretatons; some scholars believe it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]], while some others believe it to be a depiction of members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]]. Because of that, the painting has been known under a number of various titles; its traditional naming in Western scholarship, ''Coquettes qui pour voir'', is derived from anonymous verses which the painting was featured with in [[Jean de Jullienne]]'s [[Recueil Jullienne|four-volume collection]] of engravings after Watteau's works.  \n\nBy the middle of the 18th century, ''Coquettes'' belonged to {{ill|Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers|fr|Louis Antoine Crozat}}, a nephew of the Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]]; after his death in 1770, the painting, along with a most part of the collection he owned, was acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772. Since then the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. In Russian literature, the painting is currently known as '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}; adopted into French as ''Acteurs de la Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise''<ref name=bordeaux1980/> or ''Les comediens fran\u00e7ais''.{{sfn|Zolotov|1985|p=98}}}}, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A.

To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Completed in the 1710s, it forms a half-length group portrait, possibly the rarest case in Watteau's body of work, and has been given various interpretatons; some scholars believe it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]], while some others believe it to be a depiction of members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]]. Because of that, the painting has been known under a number of various titles; its traditional naming in Western scholarship, ''Coquettes qui pour voir'', is derived from anonymous verses which the painting was featured with in [[Jean de Jullienne]]'s [[Recueil Jullienne|four-volume collection]] of engravings after Watteau's works.  \n\nBy the middle of the 18th century, ''Coquettes'' belonged to {{ill|Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers|fr|Louis Antoine Crozat}}, a nephew of the Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]]; after his death in 1770, the painting, along with a most part of the collection he owned, was acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772. Since then the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. In Russian literature, the painting is currently known as '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}; adopted into French as ''Acteurs de la Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise''<ref name=bordeaux1980/> or ''Les comediens fran\u00e7ais''.{{sfn|Zolotov|1985|p=98}}}}, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks.

To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

It is one of two active [[Fleet Air Arm]] bases (the other being [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose)]] and is currently home to the Royal Navy [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat HMA2]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters as well as the Royal Navy's [[Commando Helicopter Force]] [[AgustaWestland AW101|Merlin]] HCi3/3A/4 and [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters.\n\nThe site consists of {{convert|1000|acre|sqmi km2|1|abbr=on}} of airfield sites plus ranges and minor estates. Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton is a large multi-role air station with an annual budget of some \u00a361 million. The airfield is also home to the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]] and the station hosts an annual Air Day in July.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1938, the potential of the land at Yeovilton for use as an airfield was spotted by [[Westland Aircraft]]'s chief test pilot [[Harald Penrose]] and an offer was made to buy the land. The owners, however{{spaced ndash}}the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] of the [[Church of England]]{{spaced ndash}}refused to sell it. In 1939, the Admiralty Air Division commandeered {{convert|417|acre|ha}} of the land and work began on the construction of the site. The runways being completed in 1941 despite problems with poor drainage. A main runway of {{convert|3645|ft|abbr=on|0}} and three subsidiary runways each of {{convert|3000|ft|abbr=on|0}} had been constructed.<ref name=\"berryman\">{{cite book |title=Somerset airfields in the Second World War |last=Berryman |first=David |year=2006 |publisher=Countryside Books |location=Newbury |isbn=1-85306-864-0 |pages=194\u2013219 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ground Crew Working on Fleet Air Arm Aircraft at Rnas Yeovilton, September 1943 TR1275.jpg|thumb|A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|alt=A Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafire being refuelled by a petrol bowser at Yeovilton in September 1943.|left]]\n[[750 Naval Air Squadron]] was formed at [[RNAS Ford]] on 24 May 1939 from the Royal Navy Observer School, but after Ford was bombed early in the war, it moved to RNAS Yeovilton.<ref name=NN>{{cite web|url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2002/0202/0002022601.asp|title=50 Years Not Out for 750 Squadron|publisher=[[Navy News]]|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> They were joined by [[751 Naval Air Squadron|751]] and [[752 Naval Air Squadron|752]] Squadrons with the Naval Air Fighter School soon following. In addition Westland Aircraft developed a repair facility at the site.  From July 1940, the site was subjected to [[Luftwaffe]] bombing on several occasions. [[794 Naval Air Squadron]] was the first to be formed at the base and served to train other squadrons to practise aerial gunnery, and part of one of the runways was marked up as a flight deck to practise landing on an aircraft carrier. [[827 Naval Air Squadron]] was also stationed at Yeovilton operating [[Fairey Albacore]]s and later [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]]s starting in May 1943, becoming the first squadron to receive Barracudas in any substantial number.<ref name=\"berryman\"/> Several units which were preparing for embarkation were also stationed at the site during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Because of pressure on space at the airfield, satellite sites were set up at [[RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II)|Charlton Horethorne]] and [[Henstridge Airfield|Henstridge]] in 1942. A centre for Air Direction Radar was also established at Speckington Manor on the edge of the airfield.<ref name=\"berryman\"/>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Yeovilton became one of the main demobilization centres for the Royal Navy, with many of the men helping to refurbish the runways while they stayed at the base. In 1952, Yeovilton became the shore base for the fleets all-weather fighters. The runways were further extended by [[Taylor Woodrow]] in 1952 and 1957 to cope with jet aircraft. In May 1953, it became the headquarters of Flag Officer Flying Training.<ref name=\"helis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.helis.com/database/?menu=2&tpais=UK&tbase=27&titulo=UK%20RNAS%20Yeovilton |title=RNAS Yeovilton |accessdate=20 February 2008 |work=Helis.com }}</ref>\n\n[[File:899 Shar Yeovilton.jpg|thumb|[[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|BAe Sea Harrier FRS1]] of 899 Naval Air Squadron at Yeovilton Naval Air Station in 1982.]]\nDuring the 1960s, further development work was undertaken, with the School of Fighter Direction returning to the site and the [[De Havilland Venom|Sea Venoms]] being replaced by the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]s then in turn by the [[McDonnell-Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantom FG1]] as a carrier-borne fighter. The 1970s saw the Flag Officer, Naval Air Command (FONAC), transferring from [[RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus)|RNAS Lee-on-Solent]]. Royal Navy fixed wing operations were phased out, and the [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantoms]] transferred to the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. The base remained as the home of the Commando Helicopter Squadrons, using the [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] HU5 and later the [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] HC4, and the fixed wing [[Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit]] (FRADU) and became the main shore base for the Navy's fleet of [[Sea Harrier]] FRS1 (and later, FA2).

As a result, The Welbeck Estate Group acquired in the nearby town of Ilchester two entire estates of apartments in Hermes Place and Lyster Close that were used by personnel at HMS Heron.

It is one of two active [[Fleet Air Arm]] bases (the other being [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose)]] and is currently home to the Royal Navy [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat HMA2]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters as well as the Royal Navy's [[Commando Helicopter Force]] [[AgustaWestland AW101|Merlin]] HCi3/3A/4 and [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters.\n\nThe site consists of {{convert|1000|acre|sqmi km2|1|abbr=on}} of airfield sites plus ranges and minor estates. Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Yeovilton is a large multi-role air station with an annual budget of some \u00a361 million. The airfield is also home to the [[Fleet Air Arm Museum]] and the station hosts an annual Air Day in July.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1938, the potential of the land at Yeovilton for use as an airfield was spotted by [[Westland Aircraft]]'s chief test pilot [[Harald Penrose]] and an offer was made to buy the land. The owners, however{{spaced ndash}}the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] of the [[Church of England]]{{spaced ndash}}refused to sell it. In 1939, the Admiralty Air Division commandeered {{convert|417|acre|ha}} of the land and work began on the construction of the site. The runways being completed in 1941 despite problems with poor drainage.

In addition Westland Aircraft developed a repair facility at the site.  From July 1940, the site was subjected to [[Luftwaffe]] bombing on several occasions. [[794 Naval Air Squadron]] was the first to be formed at the base and served to train other squadrons to practise aerial gunnery, and part of one of the runways was marked up as a flight deck to practise landing on an aircraft carrier. [[827 Naval Air Squadron]] was also stationed at Yeovilton operating [[Fairey Albacore]]s and later [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]]s starting in May 1943, becoming the first squadron to receive Barracudas in any substantial number.<ref name=\"berryman\"/> Several units which were preparing for embarkation were also stationed at the site during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Because of pressure on space at the airfield, satellite sites were set up at [[RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II)|Charlton Horethorne]] and [[Henstridge Airfield|Henstridge]] in 1942. A centre for Air Direction Radar was also established at Speckington Manor on the edge of the airfield.<ref name=\"berryman\"/>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Yeovilton became one of the main demobilization centres for the Royal Navy, with many of the men helping to refurbish the runways while they stayed at the base. In 1952, Yeovilton became the shore base for the fleets all-weather fighters. The runways were further extended by [[Taylor Woodrow]] in 1952 and 1957 to cope with jet aircraft. In May 1953, it became the headquarters of Flag Officer Flying Training.<ref name=\"helis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.helis.com/database/?menu=2&tpais=UK&tbase=27&titulo=UK%20RNAS%20Yeovilton |title=RNAS Yeovilton |accessdate=20 February 2008 |work=Helis.com }}</ref>\n\n[[File:899 Shar Yeovilton.jpg|thumb|[[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|BAe Sea Harrier FRS1]] of 899 Naval Air Squadron at Yeovilton Naval Air Station in 1982.]]\nDuring the 1960s, further development work was undertaken, with the School of Fighter Direction returning to the site and the [[De Havilland Venom|Sea Venoms]] being replaced by the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]s then in turn by the [[McDonnell-Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantom FG1]] as a carrier-borne fighter. The 1970s saw the Flag Officer, Naval Air Command (FONAC), transferring from [[RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus)|RNAS Lee-on-Solent]]. Royal Navy fixed wing operations were phased out, and the [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantoms]] transferred to the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. The base remained as the home of the Commando Helicopter Squadrons, using the [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] HU5 and later the [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] HC4, and the fixed wing [[Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit]] (FRADU) and became the main shore base for the Navy's fleet of [[Sea Harrier]] FRS1 (and later, FA2). A ski-jump (now removed) was installed to enable practice of [[STOVL|ski-jump assisted take-offs]].<ref name=\"helis\"/>\n\nIn the mid 1980s Defence Estates announced that many of the Royal Navy ratings married quarters at RNAS Yeovilton were surplus to requirements.

Katorga camps were established in the 17th century in underpopulated areas of Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]] \u2013 regions that had few towns or food sources and lacked any organised transportation systems. Despite the isolated conditions, a few prisoners successfully escaped to populated areas. After the change in Russian penal law in 1847, exile and katorga became the common punishment for participants in nationalistic uprisings within the Russian Empire. This led to increasing numbers of [[Poles]] sent to Siberia for katorga. From these times, Siberia gained its fearful connotation of punishment, which was further enhanced by the Soviet GULAG system.

In 1927 the official in charge of prison administration wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The exploitation of prison labour, the system of squeezing \"golden sweat\" from them, the organisation of production in places of confinement, which while profitable from a commercial point of view is fundamentally lacking in corrective significance \u2013 these are entirely inadmissible in Soviet places of confinement.<ref>D.J.

In 1923 he was arrested for illegally crossing borders and smuggling. He was sentenced to 10 years' hard labor at [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], which later came to be known as the \"first camp of the Gulag\". While serving his sentence he wrote a letter to the camp administration detailing a number of \"productivity improvement\" proposals including the infamous system of labor exploitation whereas the inmates' food rations were to be linked to their rate of production, a proposal known as nourishment scale (\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f). This notorious you-eat-as-you-work system would often kill weaker prisoners in weeks and caused countless casualties. The letter caught the attention of a number of high communist officials including [[Genrikh Yagoda]] and Frenkel soon went from being an inmate to becoming a camp commander and an important Gulag official.

The growth of the camp system coincided with the peak of the Soviet [[industrialisation]] campaign. Most of the camps established to accommodate the masses of incoming prisoners were assigned distinct economic tasks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} These included the exploitation of natural resources and the colonisation of remote areas, as well as the realisation of enormous infrastructural facilities and industrial construction projects. The plan to achieve these goals with \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" instead of labor camps was dropped after the revealing of the [[Nazino affair]] in 1933; subsequently the Gulag system was expanded.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe 1931\u201332 archives indicate the Gulag had approximately 200,000 prisoners in the camps; while in 1935, approximately 800,000 were in camps and 300,000 in colonies (annual averages).<ref name=Kozlov />\n\n[[File:Korolev posle aresta 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Rocket engineer [[Sergei Korolev]] shortly after his arrest in 1938]]\nIn the early 1930s, a tightening of Soviet penal policy caused significant growth of the prison camp population.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HYSGZs6mW5wC|title=Gulag: A History of the Soviet Camps|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2012-08-02|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141975269|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The Camps Expand}}</ref> During the [[Great Purge]] of 1937\u201338, mass arrests caused another increase in inmate numbers.

After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Stalin]] was able to take control of the government, and began to form the gulag system.  On June 27, 1929 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=9}}</ref> These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years.  Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the [[NKVD]].  The purpose of these new camps was to colonise the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivisation and rapid industrial development. [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called [[Kulaks]]. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as \"[[dekulakization]]\". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term \"Kulak\" would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakisation process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=11}}</ref> Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labour work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing.  The \"special settlers\", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realised the problem, and began to reform the dekulakisation process. To help prevent the mass escapes the [[OGPU]] started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The [[OGPU]] also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakisation process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labour force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== During World War II ===\n\n==== Political role ====\n[[File:Kolyma road00.jpg|thumb|Road construction by inmates of the ''[[Dalstroy]]'' (part of the '[[R504 Kolyma Highway|Road of Bones]]' from Magadan to [[Yakutsk]])]]\n\nOn the eve of [[World War II]], Soviet archives indicate a combined camp and colony population upwards of 1.6 million in 1939, according to V.

They were initially intended for [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborators]], but then other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported peoples]] who fled from exile) were also sentenced to \"katorga works\". Prisoners sentenced to \"katorga works\" were sent to Gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime and many of them perished.<ref name=\"gulag1\" />\n\n==== Economic role ====\n[[File:Political prisoners in Gulag.jpg|thumb|Political prisoners eating lunch in the [[Intalag]] coal mine]]\n[[File:Central shop in Norilsk in 1957.jpg|thumb|Central shop in [[Norilsk]] built by prisoners of the [[Norillag]]]]\n[[File:Logging at Small Ungut.jpeg|thumb|Lithuanian deportees preparing logs for rafting on the [[Mana River]]]]\nUp until World War II, the Gulag system expanded dramatically to create a Soviet \"camp economy\". Right before the war, forced labour provided 46.5% of the nation's [[nickel]], 76% of its [[tin]], 40% of its [[cobalt]], 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\"/>  And in preparation for war, the NKVD put up many more factories and built highways and railroads.\n\nThe Gulag quickly switched to production of arms and supplies for the army after fighting began. At first, transportation remained a priority. In 1940 the NKVD focused most of its energy on railroad construction.<ref name=khlev>{{cite book | last= Khevniuk | first= Oleg V.|title= The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror|year= 2004|publisher= Yale University Press|pages= 236\u2013286}}</ref> This would prove extremely important when the German advance into the Soviet Union started in 1941. In addition, factories converted to produce ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies. Moreover, the NKVD gathered skilled workers and specialists from throughout the Gulag into 380 special colonies which produced tanks, aircraft, armaments, and ammunition.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\">{{cite book|last= Ivanova|first= Galina Mikhailovna|title= Labor Camp Socialism: The Gulag in the Soviet Totalitarian System|year= 2000|publisher= Sharpe|location= Armonk, NY|pages= 69\u2013126}}</ref>\n\nDespite its low capital costs, the camp economy suffered from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labour camps\" /> But the greatest problem was simple \u2013 forced labour was less efficient than free labour. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free labourers in the USSR at the time,<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> which may be partially explained by malnutrition.\n\nTo make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: \"There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.\" In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: \"By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.\"<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.<ref name=ebacon>{{cite book|last= Bacon|first= Edwin|title= The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in the Light of the Archives|year= 1994|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York, NY|pages= 42\u201363, 82\u2013100, 123\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labour scarcity at the beginning of the war. The [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1936\u20131938 had provided a large supply of free labour, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their [[project]]s, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project.<ref name=khlev /> To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labour-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.<ref name=khlev /> But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) Many labourers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.<ref name=ebacon />\n\nEven as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to \"do more with less\". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labour resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of [[Operation Barbarossa]]'s advance prevented the evacuation of all labourers in good time, and the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands]]. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labour, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of labourers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.<ref name=ebacon />\n\n=== After World War II ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Labor camp.jpg|thumb|Upper Debin Camp, painted by former prisoner [[Nikolai Getman]]]] -->\n[[File:Transpolar Railway between Salekhard and Nadym.jpg|thumb| The [[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway|Transpolar Railway]] was a project of the Gulag system that took place from 1947 to 1953.]]\nAfter World War II the number of inmates in prison camps and colonies, again, rose sharply, reaching approximately 2.5 million people by the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of whom were in camps).\n\nWhen the war in Europe ended in May 1945, as many as two million former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated into the USSR]].<ref>Mark Elliott. \"The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944\u201347,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 88, No. 2 (June 1973), pp. 253\u2013275.</ref> On February 11, 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] signed a Repatriation Agreement with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"darkside\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation \u2013 The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets.

However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meagre food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labour.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 The Gulag Collection: Paintings of Nikolai Getman]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127121250/http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 |date=November 27, 2007 }}</ref> In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanisation of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers.

Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet [[production quota]]), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onward), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfilment and overfulfilment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onward), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers ([[Udarnik|shock workers]] or [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] in Soviet parlance).<ref name=\"borodkin\">Leonid Borodkin and Simon Ertz 'Forced Labor and the Need for Motivation: Wages and Bonuses in the Stalinist Camp System', ''Comparative Economic Studies'', June 2005, Vol.47, Iss. 2, pp. 418\u2013436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Shack from Gulag \u2013 reconstruction in [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]]]]\n\nA distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardised \"nourishment scales\": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered. [[Naftaly Frenkel]] is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfil high production quota.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.\n\nConsidering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:\n\n*\"[[Kulak]]s\", [[osadnik]]s, \"[[ukaznik]]s\" (people sentenced for violation of various [[ukase]]s, such as [[Law of Spikelets]], decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of [[criminal law]]\n*Dedicated criminals: \"[[thieves in law]]\"\n*People sentenced for various [[political prisoner|political]] and religious reasons.\n\n=== Gulag and famine (1932\u20131933) ===\nA severe [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1931\u20131933]] swept across many different regions in the Soviet Union. During this time, it is estimated that around six to seven million people starved to death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=55}}</ref> On 7 August 1932, a new edict drafted by Stalin specified a minimum sentence of ten years or execution for theft from collective farms or of cooperative property. Over the next few months, prosecutions rose fourfold. A large share of cases prosecuted under the law were for the theft of small quantities of grain worth less than fifty rubles. The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/persa/010fulltext.pdf|title=Theft Under Stalin: A Property Rights Analysis|last=Gorlizki|first=Yoram|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.\n\nPrisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in [[Soviet Uzbekistan]] died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around {{convert|300|Cal|kJ}} worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed \"not to spare bullets\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=61}}</ref> The bodies of inmates who tried to escape were commonly displayed in the courtyards of the camps, and the administrators would forcibly escort the inmates around the dead bodies as a message. Until 1934, lack of food and the outbreak of diseases started to destabilise the Gulag system. It wasn't until the famine ended that the system started to stabilize.\n\n=== Social conditions ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labour with one of them being [[logging]] (''lesopoval''). The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.\n\nLocals who captured a [[Fugitive|runaway]] were given rewards.<ref>\"[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ Nikolai Getman: The Gulag Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513172402/http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}\"</ref> It is also said that Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters.

Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]] is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /> The [[colloquial]] name for the islands, \"[[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]\", entered the [[vernacular]] as a [[synonym]] for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for \"re-education of [[class enemy|class enemies]]\" and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian [[intelligentsia]], enjoyed relative freedom (within the natural confinement of the islands). Local newspapers and magazines were published and even some scientific research was carried out (e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely). Eventually Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp; in fact some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929 [[Maxim Gorky]] visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky's trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled \"Po Soiuzu Sovetov,\" Part V, subtitled \"Solovki.\" In the report, Gorky wrote that \"camps such as 'Solovki' were absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Yedlin>{{cite book|last=Yedlin|first=Tova|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96605-8|page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zxt5_vI_ozcC&pg=PA188}}</ref>\n\nWith the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labour, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] or the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]), including facilities in big cities \u2014 parts of the famous [[Moscow Metro]] and the [[Moscow State University]] new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialisation of the 1930s, [[World War II|war-time]] and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry. Gorky organised in 1933 a trip of 120 writers and artists to the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal, 36 of them wrote a propaganda book about the construction published in 1934 and destroyed in 1937.\n\n[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]].

However, camps were generally spread throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], including the European parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Mongolia]], which were under the direct control of the Gulag.\n\nNot all camps were fortified; some in Siberia were marked only by posts. Escape was deterred by the harsh elements, as well as tracking dogs that were assigned to each camp. While during the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often aided escapees, many of the tribes were also [[victimised]] by escaped thieves. Tantalised by large rewards as well, they began aiding authorities in the capture of Gulag inmates. Camp guards were given stern incentive to keep their inmates in line at all costs; if a prisoner escaped under a guard's watch, the guard would often be stripped of his uniform and become a Gulag inmate himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Further, if an escaping prisoner was shot, guards could be fined amounts that were often equivalent to one or two weeks wages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ru200008020027.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of 'Project 503' to build a railroad from [[Salekhard]] to [[Igarka]] near [[Turukhansk]] on the [[Yenisey]]]]\n\nIn some cases, teams of inmates were dropped off in new territory with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die. Sometimes it took several waves of colonists before any one group survived to establish the camp.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe area along the [[Indigirka river]] was known as ''the Gulag inside the Gulag''.

It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.<ref name=\"Ivanova 2000\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince many of these existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was lower. It peaked in the early 1950s, when there were more than 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union.

The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature \u2013 providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favoured by historian Robert Conquest, amongst others). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalised the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society|last=Barnes|first=Stephen A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-15112-0|location=Princeton|pages=7\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] argued that as part of a [[totalitarian]] system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in \"total domination.\" In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 437 \u2013 59</ref>\n\nShe also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all \"forced labour\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 \u2013 45</ref> The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labour camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labour camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organised for labour purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticises other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labour. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labour and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nArendt argues that together with the systematised, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximising cruelty and by organising the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds.

On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (1917\u20131990 \u0433\u0433.).|journal=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f XXI|year=1994|issue=\u2116 1\u20132|pages=107\u2013124|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330205748/http://kob.rv.ua/doki-dai/dotu/other/zemskov/zemskov_politrepressii(1917-1990).pdf |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by [[Viktor Zemskov]].<ref name=\"Rousso, Golsan\">{{cite book|last1=Rousso|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Rousso|last2=Golsan|first2=Richard|title=Stalinism and nazism: history and memory compared|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9000-6|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIt7fMp30sAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars,<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /><ref name=Ellman_SRS />  despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics.<ref name= Vishnevsky /> It is also necessary to note that not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted. Thus, Sergei Maksudov alleged that although literary sources, for example the books of [[Lev Razgon]] or [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], did not envisage the total number of the camps very well and markedly exaggerated their size, on the other hand, Viktor Zemskov, who published many documents by the NKVD and [[KGB]], was far from understanding of the Gulag essence and the nature of socio-political processes in the country. He added that without distinguishing the degree of accuracy and reliability of certain figures, without making a critical analysis of sources, without comparing new data with already known information, Zemskov absolutises the published materials by presenting them as the ultimate truth. As a result, Maksudov charges that Zemskov attempts to make generalized statements with reference to a particular document, as a rule, do not hold water.<ref name=\"\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\">{{cite journal|last=\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432|first=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439|title=\u041e \u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0432 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435 \"\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0441\"|journal=\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|year=1995|issue=\u2116 9|pages=114\u2013118|url=http://scepsis.ru/library/id_956.html|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Frenkel2.jpg|thumb|[[OGPU]] chiefs responsible for construction of the [[White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal]]: right: [[Naftaly Frenkel|Frenkel]]; center: [[Matvei Berman|Berman]]; left: Afanasev (Head of the southern part of BelBaltLag)]]\n\nIn response, Zemskov wrote that the charge that Zemskov allegedly did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers is that they do not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with \"old\" one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatise the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.<ref name=\"\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0443\" />\n\nAccording to French historian [[Nicolas Werth]], the mountains of the materials of the Gulag archives, which are stored in funds of the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] and are being constantly exposed during the last fifteen years, represent only a very small part of bureaucratic prose of immense size left over the decades of \"creativity\" by the \"dull and reptile\" organisation managing the Gulag.

As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labour conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of \"corrective labour colonies\" served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.<ref name=\"GRZ\" /> Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labour colonies amounted to 2,625,000.<ref name=\"Anatoly Vishnevsky\">[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema05.php \"The Total Number of Repressed\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including [[Robert Conquest]]<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the 'high numbers' of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936 is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census,<ref>http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/rosefielde.pdf</ref><ref name= Vishnevsky>Vishnevsky, Alantoly. \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (The Demographic Loss of Repression), Demoscope Weekly, December 31, 2007, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php retrieved] April 13, 2011</ref> it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> Although Conquest cited Beria's report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.<ref>https://www.bu.edu/iscip/pubseries/PubSeries1conquest.pdf</ref>\n\nThese data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928\u201353, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG ''labour camps'' and 4\u20135 million passed through the ''labour colonies''.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps' capacity, not the actual number of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" />\n\n== Influence ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== Culture ===\n<!-- this section is for the general influence on the Soviet culture of **Gulag itself**, not a list of publications about Gulag -->\n\nThe Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.\n\nThe Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern [[Russian folklore]].  Many songs by the authors-performers known as the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|''bards'']], most notably [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]], neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of \"Zeks\". Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe memoirs of [[Alexander Dolgun]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society.  These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.\n\nAnother cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like [[Magadan]], where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to [[Moscow]]'s and [[Eddie Rosner]] played jazz.\n\n==== Literature ====\nMany eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:\n[[File:1929-ShalamovV.jpg|thumb|[[Varlam Shalamov]] after first arrest, 1929]]\n* [[Varlam Shalamov]]'s ''[[The Kolyma Tales|Kolyma Tales]]'' is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.\n* [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] wrote ''[[I Chose Freedom (book)|I Chose Freedom]]'' after defecting to the [[United States]] in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labour camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at [[Kemerovo]] on the [[Tom River]] in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the [[KGB]] for every convict they employed.\n* [[Anatoli Granovsky]] wrote ''I Was an NKVD Agent'' after [[Defection|defecting]] to [[Sweden]] in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky's father was sent to the gulag in 1937.\n* [[Julius Margolin]]'s book ''A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka'' was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.\n* [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]] wrote ''A World Apart'', which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.\n* [[Victor Herman]]'s book ''Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life''. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.\n* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was not the first literary work about labour camps. His previous book on the subject, \"[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]\", about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, ''[[Novy Mir]]'' (''New World''), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. ''[[The First Circle]]'', an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the ''[[Marfino]]'' ''[[sharashka]]'' or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.\n* [[Slavomir Rawicz]]'s book \"[[The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom]]\": In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labour camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday horrors. \n* [[J\u00e1nos R\u00f3zs\u00e1s]], a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich-inscribed-first-edition-alexander-solzhenitsyn-signed/ | title=One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich}}</ref> wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.\n*[[Zoltan Szalkai]], a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.\n* [[Karlo \u0160tajner]], a Croatian communist who was active in the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the manager of the [[Comintern Publishing House]] in Moscow 1932\u201339, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR\u2013[[Yugoslavia]]n political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. He wrote an impressive book titled ''7000 days in Siberia''.\n* ''Dancing Under the Red Star'' by [[Karl Tobien]] ({{ISBN|1-4000-7078-3}}) tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag to tell about it.\n* ''Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag'' ({{ISBN|0-394-49497-0}}), by a member of the US Embassy, and ''I Was a Slave in Russia'' ({{ISBN|0-8159-5800-5}}), an American factory owner's son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946\u201355.\n* [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] wrote two famous books about her remembrances, ''Journey Into the Whirlwind'' and ''Within the Whirlwind''.\n*[[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], a pro-[[Croatia]]n Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in [[Austria]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Markovi\u0107 wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled ''Ten years in Gulag'' (''Deset godina u Gulagu'', Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).\n* [[Ani\u021ba Nandri\u0219-Cudla]]'s book, ''20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani \u00een Siberia]'' is the own life's account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cern\u0103u\u021bi) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system together with her three sons.  Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities.  It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame  [[typhus]], [[scorbutus]], [[malnutrition]], extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with three years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labour camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.\n* [[Frantsishak Alyakhnovich]] \u2013 Solovki prisoner\n* [[Blagoy Popov]], a Bulgarian communist and a defendant in the [[Leipzig trial]], along with [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and [[Vasil Tanev]], was arrested in 1937 during the [[Stalinist purges]] and spent seventeen years in [[Norillag]]. Popov was released in 1954, after the death of Stalin, and returned to [[Bulgaria]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438|last=\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432|first=\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0439|publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\"|year=2012|isbn=978-619-152-025-1|location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f|pages=37, 57}}</ref> He wrote his autobiographical account in the book ''From the Leipzig trial to the Siberia camps'' (''\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438'', \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, 2012 {{ISBN|978-619-152-025-1}}).\n* [[Mkrtich Armen]], an Armenian writer who was imprisoned in 1937 and rehabilitated in 1945, published a collection of his memories under the title \"They Ordered to Give You\" in 1964.\n* [[Gurgen Mahari]], an Armenian writer and poet, who was arrested in 1936, released in 1947, arrested again in 1948 and sent into Siberian exile as an \"unreliable type\" until 1954, wrote \"Barbed Wires in Blossom\", a novella based largely on his personal experiences in a Soviet gulag.\n\n=== Colonisation ===\n[[File:Vorkuta r.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Vorkuta]]]]\nSoviet [[wikisource:\u041e\u0431 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445|state documents]] show that the goals of the gulag included colonisation of sparsely populated remote areas.

In addition, for persons who served full term, but who were denied the free choice of place of residence, it was recommended to assign them for \"free settlement\" and give them land in the general vicinity of the place of confinement.\n\nThe gulag inherited this approach from the [[katorga]] system.\n\nIt is estimated that of the 40,000 people collecting state pensions in [[Vorkuta Gulag|Vorkuta]], 32,000 are trapped former gulag inmates, or their descendants.<ref>Robert Conquest, Paul Hollander: Political violence: belief, behavior, and legitimation p.55, Palgrave Macmillan;(2008) {{ISBN|978-0-230-60646-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Life after term served ===\nPersons who served a term in a camp or in a prison were restricted from taking a wide range of jobs.

Katorga camps were established in the 17th century in underpopulated areas of Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]] \u2013 regions that had few towns or food sources and lacked any organised transportation systems. Despite the isolated conditions, a few prisoners successfully escaped to populated areas. After the change in Russian penal law in 1847, exile and katorga became the common punishment for participants in nationalistic uprisings within the Russian Empire. This led to increasing numbers of [[Poles]] sent to Siberia for katorga. From these times, Siberia gained its fearful connotation of punishment, which was further enhanced by the Soviet GULAG system.

In 1927 the official in charge of prison administration wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The exploitation of prison labour, the system of squeezing \"golden sweat\" from them, the organisation of production in places of confinement, which while profitable from a commercial point of view is fundamentally lacking in corrective significance \u2013 these are entirely inadmissible in Soviet places of confinement.<ref>D.J.

In 1923 he was arrested for illegally crossing borders and smuggling. He was sentenced to 10 years' hard labor at [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], which later came to be known as the \"first camp of the Gulag\". While serving his sentence he wrote a letter to the camp administration detailing a number of \"productivity improvement\" proposals including the infamous system of labor exploitation whereas the inmates' food rations were to be linked to their rate of production, a proposal known as nourishment scale (\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f). This notorious you-eat-as-you-work system would often kill weaker prisoners in weeks and caused countless casualties. The letter caught the attention of a number of high communist officials including [[Genrikh Yagoda]] and Frenkel soon went from being an inmate to becoming a camp commander and an important Gulag official.

The growth of the camp system coincided with the peak of the Soviet [[industrialisation]] campaign. Most of the camps established to accommodate the masses of incoming prisoners were assigned distinct economic tasks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} These included the exploitation of natural resources and the colonisation of remote areas, as well as the realisation of enormous infrastructural facilities and industrial construction projects. The plan to achieve these goals with \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" instead of labor camps was dropped after the revealing of the [[Nazino affair]] in 1933; subsequently the Gulag system was expanded.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe 1931\u201332 archives indicate the Gulag had approximately 200,000 prisoners in the camps; while in 1935, approximately 800,000 were in camps and 300,000 in colonies (annual averages).<ref name=Kozlov />\n\n[[File:Korolev posle aresta 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Rocket engineer [[Sergei Korolev]] shortly after his arrest in 1938]]\nIn the early 1930s, a tightening of Soviet penal policy caused significant growth of the prison camp population.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HYSGZs6mW5wC|title=Gulag: A History of the Soviet Camps|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2012-08-02|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141975269|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The Camps Expand}}</ref> During the [[Great Purge]] of 1937\u201338, mass arrests caused another increase in inmate numbers.

After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Stalin]] was able to take control of the government, and began to form the gulag system.  On June 27, 1929 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=9}}</ref> These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years.  Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the [[NKVD]].  The purpose of these new camps was to colonise the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivisation and rapid industrial development. [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called [[Kulaks]]. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as \"[[dekulakization]]\". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term \"Kulak\" would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakisation process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=11}}</ref> Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labour work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing.  The \"special settlers\", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realised the problem, and began to reform the dekulakisation process. To help prevent the mass escapes the [[OGPU]] started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The [[OGPU]] also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakisation process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labour force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== During World War II ===\n\n==== Political role ====\n[[File:Kolyma road00.jpg|thumb|Road construction by inmates of the ''[[Dalstroy]]'' (part of the '[[R504 Kolyma Highway|Road of Bones]]' from Magadan to [[Yakutsk]])]]\n\nOn the eve of [[World War II]], Soviet archives indicate a combined camp and colony population upwards of 1.6 million in 1939, according to V.

They were initially intended for [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborators]], but then other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported peoples]] who fled from exile) were also sentenced to \"katorga works\". Prisoners sentenced to \"katorga works\" were sent to Gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime and many of them perished.<ref name=\"gulag1\" />\n\n==== Economic role ====\n[[File:Political prisoners in Gulag.jpg|thumb|Political prisoners eating lunch in the [[Intalag]] coal mine]]\n[[File:Central shop in Norilsk in 1957.jpg|thumb|Central shop in [[Norilsk]] built by prisoners of the [[Norillag]]]]\n[[File:Logging at Small Ungut.jpeg|thumb|Lithuanian deportees preparing logs for rafting on the [[Mana River]]]]\nUp until World War II, the Gulag system expanded dramatically to create a Soviet \"camp economy\". Right before the war, forced labour provided 46.5% of the nation's [[nickel]], 76% of its [[tin]], 40% of its [[cobalt]], 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\"/>  And in preparation for war, the NKVD put up many more factories and built highways and railroads.\n\nThe Gulag quickly switched to production of arms and supplies for the army after fighting began. At first, transportation remained a priority. In 1940 the NKVD focused most of its energy on railroad construction.<ref name=khlev>{{cite book | last= Khevniuk | first= Oleg V.|title= The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror|year= 2004|publisher= Yale University Press|pages= 236\u2013286}}</ref> This would prove extremely important when the German advance into the Soviet Union started in 1941. In addition, factories converted to produce ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies. Moreover, the NKVD gathered skilled workers and specialists from throughout the Gulag into 380 special colonies which produced tanks, aircraft, armaments, and ammunition.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\">{{cite book|last= Ivanova|first= Galina Mikhailovna|title= Labor Camp Socialism: The Gulag in the Soviet Totalitarian System|year= 2000|publisher= Sharpe|location= Armonk, NY|pages= 69\u2013126}}</ref>\n\nDespite its low capital costs, the camp economy suffered from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labour camps\" /> But the greatest problem was simple \u2013 forced labour was less efficient than free labour. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free labourers in the USSR at the time,<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> which may be partially explained by malnutrition.\n\nTo make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: \"There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.\" In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: \"By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.\"<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.<ref name=ebacon>{{cite book|last= Bacon|first= Edwin|title= The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in the Light of the Archives|year= 1994|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York, NY|pages= 42\u201363, 82\u2013100, 123\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labour scarcity at the beginning of the war. The [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1936\u20131938 had provided a large supply of free labour, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their [[project]]s, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project.<ref name=khlev /> To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labour-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.<ref name=khlev /> But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) Many labourers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.<ref name=ebacon />\n\nEven as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to \"do more with less\". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labour resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of [[Operation Barbarossa]]'s advance prevented the evacuation of all labourers in good time, and the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands]]. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labour, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of labourers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.<ref name=ebacon />\n\n=== After World War II ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Labor camp.jpg|thumb|Upper Debin Camp, painted by former prisoner [[Nikolai Getman]]]] -->\n[[File:Transpolar Railway between Salekhard and Nadym.jpg|thumb| The [[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway|Transpolar Railway]] was a project of the Gulag system that took place from 1947 to 1953.]]\nAfter World War II the number of inmates in prison camps and colonies, again, rose sharply, reaching approximately 2.5 million people by the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of whom were in camps).\n\nWhen the war in Europe ended in May 1945, as many as two million former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated into the USSR]].<ref>Mark Elliott. \"The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944\u201347,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 88, No. 2 (June 1973), pp. 253\u2013275.</ref> On February 11, 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] signed a Repatriation Agreement with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"darkside\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation \u2013 The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets.

However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meagre food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labour.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 The Gulag Collection: Paintings of Nikolai Getman]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127121250/http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 |date=November 27, 2007 }}</ref> In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanisation of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers.

Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet [[production quota]]), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onward), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfilment and overfulfilment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onward), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers ([[Udarnik|shock workers]] or [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] in Soviet parlance).<ref name=\"borodkin\">Leonid Borodkin and Simon Ertz 'Forced Labor and the Need for Motivation: Wages and Bonuses in the Stalinist Camp System', ''Comparative Economic Studies'', June 2005, Vol.47, Iss. 2, pp. 418\u2013436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Shack from Gulag \u2013 reconstruction in [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]]]]\n\nA distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardised \"nourishment scales\": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered. [[Naftaly Frenkel]] is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfil high production quota.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.\n\nConsidering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:\n\n*\"[[Kulak]]s\", [[osadnik]]s, \"[[ukaznik]]s\" (people sentenced for violation of various [[ukase]]s, such as [[Law of Spikelets]], decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of [[criminal law]]\n*Dedicated criminals: \"[[thieves in law]]\"\n*People sentenced for various [[political prisoner|political]] and religious reasons.\n\n=== Gulag and famine (1932\u20131933) ===\nA severe [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1931\u20131933]] swept across many different regions in the Soviet Union. During this time, it is estimated that around six to seven million people starved to death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=55}}</ref> On 7 August 1932, a new edict drafted by Stalin specified a minimum sentence of ten years or execution for theft from collective farms or of cooperative property. Over the next few months, prosecutions rose fourfold. A large share of cases prosecuted under the law were for the theft of small quantities of grain worth less than fifty rubles. The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/persa/010fulltext.pdf|title=Theft Under Stalin: A Property Rights Analysis|last=Gorlizki|first=Yoram|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.\n\nPrisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in [[Soviet Uzbekistan]] died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around {{convert|300|Cal|kJ}} worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed \"not to spare bullets\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=61}}</ref> The bodies of inmates who tried to escape were commonly displayed in the courtyards of the camps, and the administrators would forcibly escort the inmates around the dead bodies as a message. Until 1934, lack of food and the outbreak of diseases started to destabilise the Gulag system. It wasn't until the famine ended that the system started to stabilize.\n\n=== Social conditions ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labour with one of them being [[logging]] (''lesopoval''). The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.\n\nLocals who captured a [[Fugitive|runaway]] were given rewards.<ref>\"[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ Nikolai Getman: The Gulag Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513172402/http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}\"</ref> It is also said that Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters.

Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]] is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /> The [[colloquial]] name for the islands, \"[[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]\", entered the [[vernacular]] as a [[synonym]] for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for \"re-education of [[class enemy|class enemies]]\" and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian [[intelligentsia]], enjoyed relative freedom (within the natural confinement of the islands). Local newspapers and magazines were published and even some scientific research was carried out (e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely). Eventually Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp; in fact some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929 [[Maxim Gorky]] visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky's trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled \"Po Soiuzu Sovetov,\" Part V, subtitled \"Solovki.\" In the report, Gorky wrote that \"camps such as 'Solovki' were absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Yedlin>{{cite book|last=Yedlin|first=Tova|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96605-8|page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zxt5_vI_ozcC&pg=PA188}}</ref>\n\nWith the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labour, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] or the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]), including facilities in big cities \u2014 parts of the famous [[Moscow Metro]] and the [[Moscow State University]] new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialisation of the 1930s, [[World War II|war-time]] and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry. Gorky organised in 1933 a trip of 120 writers and artists to the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal, 36 of them wrote a propaganda book about the construction published in 1934 and destroyed in 1937.\n\n[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]].

However, camps were generally spread throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], including the European parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Mongolia]], which were under the direct control of the Gulag.\n\nNot all camps were fortified; some in Siberia were marked only by posts. Escape was deterred by the harsh elements, as well as tracking dogs that were assigned to each camp. While during the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often aided escapees, many of the tribes were also [[victimised]] by escaped thieves. Tantalised by large rewards as well, they began aiding authorities in the capture of Gulag inmates. Camp guards were given stern incentive to keep their inmates in line at all costs; if a prisoner escaped under a guard's watch, the guard would often be stripped of his uniform and become a Gulag inmate himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Further, if an escaping prisoner was shot, guards could be fined amounts that were often equivalent to one or two weeks wages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ru200008020027.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of 'Project 503' to build a railroad from [[Salekhard]] to [[Igarka]] near [[Turukhansk]] on the [[Yenisey]]]]\n\nIn some cases, teams of inmates were dropped off in new territory with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die. Sometimes it took several waves of colonists before any one group survived to establish the camp.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe area along the [[Indigirka river]] was known as ''the Gulag inside the Gulag''.

It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.<ref name=\"Ivanova 2000\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince many of these existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was lower. It peaked in the early 1950s, when there were more than 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union.

The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature \u2013 providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favoured by historian Robert Conquest, amongst others). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalised the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society|last=Barnes|first=Stephen A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-15112-0|location=Princeton|pages=7\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] argued that as part of a [[totalitarian]] system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in \"total domination.\" In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 437 \u2013 59</ref>\n\nShe also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all \"forced labour\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 \u2013 45</ref> The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labour camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labour camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organised for labour purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticises other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labour. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labour and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nArendt argues that together with the systematised, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximising cruelty and by organising the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds.

On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (1917\u20131990 \u0433\u0433.).|journal=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f XXI|year=1994|issue=\u2116 1\u20132|pages=107\u2013124|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330205748/http://kob.rv.ua/doki-dai/dotu/other/zemskov/zemskov_politrepressii(1917-1990).pdf |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by [[Viktor Zemskov]].<ref name=\"Rousso, Golsan\">{{cite book|last1=Rousso|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Rousso|last2=Golsan|first2=Richard|title=Stalinism and nazism: history and memory compared|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9000-6|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIt7fMp30sAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars,<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /><ref name=Ellman_SRS />  despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics.<ref name= Vishnevsky /> It is also necessary to note that not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted. Thus, Sergei Maksudov alleged that although literary sources, for example the books of [[Lev Razgon]] or [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], did not envisage the total number of the camps very well and markedly exaggerated their size, on the other hand, Viktor Zemskov, who published many documents by the NKVD and [[KGB]], was far from understanding of the Gulag essence and the nature of socio-political processes in the country. He added that without distinguishing the degree of accuracy and reliability of certain figures, without making a critical analysis of sources, without comparing new data with already known information, Zemskov absolutises the published materials by presenting them as the ultimate truth. As a result, Maksudov charges that Zemskov attempts to make generalized statements with reference to a particular document, as a rule, do not hold water.<ref name=\"\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\">{{cite journal|last=\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432|first=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439|title=\u041e \u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0432 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435 \"\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0441\"|journal=\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|year=1995|issue=\u2116 9|pages=114\u2013118|url=http://scepsis.ru/library/id_956.html|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Frenkel2.jpg|thumb|[[OGPU]] chiefs responsible for construction of the [[White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal]]: right: [[Naftaly Frenkel|Frenkel]]; center: [[Matvei Berman|Berman]]; left: Afanasev (Head of the southern part of BelBaltLag)]]\n\nIn response, Zemskov wrote that the charge that Zemskov allegedly did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers is that they do not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with \"old\" one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatise the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.<ref name=\"\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0443\" />\n\nAccording to French historian [[Nicolas Werth]], the mountains of the materials of the Gulag archives, which are stored in funds of the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] and are being constantly exposed during the last fifteen years, represent only a very small part of bureaucratic prose of immense size left over the decades of \"creativity\" by the \"dull and reptile\" organisation managing the Gulag.

As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labour conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of \"corrective labour colonies\" served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.<ref name=\"GRZ\" /> Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labour colonies amounted to 2,625,000.<ref name=\"Anatoly Vishnevsky\">[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema05.php \"The Total Number of Repressed\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including [[Robert Conquest]]<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the 'high numbers' of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936 is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census,<ref>http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/rosefielde.pdf</ref><ref name= Vishnevsky>Vishnevsky, Alantoly. \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (The Demographic Loss of Repression), Demoscope Weekly, December 31, 2007, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php retrieved] April 13, 2011</ref> it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> Although Conquest cited Beria's report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.<ref>https://www.bu.edu/iscip/pubseries/PubSeries1conquest.pdf</ref>\n\nThese data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928\u201353, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG ''labour camps'' and 4\u20135 million passed through the ''labour colonies''.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps' capacity, not the actual number of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" />\n\n== Influence ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== Culture ===\n<!-- this section is for the general influence on the Soviet culture of **Gulag itself**, not a list of publications about Gulag -->\n\nThe Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.\n\nThe Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern [[Russian folklore]].  Many songs by the authors-performers known as the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|''bards'']], most notably [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]], neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of \"Zeks\". Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe memoirs of [[Alexander Dolgun]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society.  These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.\n\nAnother cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like [[Magadan]], where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to [[Moscow]]'s and [[Eddie Rosner]] played jazz.\n\n==== Literature ====\nMany eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:\n[[File:1929-ShalamovV.jpg|thumb|[[Varlam Shalamov]] after first arrest, 1929]]\n* [[Varlam Shalamov]]'s ''[[The Kolyma Tales|Kolyma Tales]]'' is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.\n* [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] wrote ''[[I Chose Freedom (book)|I Chose Freedom]]'' after defecting to the [[United States]] in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labour camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at [[Kemerovo]] on the [[Tom River]] in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the [[KGB]] for every convict they employed.\n* [[Anatoli Granovsky]] wrote ''I Was an NKVD Agent'' after [[Defection|defecting]] to [[Sweden]] in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky's father was sent to the gulag in 1937.\n* [[Julius Margolin]]'s book ''A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka'' was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.\n* [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]] wrote ''A World Apart'', which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.\n* [[Victor Herman]]'s book ''Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life''. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.\n* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was not the first literary work about labour camps. His previous book on the subject, \"[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]\", about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, ''[[Novy Mir]]'' (''New World''), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. ''[[The First Circle]]'', an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the ''[[Marfino]]'' ''[[sharashka]]'' or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.\n* [[Slavomir Rawicz]]'s book \"[[The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom]]\": In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labour camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday horrors. \n* [[J\u00e1nos R\u00f3zs\u00e1s]], a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich-inscribed-first-edition-alexander-solzhenitsyn-signed/ | title=One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich}}</ref> wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.\n*[[Zoltan Szalkai]], a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.\n* [[Karlo \u0160tajner]], a Croatian communist who was active in the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the manager of the [[Comintern Publishing House]] in Moscow 1932\u201339, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR\u2013[[Yugoslavia]]n political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. He wrote an impressive book titled ''7000 days in Siberia''.\n* ''Dancing Under the Red Star'' by [[Karl Tobien]] ({{ISBN|1-4000-7078-3}}) tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag to tell about it.\n* ''Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag'' ({{ISBN|0-394-49497-0}}), by a member of the US Embassy, and ''I Was a Slave in Russia'' ({{ISBN|0-8159-5800-5}}), an American factory owner's son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946\u201355.\n* [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] wrote two famous books about her remembrances, ''Journey Into the Whirlwind'' and ''Within the Whirlwind''.\n*[[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], a pro-[[Croatia]]n Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in [[Austria]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Markovi\u0107 wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled ''Ten years in Gulag'' (''Deset godina u Gulagu'', Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).\n* [[Ani\u021ba Nandri\u0219-Cudla]]'s book, ''20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani \u00een Siberia]'' is the own life's account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cern\u0103u\u021bi) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system together with her three sons.  Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities.  It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame  [[typhus]], [[scorbutus]], [[malnutrition]], extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with three years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labour camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.\n* [[Frantsishak Alyakhnovich]] \u2013 Solovki prisoner\n* [[Blagoy Popov]], a Bulgarian communist and a defendant in the [[Leipzig trial]], along with [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and [[Vasil Tanev]], was arrested in 1937 during the [[Stalinist purges]] and spent seventeen years in [[Norillag]]. Popov was released in 1954, after the death of Stalin, and returned to [[Bulgaria]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438|last=\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432|first=\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0439|publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\"|year=2012|isbn=978-619-152-025-1|location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f|pages=37, 57}}</ref> He wrote his autobiographical account in the book ''From the Leipzig trial to the Siberia camps'' (''\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438'', \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, 2012 {{ISBN|978-619-152-025-1}}).\n* [[Mkrtich Armen]], an Armenian writer who was imprisoned in 1937 and rehabilitated in 1945, published a collection of his memories under the title \"They Ordered to Give You\" in 1964.\n* [[Gurgen Mahari]], an Armenian writer and poet, who was arrested in 1936, released in 1947, arrested again in 1948 and sent into Siberian exile as an \"unreliable type\" until 1954, wrote \"Barbed Wires in Blossom\", a novella based largely on his personal experiences in a Soviet gulag.\n\n=== Colonisation ===\n[[File:Vorkuta r.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Vorkuta]]]]\nSoviet [[wikisource:\u041e\u0431 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445|state documents]] show that the goals of the gulag included colonisation of sparsely populated remote areas.

In addition, for persons who served full term, but who were denied the free choice of place of residence, it was recommended to assign them for \"free settlement\" and give them land in the general vicinity of the place of confinement.\n\nThe gulag inherited this approach from the [[katorga]] system.\n\nIt is estimated that of the 40,000 people collecting state pensions in [[Vorkuta Gulag|Vorkuta]], 32,000 are trapped former gulag inmates, or their descendants.<ref>Robert Conquest, Paul Hollander: Political violence: belief, behavior, and legitimation p.55, Palgrave Macmillan;(2008) {{ISBN|978-0-230-60646-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Life after term served ===\nPersons who served a term in a camp or in a prison were restricted from taking a wide range of jobs.

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\".

The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken.

Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\".

{"title_page": "Brush (electric)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[Image:Carbon brushes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A pair of carbon brushes]]\n\nA '''brush''' or '''carbon brush''' is an [[electrical contact]] which conducts [[current (electricity)|current]] between stationary [[wire]]s and moving parts, most commonly in a rotating [[Axle|shaft]]. Typical applications include [[electric motor]]s, [[alternator]]s and [[electric generator]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\nFor certain types of electric motors or generators to function, the [[electromagnetic coil|coil]]s of the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] must be connected to complete an electrical circuit. Originally this was accomplished by affixing a [[copper]] or [[brass]] [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] or '[[slip ring]] to the [[Axle|shaft]], with [[spring (device)|spring]]s pressing [[braid]]ed [[copper]] [[wire]] 'brushes' onto the rings which conduct the current. Such brushes provided poor commutation as they moved from one commutator segment to the next. The cure was the introduction of 'high [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] brushes' made from [[graphite]] (sometimes with added copper). Although the resistance was of the order of tens of milliohms, they were high resistance enough to provide a gradual shift of current from one commutator segment to the next. The term ''brush'' remains in use. Since the brushes wear out, they can be replaced in products intended to allow maintenance.\n\nMetal fiber brushes are currently being developed.<ref>http://www.dh-inc.com/metal-fiber-brushes-and-slip-rings</ref> They may have advantages over current brush technology, but have not yet seen wide implementation.\n\n==Manufacturing process==\n===Mixing components===\nExact composition of the brush depends on the application. Graphite/carbon powder is commonly used. Copper is used for better conductance (rare for AC applications). In order to maximize electrical conductivity and [[green strength]], highly dendritic (electrolytic) copper powder is used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zanon|first=Matteo|last2=Rampin|first2=Ilaria|last3=Breda|first3=Alessandro|last4=Bortolotti|first4=Francesco|date=2015-10-05|title=The sintering behaviour of electrolytic and water-atomized copper powders|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305391957_The_sintering_behaviour_of_electrolytic_and_water-atomized_copper_powders}}</ref> [[Binder (material)|Binders]], mostly [[phenol]] or other [[resin]]s or [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], are mixed in so the powder holds its shape when compacted. Other additives include metal powders, and solid lubricants like MoS<sub>2</sub>, WS<sub>2</sub>.

Typical applications include [[electric motor]]s, [[alternator]]s and [[electric generator]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\nFor certain types of electric motors or generators to function, the [[electromagnetic coil|coil]]s of the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] must be connected to complete an electrical circuit. Originally this was accomplished by affixing a [[copper]] or [[brass]] [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] or '[[slip ring]] to the [[Axle|shaft]], with [[spring (device)|spring]]s pressing [[braid]]ed [[copper]] [[wire]] 'brushes' onto the rings which conduct the current. Such brushes provided poor commutation as they moved from one commutator segment to the next. The cure was the introduction of 'high [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] brushes' made from [[graphite]] (sometimes with added copper). Although the resistance was of the order of tens of milliohms, they were high resistance enough to provide a gradual shift of current from one commutator segment to the next. The term ''brush'' remains in use. Since the brushes wear out, they can be replaced in products intended to allow maintenance.\n\nMetal fiber brushes are currently being developed.<ref>http://www.dh-inc.com/metal-fiber-brushes-and-slip-rings</ref> They may have advantages over current brush technology, but have not yet seen wide implementation.\n\n==Manufacturing process==\n===Mixing components===\nExact composition of the brush depends on the application. Graphite/carbon powder is commonly used. Copper is used for better conductance (rare for AC applications). In order to maximize electrical conductivity and [[green strength]], highly dendritic (electrolytic) copper powder is used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zanon|first=Matteo|last2=Rampin|first2=Ilaria|last3=Breda|first3=Alessandro|last4=Bortolotti|first4=Francesco|date=2015-10-05|title=The sintering behaviour of electrolytic and water-atomized copper powders|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305391957_The_sintering_behaviour_of_electrolytic_and_water-atomized_copper_powders}}</ref> [[Binder (material)|Binders]], mostly [[phenol]] or other [[resin]]s or [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], are mixed in so the powder holds its shape when compacted.

{"title_page": "Sheaf (mathematics)", "text_new": "{{about|sheaves on [[topological space]]s|sheaves on a site|Grothendieck topology|and|Topos}}{{Technical|date=September 2019}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''sheaf''' is a tool for systematically tracking locally defined data attached to the [[open set]]s of a [[topological space]]. The data can be restricted to smaller open sets, and the data assigned to an open set is equivalent to all collections of compatible data assigned to collections of smaller open sets covering the original one. For example, such data can consist of the [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] of [[continuous function|continuous]] or [[smooth function|smooth]] [[real numbers|real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on each open set. Sheaves are by design quite general and abstract objects, and their correct definition is rather technical. They are variously defined, for example, as sheaves of [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or sheaves of rings, depending on the type of data assigned to open sets.\n\nThere are also [[map (mathematics)|maps]] (or [[morphism]]s) from one sheaf to another; sheaves (of a specific type, such as sheaves of [[abelian group]]s) with their [[morphism]]s on a fixed topological space form a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. On the other hand, to each [[continuous map]] there is associated both a [[direct image functor]], taking sheaves and their morphisms on the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] to sheaves and morphisms on the [[codomain]], and an [[inverse image functor]] operating in the opposite direction. These [[functor]]s, and certain variants of them, are essential parts of sheaf theory.\n\nDue to their general nature and versatility, sheaves have several applications in topology and especially in [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]] and [[differential geometry]]. First, geometric structures such as that of a [[differentiable manifold]] or a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] can be expressed in terms of a sheaf of rings on the space. In such contexts several geometric constructions such as [[vector bundles]] or [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisors]] are naturally specified in terms of sheaves. Second, sheaves provide the framework for a very general [[sheaf cohomology|cohomology theory]], which encompasses also the \"usual\" topological cohomology theories such as [[singular cohomology]]. Especially in algebraic geometry and the theory of [[complex manifold]]s, sheaf cohomology provides a powerful link between topological and geometric properties of spaces. Sheaves also provide the basis for the theory of [[D-module|''D''-module]]s, which provide applications to the theory of [[differential equation]]s. In addition, generalisations of sheaves to more general settings than topological spaces, such as [[Grothendieck topology]], have provided applications to [[mathematical logic]] and [[number theory]].\n\n== Overview ==\nIn [[topology]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]], several structures defined on a [[topological space]] (e.g., a [[differentiable manifold]]) can be naturally ''localised'' or ''restricted'' to [[open set|open]] [[subset]]s of the space: typical examples include [[continuous function|continuous]] [[real numbers|real]]-valued or [[complex number|complex]]-valued functions, ''n'' times [[differentiable function|differentiable]] (real-valued or complex-valued) functions, [[bounded function|bounded]] real-valued functions, [[vector field]]s, and [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] of any [[vector bundle]] on the space.\n\n''Presheaves'' formalise the situation common to the examples above: a presheaf (of sets) on a topological space is a structure that associates to each open set ''U'' of the space a set ''F''(''U'') of ''sections'' on ''U'', and to each open set ''V'' included in ''U'' a map ''F''(''U'') \u2192 ''F''(''V'') giving ''restrictions'' of sections over ''U'' to ''V''.  Each of the examples above defines a presheaf  by taking the restriction maps to be the usual restriction of functions, vector fields and sections of a vector bundle. Moreover, in each of these examples the sets of sections have additional [[algebraic structure]]: pointwise operations make them [[abelian group]]s, and in the examples of real and complex-valued functions the sets of sections even have a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. In addition, in each example the restriction maps are [[homomorphism]]s of the corresponding algebraic structure. This observation leads to the natural definition of presheaves with additional algebraic structure such as presheaves of groups, of abelian groups, of rings: sets of sections are required to have the specified algebraic structure, and the restrictions are required to be homomorphisms. Thus for example continuous real-valued functions on a topological space form a presheaf of rings on the space.\n\nGiven a presheaf, a natural question to ask is to what extent its sections over an open set ''U'' are specified by their restrictions to smaller open sets ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> of an [[open cover]] of ''U''. A presheaf is ''separated'' if its sections are \"locally determined\": whenever two sections over ''U'' coincide when restricted to each of ''V''<sub>''i''</sub>, the two sections are identical. All examples of presheaves discussed above are separated, since in each case the sections are specified by their values at the points of the underlying space. Finally, a separated presheaf is a ''sheaf'' if ''compatible sections can be glued together'', i.e.,  whenever there is a section of the presheaf over each of the covering sets ''V''<sub>''i''</sub>, chosen so that they match on the overlaps of the covering sets, these sections correspond to a (unique) section on ''U'', of which they are restrictions. It is easy to verify that all examples above except the presheaf of bounded functions are in fact sheaves: in all cases the criterion of being a section of the presheaf is ''local'' in a sense that it is enough to verify it in an arbitrary neighbourhood of each point.\n\nOn the other hand, a function can be bounded on each set of an (infinite) open cover of a space without being bounded on all of the space; thus bounded functions provide an example of a (separated) presheaf that in general fails to be a sheaf. Another example of a  presheaf that fails to be a sheaf is a ''constant presheaf'' that associates the same fixed set (or abelian group, or ring,...)  to each open set: it follows from the gluing property of sheaves that the set of sections on a disjoint union of two open sets is the [[Cartesian product]] of the sets of sections over the two open sets. The correct way to define the [[constant sheaf]] ''F<sub>A</sub>'' (associated to for instance a set ''A'') on a topological space is to require sections on an open set ''U'' to be continuous maps from ''U'' to ''A'' equipped with the [[discrete topology]]; then in particular ''F<sub>A</sub>''(''U'') &cong; ''A'' for [[connected space|connected]] ''U''.\n\nMaps between sheaves or presheaves (called [[morphism]]s), consist of maps between the sets of sections over each open set of the underlying space, compatible with restrictions of sections. If the presheaves or sheaves considered are provided with additional algebraic structure, these maps are assumed to be homomorphisms. Sheaves endowed with nontrivial endomorphisms, such as the action of an [[algebraic torus]] or a [[Galois group]], are of particular interest.\n\nPresheaves and sheaves are typically denoted by capital letters, ''F'' being particularly common, presumably for the [[French language|French]] word for sheaf, ''faisceau''. Use of calligraphic letters such as <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> is also common.\n\n== Formal definitions ==\nThe first step in defining a sheaf is to define a ''presheaf'', which captures the idea of associating data and restriction maps to the open sets of a topological space.  The second step is to require the normalisation and gluing axioms.  A presheaf that satisfies these axioms is a sheaf.\n\n=== Presheaves ===\n{{See also|Presheaf (category theory)}}\n\nLet ''X'' be a topological space, and let '''C''' be a [[category (category theory)|category]].  Usually '''C''' is the [[category of sets]], the [[category of groups]], the [[category of abelian groups]], or the [[category of commutative rings]].  A '''presheaf''' ''F'' on ''X'' is a functor with values in '''C''' given by the following data:\n*For each open set ''U'' of ''X'', there corresponds an object ''F''(''U'') in '''C'''\n*For each inclusion of open sets ''V'' \u2286 ''U'', there corresponds a [[morphism]] <math>\\operatorname{res}_{V, U} \\colon F(U) \\rightarrow F(V)</math> in the category '''C'''.\nThe morphisms res<sub>''V'',''U''</sub> are called '''restriction morphisms'''.  If {{nowrap|''s'' \u2208 ''F''(''U'')}}, then its restriction {{nowrap|res<sub>''V'',''U''</sub>(s)}} is often denoted ''s''|<sub>''V''</sub> by analogy with restriction of functions.  The restriction morphisms are required to satisfy two properties:\n*For every open set ''U'' of ''X'', the restriction morphism res<sub>''U'',''U''</sub> : ''F''(''U'') \u2192 ''F''(''U'') is the identity morphism on ''F''(''U'').\n*If we have three open sets ''W'' \u2286 ''V'' \u2286 ''U'', then the [[function composition|composite]] {{nowrap|1=res<sub>''W'',''V''</sub>&nbsp;<small>o</small>&nbsp;res<sub>''V'',''U''</sub> equals res<sub>''W'',''U''</sub>.}}\nInformally, the second axiom says it doesn't matter whether we restrict to ''W'' in one step or restrict first to ''V'', then to ''W''.\n\nThere is a compact way to express the notion of a presheaf in terms of [[category theory]].  First we define the category of open sets on ''X'' to be the [[posetal category]] ''O''(''X'') whose objects are the open sets of ''X'' and whose morphisms are inclusions.  Then a '''C'''-valued presheaf on ''X'' is the same as a [[contravariant functor]] from ''O''(''X'') to '''C'''.  This definition can be generalized to the case when the source category is not of the form ''O''(''X'') for any ''X''; see [[presheaf (category theory)]].\n\nIf ''F'' is a '''C'''-valued presheaf on ''X'', and ''U'' is an open subset of ''X'', then ''F''(''U'') is called the '''sections of ''F'' over ''U'''''.  If '''C''' is a [[concrete category]], then each element of ''F''(''U'') is called a '''section'''.  A section over ''X'' is called a '''global section'''.\n\nA common notation (used also below) for the restriction res<sub>''V'',''U''</sub>(''s'') of a section is ''s''|<sub>''V''</sub>.  This terminology and notation is by analogy with sections of [[fiber bundle]]s or sections of the \u00e9tal\u00e9 space of a sheaf; see below.  ''F''(''U'') is also often denoted <math>\\Gamma</math>(''U'',&nbsp;''F''), especially in contexts such as [[sheaf cohomology]] where ''U'' tends to be fixed and ''F'' tends to be variable.\n\n=== Sheaves ===\nFor simplicity, consider first the case where the sheaf takes values in the category of sets. In fact, this definition applies more generally to the situation where the category is a [[concrete category]] whose underlying set functor is [[Conservative functor|conservative]], meaning that if the underlying map of sets is a bijection, then the original morphism is an isomorphism.\n\nA ''sheaf'' is a presheaf with values in the category of sets that satisfies the following two axioms:\n# (Locality) If (''U''<sub>''i''</sub>) is an open  [[cover (topology)|covering]] of an open set ''U'', and if ''s'',&nbsp;''t'' \u2208 ''F''(''U'') are such that ''s''|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub></sub> = ''t''|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub></sub> for each set ''U''<sub>''i''</sub> of the covering, then ''s'' = ''t''; and\n# ([[Gluing axiom|Gluing]]) If (''U''<sub>''i''</sub>) is an open covering of an open set ''U'', and if for each ''i'' a section ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2208 ''F''(''U''<sub>''i''</sub>) is given such that for each pair ''U''<sub>''i''</sub>,&nbsp;''U''<sub>''j''</sub> of the covering sets the restrictions of ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''s''<sub>''j''</sub> agree on the overlaps: ''s''<sub>''i''</sub>|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub>\u2229''U''<sub>''j''</sub></sub> =  ''s''<sub>''j''</sub>|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub>\u2229''U''<sub>''j''</sub></sub>, then there is a section ''s'' \u2208 ''F''(''U'') such that ''s''|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub></sub> = ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> for each ''i''.\n\nThe section ''s'' whose existence is guaranteed by axiom 2 is called the '''gluing''', '''concatenation''', or '''collation''' of the sections ''s''<sub>''i''</sub>. By axiom 1 it is unique. Sections ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> satisfying the condition of axiom 2 are often called ''compatible''; thus axioms 1 and 2 together state that ''compatible sections can be uniquely glued together''. A '''separated presheaf''', or '''monopresheaf''', is a presheaf satisfying axiom 1.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Tennison | first1=B. R. | title=Sheaf theory | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | mr=0404390  | year=1975}}</ref>\n\nIf '''C''' (the category in which the sheaf takes values) has [[product (category theory)|products]], the sheaf axioms are equivalent to the requirement that, for any open covering ''U''<sub>''i''</sub>, the first arrow in the following diagram is an [[equalizer (mathematics)|equalizer]]:\n\n:<math>F(U) \\rightarrow \\prod_{i} F(U_i) {{{} \\atop \\longrightarrow}\\atop{\\longrightarrow \\atop {}}} \\prod_{i, j} F(U_i \\cap U_j).</math>\n\nHere the first map is the product of the restriction maps\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{res}_{U_i, U} \\colon F(U) \\rightarrow F(U_i)</math>\n\nand the pair of arrows the products of the two sets of restrictions\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{res}_{U_i \\cap U_j, U_i} \\colon F(U_i) \\rightarrow F(U_i \\cap U_j)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{res}_{U_i \\cap U_j, U_j} \\colon F(U_j) \\rightarrow F(U_i \\cap U_j).</math>\n\nFor a separated presheaf, the first arrow need only be injective.\n\nIn general, for an open set ''U'' and open covering (''U''<sub>''i''</sub>), construct a category ''J'' whose objects are the sets ''U<sub>i</sub>'' and the intersections {{nowrap|''U<sub>i</sub>'' &cap; ''U<sub>j</sub>''}} and whose morphisms are the inclusions of {{nowrap|''U<sub>i</sub>'' &cap; ''U<sub>j</sub>''}} in ''U<sub>i</sub>'' and ''U<sub>j</sub>''. The sheaf axioms for ''U'' and (''U''<sub>''i''</sub>) are that the [[limit (category theory)|limit]] of the functor ''F'' restricted to the category ''J'' must be isomorphic to ''F''(''U'').\n\nNotice that the empty subset of a topological space is covered by the empty family of sets. The product of an empty family or the limit of an empty family is a terminal object, and consequently the value of a sheaf on the empty set must be a terminal object. If sheaf values are in the category of sets, applying the local identity axiom to the empty family shows that over the empty set, there is at most one section, and applying the gluing axiom to the empty family shows that there is at least one section. This property is called the '''normalisation axiom'''.\n\nIt can be shown that to specify a sheaf, it is enough to specify its restriction to the open sets of a [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the topology of the underlying space. Moreover, it can also be shown that it is enough to verify the sheaf axioms above relative to the open sets of a covering. Thus a sheaf can often be defined by giving its values on the open sets of a basis, and verifying the sheaf axioms relative to the basis. (see {{section link|Gluing axiom|Sheaves on a basis of open sets}}.)\n\n=== Morphisms ===\nHeuristically speaking, a morphism of sheaves is analogous to a function between them.  However, because sheaves contain data relative to every open set of a topological space, a morphism of sheaves is defined as a collection of functions, one for each open set, that satisfy a compatibility condition.\n\nLet ''F'' and ''G'' be two sheaves on ''X'' with values in the category '''C'''.  A ''[[morphism]]'' <math>\\varphi:G\\to F</math> consists of a morphism <math>\\varphi_U:G(U)\\to F(U)</math> for each open set {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|X}}, subject to the condition that this morphism is compatible with restrictions.  In other words, for every open subset ''V'' of an open set ''U'', the following diagram is [[commutative diagram|commutative]].\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rcl}\nG(U) & \\xrightarrow{\\quad\\varphi_U\\quad} & F(U)\\\\\nr_{V,U}\\Biggl\\downarrow & & \\Biggl\\downarrow r_{V,U}\\\\\nG(V) & \\xrightarrow[{\\quad\\varphi_V\\quad}]{} & F(V)\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nRecall that we could also express a sheaf as a special kind of functor.  In this language, a morphism of sheaves is a [[natural transformation]] of the corresponding functors.  With this notion of morphism, there is a category of '''C'''-valued sheaves on ''X'' for any '''C'''.  The objects are the '''C'''-valued sheaves on ''X'', and the morphisms are morphisms of sheaves on ''X''.  An ''[[isomorphism]]'' of sheaves is an isomorphism in this category.\n\nIt can be proved that an isomorphism of sheaves is an isomorphism on each open set ''U''.  In other words, <math>\\varphi</math> is an isomorphism if and only if for each ''U'', <math>\\varphi_U</math> is an isomorphism.  It is also true that a morphism of sheaves <math>\\varphi</math> is an isomorphism if and only if there exists an open cover <math>\\{U_\\alpha\\}</math> such that <math>\\varphi|_{U_\\alpha}</math> are isomorphisms of sheaves for all <math>\\alpha</math>. The same facts are true for [[monomorphism]]s.  However, they are false for [[epimorphism]]s, and their failure is measured by [[sheaf cohomology]].\n\nNotice that we used neither the locality nor the gluing axiom in defining a morphism of sheaves.  Consequently, the above definition makes sense for presheaves as well.  The category of '''C'''-valued presheaves on ''X'' is then a [[functor category]], the category of contravariant functors from ''O''(''X'') to '''C'''.\n\n== Examples ==\nBecause sheaves encode exactly the data needed to pass between local and global situations, there are many examples of sheaves occurring throughout mathematics.  Here are some additional examples of sheaves:\n\n* Any continuous map of topological spaces determines a sheaf of sets.  Let ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' be a continuous map.  We define a sheaf \u0393(''Y''/''X'') on ''X'' by setting \u0393(''Y''/''X'')(U) equal to the sections ''U'' \u2192 ''Y'', that is, \u0393(''Y''/''X'')(U) is the set of all continuous functions ''s'' : ''U'' \u2192 ''Y'' such that ''f \u2218 s'' = ''id''<sub>''U''</sub>.  Restriction is given by restriction of functions.  This sheaf is called the '''sheaf of sections''' of ''f'', and it is especially important when ''f'' is the projection of a [[fiber bundle]] onto its base space.  Notice that if the image of ''f'' does not contain ''U'', then \u0393(''Y''/''X'')(''U'') is empty. For a concrete example, take ''X'' = '''C''' \\ {0}, ''Y'' = '''C''', and ''f''(''z'') = exp(''z''). \u0393(''Y''/''X'')(''U'') is the set of branches of the logarithm on ''U''.\n* Fix a point ''x'' in ''X'' and an object ''S'' in a category '''C'''.  The ''skyscraper sheaf over ''x'' with stalk'' ''S'' is the sheaf ''S''<sub>''x''</sub> defined as follows: If ''U'' is an open set containing ''x'', then ''S''<sub>''x''</sub>(''U'') = ''S''.  If ''U'' does not contain ''x'', then ''S''<sub>''x''</sub>(''U'') is the terminal object of '''C'''.  The restriction maps are either the identity on ''S'', if both open sets contain ''x'', or the unique map from ''S'' to the terminal object of '''C'''.\n\n=== Sheaves on manifolds ===\nIn the following examples ''M'' is an ''n''-dimensional ''C''<sup>''k''</sup>-manifold.

Define a presheaf ''F'' as follows: ''F''(\u2205) = {\u2205}, ''F''({''x''}) = '''R''', ''F''({''y''}) = '''R''', ''F''({''x'', ''y''}) = '''R''' \u00d7 '''R''' \u00d7 '''R'''.  The restriction map ''F''({''x'', ''y''}) \u2192 ''F''({''x''}) is the projection of '''R''' &times; '''R''' &times; '''R''' onto its first coordinate, and the restriction map ''F''({''x'', ''y''}) \u2192 ''F''({''y''}) is the projection of '''R''' &times; '''R''' &times; '''R''' onto its second coordinate.  ''F'' is a presheaf that is not separated: A global section is determined by three numbers, but the values of that section over {''x''} and {''y''} determine only two of those numbers.  So while we can glue any two sections over {''x''} and {''y''}, we cannot glue them uniquely.\n* Let ''X'' be the [[real line]], and let ''F''(''U'') be the set of [[bounded function|bounded]] continuous functions on ''U''.  This is not a sheaf because it is not always possible to glue.  For example, let ''U''<sub>''i''</sub> be the set of all ''x'' such that |''x''| < ''i''.  The identity function ''f''(''x'') = ''x'' is bounded on each ''U''<sub>''i''</sub>.  Consequently we get a section ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> on ''U''<sub>''i''</sub>.  However, these sections do not glue, because the function ''f'' is not bounded on the real line.  Consequently ''F'' is a presheaf, but not a sheaf.  In fact, ''F'' is separated because it is a sub-presheaf of the sheaf of continuous functions.\n\n== Turning a presheaf into a sheaf ==\nIt is frequently useful to take the data contained in a presheaf and to express it as a sheaf.  It turns out that there is a best possible way to do this.  It takes a presheaf ''F'' and produces a new sheaf ''aF'' called the '''sheaving''', '''sheafification''' or '''sheaf associated to the presheaf''' ''F''.  The functor ''a'' is called the '''sheaving functor''', '''sheafification functor''', or '''associated sheaf functor'''. There is a natural morphism of presheaves <math>i\\colon F\\to aF</math> that has the universal property that for any sheaf ''G'' and any morphism of presheaves <math>f\\colon F\\to G</math>, there is a unique morphism of sheaves <math>\\tilde f \\colon aF \\rightarrow G</math> such that <math>f = \\tilde f i</math>.  In fact ''a'' is the left [[adjoint functor]] to the inclusion functor (or [[forgetful functor]]) from the category of sheaves to the category of presheaves, and ''i'' is the [[adjoint functor#Unit and co-unit|unit]] of the adjunction. In this way, the category of  sheaves turns into a [[Giraud subcategory]] of presheaves.\n\nOne concrete way of constructing the sheaf ''aF'' is to identify it with the sheaf of sections of an appropriate topological space, called the [[#The \u00e9tal\u00e9 space of a sheaf|\u00e9tal\u00e9 space]] of the presheaf.  Briefly, the underlying set of the topological space is the disjoint union of the [[#Stalks of a sheaf|stalks]] of ''F'', denoted {{nowrap|Sp\u00e9 ''F''}}.  There is a natural map {{nowrap|&phi; : Sp\u00e9 ''F'' &rarr; ''X''}} that sends each germ to the point of ''X'' over which it lies.  For each open set ''U'' and each section ''s'' of ''F'' over ''U'', we define a section <math>\\bar s</math> of &phi; that sends ''x'' to the germ ''s''<sub>''x''</sub>.  Then {{nowrap|Sp\u00e9 ''F''}} is given the finest topology for which all sections <math>\\bar s</math> are continuous, and ''aF'' is the sheaf of continuous sections of &phi; for this topology.\n\nThere are other constructions of the sheaf ''aF''.  In particular, [[Alexander Grothendieck]] and [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] ([[S\u00e9minaire de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique du Bois Marie#SGA 4|SGA 4]] II 3.0.5) define a functor ''L'' from presheaves to presheaves which, when applied to a presheaf, yields a separated presheaf and, when applied to a separated presheaf, yields a sheaf.  Applying the functor ''L'' twice therefore turns a presheaf into a sheaf, and in fact ''LLF'' is the associated sheaf ''aF''.\n\n== Operations ==\nIf ''K'' is a [[Subobject|subsheaf]] of a sheaf ''F'' of abelian groups, then the '''quotient sheaf''' ''Q'' is the sheaf associated to the presheaf <math>U \\mapsto F(U)/K(U)</math>; in other words, the quotient sheaf fits into an exact sequence of sheaves of abelian groups;\n:<math>0 \\to K \\to F \\to Q \\to 0.</math>\n(this is also called a [[sheaf extension]].)\n\nLet ''F'', ''G'' be sheaves of abelian groups. The set <math>U \\mapsto \\operatorname{Hom}(F, G)</math> of morphisms of sheaves from ''F'' to ''G'' forms an abelian group (by the abelian group structure of ''G''). The '''sheaf hom''' of ''F'' and ''G'', denoted by,\n:<math>\\mathcal{Hom}(F, G)</math>\nis the sheaf of abelian groups <math>U \\mapsto \\operatorname{Hom}(F|_U, G|_U)</math> where <math>F|_U</math> is the sheaf on ''U'' given by <math>(F|_U)(V) = F(V)</math> (Note sheafification is not needed here). The direct sum of ''F'' and ''G'' is the sheaf given by <math>U \\mapsto F(U) \\oplus G(U) </math>, and the tensor product of ''F'' and ''G'' is the sheaf associated to the presheaf <math>U \\mapsto F(U) \\otimes G(U)</math>.\n\nAll of these operations extend to [[sheaf of modules|sheaves of modules]] over a [[sheaf of rings]] ''A''; the above is the special case when ''A'' is the [[constant sheaf]] <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{Z}}</math>.\n\n== Images of sheaves ==\n{{Images of sheaves}}\n{{Main|Image functors for sheaves}}\n\nThe definition of a morphism on sheaves makes sense only for sheaves on the same space ''X''.  This is because the data contained in a sheaf is indexed by the open sets of the space.  If we have two sheaves on different spaces, then their data is indexed differently.  There is no way to go directly from one set of data to the other.\n\nHowever, it is possible to move a sheaf from one space to another using a continuous function.  Let ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' be a continuous function from a topological space ''X'' to a topological space ''Y''.  If we have a sheaf on ''X'', we can move it to ''Y'', and vice versa.  There are four ways in which sheaves can be moved.\n* A sheaf <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> on ''X'' can be moved to ''Y'' using the [[direct image functor]] <math>f_*</math> or the [[direct image with proper support functor]] <math>f_!</math>.\n* A sheaf <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> on ''Y'' can be moved to ''X'' using the [[inverse image functor]] <math>f^{-1}</math> or the [[twisted inverse image functor]] <math>f^!</math>.\n\nThe twisted inverse image functor <math>f^!</math> is, in general, only defined as a functor between [[derived category|derived categories]].  These functors come in adjoint pairs: <math>f^{-1}</math> and <math>f_*</math> are left and right adjoints of each other, and <math>Rf_!</math> and <math>f^!</math> are left and right adjoints of each other. (<math>Rf_!</math> is the [[exceptional inverse image functor]].)  The functors are intertwined with each other by [[Coherent duality|Grothendieck duality]] and [[Verdier duality]].\n\nThere is a different inverse image functor for sheaves of modules over sheaves of rings.  This functor is usually denoted <math>f^*</math> and it is distinct from <math>f^{-1}</math>.  See [[inverse image functor]].\n\n== Stalks of a sheaf ==\n{{Main|Stalk (sheaf)}}\n\nThe '''stalk''' <math>\\mathcal{F}_x</math> of a sheaf <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> captures the properties of a sheaf \"around\" a point ''x'' \u2208 ''X,'' generalizing the [[Germ (mathematics)|germs of functions]].\nHere, \"around\" means that, conceptually speaking, one looks at smaller and smaller [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhoods]] of the point. Of course, no single neighborhood will be small enough, so we will have to take a limit of some sort.\n\nThe stalk is defined by\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}_x = \\varinjlim_{U\\ni x} \\mathcal{F}(U),</math>\nthe [[direct limit]] being over all open subsets of ''X'' containing the given point ''x''. In other words, an element of the stalk is given by a section over some open neighborhood of ''x'', and two such sections are considered equivalent if their restrictions agree on a smaller neighborhood.\n\nThe natural morphism ''F''(''U'') \u2192 ''F''<sub>''x''</sub> takes a section ''s'' in ''F''(''U'') to its ''germ'' at x.  This generalises the usual definition of a [[germ (mathematics)|germ]].\n\nA different way of defining the stalk is\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}_x := i^{-1}\\mathcal{F}(\\{x\\}),</math>\nwhere ''i'' is the inclusion of the one-point space {''x''} into ''X''. The equivalence follows from the definition of the [[inverse image functor|inverse image]].\n\nIn many situations, knowing the stalks of a sheaf is enough to control the sheaf itself. For example, whether or not a morphism of sheaves is a monomorphism, epimorphism, or isomorphism can be tested on the stalks.  They also find use in constructions such as [[Godement resolution]]s.\n\n== Ringed spaces and locally ringed spaces ==\n{{Main|Ringed space}}\n\nA pair <math>(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)</math> consisting of a topological space ''X'' and a sheaf of rings on ''X'' is called a '''[[ringed space]]'''. Many types of spaces can be defined as certain types of ringed spaces. The sheaf <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> is called the '''structure sheaf''' of the space. A very common situation is when all the stalks of the structure sheaf are [[local ring]]s, in which case the pair is called a '''locally ringed space'''. Here are examples of definitions made in this way:\n* An ''n''-dimensional ''C''<sup>''k''</sup> manifold ''M'' is a locally ringed space whose structure sheaf is an <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}</math>-algebra and is locally isomorphic to the sheaf of ''C''<sup>''k''</sup> real-valued functions on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n* A [[complex analytic space]] is a locally ringed space whose structure sheaf is a <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{C}}</math>-algebra and is locally isomorphic to the vanishing locus of a finite set of holomorphic functions together with the restriction (to the vanishing locus) of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup> for some ''n''.\n* A [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] is a locally ringed space that is locally isomorphic to the [[spectrum of a ring]].\n* A [[semialgebraic space]] is a locally ringed space that is locally isomorphic to a [[semialgebraic set]] in Euclidean space together with its sheaf of semialgebraic functions.\n\n== Sheaves of modules ==\n{{main|Sheaf of modules}}\nLet <math>(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)</math> be a ringed space. A '''sheaf of modules''' is a sheaf <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> such that on every open set ''U'' of ''X'', <math>\\mathcal{M}(U)</math> is an <math>\\mathcal{O}_X(U)</math>-module and for every inclusion of open sets ''V'' \u2286 ''U'', the restriction map <math>\\mathcal{M}(U) \\to \\mathcal{M}(V)</math> is compatible with the restriction map ''O''(''U'') \u2192 ''O''(''V''): the restriction of ''fs'' is the restriction of ''f'' times that of s for any ''f'' in ''O''(''U'') and ''s'' in ''F''(''U'').\n\nMost important geometric objects are sheaves of modules. For example, there is a one-to-one correspondence between [[vector bundle]]s and [[locally free sheaf|locally free sheaves]] of <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math>-modules. Sheaves of solutions to differential equations are [[D-module|''D''-module]]s, that is, modules over the sheaf of differential operators.\n\nA particularly important case is [[abelian sheaf|abelian sheaves]], which are modules over the constant sheaf <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{Z}}</math>. Every sheaf of modules is an abelian sheaf.\n\n=== Finiteness conditions for sheaves of modules ===\n{{Further|Coherent sheaf}}\nThe condition that a module is finitely generated or finitely presented can also be formulated for a sheaf of modules. <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> is '''finitely generated''' if, for every point ''x'' of ''X'', there exists an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'', a natural number ''n'' (possibly depending on ''U''), and a surjective morphism of sheaves <math>\\mathcal{O}_X^n|_U \\to \\mathcal{M}|_U</math>.  Similarly, <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> is '''finitely presented''' if in addition there exists a natural number ''m'' (again possibly depending on ''U'') and a morphism of sheaves <math>\\mathcal{O}_X^m|_U \\to \\mathcal{O}_X^n|_U</math> such that the sequence of morphisms <math>\\mathcal{O}_X^m|_U \\to \\mathcal{O}_X^n|_U \\to \\mathcal{M}</math> is exact. Equivalently, the kernel of the morphism <math>\\mathcal{O}_X^n|_U \\to \\mathcal{M}</math> is itself a finitely generated sheaf.\n\nThese, however, are not the only possible finiteness conditions on a sheaf. The most important finiteness condition for a sheaf is coherence. <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> is '''coherent''' if it is of finite type and if, for every open set ''U'' and every morphism of sheaves <math>\\phi : \\mathcal{O}_X^n \\to \\mathcal{M}</math> (not necessarily surjective), the kernel of \u03c6 is of finite type. <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> is '''coherent''' if it is coherent as a module over itself.  Note that coherence is a strictly stronger condition than finite presentation: <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> is always finitely presented as a module over itself, but it is not always coherent. For example, let ''X'' be a point, let <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> be the ring {{nowrap begin}}''R'' = '''C'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ...]{{nowrap end}} of complex polynomials in countably many indeterminates.  Choose {{nowrap begin}}''n'' = 1{{nowrap end}}, and for the morphism \u03c6, take the map that sends every variable to zero. The kernel of this map is not finitely generated, so <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> is not coherent.\n\n== The \u00e9tal\u00e9 space of a sheaf ==\n{{anchor|Etale space}}<!--[[\u00c9tal\u00e9 space]] and similar redirect here -->\nIn the examples above it was noted that some sheaves occur naturally as sheaves of sections.  In fact, all sheaves of sets can be represented as sheaves of sections of a topological space called the ''\u00e9tal\u00e9 space'', from the French word \u00e9tal\u00e9 {{IPA-fr|etale|}}, meaning roughly \"spread out\". If ''F'' is a sheaf over ''X'', then the '''\u00e9tal\u00e9 space''' of ''F'' is a topological space ''E'' together with a [[local homeomorphism]] ''\u03c0'' : ''E'' \u2192 ''X'' such that the sheaf of sections of ''\u03c0'' is ''F''.  The space ''E'' is usually very strange, and even if the sheaf ''F'' arises from a natural topological situation, ''E'' may not have any clear topological interpretation.  For example, if ''F'' is the sheaf of sections of a continuous function ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'', then ''E'' = ''Y'' if and only if ''f'' is a [[local homeomorphism]].\n\nThe \u00e9tal\u00e9 space ''E'' is constructed from the stalks of ''F'' over ''X''.  As a set, it is their [[disjoint union]] and ''\u03c0'' is the obvious map that takes the value ''x'' on the stalk of ''F'' over ''x'' \u2208 ''X''.  The topology of ''E'' is defined as follows. For each element ''s'' of ''F''(''U'') and each ''x'' in ''U'', we get a germ of ''s'' at ''x''.  These germs determine points of ''E''.  For any ''U'' and ''s'' \u2208 ''F''(''U''), the union of these points (for all ''x'' \u2208 ''U'') is declared to be open in ''E''.  Notice that each stalk has the [[discrete topology]] as subspace topology.  Two morphisms between sheaves determine a continuous map of the corresponding \u00e9tal\u00e9 spaces that is compatible with the projection maps (in the sense that every germ is mapped to a germ over the same point).  This makes the construction into a functor.\n\nThe construction above determines an [[equivalence of categories]] between the category of sheaves of sets on ''X'' and the category of \u00e9tal\u00e9 spaces over ''X''.  The construction of an \u00e9tal\u00e9 space can also be applied to a presheaf, in which case the sheaf of sections of the \u00e9tal\u00e9 space recovers the sheaf associated to the given presheaf.\n\nThis construction makes all sheaves into [[representable functor]]s on certain categories of topological spaces.  As above, let ''F'' be a sheaf on ''X'', let ''E'' be its \u00e9tal\u00e9 space, and let ''\u03c0'' : ''E'' \u2192 ''X'' be the natural projection.  Consider the category '''Top'''/''X'' of topological spaces over ''X'', that is, the category of topological spaces together with fixed continuous maps to ''X''.  Every object of this category is a continuous map ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'', and a morphism from ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' to ''Z'' \u2192 ''X'' is a continuous map ''Y'' \u2192 ''Z'' that commutes with the two maps to ''X''.  There is a functor \u0393 from '''Top'''/''X'' to the category of sets that takes an object ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' to (''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''F'')(''Y'').  For example, if ''i'' : ''U'' \u2192 ''X'' is the inclusion of an open subset, then \u0393(''i'') = (''i''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''F'')(''U'') agrees with the usual ''F''(''U''), and if ''i'' : {''x''} \u2192 ''X'' is the inclusion of a point, then \u0393({''x''}) = (''i''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''F'')({''x''}) is the stalk of ''F'' at ''x''.  There is a natural isomorphism\n:<math>(f^{-1}F)(Y) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathbf{Top}/X}(f, \\pi)</math>,\nwhich shows that ''\u03c0'' represents the functor \u0393.\n\n''E'' is constructed so that the projection map ''\u03c0'' is a covering map. In algebraic geometry, the natural analog of a covering map is called an [[\u00e9tale morphism]]. Despite its similarity to \"\u00e9tal\u00e9\", the word \u00e9tale {{IPA-fr|etal|}} has a different meaning in French. It is possible to turn ''E'' into a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] and ''\u03c0'' into a morphism of schemes in such a way that ''\u03c0'' retains the same universal property, but ''\u03c0'' is ''not'' in general an \u00e9tale morphism because it is not quasi-finite. It is, however, [[formally \u00e9tale]].\n\nThe definition of sheaves by \u00e9tal\u00e9 spaces is older than the definition given earlier in the article.  It is still common in some areas of mathematics such as [[mathematical analysis]].\n\n== Sheaf cohomology ==\n{{Main|Sheaf cohomology}}\n\nIt was noted above that the functor <math>\\Gamma(U,-)</math> preserves isomorphisms and monomorphisms, but not epimorphisms.  If ''F'' is a sheaf of abelian groups, or more generally a sheaf with values in an [[abelian category]], then <math>\\Gamma(U,-)</math> is actually a [[left exact functor]].  This means that it is possible to construct [[derived functor]]s of <math>\\Gamma(U,-)</math>.  These derived functors are called the ''cohomology groups'' (or ''modules'') of ''F'' and are written <math>H^i(U,-)</math>. Grothendieck proved in his \"[[Tohoku paper]]\" ({{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1957}}) that every category of sheaves of abelian groups contains enough [[injective object]]s, so these derived functors always exist.\n\nHowever, computing sheaf cohomology using injective resolutions is nearly impossible. In practice, it is much more common to find a different and more tractable resolution of ''F''. A general construction is provided by [[Godement resolution]]s, and particular resolutions may be constructed using [[soft sheaf|soft sheaves]], [[fine sheaf|fine sheaves]], and [[flabby sheaf|flabby sheaves]] (also known as ''flasque sheaves'' from the French ''flasque'' meaning flabby). As a consequence, it can become possible to compare sheaf cohomology with other cohomology theories. For example, the [[de Rham complex]] is a resolution of the constant sheaf <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}</math> on any smooth manifold, so the sheaf cohomology of <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}</math> is equal to its [[de Rham cohomology]]. In fact, comparing sheaf cohomology to de&nbsp;Rham cohomology and singular cohomology provides a proof of de&nbsp;Rham's theorem that the two cohomology theories are isomorphic.\n\nA different approach is by [[\u010cech cohomology]].  \u010cech cohomology was the first cohomology theory developed for sheaves and it is well-suited to concrete calculations.  It relates sections on open subsets of the space to cohomology classes on the space.  In most cases, \u010cech cohomology computes the same cohomology groups as the derived functor cohomology.  However, for some pathological spaces, \u010cech cohomology will give the correct <math>H^1</math> but incorrect higher cohomology groups.  To get around this, [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] developed [[hypercover]]ings.  Hypercoverings not only give the correct higher cohomology groups but also allow the open subsets mentioned above to be replaced by certain morphisms from another space.  This flexibility is necessary in some applications, such as the construction of [[Pierre Deligne]]'s [[mixed Hodge structure]]s.\n\nA much cleaner approach to the computation of some cohomology groups is the [[Borel\u2013Bott\u2013Weil theorem]], which identifies the cohomology groups of some [[line bundle]]s on [[flag manifold]]s with [[irreducible representation]]s of [[Lie group]]s.  This theorem can be used, for example, to easily compute the cohomology groups of all line bundles on projective space.\n\nIn many cases there is a duality theory for sheaves that generalizes [[Poincar\u00e9 duality]]. See [[Coherent duality|Grothendieck duality]] and [[Verdier duality]].\n\n== Sites and topoi ==\n{{Main|Grothendieck topology|Topos}}\n\n[[Andr\u00e9 Weil]]'s [[Weil conjectures]] stated that there was a [[Weil cohomology theory|cohomology theory]] for [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s that would give an analogue of the [[Riemann hypothesis]].  The cohomology of a complex manifold can be defined as the sheaf cohomology of the locally constant sheaf <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{C}}</math> in the Euclidean topology, which suggests defining a Weil cohomology theory in positive characteristic as the sheaf cohomology of a constant sheaf.  But the only classical topology on such a variety is the [[Zariski topology]], and the Zariski topology has very few open sets, so few that the cohomology of any Zariski-constant sheaf on an irreducible variety vanishes (except in degree zero).  [[Alexandre Grothendieck]] solved this problem by introducing [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]], which axiomatize the notion of ''covering''.  Grothendieck's insight was that the definition of a sheaf depends only on the open sets of a topological space, not on the individual points.  Once he had axiomatized the notion of covering, open sets could be replaced by other objects.  A presheaf takes each one of these objects to data, just as before, and a sheaf is a presheaf that satisfies the gluing axiom with respect to our new notion of covering.  This allowed Grothendieck to define [[\u00e9tale cohomology]] and [[\u2113-adic cohomology]], which eventually were used to prove the Weil conjectures.\n\nA category with a Grothendieck topology is called a ''site''.  A category of sheaves on a site is called a ''topos'' or a ''Grothendieck topos''.  The notion of a topos was later abstracted by [[William Lawvere]] and Miles Tierney to define an [[elementary topos]], which has connections to [[mathematical logic]].\n\n== History ==\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe first origins of '''sheaf theory''' are hard to pin down \u2013 they may be co-extensive with the idea of [[analytic continuation]]{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}. It took about 15 years for a recognisable, free-standing theory of sheaves to emerge from the foundational work on [[cohomology]].\n* 1936 [[Eduard \u010cech]] introduces the ''[[Nerve of an open covering|nerve]]'' construction, for associating a [[simplicial complex]] to an open covering.\n* 1938 [[Hassler Whitney]] gives a 'modern' definition of cohomology, summarizing the work since [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]] and [[Kolmogorov]] first defined ''[[cochain]]s''.\n* 1943 [[Norman Steenrod]] publishes on homology ''with [[local coefficients]]''.\n* 1945 [[Jean Leray]] publishes work carried out as a [[prisoner of war]], motivated by proving [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]] theorems for application to [[Partial differential equation|PDE]] theory; it is the start of sheaf theory and [[spectral sequence]]s.\n* 1947 [[Henri Cartan]] reproves the [[de Rham theorem]] by sheaf methods, in correspondence with [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] (see [[De Rham\u2013Weil theorem]]). Leray gives a sheaf definition in his courses via closed sets (the later ''carapaces'').\n* 1948 The Cartan seminar writes up sheaf theory for the first time.\n* 1950 The \"second edition\" sheaf theory from the Cartan seminar: the [[sheaf space]] (''espace \u00e9tal\u00e9'') definition is used, with stalkwise structure. [[Support (mathematics)|Supports]] are introduced, and cohomology with supports. Continuous mappings give rise to spectral sequences. At the same time [[Kiyoshi Oka]] introduces an idea (adjacent to that) of a sheaf of ideals, in [[several complex variables]].\n* 1951 The Cartan seminar proves [[theorems A and B]], based on Oka's work.\n* 1953 The finiteness theorem for [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] in the analytic theory is proved by Cartan and [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], as is [[Serre duality]].\n* 1954 Serre's paper ''[[#CITEREFSerre1955|Faisceaux alg\u00e9briques coh\u00e9rents]]'' (published in 1955) introduces sheaves into [[algebraic geometry]]. These ideas are immediately exploited by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]], who writes a major 1956 book on topological methods.\n* 1955 [[Alexander Grothendieck]] in lectures in [[Kansas]] defines [[abelian category]] and ''presheaf'', and by using [[injective resolution]]s allows direct use of sheaf cohomology on all topological spaces, as [[derived functor]]s.\n* 1956 [[Oscar Zariski]]'s report ''[[#CITEREFMartinChernZariski1956|Algebraic sheaf theory]]''\n* 1957 Grothendieck's [[#CITEREFGrothendieck1957|''Tohoku'' paper]] rewrites [[homological algebra]]; he proves [[Coherent duality|Grothendieck duality]] (i.e., Serre duality for possibly [[Mathematical singularity|singular]] algebraic varieties).\n* 1957 onwards: Grothendieck extends sheaf theory in line with the needs of algebraic geometry, introducing: [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] and general sheaves on them, [[local cohomology]], [[derived category|derived categories]] (with Verdier), and [[Grothendieck topologies]]. There emerges also his influential schematic idea of '[[Grothendieck's six operations|six operations]]' in homological algebra.\n* 1958 [[Roger Godement]]'s book on sheaf theory is published. At around this time [[Mikio Sato]] proposes his [[hyperfunction]]s, which will turn out to have sheaf-theoretic nature.\n\nAt this point sheaves had become a mainstream part of mathematics, with use by no means restricted to [[algebraic topology]]. It was later discovered that the logic in categories of sheaves is [[intuitionistic logic]] (this observation is now often referred to as [[Kripke\u2013Joyal semantics]], but probably should be attributed to a number of authors). This shows that some of the facets of sheaf theory can also be traced back as far as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Coherent sheaf]]\n* [[Cosheaf]]\n* [[Gerbe]]\n* [[Stack (mathematics)]]\n* [[Sheaf of spectra]]\n* [[Presheaf of spaces]]\n* [[Base change theorems]]\n* [[Locally constant sheaf]]\n* [[Constructible sheaf]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added under references heading by script-assisted edit-->\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Bredon | first1=Glen E. | author1-link = Glen Bredon | title=Sheaf theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-94905-5 | mr=1481706  | edition=2nd | year=1997 | volume=170}} (oriented towards conventional topological applications)\n* {{Citation | last1=Godement | first1=Roger | author1-link = Roger Godement | title=Topologie alg\u00e9brique et th\u00e9orie des faisceaux | publisher=Hermann | location=Paris | mr=0345092  | year=1973}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Grothendieck | first1=Alexander | author1-link=Alexander Grothendieck | title=Sur quelques points d'alg\u00e8bre homologique | mr=0102537  | year=1957 | journal=The Tohoku Mathematical Journal |series=Second Series | issn=0040-8735 | volume=9 | pages=119\u2013221 | doi=10.2748/tmj/1178244839}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Hirzebruch | first1=Friedrich | author1-link = Friedrich Hirzebruch | title=Topological methods in algebraic geometry | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | series=Classics in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-58663-0 | mr=1335917  | year=1995}} (updated edition of a classic using enough sheaf theory to show its power)\n* {{Citation | last1=Kashiwara | first1=Masaki | author1-link=Masaki Kashiwara | last2=Schapira | first2=Pierre | title=Sheaves on manifolds | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | series=Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences] | isbn=978-3-540-51861-7 | mr=1299726  | year=1994 | volume=292}} (advanced techniques such as the [[derived category]] and [[vanishing cycle]]s on the most reasonable spaces)\n* {{Citation | last1=Mac Lane | first1=Saunders | author1-link = Saunders Mac Lane | last2=Moerdijk | first2=Ieke | author2-link = Ieke Moerdijk | title=Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | series=Universitext | isbn=978-0-387-97710-2 | mr=1300636  | year=1994}} (category theory and toposes emphasised)\n* {{Citation | last1=Martin | first1=William T. | last2=Chern | first2=Shiing-Shen | author2-link=Shiing-Shen Chern | last3=Zariski | first3=Oscar | author3-link=Oscar Zariski | title=Scientific report on the Second Summer Institute, several complex variables | mr=0077995  | year=1956 | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9904 | volume=62 | pages=79\u2013141 | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1956-10013-X | issue=2}}\n* [[J.

The data can be restricted to smaller open sets, and the data assigned to an open set is equivalent to all collections of compatible data assigned to collections of smaller open sets covering the original one. For example, such data can consist of the [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] of [[continuous function|continuous]] or [[smooth function|smooth]] [[real numbers|real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on each open set. Sheaves are by design quite general and abstract objects, and their correct definition is rather technical. They are variously defined, for example, as sheaves of [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or sheaves of rings, depending on the type of data assigned to open sets.\n\nThere are also [[map (mathematics)|maps]] (or [[morphism]]s) from one sheaf to another; sheaves (of a specific type, such as sheaves of [[abelian group]]s) with their [[morphism]]s on a fixed topological space form a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. On the other hand, to each [[continuous map]] there is associated both a [[direct image functor]], taking sheaves and their morphisms on the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] to sheaves and morphisms on the [[codomain]], and an [[inverse image functor]] operating in the opposite direction. These [[functor]]s, and certain variants of them, are essential parts of sheaf theory.\n\nDue to their general nature and versatility, sheaves have several applications in topology and especially in [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]] and [[differential geometry]]. First, geometric structures such as that of a [[differentiable manifold]] or a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] can be expressed in terms of a sheaf of rings on the space. In such contexts several geometric constructions such as [[vector bundles]] or [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisors]] are naturally specified in terms of sheaves. Second, sheaves provide the framework for a very general [[sheaf cohomology|cohomology theory]], which encompasses also the \"usual\" topological cohomology theories such as [[singular cohomology]]. Especially in algebraic geometry and the theory of [[complex manifold]]s, sheaf cohomology provides a powerful link between topological and geometric properties of spaces. Sheaves also provide the basis for the theory of [[D-module|''D''-module]]s, which provide applications to the theory of [[differential equation]]s. In addition, generalisations of sheaves to more general settings than topological spaces, such as [[Grothendieck topology]], have provided applications to [[mathematical logic]] and [[number theory]].\n\n== Overview ==\nIn [[topology]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]], several structures defined on a [[topological space]] (e.g., a [[differentiable manifold]]) can be naturally ''localised'' or ''restricted'' to [[open set|open]] [[subset]]s of the space: typical examples include [[continuous function|continuous]] [[real numbers|real]]-valued or [[complex number|complex]]-valued functions, ''n'' times [[differentiable function|differentiable]] (real-valued or complex-valued) functions, [[bounded function|bounded]] real-valued functions, [[vector field]]s, and [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] of any [[vector bundle]] on the space.\n\n''Presheaves'' formalise the situation common to the examples above: a presheaf (of sets) on a topological space is a structure that associates to each open set ''U'' of the space a set ''F''(''U'') of ''sections'' on ''U'', and to each open set ''V'' included in ''U'' a map ''F''(''U'') \u2192 ''F''(''V'') giving ''restrictions'' of sections over ''U'' to ''V''.  Each of the examples above defines a presheaf  by taking the restriction maps to be the usual restriction of functions, vector fields and sections of a vector bundle. Moreover, in each of these examples the sets of sections have additional [[algebraic structure]]: pointwise operations make them [[abelian group]]s, and in the examples of real and complex-valued functions the sets of sections even have a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. In addition, in each example the restriction maps are [[homomorphism]]s of the corresponding algebraic structure. This observation leads to the natural definition of presheaves with additional algebraic structure such as presheaves of groups, of abelian groups, of rings: sets of sections are required to have the specified algebraic structure, and the restrictions are required to be homomorphisms. Thus for example continuous real-valued functions on a topological space form a presheaf of rings on the space.\n\nGiven a presheaf, a natural question to ask is to what extent its sections over an open set ''U'' are specified by their restrictions to smaller open sets ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> of an [[open cover]] of ''U''. A presheaf is ''separated'' if its sections are \"locally determined\": whenever two sections over ''U'' coincide when restricted to each of ''V''<sub>''i''</sub>, the two sections are identical. All examples of presheaves discussed above are separated, since in each case the sections are specified by their values at the points of the underlying space. Finally, a separated presheaf is a ''sheaf'' if ''compatible sections can be glued together'', i.e.,  whenever there is a section of the presheaf over each of the covering sets ''V''<sub>''i''</sub>, chosen so that they match on the overlaps of the covering sets, these sections correspond to a (unique) section on ''U'', of which they are restrictions. It is easy to verify that all examples above except the presheaf of bounded functions are in fact sheaves: in all cases the criterion of being a section of the presheaf is ''local'' in a sense that it is enough to verify it in an arbitrary neighbourhood of each point.\n\nOn the other hand, a function can be bounded on each set of an (infinite) open cover of a space without being bounded on all of the space; thus bounded functions provide an example of a (separated) presheaf that in general fails to be a sheaf. Another example of a  presheaf that fails to be a sheaf is a ''constant presheaf'' that associates the same fixed set (or abelian group, or ring,...)  to each open set: it follows from the gluing property of sheaves that the set of sections on a disjoint union of two open sets is the [[Cartesian product]] of the sets of sections over the two open sets. The correct way to define the [[constant sheaf]] ''F<sub>A</sub>'' (associated to for instance a set ''A'') on a topological space is to require sections on an open set ''U'' to be continuous maps from ''U'' to ''A'' equipped with the [[discrete topology]]; then in particular ''F<sub>A</sub>''(''U'') &cong; ''A'' for [[connected space|connected]] ''U''.\n\nMaps between sheaves or presheaves (called [[morphism]]s), consist of maps between the sets of sections over each open set of the underlying space, compatible with restrictions of sections. If the presheaves or sheaves considered are provided with additional algebraic structure, these maps are assumed to be homomorphisms. Sheaves endowed with nontrivial endomorphisms, such as the action of an [[algebraic torus]] or a [[Galois group]], are of particular interest.\n\nPresheaves and sheaves are typically denoted by capital letters, ''F'' being particularly common, presumably for the [[French language|French]] word for sheaf, ''faisceau''. Use of calligraphic letters such as <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> is also common.\n\n== Formal definitions ==\nThe first step in defining a sheaf is to define a ''presheaf'', which captures the idea of associating data and restriction maps to the open sets of a topological space.  The second step is to require the normalisation and gluing axioms.  A presheaf that satisfies these axioms is a sheaf.\n\n=== Presheaves ===\n{{See also|Presheaf (category theory)}}\n\nLet ''X'' be a topological space, and let '''C''' be a [[category (category theory)|category]].  Usually '''C''' is the [[category of sets]], the [[category of groups]], the [[category of abelian groups]], or the [[category of commutative rings]].  A '''presheaf''' ''F'' on ''X'' is a functor with values in '''C''' given by the following data:\n*For each open set ''U'' of ''X'', there corresponds an object ''F''(''U'') in '''C'''\n*For each inclusion of open sets ''V'' \u2286 ''U'', there corresponds a [[morphism]] <math>\\operatorname{res}_{V, U} \\colon F(U) \\rightarrow F(V)</math> in the category '''C'''.\nThe morphisms res<sub>''V'',''U''</sub> are called '''restriction morphisms'''.  If {{nowrap|''s'' \u2208 ''F''(''U'')}}, then its restriction {{nowrap|res<sub>''V'',''U''</sub>(s)}} is often denoted ''s''|<sub>''V''</sub> by analogy with restriction of functions.  The restriction morphisms are required to satisfy two properties:\n*For every open set ''U'' of ''X'', the restriction morphism res<sub>''U'',''U''</sub> : ''F''(''U'') \u2192 ''F''(''U'') is the identity morphism on ''F''(''U'').\n*If we have three open sets ''W'' \u2286 ''V'' \u2286 ''U'', then the [[function composition|composite]] {{nowrap|1=res<sub>''W'',''V''</sub>&nbsp;<small>o</small>&nbsp;res<sub>''V'',''U''</sub> equals res<sub>''W'',''U''</sub>.}}\nInformally, the second axiom says it doesn't matter whether we restrict to ''W'' in one step or restrict first to ''V'', then to ''W''.\n\nThere is a compact way to express the notion of a presheaf in terms of [[category theory]].  First we define the category of open sets on ''X'' to be the [[posetal category]] ''O''(''X'') whose objects are the open sets of ''X'' and whose morphisms are inclusions.  Then a '''C'''-valued presheaf on ''X'' is the same as a [[contravariant functor]] from ''O''(''X'') to '''C'''.  This definition can be generalized to the case when the source category is not of the form ''O''(''X'') for any ''X''; see [[presheaf (category theory)]].\n\nIf ''F'' is a '''C'''-valued presheaf on ''X'', and ''U'' is an open subset of ''X'', then ''F''(''U'') is called the '''sections of ''F'' over ''U'''''.  If '''C''' is a [[concrete category]], then each element of ''F''(''U'') is called a '''section'''.  A section over ''X'' is called a '''global section'''. A common notation (used also below) for the restriction res<sub>''V'',''U''</sub>(''s'') of a section is ''s''|<sub>''V''</sub>.  This terminology and notation is by analogy with sections of [[fiber bundle]]s or sections of the \u00e9tal\u00e9 space of a sheaf; see below.  ''F''(''U'') is also often denoted <math>\\Gamma</math>(''U'',&nbsp;''F''), especially in contexts such as [[sheaf cohomology]] where ''U'' tends to be fixed and ''F'' tends to be variable.\n\n=== Sheaves ===\nFor simplicity, consider first the case where the sheaf takes values in the category of sets. In fact, this definition applies more generally to the situation where the category is a [[concrete category]] whose underlying set functor is [[Conservative functor|conservative]], meaning that if the underlying map of sets is a bijection, then the original morphism is an isomorphism.\n\nA ''sheaf'' is a presheaf with values in the category of sets that satisfies the following two axioms:\n# (Locality) If (''U''<sub>''i''</sub>) is an open  [[cover (topology)|covering]] of an open set ''U'', and if ''s'',&nbsp;''t'' \u2208 ''F''(''U'') are such that ''s''|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub></sub> = ''t''|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub></sub> for each set ''U''<sub>''i''</sub> of the covering, then ''s'' = ''t''; and\n# ([[Gluing axiom|Gluing]]) If (''U''<sub>''i''</sub>) is an open covering of an open set ''U'', and if for each ''i'' a section ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2208 ''F''(''U''<sub>''i''</sub>) is given such that for each pair ''U''<sub>''i''</sub>,&nbsp;''U''<sub>''j''</sub> of the covering sets the restrictions of ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''s''<sub>''j''</sub> agree on the overlaps: ''s''<sub>''i''</sub>|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub>\u2229''U''<sub>''j''</sub></sub> =  ''s''<sub>''j''</sub>|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub>\u2229''U''<sub>''j''</sub></sub>, then there is a section ''s'' \u2208 ''F''(''U'') such that ''s''|<sub>''U''<sub>''i''</sub></sub> = ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> for each ''i''.\n\nThe section ''s'' whose existence is guaranteed by axiom 2 is called the '''gluing''', '''concatenation''', or '''collation''' of the sections ''s''<sub>''i''</sub>. By axiom 1 it is unique. Sections ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> satisfying the condition of axiom 2 are often called ''compatible''; thus axioms 1 and 2 together state that ''compatible sections can be uniquely glued together''. A '''separated presheaf''', or '''monopresheaf''', is a presheaf satisfying axiom 1.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Tennison | first1=B. R. | title=Sheaf theory | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | mr=0404390  | year=1975}}</ref>\n\nIf '''C''' (the category in which the sheaf takes values) has [[product (category theory)|products]], the sheaf axioms are equivalent to the requirement that, for any open covering ''U''<sub>''i''</sub>, the first arrow in the following diagram is an [[equalizer (mathematics)|equalizer]]:\n\n:<math>F(U) \\rightarrow \\prod_{i} F(U_i) {{{} \\atop \\longrightarrow}\\atop{\\longrightarrow \\atop {}}} \\prod_{i, j} F(U_i \\cap U_j).</math>\n\nHere the first map is the product of the restriction maps\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{res}_{U_i, U} \\colon F(U) \\rightarrow F(U_i)</math>\n\nand the pair of arrows the products of the two sets of restrictions\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{res}_{U_i \\cap U_j, U_i} \\colon F(U_i) \\rightarrow F(U_i \\cap U_j)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{res}_{U_i \\cap U_j, U_j} \\colon F(U_j) \\rightarrow F(U_i \\cap U_j).</math>\n\nFor a separated presheaf, the first arrow need only be injective.\n\nIn general, for an open set ''U'' and open covering (''U''<sub>''i''</sub>), construct a category ''J'' whose objects are the sets ''U<sub>i</sub>'' and the intersections {{nowrap|''U<sub>i</sub>'' &cap; ''U<sub>j</sub>''}} and whose morphisms are the inclusions of {{nowrap|''U<sub>i</sub>'' &cap; ''U<sub>j</sub>''}} in ''U<sub>i</sub>'' and ''U<sub>j</sub>''. The sheaf axioms for ''U'' and (''U''<sub>''i''</sub>) are that the [[limit (category theory)|limit]] of the functor ''F'' restricted to the category ''J'' must be isomorphic to ''F''(''U'').\n\nNotice that the empty subset of a topological space is covered by the empty family of sets. The product of an empty family or the limit of an empty family is a terminal object, and consequently the value of a sheaf on the empty set must be a terminal object. If sheaf values are in the category of sets, applying the local identity axiom to the empty family shows that over the empty set, there is at most one section, and applying the gluing axiom to the empty family shows that there is at least one section. This property is called the '''normalisation axiom'''.\n\nIt can be shown that to specify a sheaf, it is enough to specify its restriction to the open sets of a [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the topology of the underlying space. Moreover, it can also be shown that it is enough to verify the sheaf axioms above relative to the open sets of a covering. Thus a sheaf can often be defined by giving its values on the open sets of a basis, and verifying the sheaf axioms relative to the basis. (see {{section link|Gluing axiom|Sheaves on a basis of open sets}}.)\n\n=== Morphisms ===\nHeuristically speaking, a morphism of sheaves is analogous to a function between them.  However, because sheaves contain data relative to every open set of a topological space, a morphism of sheaves is defined as a collection of functions, one for each open set, that satisfy a compatibility condition.\n\nLet ''F'' and ''G'' be two sheaves on ''X'' with values in the category '''C'''.  A ''[[morphism]]'' <math>\\varphi:G\\to F</math> consists of a morphism <math>\\varphi_U:G(U)\\to F(U)</math> for each open set {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|X}}, subject to the condition that this morphism is compatible with restrictions.  In other words, for every open subset ''V'' of an open set ''U'', the following diagram is [[commutative diagram|commutative]].\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rcl}\nG(U) & \\xrightarrow{\\quad\\varphi_U\\quad} & F(U)\\\\\nr_{V,U}\\Biggl\\downarrow & & \\Biggl\\downarrow r_{V,U}\\\\\nG(V) & \\xrightarrow[{\\quad\\varphi_V\\quad}]{} & F(V)\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nRecall that we could also express a sheaf as a special kind of functor.  In this language, a morphism of sheaves is a [[natural transformation]] of the corresponding functors.  With this notion of morphism, there is a category of '''C'''-valued sheaves on ''X'' for any '''C'''.  The objects are the '''C'''-valued sheaves on ''X'', and the morphisms are morphisms of sheaves on ''X''.  An ''[[isomorphism]]'' of sheaves is an isomorphism in this category.\n\nIt can be proved that an isomorphism of sheaves is an isomorphism on each open set ''U''.  In other words, <math>\\varphi</math> is an isomorphism if and only if for each ''U'', <math>\\varphi_U</math> is an isomorphism.  It is also true that a morphism of sheaves <math>\\varphi</math> is an isomorphism if and only if there exists an open cover <math>\\{U_\\alpha\\}</math> such that <math>\\varphi|_{U_\\alpha}</math> are isomorphisms of sheaves for all <math>\\alpha</math>. The same facts are true for [[monomorphism]]s.  However, they are false for [[epimorphism]]s, and their failure is measured by [[sheaf cohomology]].\n\nNotice that we used neither the locality nor the gluing axiom in defining a morphism of sheaves.  Consequently, the above definition makes sense for presheaves as well.  The category of '''C'''-valued presheaves on ''X'' is then a [[functor category]], the category of contravariant functors from ''O''(''X'') to '''C'''.\n\n== Examples ==\nBecause sheaves encode exactly the data needed to pass between local and global situations, there are many examples of sheaves occurring throughout mathematics.  Here are some additional examples of sheaves:\n\n* Any continuous map of topological spaces determines a sheaf of sets.  Let ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' be a continuous map.  We define a sheaf \u0393(''Y''/''X'') on ''X'' by setting \u0393(''Y''/''X'')(U) equal to the sections ''U'' \u2192 ''Y'', that is, \u0393(''Y''/''X'')(U) is the set of all continuous functions ''s'' : ''U'' \u2192 ''Y'' such that ''f \u2218 s'' = ''id''<sub>''U''</sub>.  Restriction is given by restriction of functions.  This sheaf is called the '''sheaf of sections''' of ''f'', and it is especially important when ''f'' is the projection of a [[fiber bundle]] onto its base space.  Notice that if the image of ''f'' does not contain ''U'', then \u0393(''Y''/''X'')(''U'') is empty. For a concrete example, take ''X'' = '''C''' \\ {0}, ''Y'' = '''C''', and ''f''(''z'') = exp(''z''). \u0393(''Y''/''X'')(''U'') is the set of branches of the logarithm on ''U''.\n* Fix a point ''x'' in ''X'' and an object ''S'' in a category '''C'''.  The ''skyscraper sheaf over ''x'' with stalk'' ''S'' is the sheaf ''S''<sub>''x''</sub> defined as follows: If ''U'' is an open set containing ''x'', then ''S''<sub>''x''</sub>(''U'') = ''S''.  If ''U'' does not contain ''x'', then ''S''<sub>''x''</sub>(''U'') is the terminal object of '''C'''.  The restriction maps are either the identity on ''S'', if both open sets contain ''x'', or the unique map from ''S'' to the terminal object of '''C'''.\n\n=== Sheaves on manifolds ===\nIn the following examples ''M'' is an ''n''-dimensional ''C''<sup>''k''</sup>-manifold.

Define a presheaf ''F'' as follows: ''F''(\u2205) = {\u2205}, ''F''({''x''}) = '''R''', ''F''({''y''}) = '''R''', ''F''({''x'', ''y''}) = '''R''' \u00d7 '''R''' \u00d7 '''R'''.  The restriction map ''F''({''x'', ''y''}) \u2192 ''F''({''x''}) is the projection of '''R''' &times; '''R''' &times; '''R''' onto its first coordinate, and the restriction map ''F''({''x'', ''y''}) \u2192 ''F''({''y''}) is the projection of '''R''' &times; '''R''' &times; '''R''' onto its second coordinate.  ''F'' is a presheaf that is not separated: A global section is determined by three numbers, but the values of that section over {''x''} and {''y''} determine only two of those numbers.  So while we can glue any two sections over {''x''} and {''y''}, we cannot glue them uniquely.\n* Let ''X'' be the [[real line]], and let ''F''(''U'') be the set of [[bounded function|bounded]] continuous functions on ''U''.  This is not a sheaf because it is not always possible to glue.  For example, let ''U''<sub>''i''</sub> be the set of all ''x'' such that |''x''| < ''i''.  The identity function ''f''(''x'') = ''x'' is bounded on each ''U''<sub>''i''</sub>.  Consequently we get a section ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> on ''U''<sub>''i''</sub>.  However, these sections do not glue, because the function ''f'' is not bounded on the real line.  Consequently ''F'' is a presheaf, but not a sheaf.  In fact, ''F'' is separated because it is a sub-presheaf of the sheaf of continuous functions.\n\n== Turning a presheaf into a sheaf ==\nIt is frequently useful to take the data contained in a presheaf and to express it as a sheaf.  It turns out that there is a best possible way to do this.  It takes a presheaf ''F'' and produces a new sheaf ''aF'' called the '''sheaving''', '''sheafification''' or '''sheaf associated to the presheaf''' ''F''.  The functor ''a'' is called the '''sheaving functor''', '''sheafification functor''', or '''associated sheaf functor'''. There is a natural morphism of presheaves <math>i\\colon F\\to aF</math> that has the universal property that for any sheaf ''G'' and any morphism of presheaves <math>f\\colon F\\to G</math>, there is a unique morphism of sheaves <math>\\tilde f \\colon aF \\rightarrow G</math> such that <math>f = \\tilde f i</math>.  In fact ''a'' is the left [[adjoint functor]] to the inclusion functor (or [[forgetful functor]]) from the category of sheaves to the category of presheaves, and ''i'' is the [[adjoint functor#Unit and co-unit|unit]] of the adjunction. In this way, the category of  sheaves turns into a [[Giraud subcategory]] of presheaves.\n\nOne concrete way of constructing the sheaf ''aF'' is to identify it with the sheaf of sections of an appropriate topological space, called the [[#The \u00e9tal\u00e9 space of a sheaf|\u00e9tal\u00e9 space]] of the presheaf.  Briefly, the underlying set of the topological space is the disjoint union of the [[#Stalks of a sheaf|stalks]] of ''F'', denoted {{nowrap|Sp\u00e9 ''F''}}.  There is a natural map {{nowrap|&phi; : Sp\u00e9 ''F'' &rarr; ''X''}} that sends each germ to the point of ''X'' over which it lies.  For each open set ''U'' and each section ''s'' of ''F'' over ''U'', we define a section <math>\\bar s</math> of &phi; that sends ''x'' to the germ ''s''<sub>''x''</sub>.  Then {{nowrap|Sp\u00e9 ''F''}} is given the finest topology for which all sections <math>\\bar s</math> are continuous, and ''aF'' is the sheaf of continuous sections of &phi; for this topology.\n\nThere are other constructions of the sheaf ''aF''.  In particular, [[Alexander Grothendieck]] and [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] ([[S\u00e9minaire de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique du Bois Marie#SGA 4|SGA 4]] II 3.0.5) define a functor ''L'' from presheaves to presheaves which, when applied to a presheaf, yields a separated presheaf and, when applied to a separated presheaf, yields a sheaf.  Applying the functor ''L'' twice therefore turns a presheaf into a sheaf, and in fact ''LLF'' is the associated sheaf ''aF''.\n\n== Operations ==\nIf ''K'' is a [[Subobject|subsheaf]] of a sheaf ''F'' of abelian groups, then the '''quotient sheaf''' ''Q'' is the sheaf associated to the presheaf <math>U \\mapsto F(U)/K(U)</math>; in other words, the quotient sheaf fits into an exact sequence of sheaves of abelian groups;\n:<math>0 \\to K \\to F \\to Q \\to 0.</math>\n(this is also called a [[sheaf extension]].)\n\nLet ''F'', ''G'' be sheaves of abelian groups. The set <math>U \\mapsto \\operatorname{Hom}(F, G)</math> of morphisms of sheaves from ''F'' to ''G'' forms an abelian group (by the abelian group structure of ''G''). The '''sheaf hom''' of ''F'' and ''G'', denoted by,\n:<math>\\mathcal{Hom}(F, G)</math>\nis the sheaf of abelian groups <math>U \\mapsto \\operatorname{Hom}(F|_U, G|_U)</math> where <math>F|_U</math> is the sheaf on ''U'' given by <math>(F|_U)(V) = F(V)</math> (Note sheafification is not needed here). The direct sum of ''F'' and ''G'' is the sheaf given by <math>U \\mapsto F(U) \\oplus G(U) </math>, and the tensor product of ''F'' and ''G'' is the sheaf associated to the presheaf <math>U \\mapsto F(U) \\otimes G(U)</math>.\n\nAll of these operations extend to [[sheaf of modules|sheaves of modules]] over a [[sheaf of rings]] ''A''; the above is the special case when ''A'' is the [[constant sheaf]] <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{Z}}</math>.\n\n== Images of sheaves ==\n{{Images of sheaves}}\n{{Main|Image functors for sheaves}}\n\nThe definition of a morphism on sheaves makes sense only for sheaves on the same space ''X''.  This is because the data contained in a sheaf is indexed by the open sets of the space.  If we have two sheaves on different spaces, then their data is indexed differently.  There is no way to go directly from one set of data to the other.\n\nHowever, it is possible to move a sheaf from one space to another using a continuous function.  Let ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' be a continuous function from a topological space ''X'' to a topological space ''Y''.  If we have a sheaf on ''X'', we can move it to ''Y'', and vice versa.  There are four ways in which sheaves can be moved.\n* A sheaf <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> on ''X'' can be moved to ''Y'' using the [[direct image functor]] <math>f_*</math> or the [[direct image with proper support functor]] <math>f_!</math>.\n* A sheaf <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> on ''Y'' can be moved to ''X'' using the [[inverse image functor]] <math>f^{-1}</math> or the [[twisted inverse image functor]] <math>f^!</math>.\n\nThe twisted inverse image functor <math>f^!</math> is, in general, only defined as a functor between [[derived category|derived categories]].  These functors come in adjoint pairs: <math>f^{-1}</math> and <math>f_*</math> are left and right adjoints of each other, and <math>Rf_!</math> and <math>f^!</math> are left and right adjoints of each other. (<math>Rf_!</math> is the [[exceptional inverse image functor]].)  The functors are intertwined with each other by [[Coherent duality|Grothendieck duality]] and [[Verdier duality]].\n\nThere is a different inverse image functor for sheaves of modules over sheaves of rings.  This functor is usually denoted <math>f^*</math> and it is distinct from <math>f^{-1}</math>.  See [[inverse image functor]].\n\n== Stalks of a sheaf ==\n{{Main|Stalk (sheaf)}}\n\nThe '''stalk''' <math>\\mathcal{F}_x</math> of a sheaf <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> captures the properties of a sheaf \"around\" a point ''x'' \u2208 ''X,'' generalizing the [[Germ (mathematics)|germs of functions]].\nHere, \"around\" means that, conceptually speaking, one looks at smaller and smaller [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhoods]] of the point. Of course, no single neighborhood will be small enough, so we will have to take a limit of some sort.\n\nThe stalk is defined by\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}_x = \\varinjlim_{U\\ni x} \\mathcal{F}(U),</math>\nthe [[direct limit]] being over all open subsets of ''X'' containing the given point ''x''. In other words, an element of the stalk is given by a section over some open neighborhood of ''x'', and two such sections are considered equivalent if their restrictions agree on a smaller neighborhood.\n\nThe natural morphism ''F''(''U'') \u2192 ''F''<sub>''x''</sub> takes a section ''s'' in ''F''(''U'') to its ''germ'' at x.  This generalises the usual definition of a [[germ (mathematics)|germ]].\n\nA different way of defining the stalk is\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}_x := i^{-1}\\mathcal{F}(\\{x\\}),</math>\nwhere ''i'' is the inclusion of the one-point space {''x''} into ''X''. The equivalence follows from the definition of the [[inverse image functor|inverse image]].\n\nIn many situations, knowing the stalks of a sheaf is enough to control the sheaf itself. For example, whether or not a morphism of sheaves is a monomorphism, epimorphism, or isomorphism can be tested on the stalks.  They also find use in constructions such as [[Godement resolution]]s.\n\n== Ringed spaces and locally ringed spaces ==\n{{Main|Ringed space}}\n\nA pair <math>(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)</math> consisting of a topological space ''X'' and a sheaf of rings on ''X'' is called a '''[[ringed space]]'''. Many types of spaces can be defined as certain types of ringed spaces. The sheaf <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> is called the '''structure sheaf''' of the space. A very common situation is when all the stalks of the structure sheaf are [[local ring]]s, in which case the pair is called a '''locally ringed space'''. Here are examples of definitions made in this way:\n* An ''n''-dimensional ''C''<sup>''k''</sup> manifold ''M'' is a locally ringed space whose structure sheaf is an <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}</math>-algebra and is locally isomorphic to the sheaf of ''C''<sup>''k''</sup> real-valued functions on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n* A [[complex analytic space]] is a locally ringed space whose structure sheaf is a <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{C}}</math>-algebra and is locally isomorphic to the vanishing locus of a finite set of holomorphic functions together with the restriction (to the vanishing locus) of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup> for some ''n''.\n* A [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] is a locally ringed space that is locally isomorphic to the [[spectrum of a ring]].\n* A [[semialgebraic space]] is a locally ringed space that is locally isomorphic to a [[semialgebraic set]] in Euclidean space together with its sheaf of semialgebraic functions.\n\n== Sheaves of modules ==\n{{main|Sheaf of modules}}\nLet <math>(X, \\mathcal{O}_X)</math> be a ringed space. A '''sheaf of modules''' is a sheaf <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> such that on every open set ''U'' of ''X'', <math>\\mathcal{M}(U)</math> is an <math>\\mathcal{O}_X(U)</math>-module and for every inclusion of open sets ''V'' \u2286 ''U'', the restriction map <math>\\mathcal{M}(U) \\to \\mathcal{M}(V)</math> is compatible with the restriction map ''O''(''U'') \u2192 ''O''(''V''): the restriction of ''fs'' is the restriction of ''f'' times that of s for any ''f'' in ''O''(''U'') and ''s'' in ''F''(''U'').\n\nMost important geometric objects are sheaves of modules. For example, there is a one-to-one correspondence between [[vector bundle]]s and [[locally free sheaf|locally free sheaves]] of <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math>-modules. Sheaves of solutions to differential equations are [[D-module|''D''-module]]s, that is, modules over the sheaf of differential operators.\n\nA particularly important case is [[abelian sheaf|abelian sheaves]], which are modules over the constant sheaf <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{Z}}</math>. Every sheaf of modules is an abelian sheaf.\n\n=== Finiteness conditions for sheaves of modules ===\n{{Further|Coherent sheaf}}\nThe condition that a module is finitely generated or finitely presented can also be formulated for a sheaf of modules. <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> is '''finitely generated''' if, for every point ''x'' of ''X'', there exists an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'', a natural number ''n'' (possibly depending on ''U''), and a surjective morphism of sheaves <math>\\mathcal{O}_X^n|_U \\to \\mathcal{M}|_U</math>.  Similarly, <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> is '''finitely presented''' if in addition there exists a natural number ''m'' (again possibly depending on ''U'') and a morphism of sheaves <math>\\mathcal{O}_X^m|_U \\to \\mathcal{O}_X^n|_U</math> such that the sequence of morphisms <math>\\mathcal{O}_X^m|_U \\to \\mathcal{O}_X^n|_U \\to \\mathcal{M}</math> is exact. Equivalently, the kernel of the morphism <math>\\mathcal{O}_X^n|_U \\to \\mathcal{M}</math> is itself a finitely generated sheaf.\n\nThese, however, are not the only possible finiteness conditions on a sheaf. The most important finiteness condition for a sheaf is coherence. <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> is '''coherent''' if it is of finite type and if, for every open set ''U'' and every morphism of sheaves <math>\\phi : \\mathcal{O}_X^n \\to \\mathcal{M}</math> (not necessarily surjective), the kernel of \u03c6 is of finite type. <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> is '''coherent''' if it is coherent as a module over itself.  Note that coherence is a strictly stronger condition than finite presentation: <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> is always finitely presented as a module over itself, but it is not always coherent. For example, let ''X'' be a point, let <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> be the ring {{nowrap begin}}''R'' = '''C'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ...]{{nowrap end}} of complex polynomials in countably many indeterminates.  Choose {{nowrap begin}}''n'' = 1{{nowrap end}}, and for the morphism \u03c6, take the map that sends every variable to zero. The kernel of this map is not finitely generated, so <math>\\mathcal{O}_X</math> is not coherent.\n\n== The \u00e9tal\u00e9 space of a sheaf ==\n{{anchor|Etale space}}<!--[[\u00c9tal\u00e9 space]] and similar redirect here -->\nIn the examples above it was noted that some sheaves occur naturally as sheaves of sections.  In fact, all sheaves of sets can be represented as sheaves of sections of a topological space called the ''\u00e9tal\u00e9 space'', from the French word \u00e9tal\u00e9 {{IPA-fr|etale|}}, meaning roughly \"spread out\". If ''F'' is a sheaf over ''X'', then the '''\u00e9tal\u00e9 space''' of ''F'' is a topological space ''E'' together with a [[local homeomorphism]] ''\u03c0'' : ''E'' \u2192 ''X'' such that the sheaf of sections of ''\u03c0'' is ''F''.  The space ''E'' is usually very strange, and even if the sheaf ''F'' arises from a natural topological situation, ''E'' may not have any clear topological interpretation.  For example, if ''F'' is the sheaf of sections of a continuous function ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'', then ''E'' = ''Y'' if and only if ''f'' is a [[local homeomorphism]].\n\nThe \u00e9tal\u00e9 space ''E'' is constructed from the stalks of ''F'' over ''X''.  As a set, it is their [[disjoint union]] and ''\u03c0'' is the obvious map that takes the value ''x'' on the stalk of ''F'' over ''x'' \u2208 ''X''.  The topology of ''E'' is defined as follows. For each element ''s'' of ''F''(''U'') and each ''x'' in ''U'', we get a germ of ''s'' at ''x''.  These germs determine points of ''E''.  For any ''U'' and ''s'' \u2208 ''F''(''U''), the union of these points (for all ''x'' \u2208 ''U'') is declared to be open in ''E''.  Notice that each stalk has the [[discrete topology]] as subspace topology.  Two morphisms between sheaves determine a continuous map of the corresponding \u00e9tal\u00e9 spaces that is compatible with the projection maps (in the sense that every germ is mapped to a germ over the same point).  This makes the construction into a functor.\n\nThe construction above determines an [[equivalence of categories]] between the category of sheaves of sets on ''X'' and the category of \u00e9tal\u00e9 spaces over ''X''.  The construction of an \u00e9tal\u00e9 space can also be applied to a presheaf, in which case the sheaf of sections of the \u00e9tal\u00e9 space recovers the sheaf associated to the given presheaf.\n\nThis construction makes all sheaves into [[representable functor]]s on certain categories of topological spaces.  As above, let ''F'' be a sheaf on ''X'', let ''E'' be its \u00e9tal\u00e9 space, and let ''\u03c0'' : ''E'' \u2192 ''X'' be the natural projection.  Consider the category '''Top'''/''X'' of topological spaces over ''X'', that is, the category of topological spaces together with fixed continuous maps to ''X''.  Every object of this category is a continuous map ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'', and a morphism from ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' to ''Z'' \u2192 ''X'' is a continuous map ''Y'' \u2192 ''Z'' that commutes with the two maps to ''X''.  There is a functor \u0393 from '''Top'''/''X'' to the category of sets that takes an object ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' to (''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''F'')(''Y'').  For example, if ''i'' : ''U'' \u2192 ''X'' is the inclusion of an open subset, then \u0393(''i'') = (''i''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''F'')(''U'') agrees with the usual ''F''(''U''), and if ''i'' : {''x''} \u2192 ''X'' is the inclusion of a point, then \u0393({''x''}) = (''i''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''F'')({''x''}) is the stalk of ''F'' at ''x''.  There is a natural isomorphism\n:<math>(f^{-1}F)(Y) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathbf{Top}/X}(f, \\pi)</math>,\nwhich shows that ''\u03c0'' represents the functor \u0393.\n\n''E'' is constructed so that the projection map ''\u03c0'' is a covering map. In algebraic geometry, the natural analog of a covering map is called an [[\u00e9tale morphism]]. Despite its similarity to \"\u00e9tal\u00e9\", the word \u00e9tale {{IPA-fr|etal|}} has a different meaning in French. It is possible to turn ''E'' into a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] and ''\u03c0'' into a morphism of schemes in such a way that ''\u03c0'' retains the same universal property, but ''\u03c0'' is ''not'' in general an \u00e9tale morphism because it is not quasi-finite. It is, however, [[formally \u00e9tale]].\n\nThe definition of sheaves by \u00e9tal\u00e9 spaces is older than the definition given earlier in the article.  It is still common in some areas of mathematics such as [[mathematical analysis]].\n\n== Sheaf cohomology ==\n{{Main|Sheaf cohomology}}\n\nIt was noted above that the functor <math>\\Gamma(U,-)</math> preserves isomorphisms and monomorphisms, but not epimorphisms.  If ''F'' is a sheaf of abelian groups, or more generally a sheaf with values in an [[abelian category]], then <math>\\Gamma(U,-)</math> is actually a [[left exact functor]].  This means that it is possible to construct [[derived functor]]s of <math>\\Gamma(U,-)</math>.  These derived functors are called the ''cohomology groups'' (or ''modules'') of ''F'' and are written <math>H^i(U,-)</math>. Grothendieck proved in his \"[[Tohoku paper]]\" ({{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1957}}) that every category of sheaves of abelian groups contains enough [[injective object]]s, so these derived functors always exist.\n\nHowever, computing sheaf cohomology using injective resolutions is nearly impossible. In practice, it is much more common to find a different and more tractable resolution of ''F''. A general construction is provided by [[Godement resolution]]s, and particular resolutions may be constructed using [[soft sheaf|soft sheaves]], [[fine sheaf|fine sheaves]], and [[flabby sheaf|flabby sheaves]] (also known as ''flasque sheaves'' from the French ''flasque'' meaning flabby). As a consequence, it can become possible to compare sheaf cohomology with other cohomology theories. For example, the [[de Rham complex]] is a resolution of the constant sheaf <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}</math> on any smooth manifold, so the sheaf cohomology of <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{R}}</math> is equal to its [[de Rham cohomology]]. In fact, comparing sheaf cohomology to de&nbsp;Rham cohomology and singular cohomology provides a proof of de&nbsp;Rham's theorem that the two cohomology theories are isomorphic.\n\nA different approach is by [[\u010cech cohomology]].  \u010cech cohomology was the first cohomology theory developed for sheaves and it is well-suited to concrete calculations.  It relates sections on open subsets of the space to cohomology classes on the space.  In most cases, \u010cech cohomology computes the same cohomology groups as the derived functor cohomology.  However, for some pathological spaces, \u010cech cohomology will give the correct <math>H^1</math> but incorrect higher cohomology groups.  To get around this, [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] developed [[hypercover]]ings.  Hypercoverings not only give the correct higher cohomology groups but also allow the open subsets mentioned above to be replaced by certain morphisms from another space.  This flexibility is necessary in some applications, such as the construction of [[Pierre Deligne]]'s [[mixed Hodge structure]]s.\n\nA much cleaner approach to the computation of some cohomology groups is the [[Borel\u2013Bott\u2013Weil theorem]], which identifies the cohomology groups of some [[line bundle]]s on [[flag manifold]]s with [[irreducible representation]]s of [[Lie group]]s.  This theorem can be used, for example, to easily compute the cohomology groups of all line bundles on projective space.\n\nIn many cases there is a duality theory for sheaves that generalizes [[Poincar\u00e9 duality]]. See [[Coherent duality|Grothendieck duality]] and [[Verdier duality]].\n\n== Sites and topoi ==\n{{Main|Grothendieck topology|Topos}}\n\n[[Andr\u00e9 Weil]]'s [[Weil conjectures]] stated that there was a [[Weil cohomology theory|cohomology theory]] for [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s that would give an analogue of the [[Riemann hypothesis]].  The cohomology of a complex manifold can be defined as the sheaf cohomology of the locally constant sheaf <math>\\underline{\\mathbf{C}}</math> in the Euclidean topology, which suggests defining a Weil cohomology theory in positive characteristic as the sheaf cohomology of a constant sheaf.  But the only classical topology on such a variety is the [[Zariski topology]], and the Zariski topology has very few open sets, so few that the cohomology of any Zariski-constant sheaf on an irreducible variety vanishes (except in degree zero).  [[Alexandre Grothendieck]] solved this problem by introducing [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]], which axiomatize the notion of ''covering''.  Grothendieck's insight was that the definition of a sheaf depends only on the open sets of a topological space, not on the individual points.  Once he had axiomatized the notion of covering, open sets could be replaced by other objects.  A presheaf takes each one of these objects to data, just as before, and a sheaf is a presheaf that satisfies the gluing axiom with respect to our new notion of covering.  This allowed Grothendieck to define [[\u00e9tale cohomology]] and [[\u2113-adic cohomology]], which eventually were used to prove the Weil conjectures.\n\nA category with a Grothendieck topology is called a ''site''.  A category of sheaves on a site is called a ''topos'' or a ''Grothendieck topos''.  The notion of a topos was later abstracted by [[William Lawvere]] and Miles Tierney to define an [[elementary topos]], which has connections to [[mathematical logic]].\n\n== History ==\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe first origins of '''sheaf theory''' are hard to pin down \u2013 they may be co-extensive with the idea of [[analytic continuation]]{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}. It took about 15 years for a recognisable, free-standing theory of sheaves to emerge from the foundational work on [[cohomology]].\n* 1936 [[Eduard \u010cech]] introduces the ''[[Nerve of an open covering|nerve]]'' construction, for associating a [[simplicial complex]] to an open covering.\n* 1938 [[Hassler Whitney]] gives a 'modern' definition of cohomology, summarizing the work since [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]] and [[Kolmogorov]] first defined ''[[cochain]]s''.\n* 1943 [[Norman Steenrod]] publishes on homology ''with [[local coefficients]]''.\n* 1945 [[Jean Leray]] publishes work carried out as a [[prisoner of war]], motivated by proving [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]] theorems for application to [[Partial differential equation|PDE]] theory; it is the start of sheaf theory and [[spectral sequence]]s.\n* 1947 [[Henri Cartan]] reproves the [[de Rham theorem]] by sheaf methods, in correspondence with [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] (see [[De Rham\u2013Weil theorem]]). Leray gives a sheaf definition in his courses via closed sets (the later ''carapaces'').\n* 1948 The Cartan seminar writes up sheaf theory for the first time.\n* 1950 The \"second edition\" sheaf theory from the Cartan seminar: the [[sheaf space]] (''espace \u00e9tal\u00e9'') definition is used, with stalkwise structure. [[Support (mathematics)|Supports]] are introduced, and cohomology with supports. Continuous mappings give rise to spectral sequences. At the same time [[Kiyoshi Oka]] introduces an idea (adjacent to that) of a sheaf of ideals, in [[several complex variables]].\n* 1951 The Cartan seminar proves [[theorems A and B]], based on Oka's work.\n* 1953 The finiteness theorem for [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] in the analytic theory is proved by Cartan and [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], as is [[Serre duality]].\n* 1954 Serre's paper ''[[#CITEREFSerre1955|Faisceaux alg\u00e9briques coh\u00e9rents]]'' (published in 1955) introduces sheaves into [[algebraic geometry]]. These ideas are immediately exploited by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]], who writes a major 1956 book on topological methods.\n* 1955 [[Alexander Grothendieck]] in lectures in [[Kansas]] defines [[abelian category]] and ''presheaf'', and by using [[injective resolution]]s allows direct use of sheaf cohomology on all topological spaces, as [[derived functor]]s.\n* 1956 [[Oscar Zariski]]'s report ''[[#CITEREFMartinChernZariski1956|Algebraic sheaf theory]]''\n* 1957 Grothendieck's [[#CITEREFGrothendieck1957|''Tohoku'' paper]] rewrites [[homological algebra]]; he proves [[Coherent duality|Grothendieck duality]] (i.e., Serre duality for possibly [[Mathematical singularity|singular]] algebraic varieties).\n* 1957 onwards: Grothendieck extends sheaf theory in line with the needs of algebraic geometry, introducing: [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] and general sheaves on them, [[local cohomology]], [[derived category|derived categories]] (with Verdier), and [[Grothendieck topologies]]. There emerges also his influential schematic idea of '[[Grothendieck's six operations|six operations]]' in homological algebra.\n* 1958 [[Roger Godement]]'s book on sheaf theory is published. At around this time [[Mikio Sato]] proposes his [[hyperfunction]]s, which will turn out to have sheaf-theoretic nature.\n\nAt this point sheaves had become a mainstream part of mathematics, with use by no means restricted to [[algebraic topology]]. It was later discovered that the logic in categories of sheaves is [[intuitionistic logic]] (this observation is now often referred to as [[Kripke\u2013Joyal semantics]], but probably should be attributed to a number of authors). This shows that some of the facets of sheaf theory can also be traced back as far as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Coherent sheaf]]\n* [[Cosheaf]]\n* [[Gerbe]]\n* [[Stack (mathematics)]]\n* [[Sheaf of spectra]]\n* [[Presheaf of spaces]]\n* [[Base change theorems]]\n* [[Locally constant sheaf]]\n* [[Constructible sheaf]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added under references heading by script-assisted edit-->\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Bredon | first1=Glen E. | author1-link = Glen Bredon | title=Sheaf theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-94905-5 | mr=1481706  | edition=2nd | year=1997 | volume=170}} (oriented towards conventional topological applications)\n* {{Citation | last1=Godement | first1=Roger | author1-link = Roger Godement | title=Topologie alg\u00e9brique et th\u00e9orie des faisceaux | publisher=Hermann | location=Paris | mr=0345092  | year=1973}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Grothendieck | first1=Alexander | author1-link=Alexander Grothendieck | title=Sur quelques points d'alg\u00e8bre homologique | mr=0102537  | year=1957 | journal=The Tohoku Mathematical Journal |series=Second Series | issn=0040-8735 | volume=9 | pages=119\u2013221 | doi=10.2748/tmj/1178244839}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Hirzebruch | first1=Friedrich | author1-link = Friedrich Hirzebruch | title=Topological methods in algebraic geometry | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | series=Classics in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-58663-0 | mr=1335917  | year=1995}} (updated edition of a classic using enough sheaf theory to show its power)\n* {{Citation | last1=Kashiwara | first1=Masaki | author1-link=Masaki Kashiwara | last2=Schapira | first2=Pierre | title=Sheaves on manifolds | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | series=Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences] | isbn=978-3-540-51861-7 | mr=1299726  | year=1994 | volume=292}} (advanced techniques such as the [[derived category]] and [[vanishing cycle]]s on the most reasonable spaces)\n* {{Citation | last1=Mac Lane | first1=Saunders | author1-link = Saunders Mac Lane | last2=Moerdijk | first2=Ieke | author2-link = Ieke Moerdijk | title=Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | series=Universitext | isbn=978-0-387-97710-2 | mr=1300636  | year=1994}} (category theory and toposes emphasised)\n* {{Citation | last1=Martin | first1=William T. | last2=Chern | first2=Shiing-Shen | author2-link=Shiing-Shen Chern | last3=Zariski | first3=Oscar | author3-link=Oscar Zariski | title=Scientific report on the Second Summer Institute, several complex variables | mr=0077995  | year=1956 | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9904 | volume=62 | pages=79\u2013141 | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1956-10013-X | issue=2}}\n* [[J.
