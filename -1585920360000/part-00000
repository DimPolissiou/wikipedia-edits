In 1538, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the shrine was plundered and destroyed by order of [[Thomas Cromwell]]. Richard of Chichester is the patron saint of [[Sussex]] in southern England; since 2007, his translated saint's day of 16 June has been celebrated as [[Sussex Day]].\n\n==Life==\nRichard was born in Burford, near the town of Wyche (modern [[Droitwich]], [[Worcestershire]]) and was an orphan member of a gentry family.<ref name=BHO>Greenway.

On coming of age his brother took possession of his lands, but was required to pay a [[Feudal relief|medieval form of death duty]] that left the family so impoverished, that Richard had to work for him on the farm.<ref name=\"lower242\">Lower. The Worthies of Sussex. p. 242</ref> His brother also made Richard heir to the estate.<ref name=\"lower242\"/> According to Richard's biographers, friends tried to arrange a match with a ''certain noble lady''.<ref name=\"lower242\"/> However Richard rejected the proposed match, suggesting that his brother might marry her instead; he also reconveyed the estates back to his brother, preferring a life of study and the church.<ref name=\"lower243\">Lower. The Worthies of Sussex. pp. 242-243</ref>\n\nEducated at the [[University of Oxford]], Richard soon began to teach in the university.<ref name=\"stephens84\">Stephens.

He was also a stickler for clerical privilege.<ref name=\"Seward\"/>\n\nRichard's [[episcopate]] was marked by the favour which he showed to the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], a house of this order at Orl\u00e9ans having sheltered him during his stay in France, and by his earnestness in preaching a [[crusade]]. After dedicating [[St Edmund's Chapel]] at [[Dover]], he died aged 56 at the [[Maison Dieu, Dover]] at midnight on 3 April 1253, where the Pope had ordered him to preach a crusade.<ref name=Handbook239/> His internal organs were removed and placed in that chapel's altar. Richard's body was then carried to Chichester and buried, according to his wishes, in the chapel on the north side of the nave, dedicated to his patron St. Edmund.<ref name=\"atkinson18\">Atkinson.

Memorials of The See at Chichester pp.87-93</ref>\nRichard overruled Henry on several occasions.  Richard defrocked a priest who had seduced a nun out of her convent, turning aside a petition from the king in the priest's favour.<ref name=\"lower244\">Lower. The Worthies of Sussex. p. 244</ref>\n\nRichard was militant in protecting the clergy from abuse. The townsmen of [[Lewes]] violated the right of [[sanctuary]] by seizing a criminal in church and [[lynching]] him, and Richard made them exhume the body and give it a proper burial in consecrated ground.<ref name=\"stephens88\"/> He also imposed severe penance on [[knight]]s who attacked priests.<ref name=\"lower244\"/>\n\nRichard produced a body of statutes with the aid of his chapter, for the organisation of the church in his diocese and the expected conduct of its clergy. It seems that many of the clergy still secretly married, though such alliances were not recognised by canon law, and as such their women's status was that of a mistress or concubine. The Bishop endeavoured to suppress the practice in his diocese with relentless austerity.\n\nBy Richard's statutes:<ref name=\"stephens88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>It was decreed that married clergy should be deprived of their [[benefice]]s; their [[Concubinage|concubines]] were to be denied the privileges of the church during their lives and also after death; they were pronounced incapable of inheriting any property from their husbands, and any such bequests would be donated for the upkeep of the cathedral. A vow of chastity was to be required of candidates for ordination. Rectors were expected to reside in their parishes, to be hospitable and charitable and tithes were to be paid on all annual crops. Anyone who did not pay their tithe would not be granted penance until they did.<br/>\n[[Vicars]] were to be priests and have only one freehold to live on, they were not allowed to have another parish held under an assumed name.<br/>\n[[Deacons]] were not to be allowed to receive confessions or to provide penances, or to baptise except in the absence of a priest. Children had to be confirmed within a year of baptism. The [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Lord's Prayer]] were to be learned in the mother tongue; priests were to celebrate mass in clean robes, to use a silver or golden [[chalice]]; thoroughly clean [[Altar cloth|corporals]] and at least two consecrated [[Altar cloth|palls]] were to be placed on the altar; the cross was to be planted in front of the [[Officiant|celebrant]]; the bread was to be of the purest wheaten flour, the wine mixed with water. The elements were not to be kept more than seven days; when carried to a sick person to be enclosed in a [[pyx]], and the priest to be preceded by a cross; a candle, holy water and bell.<br/>\nPractices such as gambling at baptisms and marriages is strictly forbidden.<br/>\n[[Archdeacon]]s were to administer justice for their proper fees, not demanding more either for rushing or delaying the business. They were to visit the churches regularly, to see that the services were duly ministered, the vessels and vestments are in proper order, the canon of the mass correctly observed and distinctly read, as also the \u2018'hours\u2019\u2019. Priests who clipped or slurred the words by rushing were to be suspended.<br/>\nThe clergy should wear their proper dress and not imitate what the lay people wore. They were not allowed to wear their hair long or have romantic entanglements. The names of excommunicated persons to be read out four times a year in the parish churches.<br/>\nA copy of these statutes was to be kept by every priest in the diocese and be brought by him to the episcopal synod.</blockquote>\n\n==Shrine==\nIt was generally believed that miracles were wrought at Richard's tomb in Chichester cathedral, which was long a popular place of pilgrimage, and in 1262, just 9 years after his death, he was canonized at [[Viterbo]] by [[Pope Urban IV]].<ref name=\"dnb1\">Lawrence. Richard of Wyche [St Richard of Chichester] (d. 1253): {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/23522}}</ref>\n\nRichard's feast day is on 3 April in the West, but because this date generally falls within Lent or Eastertide this is normally translated to 16 June in some provinces of the Anglican Communion (the Anglican Church of Canada, for example, commemorates Richard on 3 April), which venerates St. Richard more widely than does the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Richard furnished the chronicler, [[Matthew Paris]], with material for the life of [[Edmund Rich|St. Edmund Rich]], and instituted the offerings for the cathedral at Chichester which were known later as \"St. Richard's pence.\"<ref name=\"dnb1\"/>\n\nDuring the episcopate of the first [[Anglican]] bishop of Chichester, [[Richard Sampson]], King [[Henry VIII of England]], through his [[Vicar-General]], [[Thomas Cromwell]] ordered the destruction of Richard's shrine in [[Chichester]] cathedral in 1538.<ref name=\"tatton143\">Tatton-Brown.Chichester Cathedral: Destruction, Repair and Restoration ''in'' Mary Hobbs.

It seems that someone associated with the parish of [[West Wittering]] in Sussex, possibly William Ernley, using his position as royal commissioner for the destruction of St. Richard's Shrine, may have spirited away the relics and bones of St. Richard and hidden them in their own parish church,  as there are persistent legends of the presence there, of the remains of the saint:\n\n<blockquote>The Lady Chapel not only contains the Saxon Cross but also an ancient broken marble slab engraved with a Bishop's pastoral staff and a Greek cross believed to have come from a reliquary containing the relics of St. Richard of Chichester, a 13th century bishop who often visited West Wittering. Part of his story is shown in the beautiful red, white and gold altar frontal presented by Yvonne Rusbridge in 1976.

In 1538, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the shrine was plundered and destroyed by order of [[Thomas Cromwell]]. Richard of Chichester is the patron saint of [[Sussex]] in southern England; since 2007, his translated saint's day of 16 June has been celebrated as [[Sussex Day]].\n\n==Life==\nRichard was born in Burford, near the town of Wyche (modern [[Droitwich]], [[Worcestershire]]) and was an orphan member of a gentry family.<ref name=BHO>Greenway. Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: volume 5: pp. 1-6.</ref><ref>Capes, 1913, p. 13)</ref> On the death of their parents Richard's elder brother was heir to the estates but he was not old enough to inherit, so the lands were subject to a [[Tenant-in-chief|feudal wardship]]. On coming of age his brother took possession of his lands, but was required to pay a [[Feudal relief|medieval form of death duty]] that left the family so impoverished, that Richard had to work for him on the farm.<ref name=\"lower242\">Lower. The Worthies of Sussex. p. 242</ref> His brother also made Richard heir to the estate.<ref name=\"lower242\"/> According to Richard's biographers, friends tried to arrange a match with a ''certain noble lady''.<ref name=\"lower242\"/> However Richard rejected the proposed match, suggesting that his brother might marry her instead; he also reconveyed the estates back to his brother, preferring a life of study and the church.<ref name=\"lower243\">Lower. The Worthies of Sussex. pp. 242-243</ref>\n\nEducated at the [[University of Oxford]], Richard soon began to teach in the university.<ref name=\"stephens84\">Stephens.

He was also a stickler for clerical privilege.<ref name=\"Seward\"/>\n\nRichard's [[episcopate]] was marked by the favour which he showed to the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], a house of this order at Orl\u00e9ans having sheltered him during his stay in France, and by his earnestness in preaching a [[crusade]]. After dedicating [[St Edmund's Chapel]] at [[Dover]], he died aged 56 at the [[Maison Dieu, Dover]] at midnight on 3 April 1253, where the Pope had ordered him to preach a crusade.<ref name=Handbook239/> His internal organs were removed and placed in that chapel's altar. Richard's body was then carried to Chichester and buried, according to his wishes, in the chapel on the north side of the nave, dedicated to his patron St. Edmund.<ref name=\"atkinson18\">Atkinson.

Memorials of The See at Chichester pp.87-93</ref>\nRichard overruled Henry on several occasions.  Richard defrocked a priest who had seduced a nun out of her convent, turning aside a petition from the king in the priest's favour.<ref name=\"lower244\">Lower. The Worthies of Sussex. p. 244</ref>\n\nRichard was militant in protecting the clergy from abuse. The townsmen of [[Lewes]] violated the right of [[sanctuary]] by seizing a criminal in church and [[lynching]] him, and Richard made them exhume the body and give it a proper burial in consecrated ground.<ref name=\"stephens88\"/> He also imposed severe penance on [[knight]]s who attacked priests.<ref name=\"lower244\"/>\n\nRichard produced a body of statutes with the aid of his chapter, for the organisation of the church in his diocese and the expected conduct of its clergy. It seems that many of the clergy still secretly married, though such alliances were not recognised by canon law, and as such their women's status was that of a mistress or concubine. The Bishop endeavoured to suppress the practice in his diocese with relentless austerity.\n\nBy Richard's statutes:<ref name=\"stephens88\"/>\n\n<blockquote>It was decreed that married clergy should be deprived of their [[benefice]]s; their [[Concubinage|concubines]] were to be denied the privileges of the church during their lives and also after death; they were pronounced incapable of inheriting any property from their husbands, and any such bequests would be donated for the upkeep of the cathedral. A vow of chastity was to be required of candidates for ordination. Rectors were expected to reside in their parishes, to be hospitable and charitable and tithes were to be paid on all annual crops. Anyone who did not pay their tithe would not be granted penance until they did.<br/>\n[[Vicars]] were to be priests and have only one freehold to live on, they were not allowed to have another parish held under an assumed name.<br/>\n[[Deacons]] were not to be allowed to receive confessions or to provide penances, or to baptise except in the absence of a priest. Children had to be confirmed within a year of baptism. The [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Lord's Prayer]] were to be learned in the mother tongue; priests were to celebrate mass in clean robes, to use a silver or golden [[chalice]]; thoroughly clean [[Altar cloth|corporals]] and at least two consecrated [[Altar cloth|palls]] were to be placed on the altar; the cross was to be planted in front of the [[Officiant|celebrant]]; the bread was to be of the purest wheaten flour, the wine mixed with water. The elements were not to be kept more than seven days; when carried to a sick person to be enclosed in a [[pyx]], and the priest to be preceded by a cross; a candle, holy water and bell.<br/>\nPractices such as gambling at baptisms and marriages is strictly forbidden.<br/>\n[[Archdeacon]]s were to administer justice for their proper fees, not demanding more either for rushing or delaying the business. They were to visit the churches regularly, to see that the services were duly ministered, the vessels and vestments are in proper order, the canon of the mass correctly observed and distinctly read, as also the \u2018'hours\u2019\u2019. Priests who clipped or slurred the words by rushing were to be suspended.<br/>\nThe clergy should wear their proper dress and not imitate what the lay people wore. They were not allowed to wear their hair long or have romantic entanglements. The names of excommunicated persons to be read out four times a year in the parish churches.<br/>\nA copy of these statutes was to be kept by every priest in the diocese and be brought by him to the episcopal synod.</blockquote>\n\n==Shrine==\nIt was generally believed that miracles were wrought at Richard's tomb in Chichester cathedral, which was long a popular place of pilgrimage, and in 1262, just 9 years after his death, he was canonized at [[Viterbo]] by [[Pope Urban IV]].<ref name=\"dnb1\">Lawrence. Richard of Wyche [St Richard of Chichester] (d. 1253): {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/23522}}</ref>\n\nRichard's feast day is on 3 April in the West, but because this date generally falls within Lent or Eastertide this is normally translated to 16 June in some provinces of the Anglican Communion (the Anglican Church of Canada, for example, commemorates Richard on 3 April), which venerates St. Richard more widely than does the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Richard furnished the chronicler, [[Matthew Paris]], with material for the life of [[Edmund Rich|St. Edmund Rich]], and instituted the offerings for the cathedral at Chichester which were known later as \"St. Richard's pence.\"<ref name=\"dnb1\"/>\n\nDuring the episcopate of the first [[Anglican]] bishop of Chichester, [[Richard Sampson]], King [[Henry VIII of England]], through his [[Vicar-General]], [[Thomas Cromwell]] ordered the destruction of Richard's shrine in [[Chichester]] cathedral in 1538.<ref name=\"tatton143\">Tatton-Brown.Chichester Cathedral: Destruction, Repair and Restoration ''in'' Mary Hobbs.

Hillier, revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her [[vagina]], rupturing her [[peritoneum]].<ref>Begg, pp. 27\u201329; Cook, pp. 34\u201335; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 50; Evans and Skinner, pp. 4\u20137</ref> The police were not informed of the incident until 6 April when they were told an inquest was to be held the next day. The inquest at the hospital, which was conducted by the [[coroner]] for East [[Middlesex]], [[Wynne Edwin Baxter]], was attended by Russell, Hillier, and the local chief inspector of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], H Division Whitechapel: John West. The inquest jury returned a verdict of murder by person or persons unknown.<ref name=\"Evans and Skinner, pp. 4\u20137\"/>\n\nChief Inspector West placed the investigation in the hands of Inspector [[Edmund Reid]] of H Division.<ref>Evans and Skinner, p. 5</ref> Reid noted in his report that her clothing was \"in such dirty ragged condition that it was impossible to tell if any part of it had been fresh torn\".<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 49</ref> [[Walter Dew]], a detective constable stationed with H Division, later described the investigation:\n\n{{quote|As in every case of murder in this country, however poor and friendless the victims might be, the police made every effort to track down Emma Smith's assailant. Unlikely as well as likely places were searched for clues. Hundreds of people were interrogated. Scores of statements were taken. Soldiers from the [[Tower of London]] [which stood within H Division] were questioned as to their movements. Ships in docks were searched and sailors questioned.<ref>Dew, Walter (1938), ''I Caught Crippen'', London: Blackie and Son, quoted in Connell, pp. 8\u20139</ref>}}\n\nSmith had not provided descriptions of the men who had attacked her and no witnesses came forward or were found. The investigation proved fruitless and the murderer or murderers were never caught.\n\n==Whitechapel murders==\nThe case was listed as the first of eleven [[Whitechapel murders]] in Metropolitan Police files. Although elements of the press linked her death to the later murders, which were blamed on a single serial killer known as \"[[Jack the Ripper]]\", her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings.<ref>Begg, pp. 29\u201331; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 47\u201350; Marriott, pp. 5\u20137</ref><ref name=met>[http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm \"The Enduring Mystery of Jack the Ripper\"] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060711093022/http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm |date=2006-07-11 }}, Metropolitan Police, retrieved 1 May 2009</ref> With the exception of Walter Dew, who said he thought that Smith was the first victim of the Ripper,<ref>Dew, p. 92, quoted in Begg, p. 29</ref> the police suspected it was the unrelated work of a criminal gang.<ref>Begg, p. 29</ref> Smith either refused to or could not describe her attackers, possibly because she feared reprisal.
