The film was directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], and stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Thomas F. Wilson]] and [[Lea Thompson]]. The film continues immediately following ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989); while stranded in 1955 during his [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] adventures, [[Marty McFly]] (Fox) discovers that his friend [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]] (Lloyd), trapped in 1885, was killed by [[Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen]] (Wilson), [[Biff Tannen|Biff]]'s great-grandfather. Marty travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return once again to 1985, but matters are complicated when Doc falls in love with [[Clara Clayton]] (Steenburgen).\n\n''Back to the Future Part III'' was filmed in [[California]] and [[Arizona]], and was produced on a $40 million budget [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with ''Part II''. ''Part III'' was released in the United States on May 25, 1990, six months after the previous installment, and grossed earned $244 million worldwide during its initial run, making it the [[1990 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 1990]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/1990/?ref_=bo_cso_table_1|title=1990 Worldwide Box Office |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\n\nOn November 12, 1955, moments after witnessing Doc vanish with the DeLorean from a lightning bolt, [[Marty McFly]] (from 1985) learns that [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett Brown]] (also from 1985) was transported to 1885 and is trapped.{{refn|group=N|As depicted at the end of the 1989 film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]''.}} Marty and the 1955 Doc use the information in Doc's 1885 letter to find and repair the [[DMC DeLorean|DeLorean]] so that Marty can return to 1985, and instructs Marty to not come back for him. Marty spots a tombstone with Doc's name, dated six days after the letter, and learns that Doc was killed by [[Biff Tannen]]'s great-grandfather, Buford. Marty photographs the tombstone and travels to 1885 to save Doc.\n\nMarty arrives on September 2, 1885, in the middle of a [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] pursuit of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. When the DeLorean's fuel line is torn, Marty hides the car in a cave and walks to [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]]. He meets his Irish-born great-great-grandparents, [[Maggie McFly#Seamus and Maggie McFly|Seamus and Maggie McFly]], and runs afoul of Buford and his gang. Buford attempts to [[Lynching|lynch]] Marty, but Doc rescues him. Doc agrees to leave 1885 after seeing the photograph, but without gasoline, the DeLorean cannot reach {{convert|88|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nDoc devises a plan to use a train [[locomotive]] to push the DeLorean up to the required speed. While he and Marty explore a [[Branch line|rail spur]] they intend to use, they spot a runaway horse-drawn wagon. Doc saves the passenger, [[Clara Clayton]], and the two fall in love. At a town festival, Buford tries killing Doc, but Marty thwarts him. Buford insults Marty and challenges him to a showdown in two days; in his anger, Marty accepts. Doc warns Marty not to get provoked by name calling and lets it slip that Marty gets into a car accident in the future. Doc's name in the photograph of the tombstone is erased but the date and tombstone itself still remain.\n\nMarty and Doc place the DeLorean onto the spur. Doc makes Marty promise that once he returns to 1985 the DeLorean will be destroyed, but Marty convinces Doc to leave with him. Unable to convince Clara that he is from the future, Doc is spurned. He goes to the saloon for a [[Binge drinking|binge]]. Doc drinks a single shot of whiskey and passes out. Buford arrives and calls out Marty, but Marty observes \"[[Clint Eastwood]]\" (his 1885 alias) appear on the tombstone in the photograph, so refuses to duel. Doc awakens after drinking the bartender's special [[Prairie oyster|\"Wake-Up Juice\"]] and tries fleeing with Marty, but Buford's gang captures Doc, forcing Marty to duel. After fooling Buford into thinking he has killed Marty using a bulletproof plate, Marty knocks Buford into a wagon full of manure. Buford is arrested for an earlier robbery. The tombstone shown in the photograph then disapears (partly due to Buford running into and breaking the tombstone).\n\nAs Clara leaves on the train, she overhears a salesman discussing how heartbroken Doc was. Clara applies the [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] and returns to town. She discovers Doc's model of the time machine and rides after him. Stealing the locomotive at gunpoint, Doc and Marty begin pushing the DeLorean along the spur line. Clara boards the locomotive while Doc climbs toward the DeLorean. Doc encourages Clara to join him, but she falls, hanging precariously by her dress. Marty passes his [[hoverboard]] to Doc so he can save Clara. They coast away from the locomotive as it falls off an unfinished railroad bridge; Marty travels to 1985 on the completed bridge.\n\nMarty arrives on October 27, 1985, escaping the powerless DeLorean before it is destroyed by an oncoming train. He discovers that everything has returned to the initial post-time travel timeline, and finds Jennifer sleeping on her front porch. He uses the lessons he learned in 1885 to avoid being goaded into a street race with Douglas J. Needles, avoiding a possible automobile accident. Remembering that this accident would have sent Marty's life spiraling downward, Jennifer opens a fax message she kept from 2015, and watches as its text regarding Marty's firing disappears.\n\nAs Marty and Jennifer examine the DeLorean wreckage, a flying steam locomotive equipped with a [[DeLorean time machine#flux capacitor|flux capacitor]] appears, manned by Doc, Clara, and their two children [[List of Back to the Future characters#Jules and Verne Brown|Jules and Verne]]. Doc gives Marty a photo of the two of them by the clockworks in 1885. Jennifer asks about the fax, and Doc tells them it means that the future has not yet been written. Doc and his family depart aboard the locomotive to an unknown time in the past.\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J.

During filming for the original, director Zemeckis asked Michael J. Fox what time period he would like to see. Fox replied that he wanted to visit the [[American frontier|Old West]] and meet [[cowboy]]s. Zemeckis and writer/producer [[Bob Gale]] were intrigued by the idea, but held it off until ''Part III''.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Rather than use existing sets, the filmmakers built the 1885 Hill Valley from scratch.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> The western scenes were filmed on location in [[Monument Valley]].<ref name=\"DVD(C)\">Back to the Future 2002 DVD Feature: Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale Q&A recorded at the [[University of Southern California]]</ref> Some of the location shooting for the 1885 Hill Valley was done in [[Jamestown, California]], and on a purpose-built set at the Red Hills Ranch near [[Sonora, California]].<ref name=\"DVD(C)\"/> Some of the train scenes were filmed at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railtown1897.org/railtown/doc.asp?id=339 |title=Railtown 1897 State Historic Park Film Credits |website=railtown1897.org|accessdate=October 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203053007/http://www.railtown1897.org/railtown/doc.asp?id=339 |archivedate=December 3, 2010  }}</ref> a [[heritage railroad|heritage line]] in Jamestown.

The most grueling part was editing ''Part II'' while filming ''Part III'', and Zemeckis bore the brunt of the process over a three-week period. While Zemeckis was shooting most of the train sequences in Sonora, Gale was in Los Angeles supervising the final dub of ''Part II''.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Zemeckis would wrap photography and board a private plane to [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], where Gale and engineers would greet him on the dubbing stage with dinner.

The film was directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], and stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Thomas F. Wilson]] and [[Lea Thompson]].

Marty spots a tombstone with Doc's name, dated six days after the letter, and learns that Doc was killed by [[Biff Tannen]]'s great-grandfather, Buford. Marty photographs the tombstone and travels to 1885 to save Doc.\n\nMarty arrives on September 2, 1885, in the middle of a [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] pursuit of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. When the DeLorean's fuel line is torn, Marty hides the car in a cave and walks to [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]]. He meets his Irish-born great-great-grandparents, [[Maggie McFly#Seamus and Maggie McFly|Seamus and Maggie McFly]], and runs afoul of Buford and his gang. Buford attempts to [[Lynching|lynch]] Marty, but Doc rescues him. Doc agrees to leave 1885 after seeing the photograph, but without gasoline, the DeLorean cannot reach {{convert|88|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nDoc devises a plan to use a train [[locomotive]] to push the DeLorean up to the required speed. While he and Marty explore a [[Branch line|rail spur]] they intend to use, they spot a runaway horse-drawn wagon. Doc saves the passenger, [[Clara Clayton]], and the two fall in love. At a town festival, Buford tries killing Doc, but Marty thwarts him. Buford insults Marty and challenges him to a showdown in two days; in his anger, Marty accepts. Doc warns Marty not to get provoked by name calling and lets it slip that Marty gets into a car accident in the future. Doc's name in the photograph of the tombstone is erased but the date and tombstone itself still remain.\n\nMarty and Doc place the DeLorean onto the spur. Doc makes Marty promise that once he returns to 1985 the DeLorean will be destroyed, but Marty convinces Doc to leave with him. Unable to convince Clara that he is from the future, Doc is spurned. He goes to the saloon for a [[Binge drinking|binge]]. Doc drinks a single shot of whiskey and passes out. Buford arrives and calls out Marty, but Marty observes \"[[Clint Eastwood]]\" (his 1885 alias) appear on the tombstone in the photograph, so refuses to duel. Doc awakens after drinking the bartender's special [[Prairie oyster|\"Wake-Up Juice\"]] and tries fleeing with Marty, but Buford's gang captures Doc, forcing Marty to duel. After fooling Buford into thinking he has killed Marty using a bulletproof plate, Marty knocks Buford into a wagon full of manure. Buford is arrested for an earlier robbery.\n\nAs Clara leaves on the train, she overhears a salesman discussing how heartbroken Doc was. Clara applies the [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] and returns to town. She discovers Doc's model of the time machine and rides after him. Stealing the locomotive at gunpoint, Doc and Marty begin pushing the DeLorean along the spur line. Clara boards the locomotive while Doc climbs toward the DeLorean. Doc encourages Clara to join him, but she falls, hanging precariously by her dress. Marty passes his [[hoverboard]] to Doc so he can save Clara. They coast away from the locomotive as it falls off an unfinished railroad bridge; Marty travels to 1985 on the completed bridge.\n\nMarty arrives on October 27, 1985, escaping the powerless DeLorean before it is destroyed by an oncoming train. He discovers that everything has returned to the initial post-time travel timeline, and finds Jennifer sleeping on her front porch. He uses the lessons he learned in 1885 to avoid being goaded into a street race with Douglas J. Needles, avoiding a possible automobile accident. Remembering that this accident would have sent Marty's life spiraling downward, Jennifer opens a fax message she kept from 2015, and watches as its text regarding Marty's firing disappears.\n\nAs Marty and Jennifer examine the DeLorean wreckage, a flying steam locomotive equipped with a [[DeLorean time machine#flux capacitor|flux capacitor]] appears, manned by Doc, Clara, and their two children [[List of Back to the Future characters#Jules and Verne Brown|Jules and Verne]]. Doc gives Marty a photo of the two of them by the clockworks in 1885. Jennifer asks about the fax, and Doc tells them it means that the future has not yet been written. Doc and his family depart aboard the locomotive to an unknown time in the past.\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J.
