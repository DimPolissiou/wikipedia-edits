He participated in the last outburst of armed resistance against the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1679\u20131681, but was eventually forced to sign a new treaty that reduced Ternate to a mere vassal of the Company. In that way he was the last formally independent Sultan before the onset of early-modern Dutch colonialism.\n\n==Succession to the throne==\n\nSibori Amsterdam was born around 1654 as the eldest son of Sultan [[Mandar Syah]] and his consort Lawa.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 22.</ref> The Dutch leanings of his father made him name two of his sons after cities in the [[Netherlands]] - a junior brother was called Prince Rotterdam. When Mandar Syah passed away from an epidemic in January 1675, Sibori Amsterdam succeeded to the throne with Dutch support. He professed his pro-Dutch standing, saying \"If my father was half a Dutchman, I shall certainly be a whole one\".<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 177.</ref> Like his predecessor he realized that a good relationship with the Dutch could raise his prestige and power, since Ternate's resources were fragile. Thus he received a Dutch bodyguard including a sergeant and a corporal, which increased his reputations. It should be recalled that the VOC was at the peak of its power at this time, after victories in [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Palembang]], [[Aceh]], [[Sultanate of Gowa|Makassar]], and [[Java]]. The new Sultan was nevertheless dissatisfied with the spice monopoly that the Company had imposed on his father, which led to a shortage of money for the Ternate court.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 178.</ref>\n\n==Rebellion==\n\nThe Sultan gave proof of military prowess in an expedition to [[Siau Island]] in 1677, which turned out to be a success. This contributed in strengthening his royal authority to the detriment of older, consensus-based forms of governance. One aristocrat who felt threatened by Sibori Amsterdam's policy was his brother-in-law Kaicili Alam (d. 1684), the heir to the defunct [[Jailolo]] kingdom, who sought and found sanctuary at the Dutch [[Fort Oranje (Ternate)|Fort Oranje]] on Ternate, to the great irritation of the Sultan. Shortly after, the three most important officials of the kingdom, the ''Jogugu'' (first minister), the ''Kapita Laut'' (the sea lord) and the ''Hukum'' (magistrate), fled to Ternate's traditional rival, the [[Tidore Sultanate]], after which Sibori Amsterdam abolished the ''Jogugu'' position altogether for a while.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 180.</ref> Later on, Kaicili Alam found favour with the Sultan because of his warlike feats and was made ''Jogugu'' of Ternate.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the VOC policy of forcing the Ternatan elite to extirpate clove trees in the realm to ensure VOC monopoly, met with growing resentment. The ties between the center of the kingdom and its outlying dependencies became strained, which at length affected relations between the Sultan and the VOC. Sibori Amsterdam fell out with the VOC governor Robertus Padtbrugge, not least because of the latter's promotion of Christian missionaries in the staunchly Islamic kingdom. Eventually Sibori Amsterdam brought his harem, Bobatos (chiefs) and artillery to Jailolo on [[Halmahera]] in open defiance of the Company.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 181-2.</ref> The rebellion, which broke out in 1679, had a pronounced religious side, and Muslim preachers from [[Banten Sultanate|Banten]] were active in inspiring anti-Dutch insurgency. Some areas, such as North Halmahera and [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] supported the Sultan, while Ternate's old rival, the Tidore Sultanate, backed up the Dutch positions and contributed with ''korakoras'' (large outriggers used in warfare). The main Ternatan strongholds in Halmahera, Sahu and Gamkonara, fell to the VOC forces in 1681, and internal divisions among the rebels spelled the end of the movement.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 182-5.</ref> Sibori Amsterdam, abandoned by most of his followers, was finally captured in August 1681.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Vassal under the VOC==\n\nThe Sultan was brought to [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and interrogated by the VOC authorities; however it was not found necessary to depose him. Rather, the status of Ternate as a formally sovereign state was abrogated through a new treaty on 17 July 1683. In a European legal sense, Ternate now became a vassal (''leen'') under the Company. In Ternatan terms, the VOC became the \"father\" and the Ternate kingdom the \"child\", and the Dutch had a decisive voice in the appointment of new Sultans.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 185-6.</ref> The Dutch proceeded to delineate the borders of the Ternate Sultanate with more rigour than before. The gains made in the Bungaya Treat of 1667 were mostly confirmed, but the gold-rich [[Gorontalo]] and [[Limboto, Gorontalo|Limboto]], the Christian settlements at the [[Gulf of Tomini]], and the [[Sangihe Islands]] were lost for the Sultan. The political reshuffling meant that the Dutch no longer saw it necessary to pay annual \"money of recognition\" for the extirpation of clove trees in Ternatan territory. However, the Sultan received a subsidy of 6,400 rijksdaalders to maintain his court.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 186-7.</ref>\n\nSultan Sibori Amsterdam seemed truly grateful to be reinstated in his kingdom, rather than being exiled or even executed.

Like his predecessors he was heavily dependent on the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), and was forced to comply to Dutch demands to extirpate spice trees in his domains, ensuring Dutch monopoly of the profitable [[spice trade]]. On the other hand, the Ternate-VOC alliance led to a large increase of Ternatan territory in the war with [[Sultanate of Gowa|Makassar]] in 1667.\n\n==Accession==\n\nKaicili (prince) Tahubo, the later Mandar Syah, was only a few years old when his father Sultan [[Mudafar Syah I]] passed away in 1627. He had two older brothers, Kaicili Kalamata and Kaicili Manilha, and was therefore not a likely candidate for the Ternatan throne.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 20.</ref> An older kinsman, [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]] ruled as Sultan from 1627 to 1648 when he passed away without sons. Now the grandees of the kingdom wanted Manilha to be their new ruler, while Muslim clerics preferred Kalamata. However, the VOC, whose influence in the affairs of Ternate was on the rise, insisted that the youngest brother Tahubo should be installed since he had been raised under the supervision of the Dutch governors in Ternate.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1895) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. III. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. xxxvii.</ref> The Ternatan elite was less than pleased, and so Tahubo, who took the title Sultan Mandar Syah, was even more dependent on Dutch goodwill than his two predecessors. His Dutch leanings can be seen from the names that he gave a few of his sons: Prince Amsterdam, Prince Rotterdam.\n\n==The rebellion of Manilha==\n\nDissatisfaction with Mandar Syah's dependence on the Company soon led to open opposition from the influential House of Fala Rahi and the various Bobatos (chiefs) of Ternate. In August 1650 they elected his brother Manilha, supposedly a mentally unstable person, as Sultan in opposition. They believed that Manilha would be more sensible to Ternatan community leaders. The attempt soon faltered, since the Dutch were not ready to abandon their candidate. Admiral Arnold de Vlamingh van Oudshoorn turned up in Maluku in 1651 and forced Manilha to yield. The other brother Kalamata, an able figure and an expert in Islamic law, continued to create trouble for the Dutch during the coming years and eventually fled to Ternate's political rival [[Makassar]]. Anti-Dutch opposition also spread to the Hoamoal Peninsula in West [[Seram Island|Ceram]] and the Muslim realm Hitu in [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], both of which were formally Ternatan dependencies. Admiral de Vlamingh van Oudshoorn, enjoined by Mandar Syah, spent several years suppressing the resistance, an extremely bloody affair that finally ensured total Dutch control over the clove-producing Ambon Quarter.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 162-4. </ref> \n\n==Extirpation of clove trees==\n\nApart from the rebellions, the selling of spices to merchants operating outside the VOC was a problem for the Dutch authorities, who deemed such practices \"smuggling\". The solution was to force the periphery areas in Maluku to stop producing spices. Here Mandar Syah was a useful tool to enforce Dutch spice monopoly. A treaty with the Sultan was signed on 31 July 1652. Mandar Syah agreed to allow the destruction of all clove trees in Ternate and the Ambon dependencies. In return, the Sultan received an annual sum (''recognitiepenningen'') of 12,000 rijksdaalders. Some of this money was to be allocated to the various Bobatos. In practice, this became a way for the Sultan to keep the Bobatos in check since those showing signs of disobedience had their subsidies withdrawn. This differed from the old system where the Bobatos kept incomes from the clove trade for the needs of their own community (''soa'').<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 167-8.</ref> Similar contracts were concluded with the other sultanates [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]].<ref>F.C. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 52.</ref> The Company and the Sultans upheld the monopoly by means of regular expeditions, ''hongitochten'', that cruised the islands and destroyed any spice tree that was found. Such ''hongitochten'' were conducted until the 19th century and gained notoriety for brutality.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 171-2.</ref>\n\n==Political gains==\n\nThe rise of the Makassar Kingdom in the first half of the 17th century had grave consequences for the Sultante of Ternate. Large areas such as [[Buton]], [[Kingdom of Banggai|Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]], [[Menado]], [[Sula Islands|Sula]] and [[Buru Island|Buru]] fell away from Ternatan overlordship.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 164.</ref> Here, the growing power of the VOC turned out to be advantageous. Ternate supported the [[Makassar War|VOC expedition to Makassar]] in 1667 with a small force. Makassar was crushed with the help of the [[Bugis people|Bugis]] leader [[Arung Palakka]] and forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bongaya]] in the same year. One of the stipulations was that Ternate regained its old vassals in [[Sulawesi]] and adjacent islands.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1981) ''The heritage of Arung Palakka''. The Hague: Nijhoff, p. 306.</ref> Another political rival, the [[Tidore Sultanate]], left its traditional alliance with [[Spain]] and made contracts with the VOC in 1657 and 1667, which for the moment put an end to the long history of Ternatan-Tidorese rivalries and petty wars.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe legacy of Sultan Mandar Syah was therefore ambivalent: on one hand close dependency on the VOC, but on the other hand a strengthening of the Sultan's own powers at the expense of officials and chiefs, and a dramatic increase in territory. These contradiction would lead to open anti-Dutch rebellion under his son [[Sibori Amsterdam]] who succeeded him in 1675.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 179-85.</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nSultan Mandar Syah married the following wives and co-wives:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 20-1.</ref>\n* A daughter of Sultan Saidi of [[Tidore]] (possibly merely engaged)\n* A princess of [[Buton]]\n* Maya from Ternate, mother of Boki Mahir\n* Lawa, mother of Amsterdam, Malayu, Mauludu and Sarabu\n* Maryam from Sahu, mother of Rotterdam and Boki Gogugu\n* Ainun, mother of Toloko\n* A [[Makassarese people|Makassarese]] woman, mother of Neman\n* A [[Gorontalo|Gorontalese]] woman, mother of Hukum and Diojo\n\nHis sons (Kaicili, princes) and daughters (Boki, princesses) were:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 20-1.</ref>\n* Boki Mahir Gammalamo\n* Kaicili [[Sibori Amsterdam]], Sultan of Ternate\n* Kaicili Malayu\n* Boki Mauludu\n* Boki Sarabu\n* Kaicili Rotterdam alias Yena\n* Boki Gogugu\n* Kaicili Toloko, Sultan of Ternate\n* Kaicili Neman\n* Kaicili Hukum\n* Boki Diojo\n* Boki Timonga\n* Boki Tabilo\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Sultan of Ternate|years=1648\u20131675}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Sibori Amsterdam]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:Sultans of Ternate]]\n[[Category:Ternate Sultanate]]\n[[Category:People from Maluku Islands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox royalty\n|name  = Sultan Mandar Syah\n|succession  = [[Sultan of Ternate]]\n|reign       = 1648\u20131675\n|predecessor = [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]]\n|successor   = [[Sibori Amsterdam]]\n|regnal name =  \n|house       = \n|father      = [[Mudafar Syah I]]\n|mother      = \n|birth_date  = \n|birth_place = \n|death_date  = 3 January 1675\n|religion    = [[Islam]]\n}}\n\n'''Sultan Mandar Syah''' (b. c. 1625-d. 3 January 1675) was the 11th Sultan of [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]] who reigned from 1648 to 1675.

Large areas such as [[Buton]], [[Kingdom of Banggai|Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]], [[Menado]], [[Sula Islands|Sula]] and [[Buru Island|Buru]] fell away from Ternatan overlordship.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 164.</ref> Here, the growing power of the VOC turned out to be advantageous. Ternate supported the [[Makassar War|VOC expedition to Makassar]] in 1667 with a small force. Makassar was crushed with the help of the [[Bugis people|Bugis]] leader [[Arung Palakka]] and forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bongaya]] in the same year. One of the stipulations was that Ternate regained its old vassals in [[Sulawesi]] and adjacent islands.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1981) ''The heritage of Arung Palakka''. The Hague: Nijhoff, p. 306.</ref> Another political rival, the [[Tidore Sultanate]], left its traditional alliance with [[Spain]] and made contracts with the VOC in 1657 and 1667, which for the moment put an end to the long history of Ternatan-Tidorese rivalries and petty wars.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe legacy of Sultan Mandar Syah was therefore ambivalent: on one hand close dependency on the VOC, but on the other hand a strengthening of the Sultan's own powers at the expense of officials and chiefs, and a dramatic increase in territory. These contradiction would lead to open anti-Dutch rebellion under his son [[Sibori Amsterdam]] who succeeded him in 1675.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 179-85.</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nSultan Mandar Syah married the following wives and co-wives:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 20-1.</ref>\n* A daughter of Sultan Saidi of [[Tidore]] (possibly merely engaged)\n* A princess of [[Buton]]\n* Maya from Ternate, mother of Boki Mahir\n* Lawa, mother of Amsterdam, Malayu, Mauludu and Sarabu\n* Maryam from Sahu, mother of Rotterdam and Boki Gogugu\n* Ainun, mother of Toloko\n* A [[Makassarese people|Makassarese]] woman, mother of Neman\n* A [[Gorontalo|Gorontalese]] woman, mother of Hukum and Diojo\n\nHis sons (Kaicili, princes) and daughters (Boki, princesses) were:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 20-1.</ref>\n* Boki Mahir Gammalamo\n* Kaicili [[Sibori Amsterdam]], Sultan of Ternate\n* Kaicili Malayu\n* Boki Mauludu\n* Boki Sarabu\n* Kaicili Rotterdam alias Yena\n* Boki Gogugu\n* Kaicili Toloko, Sultan of Ternate\n* Kaicili Neman\n* Kaicili Hukum\n* Boki Diojo\n* Boki Timonga\n* Boki Tabilo\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Sultan of Ternate|years=1648\u20131675}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Sibori Amsterdam]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:Sultans of Ternate]]\n[[Category:Ternate Sultanate]]\n[[Category:People from Maluku Islands]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toAmbon(link changed toAmbon Island) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandar_Syah"}

Therefore, orbital satellites need to maneuver out of the path of tracked space debris that can cause major damage. Additionally, if one very large space mirror were to be deployed, its massive surface area will be a very large target for space debris. Therefore, maneuvering hundreds of space mirrors or one very large space mirror will prove to be very difficult due to the sheer number of space debris and the potential size of the space mirror.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Unintended Climate Change ====\nThe direct reflection of solar radiation away from the Earth may have certain adverse effects on the climate.

In the past, many scientists have also resisted the idea of using geoengineering to curb climate change, as the risks of causing adverse effects were too great and they worried it would encourage people to continue to use fossil fuels that contribute to that change<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n=== Policy ===\nAt times, politicians have been more eager to discuss climate engineering and space mirror proposals than scientists have been to think about implementing them.<ref name=\":6\" /> Politicians in the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama have discussed and proposed funding for US-based space mirrors proposals. Scientists, however, are still worried about the significant risks. Matthew Watson, of the University of Bristol, led a \u00a35m research study into the potential adverse effects of climate engineering and said that \u201cWe are sleepwalking to a disaster with climate change.

Although CO2 removal from the atmosphere would reverse climate changes thus far, removing carbon is a slower and more difficult process compared to solar radiation management.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSolar radiation management works to directly mitigate the effects of atmospheric warming due to the burning of fossil fuels and subsequent release of greenhouse gases.<ref name=\":3\" /> Space mirrors fall under this category of geoengineering as they work to block solar radiation and lower the warming effects from the sun.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Research and Development Proposals ===\nThere have been several theoretical proposals for space mirrors since the 1980s as researchers attempted to discover a feasible way to partially reflect sunlight and slow down the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere using space mirrors.<ref name=\":0\" /> Research into space mirrors first began in 1989 by engineer James Early, who proposed a 2,000 km glass shield.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming|title=How a giant space umbrella could stop global warming|last=Gorvett|first=Zaria|website=www.bbc.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The glass shield would need to be constructed on the Moon using moon rock due to its sheer mass.<ref name=\":1\" /> Lowell Wood, a researcher at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, proposed sending a single, massive mirror into orbit at Lagrange point L1, approximately one million miles away from Earth.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/30302-lagrange-points.html|title=Lagrange Points: Parking Places in Space|last=Science|first=Elizabeth Howell 2017-08-22T01:30:00Z|last2=Astronomy|website=Space.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> While orbiting at the [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange point 1]], the space mirror would be able to remain in orbit without any additional energy supplies and continue to block sunlight.<ref name=\":12\" /> In 2006, Roger Angel, a researcher at the University of Arizona, proposed sending millions of smaller space mirrors as opposed to one large mirror to reduce costs and increase feasibility as a single mirror would need to be approximately 600,000 square miles to block just one percent of sunlight.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStar Technology and Research looked to create a system of space mirrors which both blocked sunlight from reaching Earth and provided another source of clean energy for Earth.<ref name=\":0\" /> The company proposed launching several hundred space mirror spacecrafts into orbit closer to Earth. These spacecrafts would orbit around the Earth\u2019s equator and could be remotely controlled to steer around Earth while covered with space mirrors that reflect sunlight.

Most of such debris are small, weighing around 1 gram.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, depending on their speed, such debris can be catastrophic for satellites if they were to collide. Therefore, orbital satellites need to maneuver out of the path of tracked space debris that can cause major damage. Additionally, if one very large space mirror were to be deployed, its massive surface area will be a very large target for space debris. Therefore, maneuvering hundreds of space mirrors or one very large space mirror will prove to be very difficult due to the sheer number of space debris and the potential size of the space mirror.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Unintended Climate Change ====\nThe direct reflection of solar radiation away from the Earth may have certain adverse effects on the climate.

He ruled from 1627 to 1648, during a time when the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) increasingly dominated this part of maritime [[Southeast Asia]], and the increasing power of the [[Sultanate of Gowa|Makassar kingdom]] threatened the Ternatan possessions. \n\n==Spanish exile and return==\n\nHamza was the third son of Kaicili (prince) Tolu (d. c. 1590), himself a son of sultan [[Hairun]] (r. 1535-1570). His brothers were Hafsin, Naya and Kapita Laut Ali.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''.

While in [[Manila]] he was Hispanicized in many ways: he was baptized and took the name Pedro de Acu\u00f1a, after the Spanish governor who had led the 1606 invasion, and married in the church. Since he was therefore expected to follow Iberian interests, the Manila authorities allowed him to return to Ternate in 1627.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 158-9.</ref> At this time Ternate was an autonomous kingdom, but was bound by a contract with the VOC to follow Dutch commercial policy, and kept a number of Dutch garrisons on its territory. Some months after Hamza's return, the current Sultan [[Mudafar Syah I]] passed away.\n\nAlthough there were other candidates for the throne, the Ternatan state council chose to appoint Hamza as new Sultan of Ternate, the more as he reverted to Islam on his return. The Dutch, who were not consulted on the matter, feared that the choice of ruler might strengthen the Spanish who occupied a number of forts on Ternate and its neighbor [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]] since 1606. They would rather have seen his forceful brother Kapita Laut Ali, the sea lord, as the new Sultan. Eventually they accepted the decision of the council, however.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 158.</ref> Though fluent in Spanish and educated by [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] fathers, he openly denounced his former Spanish protectors, and never seems to have seriously plotted to place Maluku under the sway of Manila during his reign.<ref>Willard A.

Christians from Moro [[Halmahera]] were forced to settle in Malayu on Ternate Island, and people from Loloda were moved to [[Jailolo]], opposite Ternate. He also strengthened his position at the cost of the Jogugu (first minister) and the Kapita Laut Ali, who was sent on an expedition to reaffirm Ternate's power in [[Sulawesi]] and [[Buton]], and died en route in 1632 or 1633.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. </ref> He also sent expeditions to curb his formal vassals, the autonomous leaders in West [[Seram Island|Ceram]] and Hitu in [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], during the 1640s. Ambon was a very important center for clove production, and the chiefs were not easily brought to obedience.

Sultan Ngarolamo of Tidore was deposed in 1633 with Ternatan support and replaced with his cousin Sultan Gorontalo, who had lived in Ternate as Hamza's proteg\u00e9. The VOC was not happy about Hamza's activism, since it was apparently just a way to increase royal Ternatan influence in the region, which could be detrimental to Dutch interests. Hamza allowed the deposed monarch to stay in Ternate, where his daughter was married to Hamza. Some years later, however, he saw it that Ngarolamo was murdered when there were doubts about his sincerity.<ref>P.A, Tiele (1890), p. liii, 380-3.</ref> Meanwhile, the Spanish in turn murdered Sultan Gorontalo in 1639, and Tidore remained allied with them until 1663.\n\n==Death==\n\nHamza, already old by the standards of the time, passed away in May 1648.

The resources of the Ternate center were nevertheless too limited and fragile to uphold the extensive realm efficiently.

Some years later, however, he saw it that Ngarolamo was murdered when there were doubts about his sincerity.<ref>P.A, Tiele (1890), p. liii, 380-3.</ref> Meanwhile, the Spanish in turn murdered Sultan Gorontalo in 1639, and Tidore remained allied with them until 1663.\n\n==Death==\n\nHamza, already old by the standards of the time, passed away in May 1648. After being a practitioner of Islam for decades he still, according to the rumours, invoked Catholic saints at his deathbed.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1895) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. III. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. 391.</ref> He left no sons in spite of his numerous marriages. He was succeeded by Mudafar Syah's son [[Mandar Syah]]<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 18-9.</ref> His attempts to centralize his realm were apparently inspired by his Spanish background, since the policy of colonial rule in the Philippines was to exercise direct control over the territories. The resources of the Ternate center were nevertheless too limited and fragile to uphold the extensive realm efficiently. The solution was to ask for assistance from the VOC when needed, which tied Ternate closer to Dutch colonial governance.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 162.</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nSultan Hamza had several wives and co-wives:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 18-9.</ref>\n* A daughter of the King of [[Mindanao]] ([[Maguindanao Sultanate|Maguindanao]]?), married in 1603\n* A daughter of the Sangaji of [[Kayoa]]\n* A woman from Sahu (Halmahera), married 1623\n* A daughter of Sultan Ngarolamo of Tidore, married 1635, died 1642\n* A daughter of Raja [[Luhu, Indonesia|Luhu]] from Hoamoal (West [[Seram Island|Ceram]]), married 1638\n* A woman from [[Makian]], married 1643 or 1644\n\nFrom all these marriages, only one child came forth:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 18.</ref>\n* A daughter, born by the Tidore princess 1642\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Mudafar Syah I]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Sultan of Ternate|years=1627\u20131648}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Mandar Syah]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:Sultans of Ternate]]\n[[Category:Ternate Sultanate]]\n[[Category:People from Maluku Islands]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toAmbon(link changed toAmbon Island) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza_of_Ternate"}
