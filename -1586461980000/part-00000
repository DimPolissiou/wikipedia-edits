Day made her first film appearance with her sister in the 1924 Mack Sennett comedy ''Picking Peaches'' before being cast in a string of comedy shorts opposite actor [[Harry Langdon]] and a stint in early Hollywood [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] opposite such silent film cowboy stars as [[Hoot Gibson]], [[Art Acord]] and [[Jack Hoxie]]. Gradually, Day began appearing in more dramatic roles opposite such esteemed actors of the era as [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Norman Kerry]], [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]], [[Buster Keaton]], and [[Lon Chaney Sr.|Lon Chaney]].\n\nIn 1926, Day was named one of the 13 [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]], a promotional campaign sponsored by the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers in the United States, which honored 13 young women each year who they believed to be on the threshold of movie stardom. Other notable recipients that year were [[Joan Crawford]], [[Mary Astor]], [[Janet Gaynor]], and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]]. The publicity from the campaign added to Day's popularity, and in 1927, she appeared opposite John Barrymore in the romantic adventure ''[[The Beloved Rogue]]''.\n\nDay is probably best recalled for her appearances in the now [[Lost film|lost]] 1927 [[Tod Browning]] directed horror classic ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]'' with [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] and [[Conrad Nagel]], her role as Sally Richards in the 1928 comedy ''[[The Cameraman (1928 film)|The Cameraman]]'' with [[Buster Keaton]], and the 1929 drama ''[[The Jazz Age (1929 film)|The Jazz Age]]'' with [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]]. By the late 1920s, Day's career had eclipsed the career of her sister Alice, who also was a popular actress. The two would appear together onscreen again in the 1929 musical ''[[The Show of Shows]]''.\n\nShe married furrier Arthur J. Klein in 1930.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marceline Day to Wed Furrier|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/12/27/archives/marceline-day-to-wed-furrier.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=December 27, 1930}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Marceline Day Re-Wed.

She had no children with either husband.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nAlthough Day transitioned into sound films with little problem, her film roles gradually became lesser in quality, and she began working primarily for lower-rung film studios. By 1933, Day made the transition back to the Western genre, appearing in \"B\" [[Westerns]] starring [[Tim McCoy]], [[Hoot Gibson]], [[Ken Maynard]], Jack Hoxie, and [[John Wayne]]. Her last film was ''The Fighting Parson'' with Gibson. After her retirement, Day rarely spoke of her years as an actress and never spoke to reporters or granted interviews.\n\n==Death==\nOn February 16, 2000, Day was found dead in her kitchen in [[Cathedral City, California]], home at the age of 91.

Day made her first film appearance with her sister in the 1924 Mack Sennett comedy ''Picking Peaches'' before being cast in a string of comedy shorts opposite actor [[Harry Langdon]] and a stint in early Hollywood [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] opposite such silent film cowboy stars as [[Hoot Gibson]], [[Art Acord]] and [[Jack Hoxie]]. Gradually, Day began appearing in more dramatic roles opposite such esteemed actors of the era as [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Norman Kerry]], [[Ram\u00f3n Novarro]], [[Buster Keaton]], and [[Lon Chaney Sr.|Lon Chaney]].\n\nIn 1926, Day was named one of the 13 [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]], a promotional campaign sponsored by the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers in the United States, which honored 13 young women each year who they believed to be on the threshold of movie stardom. Other notable recipients that year were [[Joan Crawford]], [[Mary Astor]], [[Janet Gaynor]], and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]]. The publicity from the campaign added to Day's popularity, and in 1927, she appeared opposite John Barrymore in the romantic adventure ''[[The Beloved Rogue]]''.\n\nDay is probably best recalled for her appearances in the now [[Lost film|lost]] 1927 [[Tod Browning]] directed horror classic ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]'' with [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] and [[Conrad Nagel]], her role as Sally Richards in the 1928 comedy ''[[The Cameraman (1928 film)|The Cameraman]]'' with [[Buster Keaton]], and the 1929 drama ''[[The Jazz Age (1929 film)|The Jazz Age]]'' with [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]]. By the late 1920s, Day's career had eclipsed the career of her sister Alice, who also was a popular actress. The two would appear together onscreen again in the 1929 musical ''[[The Show of Shows]]''.\n\nShe married furrier Arthur J. Klein in 1930.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marceline Day to Wed Furrier|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/12/27/archives/marceline-day-to-wed-furrier.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=December 27, 1930}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Marceline Day Re-Wed.

By 1933, Day made the transition back to the Western genre, appearing in \"B\" [[Westerns]] starring [[Tim McCoy]], [[Hoot Gibson]], [[Ken Maynard]], Jack Hoxie, and [[John Wayne]]. Her last film was ''The Fighting Parson'' with Gibson. After her retirement, Day rarely spoke of her years as an actress and never spoke to reporters or granted interviews.\n\n==Death==\nOn February 16, 2000, Day was found dead in her [[Cathedral City, California]], home at the age of 91. She was cremated.<ref name=\"rp\">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Scott |title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed. |date=2016 |publisher=McFarland

Scenario B (X never exists)\n|-\n| (1) Presence of pain (Bad) || (3) Absence of pain (Good)\n|-\n| (2) Presence of pleasure (Good) || (4) Absence of pleasure (Not bad)\n|}\n\n==== Implications for procreation ====\nBenatar argues that bringing someone into existence generates both good and bad experiences, pain and pleasure, whereas not doing so generates neither pain nor pleasure. The absence of pain is good, the absence of pleasure is not bad. Therefore, the ethical choice is weighed in favor of non-procreation.\n\nBenatar raises four other related asymmetries that he considers quite plausible:\n# We have a moral obligation not to create unhappy people and we have no moral obligation to create happy people. The reason why we think there is a moral obligation not to create unhappy people is that the presence of this suffering would be bad (for the sufferers) and the absence of the suffering is good (even though there is nobody to enjoy the absence of suffering). By contrast, the reason we think there is no moral obligation to create happy people is that although their pleasure would be good for them, the absence of pleasure when they do not come into existence will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.\n# It is strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide to create them, and it is not strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide not to create them. That the child may be happy is not a morally important reason to create them. By contrast, that the child may be unhappy is an important moral reason not to create them. If it were the case that the absence of pleasure is bad even if someone does not exist to experience its absence, then we would have a significant moral reason to create a child and to create as many children as possible. And if it were not the case that the absence of pain is good even if someone does not exist to experience this good, then we would not have a significant moral reason not to create a child.\n# Someday we can regret for the sake of a person whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we created them \u2013 a person can be unhappy and the presence of their pain would be a bad thing. But we will never feel regret for the sake of a person whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we did not create them \u2013 a person will not be deprived of happiness, because he or she will never exist, and the absence of happiness will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.\n#We feel sadness by the fact that somewhere people come into existence and suffer, and we feel no sadness by the fact that somewhere people did not come into existence in a place where there are happy people.

Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 30-40.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Scenario A (X exists) !! Scenario B (X never exists)\n|-\n| (1) Presence of pain (Bad) || (3) Absence of pain (Good)\n|-\n| (2) Presence of pleasure (Good) || (4) Absence of pleasure (Not bad)\n|}\n\n==== Implications for procreation ====\nBenatar argues that bringing someone into existence generates both good and bad experiences, pain and pleasure, whereas not doing so generates neither pain nor pleasure. The absence of pain is good, the absence of pleasure is not bad. Therefore, the ethical choice is weighed in favor of non-procreation.\n\nBenatar raises four other related asymmetries that he considers quite plausible:\n# We have a moral obligation not to create unhappy people and we have no moral obligation to create happy people. The reason why we think there is a moral obligation not to create unhappy people is that the presence of this suffering would be bad (for the sufferers) and the absence of the suffering is good (even though there is nobody to enjoy the absence of suffering). By contrast, the reason we think there is no moral obligation to create happy people is that although their pleasure would be good for them, the absence of pleasure when they do not come into existence will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.\n# It is strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide to create them, and it is not strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide not to create them. That the child may be happy is not a morally important reason to create them. By contrast, that the child may be unhappy is an important moral reason not to create them. If it were the case that the absence of pleasure is bad even if someone does not exist to experience its absence, then we would have a significant moral reason to create a child and to create as many children as possible. And if it were not the case that the absence of pain is good even if someone does not exist to experience this good, then we would not have a significant moral reason not to create a child.\n# Someday we can regret for the sake of a person whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we created them \u2013 a person can be unhappy and the presence of their pain would be a bad thing. But we will never feel regret for the sake of a person whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we did not create them \u2013 a person will not be deprived of happiness, because he or she will never exist, and the absence of happiness will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.\n#We feel sadness by the fact that somewhere people come into existence and suffer, and we feel no sadness by the fact that somewhere people did not come into existence in a place where there are happy people. When we know that somewhere people came into existence and suffer, we feel compassion. The fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and suffer is good. This is because the absence of pain is good even when there is not someone who is experiencing this good. On the other hand, we do not feel sadness by the fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and are not happy. This is because the absence of pleasure is bad only when someone exists to be deprived of this good.<ref>D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 30-57.</ref>\n\n=== Humans' unreliable assessment of life's quality ===\n\nBenatar raises the issue of whether humans inaccurately estimate the true quality of their lives, and has cited three psychological phenomena which he believes are responsible for this: \n# [[Pollyanna principle|Tendency towards optimism]]: we have a positively distorted perspective of our lives in the past, present, and future.\n# Adaptation: we adapt to our circumstances, and if they worsen, our sense of well-being is lowered in anticipation of those harmful circumstances, according to our expectations, which are usually divorced from the reality of our circumstances. \n# Comparison: we judge our lives by comparing them to those of others, ignoring the negatives which affect everyone to focus on specific differences. And due to our optimism bias, we mostly compare ourselves to those worse off, to overestimate the value of our own well-being.\n\nHe concludes;\n{{quote|The above psychological phenomena are unsurprising from an evolutionary perspective.

He then moved to [[Hannover 96]] in the ''Regionalliga Nord'' (third German league). He made a big impression in a squad that featured stars-to-be [[Gerald Asamoah]] and [[Fabian Ernst]]. That team ripped through the season scoring more than 100 goals, but succumbed to [[Energie Cottbus]] in the 1997 promotion playoffs.\n\nIn 1998, Hannover finally promoted to the [[2.

The [[Commodity market|market value]] of the metal varies, depending on the [[Spot contract|spot price]] of [[silver]]. The 99.99% silver content makes the coin among the finest official bullion coins worldwide. The standard version has a weight of 1 [[troy ounce]] (31.10 grams).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mint.ca/store/content/bullionProductDetails.jsp?itemId=prod1630032&cat=Products&nId=7400002&parentnId=1300002&nodeGroup=About+the+Mint|title=Silver Maple Leaf Coin &#124; The Royal Canadian Mint|website=www.mint.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe Silver Maple Leaf's [[obverse and reverse]] display, respectively, the profile of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] and the [[National symbols of Canada|Canadian Maple Leaf]]. In 2014, new security features were introduced: radial lines and a micro-engraved laser mark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinnews.net/2013/12/06/2014-silver-maple-leaf-bullion-coins/|title=2014 Silver Maple Leaf Bullion Coins, New Security and Finish|website=CoinNews.net|date=2013-12-06 | access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==Information==\nThe Silver Maple Leaf is issued annually by the [[Government of Canada|Government]] of [[Canada]]. Introduced in 1988 by the [[Royal Canadian Mint]], there have been three subsequent standard editions  and several special editions.\n\nThe Silver Maple Leaf's [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] displays the profile of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. There have been three subsequent versions of the Queen's profile:\n\n* 1988&ndash;1989: Portrait by [[Arnold Machin]].\n* 1990&ndash;2003: Portrait by [[Dora de Pedery-Hunt|Dora de P\u00e9dery-Hunt]].\n* Since 2004: Portrait by [[Susanna Blunt]].\n\n[[File:Canadian Silver Maple Leaf coins and tubes.png|thumb|Three 25-coin tubes together with seven coins]]\nThe Silver Maple Leaf's [[obverse and reverse|reverse]] displays the [[National symbols of Canada|Canadian Maple Leaf]]. This design has remained unchanged since 1988. In 2014, however, new security features were introduced: radial lines and a micro-engraved laser mark. Also the obverse was affected by this.\n\nThe phrases <small>CANADA</small> and <small>FINE SILVER 1 OZ ARGENT PUR</small> are universal elements.\n\nGranted a [[face value]] of 5 [[Canadian dollar]]s, the Silver Maple Leaf has status as [[legal tender]]. It has also a [[Commodity market|market value]] that depends on the [[Spot contract|spot price]] of [[silver]] and that normally exceeds the nominal face value. With few exceptions and alike similar international bullion coins, the Silver Maple Leaf has a weight of 1 [[troy ounce]] (31.10 grams). The 99.99% silver content makes the coin among the finest official bullion coins worldwide.\n\nSamples of the Silver Maple Leaf often carry a blemish that has a milky-white appearance, called a milk spot. This happens when a cleaning detergent is left on the coin when it goes into the annealing furnace.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe Silver Maple Leaf was originally packaged in [[Mylar]]. Since 2009<!-- However some RCM \"Mylar\" sealed Maples have been seen on the market dated as far as 2012 -->, due to increasing demand, it is packaged in semi-transparent tubes with a yellow lid bearing the RCM logo. Some special editions have tubes with an orange, red, blue, dark blue or grey lid. Each tube contains 25 coins.<ref>''Canadian Coin News'' Volume 47, number 12, pagina 1. 20 September&ndash;12 October 2009.</ref> Furthermore, there exist boxes that contain 20 tubes each.\n\n===Mintage (all uncirculated bulk coins)===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!width=80|Mintage\n!Ref.\n!Year\n!width=80|Mintage\n!Ref.\n!Year\n!width=80|Mintage\n!Ref.\n|-\n|1988\n|align=\"right\"|1,155,931\n|<ref name=\"Mintage\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3872kkQ_swC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Essential Guide to Investing in Precious Metals, page 115|author=David L.

The Silver Maple Leaf (SML), a staple of pure silver bullion, was only produced in 1oz coins. It was only for the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the SML, that a reverse proof 10oz Silver Maple Leaf was struck. Unfortunately, due to price ($200, silver spot ~$6) and lack of interest, the planned 30,000 10oz SMLs were not sold out, and more than half were taken back for melting. Their cases were also recycled for one of the 2004 2oz bimetallic coins that the RCM issued. This is also the reason that some of the silver COAs will number above 14,000, though only around 13,000 of the coins survived.\n\nIn 1999, many Silver Maple Leaf coins were issued with a privy mark to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the [[RCM Maple Leaf Program]]. In the following year, the coins featured a privy mark with fireworks and the number 2000. Another Silver Maple Leaf version was issued to commemorate the millennium. The coins were double-dated 1999 and 2000.<ref name=charltonp434>''Charlton Standard of Canadian Coins'', 60th Edition, p.434, W.K. Cross, {{ISBN|0-88968-297-6}}</ref>\n\nSome of the privy-marked Silver Maple Leaf versions were available only in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In 2005, the Liberation of the Netherlands triple privy silver Maple Leaf&mdash;the rarest of all Silver Maple Leaf coins&mdash;was struck by the Royal Canadian Mint for the [[Royal Dutch Mint]]. The first coin produced by the facility, graded SP70 on the [[Sheldon scale]], was to be presented to [[Queen Beatrix]] of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2005, The Royal Canadian Mint issued The North America LEGACY of LIBERTY pure silver commemorative coin set, with two coins dated 2004 and two coin dated 2005. Also included in the set was the first poppy colourized quarter (2005), a Royal Canadian Legion symbol of remembrance, hope, and sacrifice. Three 1oz pure silver maple leaf coins with privy marks were made:  Victory Europe Day - May 8, 1945 (2005), Victory Japan Day - September 2, 1945 (2005) and D-Day - June 6th 1944 (2004), with only 4200 sets being minted.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nThere are also special edition R.C.M. coins called the 'Maple Leaf Forever' series, with there being three maple leaf symbols on the reverse. The mint has minted 100,000 of this design in 1/2 oz .9999 fine silver coins and 200 strikes of the same design in a large 60mm diameter .9999 fine gold coin. Many other Royal Canadian Mint coins feature maple leaf symbols, such as the $20 for $20 series, the 'Piedfort Maple' series, the 5 oz silver 25th anniversary coins, 1 oz silver 25th anniversary coins with gold guild clad (an identical coin is minted in 1 oz of .9995 fine platinum) and fractional 25th anniversary coins in silver and gold. There are also the 1&nbsp;kg $250 coins 2011\u20132015 with mintage numbers 999, 1200, 600, 600, 500 respectively.\n\n2 other series noted by argent pur signa include the SML edge lettering 20 coins which includes:\n\n2013 [[Bald eagle|Bald Eagle]]-  7,500\n\n- Bald Eagle #1 - Portrait of Power\n                                      \n- Bald Eagle #2 - Lifelong Mates\n                                           \n- Bald Eagle #3 - Deadly Predator\n                                       \n- Bald Eagle #4 - Mother Protecting  Baby Eaglets\n               \n2014 Bison Bull \u2013 Complete 7,500\n\n- Bison Bull  #1 - Buffalo Proof\n              \n- Bison Bull  #2 - Bull and His Mate\n           \n- Bison Bull  #3 - The Fight\n                \n- Bison Bull  #4 - Family At Rest\n               \n2014 White-Tailed Deer - 7,500\n\n- White-Tailed Deer #1 - Portrait of a 10-Point Buck\n                              \n- White-Tailed Deer #2 - Challenge for Power - Two Bucks Fighting\n     \n- White-Tailed Deer #3 - Mates Leaping Over a Fallen Pine Log\n          \n- White-Tailed Deer #4 - A Doe and Her Fawns\n\n2015 Sportfish of North America - 6500\n\n- Largemouth Bass Game Trophy Fish $20\n \t\t\t\t\n- Northern Pike Game Trophy Fish $20 Pure\n                                           \n- Walleye Game Trophy Fish $20 Pure Silver\n                                           \n- Rainbow Trout Trophy Fish $20 Pure Silver\n                                         \n2015-2016 Great Grizzly Bear -    6500\n \n- Canada 2015 Great Grizzly Bear #1 - The Catch\n                                    \n- Canada 2015 Great Grizzly Bear #2 - Togetherness\n                               \n- Canada 2015 Great Grizzly Bear #3 - Family\n                                       \n- Canada 2016 Great Grizzly Bear #4 - The Battle for Dominance\n\n2014 $20 The Seven Sacred Teachings: SML argent pur   mintage 7,000\n    \n-1- Love eagle\n                                                                         \n-2- Respect bison or buffalo\n                                                \n-3- Courage Grizzly bear\n                                                     \n-4- Honest Raven\n                                                                \n-5- Wisdom Beaver and Poplar Tree\n                                  \n-6- Humility Wolf\n                                                                 \n-7- Truth Turtle\n\n==Commemorative editions==\n\n===Anniversaries===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Description\n!Artist (reverse, obverse)\n!Mintage\n!Issue price\n!Comment\n|-\n|1998\n|10th Anniversary Silver Maple Leaf\n|[[RCM engravers]], [[Dora de Pedery-Hunt]]\n|align=\"right\"|13,533\n|$200.00\n|10-ounce coin, $50, reverse proof, COA made of sterling silver, in black leather-box\n|-\n|2003\n|15th Anniversary Silver Maple Leaf\n|RCM engravers\n|align=\"right\"|28,947\n|$149.95\n|5-coin set: 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/10, and 1/20 oz.

It is produced by the [[Royal Canadian Mint]].\n\nThe Silver Maple Leaf is [[legal tender]]. The [[face value]] is 5 [[Canadian dollar]]s. The [[Commodity market|market value]] of the metal varies, depending on the [[Spot contract|spot price]] of [[silver]]. The 99.99% silver content makes the coin among the finest official bullion coins worldwide. The standard version has a weight of 1 [[troy ounce]] (31.10 grams).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mint.ca/store/content/bullionProductDetails.jsp?itemId=prod1630032&cat=Products&nId=7400002&parentnId=1300002&nodeGroup=About+the+Mint|title=Silver Maple Leaf Coin &#124; The Royal Canadian Mint|website=www.mint.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe Silver Maple Leaf's [[obverse and reverse]] display, respectively, the profile of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] and the [[National symbols of Canada|Canadian Maple Leaf]]. In 2014, new security features were introduced: radial lines and a micro-engraved laser mark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinnews.net/2013/12/06/2014-silver-maple-leaf-bullion-coins/|title=2014 Silver Maple Leaf Bullion Coins, New Security and Finish|website=CoinNews.net|date=2013-12-06 | access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n==Information==\nThe Silver Maple Leaf is issued annually by the [[Government of Canada|Government]] of [[Canada]]. Introduced in 1988 by the [[Royal Canadian Mint]], there have been three subsequent standard editions  and several special editions.\n\nThe Silver Maple Leaf's [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] displays the profile of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. There have been three subsequent versions of the Queen's profile:\n\n* 1988&ndash;1989: Portrait by [[Arnold Machin]].\n* 1990&ndash;2003: Portrait by [[Dora de Pedery-Hunt|Dora de P\u00e9dery-Hunt]].\n* Since 2004: Portrait by [[Susanna Blunt]].\n\n[[File:Canadian Silver Maple Leaf coins and tubes.png|thumb|Three 25-coin tubes together with seven coins]]\nThe Silver Maple Leaf's [[obverse and reverse|reverse]] displays the [[National symbols of Canada|Canadian Maple Leaf]]. This design has remained unchanged since 1988. In 2014, however, new security features were introduced: radial lines and a micro-engraved laser mark. Also the obverse was affected by this.\n\nThe phrases <small>CANADA</small> and <small>FINE SILVER 1 OZ ARGENT PUR</small> are universal elements.\n\nGranted a [[face value]] of 5 [[Canadian dollar]]s, the Silver Maple Leaf has status as [[legal tender]]. It has also a [[Commodity market|market value]] that depends on the [[Spot contract|spot price]] of [[silver]] and that normally exceeds the nominal face value. With few exceptions and alike similar international bullion coins, the Silver Maple Leaf has a weight of 1 [[troy ounce]] (31.10 grams). The 99.99% silver content makes the coin among the finest official bullion coins worldwide.\n\nSamples of the Silver Maple Leaf often carry a blemish that has a milky-white appearance, called a milk spot. This happens when a cleaning detergent is left on the coin when it goes into the annealing furnace.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe Silver Maple Leaf was originally packaged in [[Mylar]]. Since 2009<!-- However some RCM \"Mylar\" sealed Maples have been seen on the market dated as far as 2012 -->, due to increasing demand, it is packaged in semi-transparent tubes with a yellow lid bearing the RCM logo. Some special editions have tubes with an orange, red, blue, dark blue or grey lid. Each tube contains 25 coins.<ref>''Canadian Coin News'' Volume 47, number 12, pagina 1. 20 September&ndash;12 October 2009.</ref> Furthermore, there exist boxes that contain 20 tubes each.\n\n===Mintage (all uncirculated bulk coins)===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!width=80|Mintage\n!Ref.\n!Year\n!width=80|Mintage\n!Ref.\n!Year\n!width=80|Mintage\n!Ref.\n|-\n|1988\n|align=\"right\"|1,155,931\n|<ref name=\"Mintage\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3872kkQ_swC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Essential Guide to Investing in Precious Metals, page 115|author=David L.

The Silver Maple Leaf (SML), a staple of pure silver bullion, was only produced in 1oz coins. It was only for the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the SML, that a reverse proof 10oz Silver Maple Leaf was struck. Unfortunately, due to price ($200, silver spot ~$6) and lack of interest, the planned 30,000 10oz SMLs were not sold out, and more than half were taken back for melting. Their cases were also recycled for one of the 2004 2oz bimetallic coins that the RCM issued. This is also the reason that some of the silver COAs will number above 14,000, though only around 13,000 of the coins survived.\n\nIn 1999, many Silver Maple Leaf coins were issued with a privy mark to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the [[RCM Maple Leaf Program]]. In the following year, the coins featured a privy mark with fireworks and the number 2000. Another Silver Maple Leaf version was issued to commemorate the millennium. The coins were double-dated 1999 and 2000.<ref name=charltonp434>''Charlton Standard of Canadian Coins'', 60th Edition, p.434, W.K. Cross, {{ISBN|0-88968-297-6}}</ref>\n\nSome of the privy-marked Silver Maple Leaf versions were available only in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In 2005, the Liberation of the Netherlands triple privy silver Maple Leaf&mdash;the rarest of all Silver Maple Leaf coins&mdash;was struck by the Royal Canadian Mint for the [[Royal Dutch Mint]]. The first coin produced by the facility, graded SP70 on the [[Sheldon scale]], was to be presented to [[Queen Beatrix]] of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2005, The Royal Canadian Mint issued The North America LEGACY of LIBERTY pure silver commemorative coin set, with two coins dated 2004 and two coin dated 2005. Also included in the set was the first poppy colourized quarter (2005), a Royal Canadian Legion symbol of remembrance, hope, and sacrifice. Three 1oz pure silver maple leaf coins with privy marks were made:  Victory Europe Day - May 8, 1945 (2005), Victory Japan Day - September 2, 1945 (2005) and D-Day - June 6th 1944 (2004), with only 4200 sets being minted.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nThere are also special edition R.C.M. coins called the 'Maple Leaf Forever' series, with there being three maple leaf symbols on the reverse. The mint has minted 100,000 of this design in 1/2 oz .9999 fine silver coins and 200 strikes of the same design in a large 60mm diameter .9999 fine gold coin.

The centre is located on the estuary of [[Avil\u00e9s]], [[Asturias]] in northwest Spain. It was inaugurated on 26 March 2011.\n\nIts imposing size and its white, red and yellow exterior make it a highly visible landmark on the town's landscape.\n\n==Oscar Niemeyer: The origins and the design==\n[[File:CentroNiemeyer80.jpg|thumb|Auditorium]]\n[[File:Centro Niemeyer Spain.jpg|thumb|Logo based on two of the main colours of Oscar Niemeyer's works]]\n[[File:CentroNiemeyer92.jpg|thumb|\"An open square to humankind...\"]]\n[[Oscar Niemeyer]], from [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, one of the most influential modernist architects in the world,<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/influential-modernist-architect-oscar-niemeyer-dies-aged-104-8388933.html Influential modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer dies aged 104].

This was the beginning of the relationship between Niemeyer and the Principality region of Asturias. Years later, as a present for the 25th anniversary of the Awards, Niemeyer donated a project to the principality. His design has become a project meant to be an international reference in the cultural field. It is dedicated to education, culture and, peace.<ref>[http://www.niemeyercenter.org/programa_eventos_info.php Information]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> The centre is the first work by Niemeyer in Spain, and he had said he believes it is his most important in Europe,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2007/04/05/cultura/2107112.html |title=Note in \"El Mundo\" |publisher=Elmundo.es |date=}}</ref> which is the reason for its name - Centro Niemeyer.\n\n===Structure===\nThe Niemeyer Centre is formed by five main elements that complement each other:<ref>[http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/wody-allen/preestreno/el-sueno-de-casandra/aviles/dn_49481.htm Description and Woody Allen]</ref>\n* '''The open square''' is a large open outdoor space for cultural activities that reflects Niemeyer's idea of a place open to humankind.\n* '''The auditorium''' contains approximately 1000 seats for concerts, theatre, and conferences. It is unusual in that its seating does not distinguish between social classes. It includes the Club, a small space for concerts, and an exhibition room in the foyer.\n* '''The dome''' is the exhibition building.\n* '''The tower''' is for sight-seeing and includes a restaurant and cocktail lounge.\n* '''The multi-purpose building''' contains the film centre, meeting-rooms, cafe, shop, and information kiosk.\n[[File:Aviles - Centro Cultural Internacional Oscar Niemeyer 67.jpg|thumb|Multipurpose building]]\n[[File:CentroNiemeyer70.jpg|thumb|Tower]]\n[[File:CentroNiemeyer61.jpg|thumb|''La grapa'']]\n[[File:R\u00eda de Avil\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|Avil\u00e9s estuary quay]]\n\n{{wide image|CentroNiemeyer1.jpg|1000px|Niemeyer Centre Panorama}}\n\n===Style and colours===\nThe main feature in Niemeyer's work are the building's curves.

Then the multipurpose building and the Auditorium were constructed. The materials used were mainly concrete and glass. Also during this time the base of the Tower was started, but it was not until the structures of other buildings were almost finished that the work on the Tower was visible. An underground car park was added.\nThe Open Square was covered in white concrete. The sides of the Auditorium were painted yellow, creating a contrast with the dominant white colour on the rest of the buildings. On one of the sides of the auditorium, a ceramic art work, designed by Niemeyer, represents the outline of a woman resting. The stage door was painted red. This door can be open to the square, so that shows can take part inside or outside the building.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe inauguration ceremony took place in March 2011 with a video speech by Niemeyer and a jazz concert with [[Woody Allen]] in front of an audience of more than 10,000 people.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/03/26/cultura/1301097031.html ''El clarinete de Woody Allen apadrina el Niemeyer'' Elmundo.es, 26 March 2011]</ref>\n[[File:Paseo de la r\u00eda 2.JPG|thumb|Avil\u00e9s Estuary]]\n[[File:Oscar Niemeyer Cultural Center Avil\u00e9s.JPG|thumb|right]]\n\n==='Niemeyer effect': impact in the post-industrial town===\nApart from its cultural purposes, the Centre has an important environmental element. It is the center of a large scale urban regeneration process that will change the town's whole waterfront. It is located on an island created in the [[Avil\u00e9s]] estuary, not far from the industrial area. This has helped in the regeneration process of the area.\n\nThe authorities are now planning many changes there, such as eliminating heavy traffic from the port area (where the center is located) and creating sporting and recreation areas. Also new building projects are being planned - a reflection of the Niemeyer Centre effect.

It includes the Club, a small space for concerts, and an exhibition room in the foyer.\n* '''The dome''' is the exhibition building.\n* '''The tower''' is for sight-seeing and includes a restaurant and cocktail lounge.\n* '''The multi-purpose building''' contains the film centre, meeting-rooms, cafe, shop, and information kiosk.\n[[File:Aviles - Centro Cultural Internacional Oscar Niemeyer 67.jpg|thumb|Multipurpose building]]\n[[File:CentroNiemeyer70.jpg|thumb|Tower]]\n[[File:CentroNiemeyer61.jpg|thumb|''La grapa'']]\n[[File:R\u00eda de Avil\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|Avil\u00e9s estuary quay]]\n\n{{wide image|CentroNiemeyer1.jpg|1000px|Niemeyer Centre Panorama}}\n\n===Style and colours===\nThe main feature in Niemeyer's work are the building's curves.

An underground car park was added.\nThe Open Square was covered in white concrete. The sides of the Auditorium were painted yellow, creating a contrast with the dominant white colour on the rest of the buildings. On one of the sides of the auditorium, a ceramic art work, designed by Niemeyer, represents the outline of a woman resting. The stage door was painted red. This door can be open to the square, so that shows can take part inside or outside the building.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe inauguration ceremony took place in March 2011 with a video speech by Niemeyer and a jazz concert with [[Woody Allen]] in front of an audience of more than 10,000 people.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/03/26/cultura/1301097031.html ''El clarinete de Woody Allen apadrina el Niemeyer'' Elmundo.es, 26 March 2011]</ref>\n[[File:Paseo de la r\u00eda 2.JPG|thumb|Avil\u00e9s Estuary]]\n[[File:Oscar Niemeyer Cultural Center Avil\u00e9s.JPG|thumb|right]]\n\n==='Niemeyer effect': impact in the post-industrial town===\nApart from its cultural purposes, the Centre has an important environmental element.
