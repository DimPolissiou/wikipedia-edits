He is a bookkeeper, she a bored housewife. However, their tedium-filled lives are drastically changed by the war. He enlists in the [[Royal Navy]], while she joins the [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wrens]]. During the three years the couple are apart (their shore leaves never coincide), they are transformed, each becoming much more self-confident.  \n\nCathy's assertive new friend, Dizzy Clayton, helps her break out of her shell. She begins going out with Dizzy's cousin, naval architect Richard, who falls in love with her. However, she remains faithful (if unenthusiastically) to her husband.\n\nMeanwhile, Robert toughens up on sea duty and in time becomes a [[petty officer]]. His hands are badly burned when his ship is sunk, but he stoically rows in the [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] for five days without complaint. He recuperates in a hospital, tended by Elena, a beautiful nurse. On the last night of his stay, he asks her out to dinner. He is attracted to her, but she informs him that she lost her beloved husband only six months earlier, kisses him, and leaves.\n\nRobert and Cathy both receive ten-day leaves, but each dreads being reunited with the dowdy spouse each remembers and being forced back into the dreary life they shared. \n\nCathy cannot bring herself to return to her flat, where Robert is waiting. Instead, she phones Robert and asks him to talk with her on more neutral ground, blurting out that she wants to leave him. He is furious. They meet on the street, in the pitch dark of the blackout.  Robert readily agrees to a divorce, to her surprise, telling her that he was going to ask her for one. They go to the neighbourhood [[pub]] to discuss the divorce and for the first time in three years they each get a good look at the transformation in the other. \n\nThroughout the film, they have been talking to their new friends about their life together, and now they revisit those issues and talk honestly to each other about the past.  They find that if they are \"perfect strangers\" now, they did not know each other very well before. For Cathy, the hated view from their flat, all walls and smoking chimneys, is a symbol of their lives before the war. They dance with each other, for the first time, and are clearly attracted. Dizzy and Robert's friend 'Scotty' meet them in the pub. Both are stunned. Dizzy thinks Cathy is crazy. Scotty calls Cathy a pin-up, but the compliment goes wrong when he shares\u2014at some length\u2014Robert's unflattering descriptions of the 'old' Cathy. She is insulted and furious. It hardens her heart and she walks out as the pub closes. Outside, waiting in vain for a taxi in the bombed-out intersection, the argument continues\u2014they even fight over where the shops were located. In the end, Scotty goes to his billet, leaving Robert on the street, thinking (in a voiceover). The girls go to the flat, where Cathy wistfully tells Dizzy about how she and Robert met. Robert returns to retrieve his gear and finds Cathy sitting in the window. The sky is bright with early morning light, and beyond the shattered houses, the vista toward the river and beyond is broken only by a church steeple.  The high walls are gone.\n\n\u201cYou've certainly got the view you always wanted.\u201d Robert says. \n\n\u201cMiles and miles of it,\u201d Cathy replies. \u201cBut oh Robert, the desolation.\u201d  \n\n\u201cPoor old London.,\u201d he says. \u201cWell,  we'll just have to build it up again.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt will take years and years.\u201d she says. \n\n\u201cBut what of that Cathy,\u201d he answers, smiling. \u201cWe're young.\u201d \n\nThey embrace, passionately.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- This is the correct order of billing, not what's in IMDb.

He is a bookkeeper, she a bored housewife. However, their tedium-filled lives are drastically changed by the war. He enlists in the [[Royal Navy]], while she joins the [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wrens]]. During the three years the couple are apart (their shore leaves never coincide), they are transformed, each becoming much more self-confident.  \n\nCathy's assertive new friend, Dizzy Clayton, helps her break out of her shell. She begins going out with Dizzy's cousin, naval architect Richard, who falls in love with her. However, she remains faithful (if unenthusiastically) to her husband.\n\nMeanwhile, Robert toughens up on sea duty and in time becomes a [[petty officer]]. His hands are badly burned when his ship is sunk, but he stoically rows in the [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] for five days without complaint. He recuperates in a hospital, tended by Elena, a beautiful nurse. On the last night of his stay, he asks her out to dinner. He is attracted to her, but she informs him that she lost her beloved husband only six months earlier, kisses him, and leaves.\n\nRobert and Cathy both receive ten-day leaves, but each dreads being reunited with the dowdy spouse each remembers and being forced back into the dreary life they shared. \n\nCathy cannot bring herself to return to her flat, where Robert is waiting. Instead, she phones Robert and asks him to talk with her on more neutral ground, blurting out that she wants to leave him. He is furious. They meet on the street, in the pitch dark of the blackout.  Robert readily agrees to a divorce, to her surprise, telling her that he was going to ask her for one. They go to the neighbourhood [[pub]] to discuss the divorce and for the first time in three years they each get a good look at the transformation in the other. \n\nThroughout the film, they have been talking to their new friends about their life together, and now they revisit those issues and talk honestly to each other about the past.

Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature [[gradient]] causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.\n\nThis effect can be used to generate electricity, measure temperature or change the temperature of objects. Because the direction of heating and cooling is determined by the polarity of the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.\n\nThe term \"thermoelectric effect\" encompasses three separately identified effects: the '''Seebeck effect''', '''Peltier effect''', and '''Thomson effect'''. The Seebeck and Peltier effects are different manifestations of the same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the '''Peltier\u2013Seebeck effect''' (the separation derives from the independent discoveries by French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]] and [[Baltic German]] physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]]). The Thomson effect is an extension of the Peltier\u2013Seebeck model and is credited to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]].\n\n[[Joule heating]], the heat that is generated whenever a current is passed through a resistive material, is not generally termed a thermoelectric effect.

An iron rod was bent into a bow and one end was heated in boiling water.

This was because the electron energy levels shifted differently in the different metals, creating a [[potential difference]] between the junctions which in turn created an electrical current through the wires, and therefore a [[magnetic field]] around the wires. Seebeck did not recognize that an electric current was involved, so he called the phenomenon \"thermomagnetic effect\".

The local [[current density]] is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf J = \\sigma (-\\nabla V + \\mathbf E_\\text{emf}),</math>\n\nwhere <math>V</math> is the local [[voltage]],<ref>The voltage in this case does not refer to electric potential but rather the \"voltmeter\" voltage <math>V = -\\mu/e</math>, where <math>\\mu</math> is the [[Fermi level]].</ref> and <math>\\sigma</math> is the local [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]]. In general, the Seebeck effect is described locally by the creation of an electromotive field\n\n:<math>\\mathbf E_\\text{emf} = -S \\nabla T,</math>\n\nwhere <math>S</math> is the [[Seebeck coefficient]] (also known as thermopower), a property of the local material, and  <math>\\nabla T</math> is the temperature gradient.\n\nThe Seebeck coefficients generally vary as function of temperature and depend strongly on the composition of the conductor. For ordinary materials at room temperature, the Seebeck coefficient may range in value from \u2212100&nbsp;\u03bcV/K to +1,000&nbsp;\u03bcV/K (see [[Seebeck coefficient]] article for more information).\n\nIf the system reaches a steady state, where <math>\\mathbf J = 0</math>, then the voltage gradient is given simply by the emf: <math>\\Delta V = S \\Delta T</math>. This simple relationship, which does not depend on conductivity, is used in the [[thermocouple]] to measure a temperature difference; an absolute temperature may be found by performing the voltage measurement at a known reference temperature. A metal of unknown composition can be classified by its thermoelectric effect if a metallic probe of known composition is kept at a constant temperature and held in contact with the unknown sample that is locally heated to the probe temperature. It is used commercially to identify metal alloys. Thermocouples in series form a [[thermopile]].

This is known as the Peltier Effect. The '''Peltier effect''' is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors and is named after French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]], who discovered it in 1834.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peltier|title=Nouvelles exp\u00e9riences sur la caloricit\u00e9 des courants \u00e9lectrique|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1834|volume=56|pages=371\u2013386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jc5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA371#v=onepage&q&f=false|trans-title=New experiments on the heat effects of electric currents|language=French}}</ref> When a current is made to flow through a junction between two conductors, A and B, heat may be generated or removed at the junction. The Peltier heat generated at the junction per unit time is\n\n:<math>\\dot{Q} = (\\Pi_\\text{A} - \\Pi_\\text{B}) I,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Pi_\\text{A}</math> and <math>\\Pi_\\text{B}</math> are the Peltier coefficients of conductors A and B, and <math>I</math> is the electric current (from A to B). The total heat generated is not determined by the Peltier effect alone, as it may also be influenced by Joule heating and thermal-gradient effects (see below).\n\nThe Peltier coefficients represent how much heat is carried per unit charge. Since charge current must be continuous across a junction, the associated heat flow will develop a discontinuity if <math>\\Pi_\\text{A}</math> and <math>\\Pi_\\text{B}</math> are different. The Peltier effect can be considered as the back-action counterpart to the Seebeck effect (analogous to the [[Counter-electromotive force|back-EMF]] in magnetic induction): if a simple thermoelectric circuit is closed, then the Seebeck effect will drive a current, which in turn (by the Peltier effect) will always transfer heat from the hot to the cold junction. The close relationship between Peltier and Seebeck effects can be seen in the direct connection between their coefficients: <math>\\Pi = T S</math> (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]).\n\nA typical Peltier [[heat pump]] involves multiple junctions in series, through which a current is driven. Some of the junctions lose heat due to the Peltier effect, while others gain heat. Thermoelectric heat pumps exploit this phenomenon, as do [[thermoelectric cooling]] devices found in refrigerators.\n\n== Thomson effect ==\nIn different materials, the Seebeck coefficient is not constant in temperature, and so a spatial gradient in temperature can result in a gradient in the Seebeck coefficient. If a current is driven through this gradient, then a continuous version of the Peltier effect will occur. This '''Thomson effect''' was predicted and later observed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (William Thomson).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|title=On a mechanical theory of thermo-electric currents|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1851|volume=3|issue=42|pages=91\u201398|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/19876#page/111/mode/1up}}</ref>  It describes the heating or cooling of a current-carrying conductor with a temperature gradient.\n\nIf a current density <math>\\mathbf J</math> is passed through a homogeneous conductor, the Thomson effect predicts a heat production rate per unit volume\n\n:<math>\\dot q = -\\mathcal K \\mathbf J \\cdot \\nabla T,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nabla T</math> is the temperature gradient, and <math>\\mathcal K</math> is the Thomson coefficient.

The Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect can be gathered together in a consistent and rigorous way, described here; this also includes the effects of [[Joule heating]] and ordinary heat conduction.

It was not satisfactorily proven until the advent of the [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager relations]], and it is worth noting that this second Thomson relation is only guaranteed for a time-reversal symmetric material; if the material is placed in a magnetic field or is itself magnetically ordered ([[ferromagnetic]], [[antiferromagnetic]], etc.), then the second Thomson relation does not take the simple form shown here.<ref>There is a generalized second Thomson relation relating anisotropic Peltier and Seebeck coefficients with reversed magnetic field and magnetic order.

The Peltier and Seebeck coefficients can only be easily determined for pairs of materials; hence, it is difficult to find values of absolute Seebeck or Peltier coefficients for an individual material.\n\nIf the Thomson coefficient of a material is measured over a wide temperature range, it can be integrated using the Thomson relations to determine the absolute values for the Peltier and Seebeck coefficients. This needs to be done only for one material, since the other values can be determined by measuring pairwise Seebeck coefficients in thermocouples containing the reference material and then adding back the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the reference material.

Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature [[gradient]] causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.\n\nThis effect can be used to generate electricity, measure temperature or change the temperature of objects. Because the direction of heating and cooling is determined by the polarity of the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.\n\nThe term \"thermoelectric effect\" encompasses three separately identified effects: the '''Seebeck effect''', '''Peltier effect''', and '''Thomson effect'''. The Seebeck and Peltier effects are different manifestations of the same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the '''Peltier\u2013Seebeck effect''' (the separation derives from the independent discoveries by French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]] and [[Baltic German]] physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]]). The Thomson effect is an extension of the Peltier\u2013Seebeck model and is credited to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]].\n\n[[Joule heating]], the heat that is generated whenever a current is passed through a resistive material, is not generally termed a thermoelectric effect.

For ordinary materials at room temperature, the Seebeck coefficient may range in value from \u2212100&nbsp;\u03bcV/K to +1,000&nbsp;\u03bcV/K (see [[Seebeck coefficient]] article for more information).\n\nIf the system reaches a steady state, where <math>\\mathbf J = 0</math>, then the voltage gradient is given simply by the emf: <math>\\Delta V = S \\Delta T</math>. This simple relationship, which does not depend on conductivity, is used in the [[thermocouple]] to measure a temperature difference; an absolute temperature may be found by performing the voltage measurement at a known reference temperature. A metal of unknown composition can be classified by its thermoelectric effect if a metallic probe of known composition is kept at a constant temperature and held in contact with the unknown sample that is locally heated to the probe temperature. It is used commercially to identify metal alloys. Thermocouples in series form a [[thermopile]].

This is known as Peltier Effect. The '''Peltier effect''' is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors and is named after French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]], who discovered it in 1834.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peltier|title=Nouvelles exp\u00e9riences sur la caloricit\u00e9 des courants \u00e9lectrique|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1834|volume=56|pages=371\u2013386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jc5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA371#v=onepage&q&f=false|trans-title=New experiments on the heat effects of electric currents|language=French}}</ref> When a current is made to flow through a junction between two conductors, A and B, heat may be generated or removed at the junction. The Peltier heat generated at the junction per unit time is\n\n:<math>\\dot{Q} = (\\Pi_\\text{A} - \\Pi_\\text{B}) I,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Pi_\\text{A}</math> and <math>\\Pi_\\text{B}</math> are the Peltier coefficients of conductors A and B, and <math>I</math> is the electric current (from A to B). The total heat generated is not determined by the Peltier effect alone, as it may also be influenced by Joule heating and thermal-gradient effects (see below).\n\nThe Peltier coefficients represent how much heat is carried per unit charge. Since charge current must be continuous across a junction, the associated heat flow will develop a discontinuity if <math>\\Pi_\\text{A}</math> and <math>\\Pi_\\text{B}</math> are different. The Peltier effect can be considered as the back-action counterpart to the Seebeck effect (analogous to the [[Counter-electromotive force|back-EMF]] in magnetic induction): if a simple thermoelectric circuit is closed, then the Seebeck effect will drive a current, which in turn (by the Peltier effect) will always transfer heat from the hot to the cold junction. The close relationship between Peltier and Seebeck effects can be seen in the direct connection between their coefficients: <math>\\Pi = T S</math> (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]).\n\nA typical Peltier [[heat pump]] involves multiple junctions in series, through which a current is driven. Some of the junctions lose heat due to the Peltier effect, while others gain heat. Thermoelectric heat pumps exploit this phenomenon, as do [[thermoelectric cooling]] devices found in refrigerators.\n\n== Thomson effect ==\nIn different materials, the Seebeck coefficient is not constant in temperature, and so a spatial gradient in temperature can result in a gradient in the Seebeck coefficient. If a current is driven through this gradient, then a continuous version of the Peltier effect will occur.

The Thomson coefficient is related to the Seebeck coefficient as <math>\\mathcal K = T \\tfrac{dS}{dT}</math> (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]). This equation, however, neglects Joule heating and ordinary thermal conductivity (see full equations below).\n\n== Full thermoelectric equations ==\n\n{{see also|Heat transfer physics#Electron}}\n\nOften, more than one of the above effects is involved in the operation of a real thermoelectric device. The Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect can be gathered together in a consistent and rigorous way, described here; this also includes the effects of [[Joule heating]] and ordinary heat conduction. As stated above, the Seebeck effect generates an electromotive force, leading to the current equation<ref name=\"fsu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/quantum/style_a/nt_pelt.html |title=A.11 Thermoelectric effects |publisher=Eng.fsu.edu |date=2002-02-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf J = \\sigma (-\\boldsymbol \\nabla V - S \\nabla T).</math>\n\nTo describe the Peltier and Thomson effects, we must consider the flow of energy. If temperature and charge change with time, the full thermoelectric equation for the energy accumulation, <math>\\dot e</math>, is<ref name=\"fsu\"/>\n\n:<math>\\dot e = \\nabla \\cdot (\\kappa \\nabla T) - \\nabla \\cdot (V + \\Pi) \\mathbf J + \\dot q_\\text{ext},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\kappa</math> is the [[thermal conductivity]]. The first term is the [[Thermal conduction#Fourier's law|Fourier's heat conduction law]], and the second term shows the energy carried by currents. The third term, <math>\\dot q_\\text{ext}</math>, is the heat added from an external source (if applicable).\n\nIf the material has reached a steady state, the charge and temperature distributions are stable, so <math>\\dot e = 0</math> and <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf J = 0</math>. Using these facts and the second Thomson relation (see below), the heat equation can be simplified to\n\n:<math>-\\dot q_\\text{ext} = \\nabla \\cdot (\\kappa \\nabla T) + \\mathbf J \\cdot \\left(\\sigma^{-1} \\mathbf J\\right) - T \\mathbf J \\cdot \\nabla S.</math>\n\nThe middle term is the Joule heating, and the last term includes both Peltier (<math>\\nabla S</math> at junction) and Thomson (<math>\\nabla S</math> in thermal gradient) effects. Combined with the Seebeck equation for <math>\\mathbf J</math>, this can be used to solve for the steady-state voltage and temperature profiles in a complicated system.\n\nIf the material is not in a steady state, a complete description needs to include dynamic effects such as relating to electrical [[capacitance]], [[inductance]] and [[heat capacity]].\n\n==Thomson relations==\n\n{{see also|Onsager reciprocal relations|Heat transfer physics#Electron}}\n\nIn 1854, Lord Kelvin found relationships between the three coefficients, implying that the Thomson, Peltier, and Seebeck effects are different manifestations of one effect (uniquely characterized by the Seebeck coefficient).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|title=On the dynamical theory of heat. Part V. Thermo-electric currents|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1854|volume=21|pages=123\u2013171|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/126375#page/147/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\nThe first Thomson relation is<ref name=\"fsu\"/>\n\n:<math>\\mathcal K \\equiv \\frac{d\\Pi}{dT} - S,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T</math> is the absolute temperature, <math>\\mathcal K</math> is the Thomson coefficient, <math>\\Pi</math> is the Peltier coefficient, and <math>S</math> is the Seebeck coefficient. This relationship is easily shown given that the Thomson effect is a continuous version of the Peltier effect. Using the second relation (described next), the first Thomson relation becomes <math>\\mathcal K = T \\tfrac{dS}{dT}</math>.\n\nThe second Thomson relation is\n\n:<math>\\Pi = TS.</math>\n\nThis relation expresses a subtle and fundamental connection between the Peltier and Seebeck effects. It was not satisfactorily proven until the advent of the [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager relations]], and it is worth noting that this second Thomson relation is only guaranteed for a time-reversal symmetric material; if the material is placed in a magnetic field or is itself magnetically ordered ([[ferromagnetic]], [[antiferromagnetic]], etc.), then the second Thomson relation does not take the simple form shown here.<ref>There is a generalized second Thomson relation relating anisotropic Peltier and Seebeck coefficients with reversed magnetic field and magnetic order. See, for example, {{cite book| isbn = 9781420038903| title = Thermoelectrics Handbook: Macro to Nano| editor1-last = Rowe| editor1-first= D. M. | date = 2010 | publisher = [[CRC Press]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Thomson coefficient is unique among the three main thermoelectric coefficients because it is the only one directly measurable for individual materials. The Peltier and Seebeck coefficients can only be easily determined for pairs of materials; hence, it is difficult to find values of absolute Seebeck or Peltier coefficients for an individual material.\n\nIf the Thomson coefficient of a material is measured over a wide temperature range, it can be integrated using the Thomson relations to determine the absolute values for the Peltier and Seebeck coefficients. This needs to be done only for one material, since the other values can be determined by measuring pairwise Seebeck coefficients in thermocouples containing the reference material and then adding back the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the reference material. For more details on absolute Seebeck coefficient determination, see [[Seebeck coefficient]].\n\n==Applications==\n{{see also|Thermoelectric materials}}\n\n===Thermoelectric generators===\n{{main|Thermoelectric generator}}\n\nThe Seebeck effect is used in thermoelectric generators, which function like [[heat engine]]s, but are less bulky, have no moving parts, and are typically more expensive and less efficient. They have a use in power plants for converting [[waste heat]] into additional electrical power (a form of [[energy recycling]]) and in automobiles as [[automotive thermoelectric generator]]s (ATGs) for increasing [[fuel efficiency]]. Space probes often use [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s with the same mechanism but using radioisotopes to generate the required heat difference. Recent uses include stove fans,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stovefanreviews.com/teg-module-and-seebeck-effect/|title=TEG Module and Seebeck Effect|website=StoveFanReviews.com}}</ref> lighting powered by body heat<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/lumen-flashlight/39893/|title=Powered by body heat, Lumen flashlight never needs batteries|first=Stanley|last=Goodner|website=Gizmag|date=October 16, 2015}}</ref> and a smartwatch powered by body heat.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602874/body-heat-powers-this-smart-watch |title=Body Heat Powers This Smart Watch; The Matrix PowerWatch is a FitBit competitor that exploits the temperature difference between your skin and the air for power. |author=Signe Brewster |date=November 16, 2016 |website=[[MIT Technology Review]] |access-date= 7 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Peltier effect ===\n{{Main|Thermoelectric cooling}}\nThe Peltier effect can be used to create a [[refrigerator]] that is compact and has no circulating fluid or moving parts. Such refrigerators are useful in applications where their advantages outweigh the disadvantage of their very low efficiency. The Peltier effect is also used by many [[thermal cyclers]], laboratory devices used to amplify DNA by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). PCR requires the cyclic heating and cooling of samples to specified temperatures. The inclusion of many thermocouples in a small space enables many samples to be amplified in parallel.\n\n===Temperature measurement===\n{{Main|Thermocouple}}\n[[Thermocouple]]s and [[thermopile]]s are devices that use the Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two objects.\nThermocouples are often used to measure high temperatures, holding the temperature of one junction constant or measuring it independently ([[thermocouple|cold junction compensation]]). Thermopiles use many thermocouples electrically connected in series, for sensitive measurements of very small temperature difference.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Nernst effect]] \u2013 a thermoelectric phenomenon when a sample allowing electrical conduction in a magnetic field and a temperature gradient normal (perpendicular) to each other\n* [[Ettingshausen effect]] \u2013 thermoelectric phenomenon affecting current in a conductor in a magnetic field\n* [[Pyroelectricity]] \u2013 the creation of an electric polarization in a crystal after heating/cooling, an effect distinct from thermoelectricity\n* [[Thermogalvanic cell]] - the production of electrical power from a galvanic cell with electrodes at different temperatures\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | title=Thermoelectrics Handbook:Macro to Nano|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|date=2006|isbn=0-8493-2264-2|editor=Rowe, D.

When combined with other Russian forces in the area, the Russian attacking force would form a formidable army of some 42,000 men.  The initial Russian assault was to be received by the British Second Division dug in on Home Hill with only 2,700 men and 12 guns.  Both Russian columns moved in a flanking fashion east towards the British. They hoped to overwhelm this portion of the Allied army before reinforcements could arrive.  The fog of the early morning hours aided the Russians by hiding their approach.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'', p. 258.</ref> Not all the Russian troops could fit on the narrow 300-meter-wide heights of Shell Hill.<ref name=\"Orlando Figes p. 257\"/> Accordingly, General Soymonov had followed Prince [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]]'s directive and deployed some of his force around the Careenage Ravine.  Furthermore, on the night before the attack, Soymonov was ordered by General [[Peter Andreivich Dannenberg|Peter A.

The British had strong pickets and had ample warning of the Russian attack despite the early morning fog. The pickets, some of them at company strength, engaged the Russians as they moved to attack. The firing in the valley also gave warning to the rest of the Second Division, who rushed to their defensive positions. [[De Lacy Evans]], commander of the British Second Division, had been injured in a fall from his horse so command of the Second Division was taken up by [[John Lysaght Pennefather|Major-General John Pennefather]], a highly aggressive officer. Pennefather did not know that he was facing a superior Russian force. Thus he abandoned Evans' plan of falling back to draw the Russians within range of the British field artillery which was hidden behind Home Hill.<ref name=\"Orlando Figes p. 259\"/>  Instead, Pennefather ordered his 2,700 strong division to attack. When they did so, the Second Division faced some 15,300 Russian soldiers.  Russian guns bombarded Home Hill, but there were no troops on the crest at this point.\n\n===The Second Division in action; the Russians in the valley===\n[[File:Battle of Inkerman map.jpg|thumb|left|A British map of the positions of the forces after the initial assault]]\nThe Russian infantry, advancing through the fog, were met by the advancing Second Division, who opened fire with their [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]] rifles, whereas the Russians were still armed with [[smoothbore]] [[musket]]s.<ref>Myatt, F. (1979): The illustrated encyclopedia of 19th century firearms.

Eventually, the Russian infantry were pushed all the way back to their own artillery positions. The Russians launched a second attack, also on the Second Division's left flank, but this time in much larger numbers and led by Soymonov himself.  Captain Hugh Rowlands, in charge of the British pickets, reported that the Russians charged \"with the most fiendish yells you can imagine.\"<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'', p. 259</ref> At this point, after the second attack, the British position was incredibly weak. If Soymonov had known the condition of the British, he would have ordered a third attack before the British reinforcements arrived.<ref name=\"Orlando Figes p. 260\"/> Such a third attack might well have succeeded, but Soymonov could not see in the fog and thus did not know of the desperate situation of the British. Instead, he awaited the arrival of his own reinforcements\u2014General Pavlov's men who were making their way toward the Inkerman battlefield in four different prong attacks from the north.<ref>See the map on page XXX of Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War''.</ref> However, the British reinforcements arrived in the form of the Light Division which came up and immediately launched a counterattack along the left flank of the Russian front, forcing the Russians back. During this fighting Soymonov was killed by a British rifleman.<ref name=\"Orlando Figes p. 260\"/>  Russian command was immediately taken up by Colonel Pristovoitov, who was himself shot a few minutes later. Colonel Uvazhnov-Aleksandrov assumed command of the Russian forces. Shortly after, Uvazhnov-Aleksandrov was also killed in the withering British fire.  At this point, no officer seemed keen to take up command and Captain Andrianov was sent off on his horse to consult with various generals about the problem.<ref name=\"Orlando Figes p. 260\"/>\n\nThe rest of the Russian column proceeded down to the valley where they were attacked by British artillery and pickets, eventually being driven off. The resistance of the British troops here had blunted all of the initial Russian attacks. General Paulov, leading the Russian second column of some 15,000, attacked the British positions on Sandbag Battery. As they approached, the 300 British defenders vaulted the wall and charged with the bayonet, driving off the leading Russian battalions. Five Russian battalions were assailed in the flanks by the British [[41st Regiment of Foot|41st Regiment]], who drove them back to the River Chernaya.\n\n===Home Hill===\n[[File:Crimean War 1854-56 Q71166.jpg|thumb|The Field of Inkermann, with the trenches]]\nGeneral [[Peter A Dannenberg]] took command of the Russian Army, and together with the uncommitted 9,000 men from the initial attacks, launched an assault on the British positions on Home Hill, held by the Second Division. The Guards Brigade and the Fourth Division were already marching to support the Second Division, but the British troops holding the Barrier withdrew, before it was re-taken by men from the [[21st Regiment of Foot|21st]], [[63rd Regiment of Foot|63rd]] Regiments and [[The Rifle Brigade]]. This position remained in British hands for the rest of the battle, despite determined attempts to take it back. The Russians launched 7,000 men against the Sandbag Battery, which was defended by 2,000 British soldiers. So began a ferocious struggle which saw the battery change hands repeatedly.\n\n===Fourth Division in action===\nWhen the British Fourth Division arrived under General [[George Cathcart]], they were finally able to go on the offensive. They launched a renewed attack against the Russians and on their flanks. The courage of Cathcart and his men had the unexpected effect of encouraging other British units to charge the Russians. However, the flanking troops were caught in the rear by an unexpected Russian counter-attack and Cathcart was shot from his horse and killed, leaving his troops disorganized and the attack was broken up. This gave the Russian army an opportunity to gain a crest on the ridge. However, as the Russian troops were coming up, they were attacked and driven off by newly arrived soldiers from the French camps. The French, with marvelous rapidity, brought up a division from five miles away and poured reinforcements into the entire line, reducing the Russians' advantage in numbers.<ref name=\"HCRE\">{{cite book |last = Porter|first = Maj Gen Whitworth|title = History of the Corps of Royal Engineers Vol I|year = 1889|publisher = The Institution of Royal Engineers|location = Chatham}}</ref>{{rp|433}}\n[[File:Adolphe Bayot - Bataille d'Inkerman - Arriv\u00e9e de la division Bosquet.jpg|thumb|Arrival of Bosquet's division]]\n[[File:C.

The Russians had now committed all of their troops and had no fresh reserves with which to act. Two British 18-pounder guns along with field artillery bombarded the 100-gun strong Russian positions on Shell Hill in counter-battery fire. With their batteries on Shell Hill taking withering fire from the British guns, their attacks rebuffed at all points, and lacking fresh infantry, the Russians began to withdraw. The allies made no attempt to pursue them. Following the battle, the allied regiments stood down and returned to their siege positions.\n\n==Aftermath==\nDespite being severely outnumbered, the allied troops held their ground, becoming a marvel of each regiment's tradition and tenacity. The amount of fog during the battle led to many of the troops on both sides being cut off, in battalion-sized groups or less. Thus, the battle became known as \"The Soldier's Battle\". The Russian attack, although unsuccessful, had denied the allies any attempt at gaining a quick victory in the Siege of Sevastopol and condemned the allied armies to two terrible winters on the heights. Following this battle, the Russians made no further large-scale attempts to defeat the allies in the field.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\n[[Alexander Kinglake]] obtained the official casualty returns for the battle. By his account allied casualties were: 2,573 British, of whom 635 were killed, and 1,800 French, of whom 175 were killed. Russia lost 3,286 killed within a total (including men taken prisoner) of 11,959 casualties.<ref>Kinglake Vol 5, \"Battle of Inkerman\", page 458: \"From the general engagement of the 5th November, including the fight on Mount Inkerman, there resulted, it seems, to the Russians a loss of 9,845 in killed, wounded, and prisoners [of which 3,286 killed]; to the English a loss of 2,573, of whom 635 were killed...Official return[s]\".</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe battle popularised the use of the name Inkerman in placenames in Victorian England, including Inkerman Road in [[Kentish Town]], London; Inkerman Road, [[St Albans]], and Inkerman Way in [[Knaphill]]. There is an Inkerman Street in [[St Kilda, Victoria]], Australia, in between Balaclava Rd and Alma Rd.

The battle broke the will of the Russian Army to defeat the allies in the field, and was followed by the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Siege of Sevastopol]]. The role of troops fighting mostly on their own initiative due to the foggy conditions during the battle has earned the engagement the name \"The Soldier's Battle\".<ref name=\"britishbattles.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishbattles.com/crimean-war/battle-of-inkerman/|title=Battle of Inkerman|website=www.britishbattles.com}}</ref>\n\n==Prelude to the battle==\nThe allied armies of Britain, France, Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire had landed on the west coast of Crimea on 14 September 1854, intending to capture the Russian naval base at [[Sevastopol]].<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (Picador Publishing: New York, 2010) p. 203.</ref>  The allied armies fought off and defeated the Russian Army at the [[Battle of Alma]], forcing them to retreat in some confusion toward the [[River Kacha]].<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'', pp. 215-216.</ref>  While the allies could have taken this opportunity to attack [[Sevastopol]] before Sevastopol could be put into a proper state of defence, the allied commanders, British general [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan]] and the French commander [[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]] could not agree on a plan of attack.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'', p. 222.</ref>\n\nInstead, they resolved to march around the city, and put Sevastopol under siege. Toward this end the allies marched to the southern coast of the Crimean peninsula and established a supply port at the city of [[Balaklava|Balaclava]].<ref>Orlando, ''The Crimean War: A History'', p. 225.</ref>  However, before the siege of Sevastopol began, the Russian commander [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov|Prince Menshikov]] evacuated Sevastopol with the major portion of his field army, leaving only a garrison to defend the city.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'', p. 241.</ref>  On 25 October 1854, a superior Russian force attacked the British base at [[Battle of Balaclava|Balaclava]], and although the Russian attack was foiled before it could reach the base, the Russians were left holding a strong position north of the British line. Balaclava revealed the allied weakness; their siege lines were so long they did not have sufficient troops to man them. Realising this, Menshikov launched an attack across the [[Chorna River (Ukraine)|Tchernaya River]] on 4 November 1854.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (Picador Publishing: New York, 2010) p. 258.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Assault===\n[[File:EB1911 Inkerman, Battle of.jpg |left|thumb]]\nOn 5 November 1854, the Russian 10th Division, under Lt.

It is an on-demand single photon source. A laser pulse can excite a pair of carriers known as an [[exciton]] in the quantum dot. The decay of a single exciton due to [[spontaneous emission]] leads to the emission of a single photon. Due to interactions between excitons, the emission when the quantum dot contains a single exciton is energetically distinct from that when the quantum dot contains more than one exciton. Therefore, by suitable energy filtering, the quantum dot becomes a [[nonclassical light]] source that emits photons one by one and thus shows [[photon antibunching]]. The emission of single photons can be proven by measuring the [[Degree of coherence#Degree of second-order coherence|second order intensity correlation function]].

The DBR's can be grown by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE). For the mirrors two materials with different [[refractive index|indices of refraction]] are grown in alternate order.

The second layer of DBR's can now be grown on top of the layer with the quantum dots.\n\nThe diameter of the pillar is only a few microns wide.

The discrete energy states in a quantum dot allow only one excitation. Additionally, the Rydberg blockade prevents the excitation of two excitons at the same space...<ref name=\" Kazimierczuk \">\n{{cite journal\n |author1= T. Kazimierczuk\n |author2= D.

If the energy of the pump laser is turned on resonance, the second exciton cannot be created.\nStill, there is a small probability of having two excitations in the quantum dot at the same time. Two excitons confined in a small volume are called [[biexciton]]s. They interact with each other and thus slightly change their energy. Photons resulting from the decay of biexcitons have a different energy than photons resulting from the decay of excitons. They can be filtered out by letting the outgoing beam pass an [[optical filter]].<ref name=\"Gold\" /> \nThe quantum dots can be excited both electrically and optically.<ref name=\"Eisaman\" /> For optical pumping, a pulsed [[laser]] can be used for excitation of the quantum dots.

The DBR's can be grown by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE). For the mirrors two materials with different [[refractive index|indices of refraction]] are grown in alternate order. Their lattice parameters should match to prevent strain. A possible combination is a combination of [[aluminum arsenide]] and [[gallium arsenide]]-layers.<ref name=\"On demand Photons\" /> A material with smaller [[band gap]] is used to grow the quantum dot. In the first few atomic layers of growing this material, the lattice constant will match that of the DBR. A tensile strain appears. At a certain thickness, the energy of the strain becomes too big and the layer contracts to grow with its own lattice constant. At this point, quantum dots have formed naturally. The second layer of DBR's can now be grown on top of the layer with the quantum dots.\n\nThe diameter of the pillar is only a few microns wide. To prevent the optical mode from exiting the cavity the micropillar must act as a waveguide.

The theoretical solution of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is a well-defined mode in which only the polarization is random. After aligning the polarization of the photons, their indistinguishability can be measured. For that, the [[Hong-Ou-Mandel effect]] is used. Two photons of the source are prepared so that they enter a 50:50 [[beam splitter]] at the same time from the two different input channels. A [[photodetector|detector]] is placed on both exits of the beam splitter. Coincidences between the two detectors are measured. If the photons are indistinguishable, no coincidences should occur.<ref name=\"HOM\">\n{{cite journal\n |author1=C. K. Hong\n |author2=Z. Y. Ou\n |author3=L.
