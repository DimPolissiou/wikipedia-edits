The games began on Saturday December 15, 2012 and, aside from the all-star games, concluded with the [[2013 BCS National Championship Game]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]] that was played on January 7, 2013.\n\nThe total of 35 team-competitive bowls was unchanged from the previous year.

To fill the 70 available team-competitive bowl slots, a total of 13 teams (19% of all participants) with non-winning seasons participated in bowl games&mdash;12 had a .500 (6-6) season and, for the second consecutive year, a team with a sub-.500 (6-7) season was invited to a bowl game.\n\n==Selection of the teams==\n[[File:2012 Bowl Teams-USA-states.png|thumb|left|300px|Number of bowl teams per state.]]\n\n===Bowl-eligibility contingency plan===\nAs per 2010 and 2011, initial bowl eligibility would go to teams with no lower than a non-losing record (6-6) for the season.

The [[Insight Bowl]], held in [[Tempe, Arizona]], is now the [[Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl]].  The [[TicketCity Bowl]] has been renamed the [[Heart of Dallas Bowl]]; its new sponsor is Plains Capital Bank.\n\n==Moratorium on new bowl games==\nThe NCAA has placed a three-year moratorium, starting with the 2011-12 bowl season, on any new bowl games.  This follows the addition of two new games ([[Pinstripe Bowl]], [[Heart of Dallas Bowl|TicketCity Bowl]]) for the [[2010-11 NCAA football bowl games|2010-11 bowl season]], bringing the total number of bowl games to 35.  The expansion to 70 teams required to fill these 35 bowl games has challenged the ability to actually find enough teams with winning (7-5 or better) records to fill bowl slots.  Teams with non-winning (6-6) and losing (6-7) records have participated in bowl games since the expansion to 35 games.  As discussed above (''Bowl-eligibility contingency plan''), the NCAA was forced to anticipate a need to allow teams with even worse (5-7) losing records to fill bowl selection slots in 2012-13.\n\n==Schedule==\nThe bowl game schedule was released July 10, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012-13 Bowl Schedule Released|url=http://footballbowlassociation.com/media/news/120710fbaschedule.pdf|publisher=Football Bowl Association|accessdate=10 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714093413/http://footballbowlassociation.com/media/news/120710fbaschedule.pdf|archive-date=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On December 2, 2012, the final BCS standings were announced and teams were officially selected for the various bowl games.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/college-football/bcs BCS Standings \u2013 December 2, 2012], espn.com.

They concluded the [[2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season]], and included 35 team-competitive games and four all-star games.  The games began on Saturday December 15, 2012 and, aside from the all-star games, concluded with the [[2013 BCS National Championship Game]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]] that was played on January 7, 2013.\n\nThe total of 35 team-competitive bowls was unchanged from the previous year. While bowl games had been the purview of [[Bowl eligibility|only the very best teams]] for nearly a century, this was the seventh consecutive year that teams with non-winning seasons participated in bowl games.  To fill the 70 available team-competitive bowl slots, a total of 13 teams (19% of all participants) with non-winning seasons participated in bowl games&mdash;12 had a .500 (6-6) season and, for the second consecutive year, a team with a sub-.500 (6-7) season was invited to a bowl game.\n\n==Selection of the teams==\n[[File:2012 Bowl Teams-USA-states.png|thumb|left|300px|Number of bowl teams per state.]]\n\n===Bowl-eligibility contingency plan===\nAs per 2010 and 2011, initial bowl eligibility would go to teams with no lower than a non-losing record (6-6) for the season.  On August 2, 2012, the NCAA Division I Board of Directors approved a significant change to the process to determine [[bowl eligible]] teams, going so far as to potentially allow 5-7 teams to go to a bowl, in case there were not enough regular bowl-eligible teams to fill every game.\nIf a bowl has one or more conferences/teams unable to meet their contractual commitments and there are no available bowl-eligible teams, the open spots can be filled \u2013 by the particular bowl's sponsoring agencies \u2013 as follows:<ref>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Greg |title=DI Board approves process to fill football bowls in case of shortfall |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/latest+news/2012/july/di+board+approves+process+to+fill+football+bowls+in+case+of+shortfall |accessdate=2 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803020639/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2012/July/DI+Board+approves+process+to+fill+football+bowls+in+case+of+shortfall |archive-date=2012-08-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n# Teams finishing 6-6 with one win against a team from the lower [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]]  (FCS), regardless of whether that FCS school meets NCAA scholarship requirements.

As discussed above (''Bowl-eligibility contingency plan''), the NCAA was forced to anticipate a need to allow teams with even worse (5-7) losing records to fill bowl selection slots in 2012-13.\n\n==Schedule==\nThe bowl game schedule was released July 10, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012-13 Bowl Schedule Released|url=http://footballbowlassociation.com/media/news/120710fbaschedule.pdf|publisher=Football Bowl Association|accessdate=10 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714093413/http://footballbowlassociation.com/media/news/120710fbaschedule.pdf|archive-date=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On December 2, 2012, the final BCS standings were announced and teams were officially selected for the various bowl games.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/college-football/bcs BCS Standings \u2013 December 2, 2012], espn.com.

Some scientists say that the events occur quasi-periodically with a recurrence time being a multiple of 1,470 years, but this is debated. The comparable climate cyclicity during the [[Holocene]] is referred to as [[Bond event]]s.\n\n==Evidence==\nThe best evidence for Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events remains in the [[Greenland Ice Sheet Project|Greenland ice cores]], which only go back to the end of the last interglacial, the [[Eemian interglacial]]. Ice core evidence from Antarctic cores suggests that the Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events are related to the so-called Antarctic Isotope Maxima by means of a coupling of the climate of the two hemispheres, the Bi-polar Seesaw.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Stocker, T.

Unfortunately, current ice core records from Greenland extend only through the last most recent glacial period so direct evidence of D-O events in earlier glacial periods from Greenland ice is unavailable. However, work by Stephen Barker and colleagues has shown that the existing Greenland record can be reconstructed by deriving the Antarctic ice core record. This allows for the reconstruction of an older Greenland record through the derivation of the nearly million-year-long Antarctic ice core record.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barker |first1=S. |last2=Knorr |first2=G. |last3=Edwards |first3=R.

Maslin ''et al.''. (2001) suggested that each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability, but that on melting, the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents, causing melting elsewhere. More specifically, D-O cold events, and their associated influx of meltwater, reduce the strength of the North Atlantic Deep Water current (NADW), weakening the northern hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere. This warmer water results in melting of Antarctic ice, thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current (AABW). This allows the NADW to return to its previous strength, driving Northern Hemisphere melting \u2013 and another D-O cold event.\n\nThe theory may also explain Heinrich events' apparent connection to the D-O cycle; when the accumulation of meltwater in the oceans reaches a threshold, it may have raised sea level enough to undercut the Laurentide ice sheet \u2013 causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle.\n\nThe [[little ice age]] around 400 to 200 years ago has been interpreted by some as the cold part of a D-O cycle.<ref name=Bond99/>\n\n== History ==\nThe ice core's signals now recognised as Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events are, in retrospect, visible in the original [[Greenland Ice Sheet Project|GISP]] core, as well as the Camp Century Greenland core.<ref>[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/greenland/gisp/campcentury/campc.html Ice Core | National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)]</ref> But at the time the ice cores were made, their significance was noted but not widely appreciated. Dansgaard ''et al''. (AGU geophysical monograph 33, 1985) note their existence in the GRIP core as \"violent oscillations\" in the \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O signal, and that they appear to correlate to events in the previous Camp Century core 1 400&nbsp;km away, thus providing evidence for their corresponding to widespread climatic anomalies (with only the Camp Century core, they could have been local fluctuations). Dansgaard ''et al''. speculate that these may be related to quasi-stationary modes of the atmosphere-ocean system. D-O events tend to be what drives the \"[[Sahara pump theory|Sahara pump]]\" which has had an effect upon human evolution and dispersal.\n\nThe cyclicity is also found during the Holocene, where the events are referred to as Bond events.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=G. |title=A Pervasive Millennial-Scale Cycle in North Atlantic Holocene and Glacial Climates |journal=Science |date=14 November 1997 |volume=278 |issue=5341 |pages=1257\u20131266 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1257 |bibcode=1997Sci...278.1257B }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=G. |last2=Kromer |first2=B |last3=Beer |first3=J |last4=Muscheler |first4=R |last5=Evans |first5=MN |last6=Showers |first6=W |last7=Hoffmann |first7=S |last8=Lotti-Bond |first8=R |last9=Hajdas |first9=I |last10=Bonani |first10=G |title=Persistent Solar Influence on North Atlantic Climate During the Holocene |journal=Science |date=15 November 2001 |volume=294 |issue=5549 |pages=2130\u20132136 |doi=10.1126/science.1065680 |pmid=11739949 |bibcode=2001Sci...294.2130B }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Younger Dryas]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |doi=10.1029/GM126p0009 |chapter=Synthesis of the Nature and Causes of Rapid Climate Transitions During the Quaternary |title=The Oceans and Rapid Climate Change |series=Geophysical Monograph Series |year=2013 |last1=Maslin |first1=Mark |last2=Seidov |first2=Dan |last3=Lowe |first3=John |pages=9\u201352 |isbn=9781118668603 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Braun |first1=Holger |last2=Christl |first2=Marcus |last3=Rahmstorf |first3=Stefan |last4=Ganopolski |first4=Andrey |last5=Mangini |first5=Augusto |last6=Kubatzki |first6=Claudia |last7=Roth |first7=Kurt |last8=Kromer |first8=Bernd |title=Possible solar origin of the 1,470-year glacial climate cycle demonstrated in a coupled model |journal=Nature |date=November 2005 |volume=438 |issue=7065 |pages=208\u2013211 |doi=10.1038/nature04121 |pmid=16281042 |bibcode=2005Natur.438..208B |url=https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/13582/1/Bra2005e.pdf }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Schulz |first=Michael |year=2002 |title=On the 1470-year pacing of Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger warm events |journal=Paleoceanography |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=4\u20131\u20134\u20139 |doi=10.1029/2000PA000571 |bibcode = 2002PalOc..17b...4S | url= http://www.geo.uni-bremen.de/geomod/staff/mschulz/reprint/1470y_pacing.pdf }}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book|url=http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/ocng_textbook/contents.html |title=Introduction to Physical Oceanography |first=Robert H. |last=Stewart |date=2008 |publisher=[[TAMU]] |isbn=9781616100452 |format=pdf |pages=353 |url-status=dead |id=AA00011696:00001 |archive-date=2016-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306040923/http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/ocng_textbook/contents.html |df= }}\n* {{cite web |url= https://photos.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/photos/dansgaard-willi-c1 |url-access=subscription  |format= Photograph |first= Chester C. |last= Langway, Jr. |title= Greenland Ice Sheet Project |quote= Dansgaard and Oeschger in a sub ice trench at Dye-3, Greenland |date= Aug 10, 1981 |publisher= [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP) |work= Emilio Segr\u00e8 Visual Archives (ESVA) }}\n\n{{Climate oscillations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dansgaard-Oeschger event}}\n[[Category:Climate]]\n[[Category:Pleistocene]]\n[[Category:Paleoclimatology]]\n[[Category:Last Glacial Period]]\n[[Category:20th century in science]] <!-- When were they discovered? -->\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Rapid climate fluctuation in the last glacial period.}}\n[[Image:Ice-core-isotope.png|thumb|300px|right|Temperature proxy from four ice cores for the last 140,000&nbsp;years, clearly indicating the greater magnitude of the D-O effect in the northern hemisphere]]\n\n'''[[Willi Dansgaard|Dansgaard]]\u2013[[Hans Oeschger|Oeschger]] events''' (often abbreviated '''D\u2013O events''') are rapid climate fluctuations that occurred 25 times during the [[last glacial period]].

Maslin ''et al.''. (2001) suggested that each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability, but that on melting, the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents, causing melting elsewhere. More specifically, D-O cold events, and their associated influx of meltwater, reduce the strength of the North Atlantic Deep Water current (NADW), weakening the northern hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere. This warmer water results in melting of Antarctic ice, thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current (AABW). This allows the NADW to return to its previous strength, driving Northern Hemisphere melting \u2013 and another D-O cold event.\n\nThe theory may also explain Heinrich events' apparent connection to the D-O cycle; when the accumulation of meltwater in the oceans reaches a threshold, it may have raised sea level enough to undercut the Laurentide ice sheet \u2013 causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle.\n\nThe [[little ice age]] around 400 to 200 years ago has been interpreted by some as the cold part of a D-O cycle.<ref name=Bond99/>\n\n== History ==\nThe ice core's signals now recognised as Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events are, in retrospect, visible in the original [[Greenland Ice Sheet Project|GISP]] core, as well as the Camp Century Greenland core.<ref>[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/greenland/gisp/campcentury/campc.html Ice Core | National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)]</ref> But at the time the ice cores were made, their significance was noted but not widely appreciated. Dansgaard ''et al''. (AGU geophysical monograph 33, 1985) note their existence in the GRIP core as \"violent oscillations\" in the \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O signal, and that they appear to correlate to events in the previous Camp Century core 1 400&nbsp;km away, thus providing evidence for their corresponding to widespread climatic anomalies (with only the Camp Century core, they could have been local fluctuations). Dansgaard ''et al''. speculate that these may be related to quasi-stationary modes of the atmosphere-ocean system. D-O events tend to be what drives the \"[[Sahara pump theory|Sahara pump]]\" which has had an effect upon human evolution and dispersal.\n\nThe cyclicity is also found during the Holocene, where the events are referred to as Bond events.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=G. |title=A Pervasive Millennial-Scale Cycle in North Atlantic Holocene and Glacial Climates |journal=Science |date=14 November 1997 |volume=278 |issue=5341 |pages=1257\u20131266 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1257 |bibcode=1997Sci...278.1257B }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=G. |last2=Kromer |first2=B |last3=Beer |first3=J |last4=Muscheler |first4=R |last5=Evans |first5=MN |last6=Showers |first6=W |last7=Hoffmann |first7=S |last8=Lotti-Bond |first8=R |last9=Hajdas |first9=I |last10=Bonani |first10=G |title=Persistent Solar Influence on North Atlantic Climate During the Holocene |journal=Science |date=15 November 2001 |volume=294 |issue=5549 |pages=2130\u20132136 |doi=10.1126/science.1065680 |pmid=11739949 |bibcode=2001Sci...294.2130B }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Younger Dryas]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |doi=10.1029/GM126p0009 |chapter=Synthesis of the Nature and Causes of Rapid Climate Transitions During the Quaternary |title=The Oceans and Rapid Climate Change |series=Geophysical Monograph Series |year=2013 |last1=Maslin |first1=Mark |last2=Seidov |first2=Dan |last3=Lowe |first3=John |pages=9\u201352 |isbn=9781118668603 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Braun |first1=Holger |last2=Christl |first2=Marcus |last3=Rahmstorf |first3=Stefan |last4=Ganopolski |first4=Andrey |last5=Mangini |first5=Augusto |last6=Kubatzki |first6=Claudia |last7=Roth |first7=Kurt |last8=Kromer |first8=Bernd |title=Possible solar origin of the 1,470-year glacial climate cycle demonstrated in a coupled model |journal=Nature |date=November 2005 |volume=438 |issue=7065 |pages=208\u2013211 |doi=10.1038/nature04121 |pmid=16281042 |bibcode=2005Natur.438..208B |url=https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/13582/1/Bra2005e.pdf }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Schulz |first=Michael |year=2002 |title=On the 1470-year pacing of Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger warm events |journal=Paleoceanography |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=4\u20131\u20134\u20139 |doi=10.1029/2000PA000571 |bibcode = 2002PalOc..17b...4S | url= http://www.geo.uni-bremen.de/geomod/staff/mschulz/reprint/1470y_pacing.pdf }}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book|url=http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/ocng_textbook/contents.html |title=Introduction to Physical Oceanography |first=Robert H. |last=Stewart |date=2008 |publisher=[[TAMU]] |isbn=9781616100452 |format=pdf |pages=353 |url-status=dead |id=AA00011696:00001 |archive-date=2016-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306040923/http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/ocng_textbook/contents.html |df= }}\n* {{cite web |url= https://photos.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/photos/dansgaard-willi-c1 |url-access=subscription  |format= Photograph |first= Chester C. |last= Langway, Jr. |title= Greenland Ice Sheet Project |quote= Dansgaard and Oeschger in a sub ice trench at Dye-3, Greenland |date= Aug 10, 1981 |publisher= [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP) |work= Emilio Segr\u00e8 Visual Archives (ESVA) }}\n\n{{Climate oscillations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dansgaard-Oeschger event}}\n[[Category:Climate]]\n[[Category:Pleistocene]]\n[[Category:Paleoclimatology]]\n[[Category:Last Glacial Period]]\n", "name_user": "Error", "label": "safe", "comment": "<!-- When were they discovered? --> addedCategory:20th century in scienceusingHotCat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger_event"}

For solving Fermat's Last Theorem, he was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Knighthood|knighted]], and received other honours such as the 2016 [[Abel Prize]]. When announcing that Wiles had won the Abel Prize, the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] described his achievement as a \"stunning proof\".<ref name=\"abelcitation\" />\n\n== Precursors to Wiles's proof==\n\n=== Fermat's Last Theorem and progress prior to 1980===\n{{main|Fermat's Last Theorem}}\n\n[[Fermat's Last Theorem]], formulated in 1637, states that no three distinct positive integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' can satisfy the equation\n: <math>a^n + b^n=c^n </math>\nif ''n'' is an integer greater than two (''n'' > 2).\n\nOver time, this simple assertion became one of the most famous unproved claims in mathematics.  Between its publication and Andrew Wiles's eventual solution over 350 years later, many mathematicians and amateurs attempted to prove this statement, either for all values of n > 2, or for specific cases. It spurred the development of entire new areas within [[number theory]]. Proofs were eventually found for all values of n up to around 4 million, first by hand, and later by computer.  But no general proof was found that would be valid for all possible values of ''n'', nor even a hint how such a proof could be undertaken.\n\n===The Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture===\n{{main|Modularity theorem}}\n\nSeparately from anything related to Fermat's Last Theorem, in the 1950s and 1960s Japanese mathematician [[Goro Shimura]], drawing on ideas posed by [[Yutaka Taniyama]], conjectured that a connection might exist between [[elliptic curve]]s and [[modular form]]s. These were mathematical objects with no known connection between them. Taniyama and Shimura posed the question whether, unknown to mathematicians, the two kinds of object were actually identical mathematical objects, just seen in different ways.\n\nThey conjectured that every [[rational curve|rational]] elliptic curve is also [[classical modular curve|modular]]. This became known as the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture. In the West, this conjecture became well known through a 1967 paper by [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]], who gave conceptual evidence for it; thus, it is sometimes called the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture.\n\nBy around 1980, much evidence had been accumulated to form conjectures about elliptic curves, and many papers had been written which examined the consequences if the conjecture was true, but the actual conjecture itself was unproven and generally considered inaccessible - meaning that mathematicians believed a proof of the conjecture was probably impossible using current knowledge. \n\nFor decades, the conjecture remained an important but unsolved problem in mathematics. Around 50 years after first being proposed, the conjecture was finally proven and renamed the [[modularity theorem]], largely as a result of Andrew Wiles's work described below.\n\n===Frey's curve===\nOn yet another separate branch of development, in the late 1960s, Yves Hellegouarch came up with the idea of associating solutions (''a'',''b'',''c'') of Fermat's equation with a completely different mathematical object: an elliptic curve.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Hellegouarch | first=Yves | title=Invitation to the Mathematics of Fermat\u2013Wiles | publisher=Academic Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-12-339251-0 }}</ref> The curve consists of all points in the plane whose coordinates (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') satisfy the relation\n: <math> y^2 = x(x-a^n)(x+b^n). </math>\nSuch an elliptic curve would enjoy very special properties, which are due to the appearance of high powers of integers in its equation and the fact that ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''c''<sup>''n''</sup> is an ''n''th power as well.\n\nIn 1982\u20131985, [[Gerhard Frey]] called attention to the unusual properties of this same curve, now called a [[Frey curve]]. He showed that it was likely that the curve could link Fermat and Taniyama, since any [[counterexample]] to Fermat's Last Theorem would probably also imply that an elliptic curve existed that was not [[modular curve|modular]]. Frey showed that there were good reasons to believe that any set of numbers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''n'') capable of disproving Fermat's Last Theorem could also probably be used to disprove the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture. Therefore, if the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture were true, no set of numbers capable of disproving Fermat could exist, so Fermat's Last Theorem would have to be true as well.\n\nMathematically, the conjecture says that each elliptic curve with [[Rational number|rational]] coefficients can be constructed in an entirely different way, not by giving its equation but by using [[modular function]]s to [[Parametric equation|parametrise]] coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' of the points on it. Thus, according to the conjecture, any elliptic curve over '''Q''' would have to be a [[modular elliptic curve]], yet if a solution to Fermat's equation with non-zero ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''n'' greater than 2 existed, the corresponding curve would not be modular, resulting in a contradiction. If the link identified by Frey could be proven, then in turn, it would mean that a proof or disproof of either Fermat's Last Theorem or the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture would simultaneously prove or disprove the other.<ref>Singh, pp. 194\u2013198; Aczel, pp. 109\u2013114.</ref>\n\n===Ribet's theorem===\n{{main|Ribet's theorem}}\n\nTo complete this link,  it was necessary to show that Frey's intuition was correct: that a Frey curve, if it existed, could not be modular. In 1985, [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] provided a partial proof that a Frey curve could not be modular. Serre did not provide a complete proof of his proposal; the missing part (which Serre had noticed early on<ref name=\"CornellBook\"/>{{rp|1}}) became known as the [[epsilon theorem|epsilon conjecture]] or \u03b5-conjecture (it is now known as [[Ribet's theorem]]). Serre's main interest was in an even more ambitious conjecture, [[Serre conjecture (number theory)|Serre's conjecture]] on modular [[Galois representations]], which would imply the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture. However his partial proof came close to confirming the link between Fermat and Taniyama.\n\nIn the summer of 1986, [[Kenneth Alan Ribet|Ken Ribet]] succeeded in proving the epsilon conjecture, now known as [[Ribet's theorem]].  His article was published in 1990. In doing so, Ribet finally proved the link between the two theorems by confirming as Frey had suggested, that a proof of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture for the kinds of elliptic curves Frey had identified, together with Ribet's theorem, would also prove Fermat's Last Theorem:\n\nIn mathematical terms, Ribet's theorem showed that if the Galois representation associated with an elliptic curve has certain properties (which Frey's curve has), then that curve cannot be modular, in the sense that there cannot exist a modular form which gives rise to the same Galois representation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210102243/http://cgd.best.vwh.net/home/flt/flt08.htm|title=The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|last=Daney|first=Charles|date=13 March 1996|access-date=2017-06-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Situation prior to Wiles's proof ===\n\nFollowing the developments related to the Frey Curve, and its link to both Fermat and Taniyama, a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem would follow from a proof of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture \u2014 or at least a proof of the conjecture for the kinds of elliptic curves that included Frey's equation (known as [[semistable elliptic curve]]s).\n\n:* From Ribet's Theorem and the Frey Curve, any 4 numbers able to be used to disprove Fermat's Last Theorem could also be used to make a semistable elliptic curve (\"Frey's curve\") that could never be modular;\n:* But if the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture were also true for semistable elliptic curves, then by definition every Frey's curve that existed must be modular.\n:* The contradiction could have [[proof by contradiction|only one answer]]: if Ribet's Theorem and the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture for semistable curves were both true, then it would mean there could not be any solutions to Fermat's equation &ndash; because then there would be no Frey curves at all, meaning no contradictions would exist. This would finally prove Fermat's Last Theorem.\n\nHowever, despite the progress made by Serre and Ribet, this approach to Fermat was widely considered unusable as well, since almost all mathematicians saw the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture itself as completely inaccessible to proof with current knowledge.<ref name=\"Singh\" />{{rp|203\u2013205, 223, 226}} For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor [[John H.

Instead of being fixed, the problem, which had originally seemed minor, now seemed very significant, far more serious, and less easy to resolve.<ref>Singh, pp. 175-185.</ref>\n\nWiles states that on the morning of 19 September 1994, he was on the verge of giving up and was almost resigned to accepting that he had failed, and to publishing his work so that others could build on it and find the error. He states that he was having a final look to try and understand the fundamental reasons why his approach could not be made to work, when he had a sudden insight that the specific reason why the Kolyvagin\u2013Flach approach would not work directly, also meant that his original attempts using [[Iwasawa theory]] could be made to work if he strengthened it using his experience gained from the Kolyvagin\u2013Flach approach since then. Each was inadequate by itself, but fixing one approach with tools from the other would resolve the issue and produce a [[class number formula]] (CNF) valid for all cases that were not already proven by his refereed paper:<ref name=\"sept1994\" /><ref>Aczel, pp. 132\u2013134.</ref><ref name=\"sept1994\" />\n\n:\"I was sitting at my desk examining the Kolyvagin\u2013Flach method.

So we assume that (somehow) we have found a solution and created such a curve (which we will call \"''E''\"), and see what happens.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | &nbsp;\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color:PaleGoldenrod\" | Part 2: the Modularity Lifting Theorem\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 4\n| Galois representations of elliptic curves ''&rho;''(''E'', ''p'') for any prime ''p'' > 3 have been studied by many mathematicians.\n\nWiles aims first of all to prove a result about these representations, that he will use later: that if a semi-stable elliptic curve ''E'' has a Galois representation ''&rho;''(''E'', ''p'') that is modular, the elliptic curve itself must be modular.\n\nProving this is helpful in two ways: it makes counting and matching easier, and, significantly, to prove the representation is modular, we would only have to prove it for one single prime number ''p'', and we can do this using ''any prime'' that makes our work easy &ndash; it does not matter which prime we use.\n\nThis is the most difficult part of the problem &ndash; technically it means proving that if the Galois representation ''&rho;''(''E'', ''p'') is a modular form, so are all the other related Galois representations ''&rho;''(''E'', ''p''<sup>&infin;</sup>) for all powers of p.<ref name=\"abelcitation\" />  This is the so-called \"[[Lift (mathematics)|modular lifting]] problem\", and Wiles approached it using [[Deformation theory|deformations]].\n\n:Any elliptic curve (or a representation of an elliptic curve) can be categorized as either [[Irreducible (mathematics)|''reducible'' or ''irreducible'']]. The proof will be slightly different depending whether or not the elliptic curve's representation is reducible.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | To compare elliptic curves and modular forms directly is difficult. Past efforts to count and match elliptic curves and modular forms had all failed. But elliptic curves can be [[Representation (mathematics)|represented]] within [[Galois theory]]. Wiles realized that working with the representations of elliptic curves instead of the curves themselves would make counting and matching them to modular forms far easier. From this point on, the proof primarily aims to prove:\n: (1) if the geometric Galois representation of a semi-stable elliptic curve is modular, so is the curve itself; and\n: (2) the geometric Galois representations of all semi-stable elliptic curves are modular.\nTogether, these allow us to work with representations of curves rather than directly with elliptic curves themselves. Our original goal will have been transformed into proving the modularity of geometric Galois representations of semi-stable elliptic curves, instead. Wiles described this realization as a \"key breakthrough\".\n\nA Galois representation of an elliptic curves is ''G''->GL('''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>).  To show that a geometric Galois representation of an elliptic curve is a modular form, we need to find a [[Eigenform|normalized eigenform]] whose [[eigenvalue]]s (which are also its [[Fourier series]] coefficients) satisfy a [[congruence relation]]ship for all but a finite number of primes.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 5\n| Wiles's initial strategy is to count and match using [[proof by induction]] and a [[Class number formula|Class Number Formula]] (\"CNF\"): an approach in which, once the hypothesis is proved for one elliptic curve, it can automatically be extended to be proven for all subsequent elliptic curves. \n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | It was in this area that Wiles found difficulties, first with horizontal [[Iwasawa theory]] and later with his extension of Kolyvagin&ndash;Flach. Wiles's work extending Kolyvagin\u2013Flach was mainly related to making Kolyvagin\u2013Flach strong enough to prove the full CNF he would use. It later turned out that neither of these approaches by itself could produce a CNF able to cover all types of semi-stable elliptic curves, and the final piece of his proof in 1995 was to realize that he could succeed by strengthening Iwasawa theory with the techniques from Kolyvagin&ndash;Flach.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 6\n| At this point, the proof has shown a key point about Galois representations: \n: If the geometric Galois representation ''&rho;''(''E'',''p'') of a semi-stable elliptic curve ''E'' is irreducible and modular (for some prime number p > 2), then subject to some technical conditions, E is modular.\nThis is Wiles's ''lifting theorem'' (or ''modularity lifting theorem''), a major and revolutionary accomplishment at the time. \n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | Crucially, this result does not just show that modular irreducible representations imply modular curves. It also means we can prove a representation is modular by using any prime number&nbsp;>&nbsp;2 that we find easiest to use (because proving it for just one prime&nbsp;>&nbsp;2 proves it for all primes&nbsp;>&nbsp;2).\n\nSo we can try to prove all of our elliptic curves are modular by using one prime number as ''p'' - but if we do not succeed in proving this for all elliptic curves, perhaps we can prove the rest by choosing different prime numbers as 'p' for the difficult cases.\n\nThe proof must cover the Galois representations of all semi-stable elliptic curves ''E'', but for each individual curve, we only need to prove it is modular using one prime number ''p''.)\n|-\n! colspan = \"3\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color:PaleGoldenrod\" | Part 3: Proving that all semi-stable elliptic curves are modular\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 7\n| With the lifting theorem proved, we return to the original problem. We will categorize all semi-stable elliptic curves based on the reducibility of their Galois representations, and use the powerful lifting theorem on the results.\n\nFrom above, it does not matter which prime is chosen for the representations. We can use any one prime number that is easiest. 3 is the smallest prime number more than 2, and some work has already been done on representations of elliptic curves using ''&rho;''(''E'',3), so choosing 3 as our prime number is a helpful starting point.\n\nWiles found that it was easier to prove the representation was modular by choosing a prime p=3 in the cases where the representation ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is irreducible, but the proof when ''&rho;''(''E'',3)  is reducible was easier to prove by choosing ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5. So the proof splits in two at this point. \n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | The proof's use of both p=3 and p=5 below, is the so-called \"3/5 switch\" referred to in some descriptions of the proof, which Wiles noticed in a paper of Mazur's in 1993, although the trick itself dates back to the 19th century.\n\nThe switch between p=3 and p=5 has since opened a significant area of study in its own right ''(see [[Serre's modularity conjecture]])''.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 8\n| If the Galois representation ''&rho;''(''E'',3) (i.e., using ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3) is irreducible, then it was known from around 1980 that its Galois representation is also always modular.\n\nWiles uses his modularity lifting theorem to make short work of this case:  \n:* If the representation ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is irreducible, then we know the representation is also modular (Langlands and Tunnell), but...\n:* ... if the representation is both irreducible and modular then ''E'' itself is modular (modularity lifting theorem).\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | Langlands and Tunnell proved this in two papers in the early 1980s. The proof is based on the fact that ''&rho;''(''E'',3) has the same [[symmetry group]] as the general [[quartic equation]] in one variable, which was one of the few general classes of [[diophantine equation]] known at that time to be modular.\n\nThis existing result for p=3 is crucial to Wiles's approach and is one reason for initially using p=3.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 9\n| So we now consider what happens if ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is reducible.\n\nWiles found that when the representation of an elliptic curve using p=3 is reducible, it was easier to work with p=5 and use his new lifting theorem to prove that ''&rho;''(''E'', 5) will always be modular, than to try and prove directly that ''&rho;''(''E'',3) itself is modular (remembering that we only need to prove it for one prime).\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | 5 is the next prime number after 3, and any prime number can be used, perhaps 5 will be an easier prime number to work with than 3? But it looks hopeless initially to prove that ''&rho;''(''E'', 5) is always modular, for much the same reason that the general [[quintic equation]] cannot be solved by radicals. So Wiles has to find a way around this.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 9.1 \n| style=\"padding-left:30px\" | If ''&rho;''(''E'',3) and ''&rho;''(''E'',5) are both reducible, Wiles proved directly that ''&rho;''(''E'',5) must be modular.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | &nbsp;\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 9.2\n| style=\"padding-left:30px\" | The last case is if ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is reducible and ''&rho;''(''E'',5) is irreducible.\n\nWiles showed that in this case, one could always find another semistable elliptic curve ''F'' such that the representation ''&rho;''(''F'',3) is irreducible and also the representations ''&rho;''(''E'',5) and ''&rho;''(''F'',5) are [[isomorphic]] (they have identical structures).\n\n:- The first of these properties shows that F must be modular (Langlands and Tunnell again: all irreducible representations with p=3 are modular). \n:- If F is modular then we know ''&rho;''(''F'',5) must be modular as well. \n:- But because the representations of ''E'' and ''F'' with ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 have exactly the same structure, and we know that ''&rho;''(''F'',5) is modular, ''&rho;''(''E'',5) must be modular as well.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | &nbsp;\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 9.3\n| style=\"padding-left:30px\" | Therefore, if ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is reducible, we have proved that ''&rho;''(''E'',5) will always be modular.

Therefore no solutions to Fermat's equation can exist either, so Fermat's Last Theorem is also true.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | We have our proof by contradiction, because we have proven that if Fermat's Last Theorem is incorrect, we could create an elliptic curve that cannot be modular (Ribet's Theorem) and must be modular (Wiles). As it cannot be both, the only answer is that no such curve exists.\n|}\n\n==Mathematical detail of Wiles proof==\n\n===Overview===\nWiles opted to attempt to match elliptic curves to a [[countable]] set of modular forms. He found that this direct approach was not working, so he transformed the problem by instead matching the [[Galois representation]]s of the elliptic curves to modular forms. Wiles denotes this matching (or mapping) that, more specifically, is a [[ring homomorphism]]:\n:<math> R_n \\rightarrow \\mathbf{T}_n. </math>\n<math>R</math> is a deformation ring and <math>\\mathbf{T}</math> is a [[Hecke algebra of a locally compact group|Hecke ring]].\n\nWiles had the insight that in many cases this ring [[homomorphism]] could be a ring [[isomorphism]] (Conjecture 2.16 in Chapter 2, \u00a73 of the 1995 paper<ref name=\"wiles1995\"/>). He realised that the map between <math>R</math> and <math>\\mathbf{T}</math> is an isomorphism if and only if two [[abelian group]]s occurring in the theory are finite and have the same [[cardinality]]. This is sometimes referred to as the \"numerical criterion\". Given this result, Fermat's Last Theorem is reduced to the statement that two groups have the same order. Much of the text of the proof leads into topics and theorems related to [[ring theory]] and [[commutation theory]]. Wiles's goal was to verify that the map <math> R \\rightarrow \\mathbf{T}</math> is an isomorphism and ultimately that <math> R = \\mathbf{T}</math>. In treating deformations, Wiles defined four cases, with the [[Group scheme#Finite flat group schemes|flat]] deformation case requiring more effort to prove and treated in a separate article in the same volume entitled \"Ring-theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras\".\n\n[[Gerd Faltings]], in his bulletin, gives the following [[commutative diagram]] (p.&nbsp;745):\n\n:[[File:Faltings diagram.png|230px]]\n\nor ultimately that <math> R = \\mathbf{T}</math>, indicating a [[complete intersection]]. Since Wiles could not show that <math> R = \\mathbf{T}</math> directly, he did so through <math> \\mathbf{Z}_3, \\mathbf{F}_3 </math> and <math>\\mathbf{T}/\\mathfrak{m}</math> via [[Lift (mathematics)|lifts]].\n\nIn order to perform this matching, Wiles had to create a [[class number formula]] (CNF). He first attempted to use horizontal [[Iwasawa theory]] but that part of his work had an unresolved issue such that he could not create a CNF. At the end of the summer of 1991, he learned about an [[Euler system]] recently developed by [[Victor Kolyvagin]] and [[Matthias Flach (mathematician)|Matthias Flach]] that seemed \"tailor made\" for the inductive part of his proof, which could be used to create a CNF, and so Wiles set his Iwasawa work aside and began working to extend Kolyvagin and Flach's work instead, in order to create the CNF his proof would require.<ref>Singh p.259-262</ref> By the spring of 1993, his work had covered all but a few families of elliptic curves, and in early 1993, Wiles was confident enough of his nearing success to let one trusted colleague into his secret. Since his work relied extensively on using the Kolyvagin&ndash;Flach approach, which was new to mathematics and to Wiles, and which he had also extended, in January 1993 he asked his Princeton colleague, [[Nick Katz]], to help him review his work for subtle errors. Their conclusion at the time was that the techniques Wiles used seemed to work correctly.<ref name=\"Singh\" />{{rp|261\u2013265}}<ref>Singh, pp. 239\u2013243; Aczel, pp. 122\u2013125.</ref>\n\nWiles' use of Kolyvagin&ndash;Flach would later be found to be the point of failure in the original proof submission, and he eventually had to revert to Iwasawa theory and a collaboration with Richard Taylor to fix it. In May 1993, while reading a paper by Mazur, Wiles had the insight that the 3/5 switch would resolve the final issues and would then cover all elliptic curves.\n\n===General approach and strategy===\nGiven an elliptic curve ''E'' over the field '''Q''' of rational numbers <math> E(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}) </math>, for every prime power <math>\\ell^n</math>, there exists a [[homomorphism]] from the [[absolute Galois group]]\n:<math> \\operatorname{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}/\\mathbf{Q}) </math>\nto\n:<math> \\operatorname{GL}_2(\\mathbf{Z}/l^n \\mathbf{Z}), </math>\nthe group of [[Invertible matrix|invertible]] 2 by 2 matrices whose entries are integers modulo <math>\\ell^n</math>.  This is because <math>E(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}})</math>, the points of ''E'' over <math>\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}</math>, form an [[abelian group]], on which <math>\\operatorname{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}/\\mathbf{Q})</math> acts; the subgroup of elements ''x'' such that <math>\\ell^n x = 0</math> is just <math>(\\mathbf{Z}/\\ell^n \\mathbf{Z})^2</math>, and an [[automorphism]] of this group is a matrix of the type described.\n\nLess obvious is that given a modular form of a certain special type, a [[Hecke eigenform]] with eigenvalues in '''Q''', one also gets a homomorphism from the absolute Galois group\n:<math>\\operatorname{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}/\\mathbf{Q}) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{GL}_2(\\mathbf{Z}/l^n \\mathbf{Z}).</math>\nThis goes back to Eichler and Shimura.  The idea is that the Galois group acts first on the modular curve on which the modular form is defined, thence on the [[Jacobian variety]] of the curve, and finally on the points of <math>\\ell^n</math> power order on that Jacobian.  The resulting representation is not usually 2-dimensional, but the [[Hecke operator]]s cut out a 2-dimensional piece.  It is easy to demonstrate that these representations come from some elliptic curve but the converse is the difficult part to prove.\n\nInstead of trying to go directly from the elliptic curve to the modular form, one can first pass to the <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, \\ell^n)</math> representation for some ''\u2113'' and ''n'', and from that to the modular form.  In the case ''\u2113''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 and ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, results of the [[Artin L-function#The Artin conjecture|Langlands\u2013Tunnell theorem]] show that the <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, 3)</math> representation of any elliptic curve over '''Q''' comes from a modular form.  The basic strategy is to use induction on ''n'' to show that this is true for ''\u2113''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 and any ''n'', that ultimately there is a single modular form that works for all n.  To do this, one uses a counting argument, comparing the number of ways in which one can [[Lift (mathematics)|lift]] a <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, \\ell^n)</math> Galois representation to <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, \\ell^{n+1})</math> and the number of ways in which one can lift a <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, \\ell^n)</math> modular form.  An essential point is to impose a sufficient set of conditions on the Galois representation; otherwise, there will be too many lifts and most will not be modular.  These conditions should be satisfied for the representations coming from modular forms and those coming from elliptic curves. \n\n===3-5 trick===\nIf the original <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, 3)</math> representation has an image which is too small, one runs into trouble with the lifting argument, and in this case, there is a final trick which has since been studied in greater generality in the subsequent work on the [[Serre conjecture (number theory)|Serre Modularity Conjecture]]. The idea involves the interplay between the <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, 3)</math> and <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, 5)</math> representations. In particular, if the mod-5 Galois representation <math>\\overline{\\rho}_{E, 5}</math> associated to an semistable elliptic curve ''E'' over '''Q''' is irreducible, then there is another semistable elliptic curve <var>E'</var> over '''Q''' such that its associated mod-5 Galois representation <math>\\overline{\\rho}_{E', 5}</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\overline{\\rho}_{E, 5}</math> ''and'' such that its associated mod-3 Galois representation <math>\\overline{\\rho}_{E, 3}</math> is irreducible (and therefore modular by Langlands\u2013Tunnell).<ref>Chapter 5 of {{cite journal|last=Wiles|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Wiles|year=1995|title=Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem|url=http://math.stanford.edu/~lekheng/flt/wiles.pdf|journal=Annals of Mathematics|volume=141|issue=3|pages=443\u2013551|oclc=37032255|doi=10.2307/2118559|jstor=2118559|citeseerx=10.1.1.169.9076}}</ref>\n\n===Structure of Wiles's proof===\nIn his 108-page article published in 1995, Wiles divides the subject matter up into the following chapters (preceded here by page numbers):\n:Introduction\n::443\n:Chapter 1\n::455 1.

The corrected proof was published in 1995.<ref name=\"abelcitation\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.abelprize.no/c67107/binfil/download.php?tid=67059|title=The Abel Prize 2016|date=2016|website=Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|access-date=29 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nWiles's proof uses many techniques from [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]], and has many ramifications in these branches of mathematics.

For solving Fermat's Last Theorem, he was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Knighthood|knighted]], and received other honours such as the 2016 [[Abel Prize]]. When announcing that Wiles had won the Abel Prize, the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] described his achievement as a \"stunning proof\".<ref name=\"abelcitation\" />\n\n== Precursors to Wiles's proof==\n\n=== Fermat's Last Theorem and progress prior to 1980===\n{{main|Fermat's Last Theorem}}\n\n[[Fermat's Last Theorem]], formulated in 1637, states that no three distinct positive integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' can satisfy the equation\n: <math>a^n + b^n=c^n </math>\nif ''n'' is an integer greater than two (''n'' > 2).\n\nOver time, this simple assertion became one of the most famous unproved claims in mathematics.  Between its publication and Andrew Wiles's eventual solution over 350 years later, many mathematicians and amateurs attempted to prove this statement, either for all values of n > 2, or for specific cases. It spurred the development of entire new areas within [[number theory]]. Proofs were eventually found for all values of n up to around 4 million, first by hand, and later by computer.  But no general proof was found that would be valid for all possible values of ''n'', nor even a hint how such a proof could be undertaken.\n\n===The Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture===\n{{main|Modularity theorem}}\n\nSeparately from anything related to Fermat's Last Theorem, in the 1950s and 1960s Japanese mathematician [[Goro Shimura]], drawing on ideas posed by [[Yutaka Taniyama]], conjectured that a connection might exist between [[elliptic curve]]s and [[modular form]]s. These were mathematical objects with no known connection between them. Taniyama and Shimura posed the question whether, unknown to mathematicians, the two kinds of object were actually identical mathematical objects, just seen in different ways.\n\nThey conjectured that every [[rational number|rational]] elliptic curve is also [[classical modular curve|modular]]. This became known as the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture. In the West, this conjecture became well known through a 1967 paper by [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]], who gave conceptual evidence for it; thus, it is sometimes called the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture.\n\nBy around 1980, much evidence had been accumulated to form conjectures about elliptic curves, and many papers had been written which examined the consequences if the conjecture was true, but the actual conjecture itself was unproven and generally considered inaccessible - meaning that mathematicians believed a proof of the conjecture was probably impossible using current knowledge. \n\nFor decades, the conjecture remained an important but unsolved problem in mathematics. Around 50 years after first being proposed, the conjecture was finally proven and renamed the [[modularity theorem]], largely as a result of Andrew Wiles's work described below.\n\n===Frey's curve===\nOn yet another separate branch of development, in the late 1960s, Yves Hellegouarch came up with the idea of associating solutions (''a'',''b'',''c'') of Fermat's equation with a completely different mathematical object: an elliptic curve.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Hellegouarch | first=Yves | title=Invitation to the Mathematics of Fermat\u2013Wiles | publisher=Academic Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-12-339251-0 }}</ref> The curve consists of all points in the plane whose coordinates (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') satisfy the relation\n: <math> y^2 = x(x-a^n)(x+b^n). </math>\nSuch an elliptic curve would enjoy very special properties, which are due to the appearance of high powers of integers in its equation and the fact that ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''c''<sup>''n''</sup> is an ''n''th power as well.\n\nIn 1982\u20131985, [[Gerhard Frey]] called attention to the unusual properties of this same curve, now called a [[Frey curve]]. He showed that it was likely that the curve could link Fermat and Taniyama, since any [[counterexample]] to Fermat's Last Theorem would probably also imply that an elliptic curve existed that was not [[modular curve|modular]]. Frey showed that there were good reasons to believe that any set of numbers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''n'') capable of disproving Fermat's Last Theorem could also probably be used to disprove the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture. Therefore, if the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture were true, no set of numbers capable of disproving Fermat could exist, so Fermat's Last Theorem would have to be true as well.\n\nMathematically, the conjecture says that each elliptic curve with [[Rational number|rational]] coefficients can be constructed in an entirely different way, not by giving its equation but by using [[modular function]]s to [[Parametric equation|parametrise]] coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' of the points on it. Thus, according to the conjecture, any elliptic curve over '''Q''' would have to be a [[modular elliptic curve]], yet if a solution to Fermat's equation with non-zero ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''n'' greater than 2 existed, the corresponding curve would not be modular, resulting in a contradiction. If the link identified by Frey could be proven, then in turn, it would mean that a proof or disproof of either Fermat's Last Theorem or the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture would simultaneously prove or disprove the other.<ref>Singh, pp. 194\u2013198; Aczel, pp. 109\u2013114.</ref>\n\n===Ribet's theorem===\n{{main|Ribet's theorem}}\n\nTo complete this link,  it was necessary to show that Frey's intuition was correct: that a Frey curve, if it existed, could not be modular. In 1985, [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] provided a partial proof that a Frey curve could not be modular. Serre did not provide a complete proof of his proposal; the missing part (which Serre had noticed early on<ref name=\"CornellBook\"/>{{rp|1}}) became known as the [[epsilon theorem|epsilon conjecture]] or \u03b5-conjecture (it is now known as [[Ribet's theorem]]). Serre's main interest was in an even more ambitious conjecture, [[Serre conjecture (number theory)|Serre's conjecture]] on modular [[Galois representations]], which would imply the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture. However his partial proof came close to confirming the link between Fermat and Taniyama.\n\nIn the summer of 1986, [[Kenneth Alan Ribet|Ken Ribet]] succeeded in proving the epsilon conjecture, now known as [[Ribet's theorem]].  His article was published in 1990. In doing so, Ribet finally proved the link between the two theorems by confirming as Frey had suggested, that a proof of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture for the kinds of elliptic curves Frey had identified, together with Ribet's theorem, would also prove Fermat's Last Theorem:\n\nIn mathematical terms, Ribet's theorem showed that if the Galois representation associated with an elliptic curve has certain properties (which Frey's curve has), then that curve cannot be modular, in the sense that there cannot exist a modular form which gives rise to the same Galois representation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210102243/http://cgd.best.vwh.net/home/flt/flt08.htm|title=The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|last=Daney|first=Charles|date=13 March 1996|access-date=2017-06-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Situation prior to Wiles's proof ===\n\nFollowing the developments related to the Frey Curve, and its link to both Fermat and Taniyama, a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem would follow from a proof of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture \u2014 or at least a proof of the conjecture for the kinds of elliptic curves that included Frey's equation (known as [[semistable elliptic curve]]s).\n\n:* From Ribet's Theorem and the Frey Curve, any 4 numbers able to be used to disprove Fermat's Last Theorem could also be used to make a semistable elliptic curve (\"Frey's curve\") that could never be modular;\n:* But if the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture were also true for semistable elliptic curves, then by definition every Frey's curve that existed must be modular.\n:* The contradiction could have [[proof by contradiction|only one answer]]: if Ribet's Theorem and the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture for semistable curves were both true, then it would mean there could not be any solutions to Fermat's equation &ndash; because then there would be no Frey curves at all, meaning no contradictions would exist. This would finally prove Fermat's Last Theorem.\n\nHowever, despite the progress made by Serre and Ribet, this approach to Fermat was widely considered unusable as well, since almost all mathematicians saw the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture itself as completely inaccessible to proof with current knowledge.<ref name=\"Singh\" />{{rp|203\u2013205, 223, 226}} For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] stated that it seemed \"impossible to actually prove\",<ref name=\"Singh\" />{{rp|226}} and Ken Ribet considered himself \"one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible\".<ref name=\"Singh\" />{{rp|223}}\n\n==Andrew Wiles==\nHearing of Ribet's 1986 proof of the epsilon conjecture, English mathematician Andrew Wiles, who had studied elliptic curves and had a childhood fascination with Fermat, decided to begin working in secret towards a proof of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture, since it was now professionally justifiable<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/andrew-wiles-fermat.html|title=Andrew Wiles on Solving Fermat|date=1 November 2000|website=PBS|access-date=29 June 2017}}</ref> as well as because of the enticing goal of proving such a long-standing problem.\n\nRibet later commented that \"Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it].\"&nbsp;<ref name=\"Singh\" />{{rp|223}}\n\n==Announcement and subsequent developments==\nWiles initially presented his proof in 1993.

Mathematicians were beginning to pressure Wiles to disclose his work whether or not complete, so that the wider community could explore and use whatever he had managed to accomplish. Instead of being fixed, the problem, which had originally seemed minor, now seemed very significant, far more serious, and less easy to resolve.<ref>Singh, pp. 175-185.</ref>\n\nWiles states that on the morning of 19 September 1994, he was on the verge of giving up and was almost resigned to accepting that he had failed, and to publishing his work so that others could build on it and find the error. He states that he was having a final look to try and understand the fundamental reasons why his approach could not be made to work, when he had a sudden insight that the specific reason why the Kolyvagin\u2013Flach approach would not work directly, also meant that his original attempts using [[Iwasawa theory]] could be made to work if he strengthened it using his experience gained from the Kolyvagin\u2013Flach approach since then. Each was inadequate by itself, but fixing one approach with tools from the other would resolve the issue and produce a [[class number formula]] (CNF) valid for all cases that were not already proven by his refereed paper:<ref name=\"sept1994\" /><ref>Aczel, pp. 132\u2013134.</ref><ref name=\"sept1994\" />\n\n:\"I was sitting at my desk examining the Kolyvagin\u2013Flach method.

The contradiction shows that the assumption must have been incorrect.\n\nThe proof falls roughly in two parts. In the first part, Wiles proves a general result about \"[[Lift (mathematics)|lifts]]\", known as the \"modularity lifting theorem\". This first part allows him to prove results about elliptic curves by converting them to problems about [[Galois representation]]s of elliptic curves.  He then uses this result to prove that all semi-stable curves are modular, by proving that the ''Galois representations'' of these curves are modular.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\" valign=\"top\"\n| &nbsp; \n! style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\" | Outline proof\n! style=\"text-align:center;background-color:lightgreen\" width=\"50%\" | Comment\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color:PaleGoldenrod\" | Part 1: setting up the proof\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 1 \n| We start by assuming that Fermat's Last Theorem is incorrect.

This means a set of numbers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''n'') must exist that is a solution of Fermat's equation, and we can use the solution to create a [[Frey curve]] which is semi-stable and elliptic. So we assume that (somehow) we have found a solution and created such a curve (which we will call \"''E''\"), and see what happens.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | &nbsp;\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color:PaleGoldenrod\" | Part 2: the Modularity Lifting Theorem\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 4\n| Galois representations of elliptic curves ''&rho;''(''E'', ''p'') for any prime ''p'' > 3 have been studied by many mathematicians.\n\nWiles aims first of all to prove a result about these representations, that he will use later: that if a semi-stable elliptic curve ''E'' has a Galois representation ''&rho;''(''E'', ''p'') that is modular, the elliptic curve itself must be modular.\n\nProving this is helpful in two ways: it makes counting and matching easier, and, significantly, to prove the representation is modular, we would only have to prove it for one single prime number ''p'', and we can do this using ''any prime'' that makes our work easy &ndash; it does not matter which prime we use.\n\nThis is the most difficult part of the problem &ndash; technically it means proving that if the Galois representation ''&rho;''(''E'', ''p'') is a modular form, so are all the other related Galois representations ''&rho;''(''E'', ''p''<sup>&infin;</sup>) for all powers of p.<ref name=\"abelcitation\" />  This is the so-called \"[[Lift (mathematics)|modular lifting]] problem\", and Wiles approached it using [[Deformation theory|deformations]].\n\n:Any elliptic curve (or a representation of an elliptic curve) can be categorized as either [[Irreducible (mathematics)|''reducible'' or ''irreducible'']]. The proof will be slightly different depending whether or not the elliptic curve's representation is reducible.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | To compare elliptic curves and modular forms directly is difficult. Past efforts to count and match elliptic curves and modular forms had all failed. But elliptic curves can be [[Representation (mathematics)|represented]] within [[Galois theory]]. Wiles realized that working with the representations of elliptic curves instead of the curves themselves would make counting and matching them to modular forms far easier. From this point on, the proof primarily aims to prove:\n: (1) if the geometric Galois representation of a semi-stable elliptic curve is modular, so is the curve itself; and\n: (2) the geometric Galois representations of all semi-stable elliptic curves are modular.\nTogether, these allow us to work with representations of curves rather than directly with elliptic curves themselves. Our original goal will have been transformed into proving the modularity of geometric Galois representations of semi-stable elliptic curves, instead. Wiles described this realization as a \"key breakthrough\".\n\nA Galois representation of an elliptic curves is ''G''->GL('''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>).  To show that a geometric Galois representation of an elliptic curve is a modular form, we need to find a [[Eigenform|normalized eigenform]] whose [[eigenvalue]]s (which are also its [[Fourier series]] coefficients) satisfy a [[congruence relation]]ship for all but a finite number of primes.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 5\n| Wiles's initial strategy is to count and match using [[proof by induction]] and a [[Class number formula|Class Number Formula]] (\"CNF\"): an approach in which, once the hypothesis is proved for one elliptic curve, it can automatically be extended to be proven for all subsequent elliptic curves. \n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | It was in this area that Wiles found difficulties, first with horizontal [[Iwasawa theory]] and later with his extension of Kolyvagin&ndash;Flach. Wiles's work extending Kolyvagin\u2013Flach was mainly related to making Kolyvagin\u2013Flach strong enough to prove the full CNF he would use. It later turned out that neither of these approaches by itself could produce a CNF able to cover all types of semi-stable elliptic curves, and the final piece of his proof in 1995 was to realize that he could succeed by strengthening Iwasawa theory with the techniques from Kolyvagin&ndash;Flach.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 6\n| At this point, the proof has shown a key point about Galois representations: \n: If the geometric Galois representation ''&rho;''(''E'',''p'') of a semi-stable elliptic curve ''E'' is irreducible and modular (for some prime number p > 2), then subject to some technical conditions, E is modular.\nThis is Wiles's ''lifting theorem'' (or ''modularity lifting theorem''), a major and revolutionary accomplishment at the time. \n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | Crucially, this result does not just show that modular irreducible representations imply modular curves. It also means we can prove a representation is modular by using any prime number&nbsp;>&nbsp;2 that we find easiest to use (because proving it for just one prime&nbsp;>&nbsp;2 proves it for all primes&nbsp;>&nbsp;2).\n\nSo we can try to prove all of our elliptic curves are modular by using one prime number as ''p'' - but if we do not succeed in proving this for all elliptic curves, perhaps we can prove the rest by choosing different prime numbers as 'p' for the difficult cases.\n\nThe proof must cover the Galois representations of all semi-stable elliptic curves ''E'', but for each individual curve, we only need to prove it is modular using one prime number ''p''.)\n|-\n! colspan = \"3\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color:PaleGoldenrod\" | Part 3: Proving that all semi-stable elliptic curves are modular\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 7\n| With the lifting theorem proved, we return to the original problem. We will categorize all semi-stable elliptic curves based on the reducibility of their Galois representations, and use the powerful lifting theorem on the results.\n\nFrom above, it does not matter which prime is chosen for the representations. We can use any one prime number that is easiest. 3 is the smallest prime number more than 2, and some work has already been done on representations of elliptic curves using ''&rho;''(''E'',3), so choosing 3 as our prime number is a helpful starting point.\n\nWiles found that it was easier to prove the representation was modular by choosing a prime p=3 in the cases where the representation ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is irreducible, but the proof when ''&rho;''(''E'',3)  is reducible was easier to prove by choosing ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5. So the proof splits in two at this point. \n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | The proof's use of both p=3 and p=5 below, is the so-called \"3/5 switch\" referred to in some descriptions of the proof, which Wiles noticed in a paper of Mazur's in 1993, although the trick itself dates back to the 19th century.\n\nThe switch between p=3 and p=5 has since opened a significant area of study in its own right ''(see [[Serre's modularity conjecture]])''.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 8\n| If the Galois representation ''&rho;''(''E'',3) (i.e., using ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3) is irreducible, then it was known from around 1980 that its Galois representation is also always modular.\n\nWiles uses his modularity lifting theorem to make short work of this case:  \n:* If the representation ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is irreducible, then we know the representation is also modular (Langlands and Tunnell), but...\n:* ... if the representation is both irreducible and modular then ''E'' itself is modular (modularity lifting theorem).\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | Langlands and Tunnell proved this in two papers in the early 1980s. The proof is based on the fact that ''&rho;''(''E'',3) has the same [[symmetry group]] as the general [[quartic equation]] in one variable, which was one of the few general classes of [[diophantine equation]] known at that time to be modular.\n\nThis existing result for p=3 is crucial to Wiles's approach and is one reason for initially using p=3.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 9\n| So we now consider what happens if ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is reducible.\n\nWiles found that when the representation of an elliptic curve using p=3 is reducible, it was easier to work with p=5 and use his new lifting theorem to prove that ''&rho;''(''E'', 5) will always be modular, than to try and prove directly that ''&rho;''(''E'',3) itself is modular (remembering that we only need to prove it for one prime).\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | 5 is the next prime number after 3, and any prime number can be used, perhaps 5 will be an easier prime number to work with than 3? But it looks hopeless initially to prove that ''&rho;''(''E'', 5) is always modular, for much the same reason that the general [[quintic equation]] cannot be solved by radicals. So Wiles has to find a way around this.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 9.1 \n| style=\"padding-left:30px\" | If ''&rho;''(''E'',3) and ''&rho;''(''E'',5) are both reducible, Wiles proved directly that ''&rho;''(''E'',5) must be modular.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | &nbsp;\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 9.2\n| style=\"padding-left:30px\" | The last case is if ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is reducible and ''&rho;''(''E'',5) is irreducible.\n\nWiles showed that in this case, one could always find another semistable elliptic curve ''F'' such that the representation ''&rho;''(''F'',3) is irreducible and also the representations ''&rho;''(''E'',5) and ''&rho;''(''F'',5) are [[isomorphic]] (they have identical structures).\n\n:- The first of these properties shows that F must be modular (Langlands and Tunnell again: all irreducible representations with p=3 are modular). \n:- If F is modular then we know ''&rho;''(''F'',5) must be modular as well. \n:- But because the representations of ''E'' and ''F'' with ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 have exactly the same structure, and we know that ''&rho;''(''F'',5) is modular, ''&rho;''(''E'',5) must be modular as well.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | &nbsp;\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| 9.3\n| style=\"padding-left:30px\" | Therefore, if ''&rho;''(''E'',3) is reducible, we have proved that ''&rho;''(''E'',5) will always be modular.

Therefore no solutions to Fermat's equation can exist either, so Fermat's Last Theorem is also true.\n| style=\"background-color:lightgreen\" | We have our proof by contradiction, because we have proven that if Fermat's Last Theorem is incorrect, we could create an elliptic curve that cannot be modular (Ribet's Theorem) and must be modular (Wiles). As it cannot be both, the only answer is that no such curve exists.\n|}\n\n==Mathematical detail of Wiles proof==\n\n===Overview===\nWiles opted to attempt to match elliptic curves to a [[countable]] set of modular forms. He found that this direct approach was not working, so he transformed the problem by instead matching the [[Galois representation]]s of the elliptic curves to modular forms. Wiles denotes this matching (or mapping) that, more specifically, is a [[ring homomorphism]]:\n:<math> R_n \\rightarrow \\mathbf{T}_n. </math>\n<math>R</math> is a deformation ring and <math>\\mathbf{T}</math> is a [[Hecke algebra of a locally compact group|Hecke ring]].\n\nWiles had the insight that in many cases this ring [[homomorphism]] could be a ring [[isomorphism]] (Conjecture 2.16 in Chapter 2, \u00a73 of the 1995 paper<ref name=\"wiles1995\"/>). He realised that the map between <math>R</math> and <math>\\mathbf{T}</math> is an isomorphism if and only if two [[abelian group]]s occurring in the theory are finite and have the same [[cardinality]]. This is sometimes referred to as the \"numerical criterion\". Given this result, Fermat's Last Theorem is reduced to the statement that two groups have the same order. Much of the text of the proof leads into topics and theorems related to [[ring theory]] and [[commutation theory]]. Wiles's goal was to verify that the map <math> R \\rightarrow \\mathbf{T}</math> is an isomorphism and ultimately that <math> R = \\mathbf{T}</math>. In treating deformations, Wiles defined four cases, with the [[Group scheme#Finite flat group schemes|flat]] deformation case requiring more effort to prove and treated in a separate article in the same volume entitled \"Ring-theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras\".\n\n[[Gerd Faltings]], in his bulletin, gives the following [[commutative diagram]] (p.&nbsp;745):\n\n:[[File:Faltings diagram.png|230px]]\n\nor ultimately that <math> R = \\mathbf{T}</math>, indicating a [[complete intersection]]. Since Wiles could not show that <math> R = \\mathbf{T}</math> directly, he did so through <math> \\mathbf{Z}_3, \\mathbf{F}_3 </math> and <math>\\mathbf{T}/\\mathfrak{m}</math> via [[Lift (mathematics)|lifts]].\n\nIn order to perform this matching, Wiles had to create a [[class number formula]] (CNF). He first attempted to use horizontal [[Iwasawa theory]] but that part of his work had an unresolved issue such that he could not create a CNF. At the end of the summer of 1991, he learned about an [[Euler system]] recently developed by [[Victor Kolyvagin]] and [[Matthias Flach (mathematician)|Matthias Flach]] that seemed \"tailor made\" for the inductive part of his proof, which could be used to create a CNF, and so Wiles set his Iwasawa work aside and began working to extend Kolyvagin and Flach's work instead, in order to create the CNF his proof would require.<ref>Singh p.259-262</ref> By the spring of 1993, his work had covered all but a few families of elliptic curves, and in early 1993, Wiles was confident enough of his nearing success to let one trusted colleague into his secret. Since his work relied extensively on using the Kolyvagin&ndash;Flach approach, which was new to mathematics and to Wiles, and which he had also extended, in January 1993 he asked his Princeton colleague, [[Nick Katz]], to help him review his work for subtle errors. Their conclusion at the time was that the techniques Wiles used seemed to work correctly.<ref name=\"Singh\" />{{rp|261\u2013265}}<ref>Singh, pp. 239\u2013243; Aczel, pp. 122\u2013125.</ref>\n\nWiles' use of Kolyvagin&ndash;Flach would later be found to be the point of failure in the original proof submission, and he eventually had to revert to Iwasawa theory and a collaboration with Richard Taylor to fix it. In May 1993, while reading a paper by Mazur, Wiles had the insight that the 3/5 switch would resolve the final issues and would then cover all elliptic curves.\n\n===General approach and strategy===\nGiven an elliptic curve ''E'' over the field '''Q''' of rational numbers <math> E(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}) </math>, for every prime power <math>\\ell^n</math>, there exists a [[homomorphism]] from the [[absolute Galois group]]\n:<math> \\operatorname{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}/\\mathbf{Q}) </math>\nto\n:<math> \\operatorname{GL}_2(\\mathbf{Z}/l^n \\mathbf{Z}), </math>\nthe group of [[Invertible matrix|invertible]] 2 by 2 matrices whose entries are integers modulo <math>\\ell^n</math>.  This is because <math>E(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}})</math>, the points of ''E'' over <math>\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}</math>, form an [[abelian group]], on which <math>\\operatorname{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}/\\mathbf{Q})</math> acts; the subgroup of elements ''x'' such that <math>\\ell^n x = 0</math> is just <math>(\\mathbf{Z}/\\ell^n \\mathbf{Z})^2</math>, and an [[automorphism]] of this group is a matrix of the type described.\n\nLess obvious is that given a modular form of a certain special type, a [[Hecke eigenform]] with eigenvalues in '''Q''', one also gets a homomorphism from the absolute Galois group\n:<math>\\operatorname{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbf{Q}}/\\mathbf{Q}) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{GL}_2(\\mathbf{Z}/l^n \\mathbf{Z}).</math>\nThis goes back to Eichler and Shimura.  The idea is that the Galois group acts first on the modular curve on which the modular form is defined, thence on the [[Jacobian variety]] of the curve, and finally on the points of <math>\\ell^n</math> power order on that Jacobian.  The resulting representation is not usually 2-dimensional, but the [[Hecke operator]]s cut out a 2-dimensional piece.  It is easy to demonstrate that these representations come from some elliptic curve but the converse is the difficult part to prove.\n\nInstead of trying to go directly from the elliptic curve to the modular form, one can first pass to the <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, \\ell^n)</math> representation for some ''\u2113'' and ''n'', and from that to the modular form.  In the case ''\u2113''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 and ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, results of the [[Artin L-function#The Artin conjecture|Langlands\u2013Tunnell theorem]] show that the <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, 3)</math> representation of any elliptic curve over '''Q''' comes from a modular form.  The basic strategy is to use induction on ''n'' to show that this is true for ''\u2113''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 and any ''n'', that ultimately there is a single modular form that works for all n.  To do this, one uses a counting argument, comparing the number of ways in which one can [[Lift (mathematics)|lift]] a <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, \\ell^n)</math> Galois representation to <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, \\ell^{n+1})</math> and the number of ways in which one can lift a <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, \\ell^n)</math> modular form.  An essential point is to impose a sufficient set of conditions on the Galois representation; otherwise, there will be too many lifts and most will not be modular.  These conditions should be satisfied for the representations coming from modular forms and those coming from elliptic curves. \n\n===3-5 trick===\nIf the original <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, 3)</math> representation has an image which is too small, one runs into trouble with the lifting argument, and in this case, there is a final trick which has since been studied in greater generality in the subsequent work on the [[Serre conjecture (number theory)|Serre Modularity Conjecture]]. The idea involves the interplay between the <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, 3)</math> and <math>(\\mathrm{mod} \\, 5)</math> representations. In particular, if the mod-5 Galois representation <math>\\overline{\\rho}_{E, 5}</math> associated to an semistable elliptic curve ''E'' over '''Q''' is irreducible, then there is another semistable elliptic curve <var>E'</var> over '''Q''' such that its associated mod-5 Galois representation <math>\\overline{\\rho}_{E', 5}</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\overline{\\rho}_{E, 5}</math> ''and'' such that its associated mod-3 Galois representation <math>\\overline{\\rho}_{E, 3}</math> is irreducible (and therefore modular by Langlands\u2013Tunnell).<ref>Chapter 5 of {{cite journal|last=Wiles|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Wiles|year=1995|title=Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem|url=http://math.stanford.edu/~lekheng/flt/wiles.pdf|journal=Annals of Mathematics|volume=141|issue=3|pages=443\u2013551|oclc=37032255|doi=10.2307/2118559|jstor=2118559|citeseerx=10.1.1.169.9076}}</ref>\n\n===Structure of Wiles's proof===\nIn his 108-page article published in 1995, Wiles divides the subject matter up into the following chapters (preceded here by page numbers):\n:Introduction\n::443\n:Chapter 1\n::455 1.
