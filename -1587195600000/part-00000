The only child of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], he succeeded to the English throne at the age of nine months upon his father's death, and succeeded to the French throne on the death of his maternal grandfather [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] shortly afterwards.\n\nHenry inherited the long-running [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453), in which his uncle [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] contested [[English claims to the French throne|his claim to the French throne]]. He is the only English monarch to also have been crowned [[King of France]] (as '''Henry II''', in 1431). His early reign, when [[Regency government, 1422\u20131437|several people were ruling for him]], saw the pinnacle of English power in France, but subsequent military, diplomatic, and economic problems had seriously endangered the English cause by the time Henry was declared fit to rule in 1437. He found his realm in a difficult position, faced with setbacks in France and divisions among the nobility at home. Unlike his father, Henry is described as timid, shy, passive, well-intentioned, and averse to warfare and violence; he was also at times mentally unstable. His ineffective reign saw the gradual loss of the [[Dual monarchy of England and France|English lands in France]]. Partially in the hope of achieving peace, in 1445 Henry married Charles VII's niece, the ambitious and strong-willed [[Margaret of Anjou]]. The peace policy failed, leading to the murder of one of Henry's key advisers, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole]], and the war recommenced, with France taking the upper hand; by 1453, [[Pale of Calais|Calais]] was Henry's only remaining territory on the continent.\n\nAs the situation in France worsened, there was a related increase in political instability in England. With Henry effectively unfit to rule, power was exercised by quarrelsome nobles, while [[political faction|factions]] and [[favourite]]s encouraged the rise of disorder in the country. Regional magnates and soldiers returning from France formed and maintained increasing numbers of private armed [[retinue|retainers]], with whom they fought one another, terrorised their neighbours, paralysed the courts, and dominated the government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cram |date=1948 |first=Paul |section=Western Europe |title=Encyclopedia of World History |title-link=Encyclopedia of World History |edition=revised |editor=[[William L.

Starting in 1453, Henry had a series of mental breakdowns, and tensions mounted between Margaret and Richard of York over control of the incapacitated king's government, and over the question of [[History of the English line of succession|succession to the throne]]. Civil war broke out in 1455, leading to a long period of [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]] known as the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Henry was deposed on 29 March 1461 after a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Towton]] by Richard's son, who took the throne as [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. Despite Margaret continuing to lead a resistance to Edward, Henry was captured by Edward's forces in 1465 and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. [[Readeption of Henry VI|Henry was restored to the throne]] in 1470, but Edward retook power in 1471, killing [[Edward of Westminster|Henry's only son and heir]] in battle and imprisoning Henry once again.\n\nHaving \"lost his wits, his two kingdoms, and his only son\",{{sfn|Cheetham|2000|p=44}} Henry died in the Tower during the night of 21 May, possibly killed on the orders of Edward. <!--He was buried at [[Chertsey Abbey]], before being moved to [[Windsor Castle]] in 1484. -->[[Miracle]]s were attributed to Henry after his death, and he was informally regarded as a [[saint]] and [[martyr]] until the 16th century. He left a legacy of educational institutions, having founded [[Eton College]], [[King's College, Cambridge]], and (together with [[Henry Chichele]]) [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] wrote [[Henry VI (play)|a trilogy of plays about his life]], depicting him as weak-willed and easily influenced by his wife, Margaret.\n\n==Child king==\n{{main|Dual monarchy of England and France|Regency government, 1422\u20131437}}\n[[File:Henry VI accession.jpg|thumb|left|upright|180 px|Henry VI, aged nine months, is shown being placed in the care of the [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]]]]\nHenry was the only child and heir of King Henry V.

A few weeks later, on 21 October 1422, in accordance with the [[Treaty of Troyes]] of 1420, he became titular King of France upon his grandfather Charles VI's death. His mother, [[Catherine of Valois]], was then 20 years old. As Charles VI's daughter, she was viewed with considerable suspicion by English nobles and was prevented from playing a full role in her son's upbringing.\n\nOn 28 September 1423, the nobles swore loyalty to Henry VI, who was not yet two years old. They summoned [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in the King's name and established a [[Regency government, 1422\u20131437|regency council]] to govern until the King should come of age. One of Henry V's surviving brothers, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John, Duke of Bedford]], was appointed senior [[regent]] of the realm and was in charge of the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|ongoing war in France]]. During Bedford's absence, the government of England was headed by Henry V's other surviving brother, [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], who was appointed [[Lord Protector]] and Defender of the Realm. His duties were limited to keeping the peace and summoning Parliament. Henry V's half-uncle [[Henry Beaufort]], [[Bishop of Winchester]] (after 1426 also [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]), had an important place on the Council. After the Duke of Bedford died in 1435, the Duke of Gloucester claimed the Regency himself, but was contested in this by the other members of the Council.\n\nFrom 1428, Henry's tutor was [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick]], whose [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick|father]] had been instrumental in [[Lords Appellant|the opposition to Richard II's reign]]. For the period 1430-1432, Henry was also tutored by the physician [[John Somerset]]. Somerset's duties were to 'tutor the young king as well as preserving his health'.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=26012|title=Somerset, John |first=Carole |last=Rawcliffe}}</ref> Somerset remained within the royal household until early 1451 after the commons petitioned for his removal because of his 'dangerous and subversive influence over Henry VI'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rawcliffe|first=Carole|date=1988|title=The Profits of Practice: The Wealth and Status of Medical Men in Later Medieval England|url=|journal=Social History of Medicine|volume=1|issue=1|page=71|doi=10.1093/shm/1.1.61}}</ref>\n\nHenry's half-brothers [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond|Edmund]] and [[Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford|Jasper]], the sons of his widowed mother and [[Owen Tudor]], were later given earldoms.

After the death of King Henry V, England had lost momentum in the [[Hundred Years' War]], whereas the House of Valois had gained ground beginning with [[Joan of Arc]]'s military victories in the year 1429. The young king came to favour a policy of peace in France and thus favoured the faction around [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]] and [[William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk]], who thought likewise, while [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], and [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], who argued for a continuation of the war, were ignored.\n\n==Marriage==\nAs the English military situation in France deteriorated, talks emerged in England about arranging a marriage for the king to strengthen England's foreign connections{{sfn|Tout|1891|p=58}} and facilitate a peace between the warring parties. In 1434, the English council suggested that peace with the Scots could best be effected by wedding Henry to one of the daughters of the [[James I of Scotland|king of Scotland]]; the proposal came to nothing. During the [[Congress of Arras]] in 1435, the English put forth the idea of a union between the English king and a daughter of [[Charles VII of France]], but the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]] refused even to contemplate the suggestion unless Henry renounced his claim to the French throne. Another proposal in 1438 to a daughter of [[Albert II of Germany|Albert II, King of Germany]], likewise failed.{{sfn|Tout|1891|p=58}}\n\nBetter prospects for England arose amidst a growing effort by French lords to resist the growing power of the French monarchy, a conflict which culminated in the [[Praguerie]] revolt of 1440.{{sfn|Tout|1891|p=58}} Though the English failed to take advantage of the Praguerie itself, the prospect of gaining the allegiance of one of Charles VII's more rebellious nobles was attractive from a military perspective. In about 1441, the recently ransomed [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in an attempt to force Charles VII to make peace with the English, suggested a marriage between Henry VI and a daughter of [[John IV, Count of Armagnac]],{{sfn|Tout|1891|p=59}} a powerful noble in southwestern France who was at odds with the [[House of Valois|Valois]] crown.{{sfn|Dicks|1967|pp=5\u20136}} An alliance with Armagnac would have helped to protect English [[Gascony]] from increasing French threats in the region, especially in the face of defections to the enemy by local English vassals,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=461}} and might have helped to wean some other French nobles to the English party.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The proposal was seriously entertained between 1441 and 1443, but a massive French campaign in 1442 against Gascony disrupted the work of the ambassadors{{sfn|Dicks|1967|pp=9, 11}} and frightened the count of Armagnac into reluctance.{{sfn|Dicks|1967|p=11}} The deal fell through due to problems in commissioning portraits of Armagnac's daughters{{sfn|Dicks|1967|pp=10\u201311}} and the count's imprisonment by Charles VII's men in 1443.{{sfn|Dicks|1967|p=12}}\n\n[[File:MargaretAnjou.jpg|thumb|left|upright|180 px|[[Margaret of Anjou]], depicted in the [[Talbot Shrewsbury Book]], 1444\u201345]]\n\nCardinal Beaufort and the Earl of Suffolk persuaded the king that the best way to pursue peace with France was through a marriage with Margaret of Anjou, the niece of King Charles VII. Henry agreed, especially when he heard reports of Margaret's stunning beauty, and sent Suffolk to negotiate with Charles, who consented to the marriage on condition that he would not have to provide the customary [[dowry]] and instead would receive the province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] from the English. These conditions were agreed in the [[Treaty of Tours]] in 1444, but the cession of Maine was kept secret from parliament, as it was known that this would be hugely unpopular with the English populace. The marriage took place at [[Titchfield Abbey]] on 23 April 1445, one month after Margaret's 15th birthday. She had arrived with an established household, composed primarily not of Angevins, but of members of  Henry's royal servants; this increase in the size of the royal household, and a concomitant increase on the birth of their son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward of Westminster]] in 1453, led to proportionately greater expense but also to greater patronage opportunities at Court.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=298}}\n\nHenry had wavered in yielding Maine to Charles, knowing that the move was unpopular and would be opposed by the dukes of Gloucester and York, and also because Maine was vital to the defence of [[Normandy]]. However, Margaret was determined that he should see it through. As the treaty became public knowledge in 1446, public anger focused on the Earl of Suffolk, but Henry and Margaret were determined to protect him.\n\n==Ascendancy of Suffolk and Somerset==\n[[File:Salut d'or.jpg|thumb|''Salut d'or'', depicting Henry as King of England and France, struck in [[Rouen]]]]\nIn 1447, the King and Queen summoned the Duke of Gloucester to appear before parliament on the charge of treason. Queen Margaret had no tolerance for any sign of disloyalty towards her husband and kingdom, thus any suspicion of this was immediately brought to her attention. This move was instigated by Gloucester's enemies, the Earl of Suffolk, whom Margaret held in great esteem, and the aging Cardinal Beaufort and his nephew, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Earl of Somerset]]. Gloucester was put in custody in [[Bury St Edmunds]], where he died, probably of a heart attack (although contemporary rumours spoke of poisoning) before he could be tried.{{efn|With the king's only remaining uncle dead, there were many, though no obvious, candidates to succeed Henry VI to the throne if he died childless. Henry VI's grandfather [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] had inaugurated a trend of favouring male succession by his deposition of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in 1399. By this logic, the most senior candidate in the royal family, through [[Patrilineality|male line]] descent from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], was Richard of York, or his rival Edmund Beaufort (the Earl of Somerset) in case the Beaufort line was declared eligible to succeed (Henry IV had barred them from succession due to their initial illegitimacy). Through [[primogeniture]] however, which was the traditional method of English succession, the legitimate successor would be [[Afonso V of Portugal]] through his descent from [[Philippa of Lancaster|Henry IV's eldest sister]], but his status as a foreign monarch made him very unlikely to become king. An alternative line of succession would be the descendants of [[Elizabeth of Lancaster, Duchess of Exeter|Henry IV's second sister]], whose son was [[John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter]]. A fifth candidate to the throne was [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]], who was the [[heir general]] of the [[House of Lancaster]] (through Henry IV's semi-legitimate brother, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]]), if the Beaufort family was admitted into the succession line. She would later marry Henry VI's maternal half-brother [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond]], and originate the Tudor claim to the throne.}}\n\nThe Duke of York, being the most powerful duke in the realm, and also being both an [[agnate]] and the [[heir general]] of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] (thus having, according to some, a better claim to the throne than Henry VI himself), probably had the best chances to succeed to the throne after Gloucester. However, he was excluded from the court circle and sent to govern [[Lordship of Ireland|Ireland]], while his opponents, the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset, were promoted to [[Duke]]s, a title at that time still normally reserved for immediate relatives of the monarch.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Keen |title=England in the Later Middle Ages |publisher=Routledge |location=London |date=1973 |isbn=9780415027830 |page=438}}</ref> The new Duke of Somerset was sent to France to assume the command of the English forces; this prestigious position was previously held by the Duke of York himself, who was dismayed at his term not being renewed and at seeing his enemy take control of it.\n\nIn the later years of Henry's reign, the monarchy became increasingly unpopular, due to a breakdown in law and order, corruption, the distribution of royal land to the king's court [[favourite]]s, the troubled state of the crown's finances, and the steady loss of territories in France. In 1447, this unpopularity took the form of a Commons campaign against [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], who was the most unpopular of all the King's entourage and widely seen as a traitor. He was impeached by Parliament to a background that has been called \"the baying for Suffolk\u2019s blood [by] a London mob\",<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'' Yale 2002, p. 67</ref> to the extent that Suffolk admitted his alarm to the king.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=677}} Ultimately, Henry was forced to send him into [[exile]], but Suffolk's ship was intercepted in the [[English Channel]]. His murdered body was found on the beach at [[Dover]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Norman |editor-last=Davis |title=The Paston Letters |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1999 |chapter=Letter 14 |pages=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nIn 1449, the Duke of Somerset, leading the campaign in France, reopened hostilities in [[Normandy]] (although he had previously been one of the main advocates for peace), but by the autumn he had been pushed back to [[Caen]]. By 1450, the French had retaken the whole province, so hard won by Henry V. Returning troops, who had often not been paid, added to the lawlessness in the southern counties of England. [[Jack Cade]] led a rebellion in [[Kent]] in 1450, calling himself \"John Mortimer\", apparently in sympathy with York, and setting up residence at the [[White Hart]] Inn in Southwark (the [[hart (deer)|white hart]] had been the symbol of the deposed [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]).{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=628}} Henry came to London with an army to crush the rebellion, but on finding that Cade had fled kept most of his troops behind while a small force followed the rebels and met them at [[Sevenoaks]]. The flight proved to have been tactical: Cade successfully ambushed the force in the Battle of Solefields (near Sevenoaks) and returned to occupy London. In the end, the rebellion achieved nothing, and London was retaken after a few days of disorder; but this was principally because of the efforts of its own residents rather than those of the army.  At any rate the rebellion showed that feelings of discontent were running high.<ref>Sevenoaks Preservation Society: ''The Rising in Kent in 1450 A.D.'', J.K.D.  Copy in Sevenoaks public library.</ref>\n\nIn 1451, the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]], held since [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s time, was also lost. In October 1452, an English advance in Aquitaine retook [[Bordeaux]] and was having some success, but by 1453 Bordeaux was lost again, leaving [[Calais]] as England's only remaining territory on the continent.\n\n==Insanity, and the ascendancy of York==\n[[File:Henry VI enthroned - British Library Royal MS 15 E vi f405r (detail).jpg|thumb|300px|Depiction of Henry enthroned, from the [[Talbot Shrewsbury Book]], 1444\u201345]]\nIn 1452, the Duke of York was persuaded to return from Ireland, claim his rightful place on the council and put an end to bad government. His cause was a popular one and he soon raised an army at [[Shrewsbury]]. The court party, meanwhile, raised their own similar-sized force in London. A stand-off took place south of London, with York presenting a list of grievances and demands to the court circle, including the arrest of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. The king initially agreed, but Margaret intervened to prevent the arrest of Beaufort. By 1453, Somerset's influence had been restored, and York was again isolated. The court party was also strengthened by the announcement that the Queen was pregnant.\n\nHowever, on hearing of the final loss of Bordeaux in August 1453, Henry experienced a [[mental breakdown]] and became completely unresponsive to everything that was going on around him for more than a year.<ref>''Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses'', ed. John A. Wagner, (ABC-CLIO, 2001), 48.</ref> He even failed to respond to the birth of a son and heir, who was christened Edward. Henry may have inherited a psychiatric condition from Charles VI of France, his maternal grandfather, who was affected by intermittent periods of insanity during the last thirty years of his life.{{efn|Charles VI, in turn, may have inherited a condition from his mother, [[Joanna of Bourbon]], who also showed signs of [[mental illness]], or other members of her family, who showed signs of psychiatric instability, such as Joanna's father, [[Peter I, Duke of Bourbon]], and her grandfather, [[Louis I, Duke of Bourbon]]. Joanna's brother [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon]], is also reported to have exhibited symptoms of such a condition.}} During his bout of insanity, Henry was attended by the surgeons [[Gilbert Kymer]] and John Marchall. [[Thomas Morstede]] had previously been appointed royal surgeon and died in 1450.\n\nThe Duke of York, meanwhile, had gained a very important ally, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], one of the most influential magnates and possibly richer than York himself. York was named regent as Protector of the Realm in 1454. The queen was excluded completely, and Edmund Beaufort was detained in the Tower of London, while many of York's supporters spread rumours that Edward was not the king's son, but Beaufort's.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sadler |first=John |title=The Red Rose and the White: the Wars of the Roses 1453\u20131487 |publisher=Longman |date=2010 |pages=49\u201351}}</ref> Other than that, York's months as regent were spent tackling the problem of government overspending.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Wars of the Roses==\n{{main|Wars of the Roses}}\n[[File:Silver groat of Henry VI (YORYM 1994 151 265) obverse.jpg|thumb|[[Groat (coin)|Silver groat]] of Henry VI, York Museums Trust]]\n\nAround Christmas Day 1454, King Henry regained his senses. Disaffected nobles who had grown in power during Henry's reign, most importantly the Earls of Warwick and [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]], took matters into their own hands. They backed the claims of the rival [[House of York]], first to the control of government, and then to the throne itself (from 1460), pointing to York's better descent from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. It was agreed that York would become Henry's successor, despite York being older.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}} In 1458, in an attempt to unite the warring factions, Henry staged [[The Love Day]] in London.\n\nThere followed a violent struggle between the houses of [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and York. Henry was defeated and captured at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] on 10 July 1460. The Duke of York was killed by Margaret's forces at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] on 30 December 1460, and Henry was rescued from imprisonment after the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] on 17 February 1461. By then, however, Henry was suffering such a bout of madness that he was apparently laughing and singing while the battle raged. He was defeated at the [[Battle of Towton]] on 29 March 1461 by the son of the Duke of York, Edward of York, who then became King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. Edward failed to capture Henry and his queen, who fled to [[Scotland]]. During the first period of Edward IV's reign, Lancastrian resistance continued mainly under the leadership of Queen Margaret and the few nobles still loyal to her in the northern counties of England and Wales.\n\nFollowing his defeat in the [[Battle of Hexham]] on 15 May 1464, Henry found refuge, sheltered by Lancastrian supporters, at houses across the north of England. By July 1465, he was in hiding at Waddington Hall, in [[Waddington, Lancashire]], the home of Sir Richard Tempest. Here, he was betrayed by \"a black monk of Addington\" and on 13 July, a group of Yorkist men, including Sir Richard's brother John, entered the home to arrest him. Henry fled into nearby woods but was soon captured. He was subsequently held captive in the Tower of London.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OI6BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT195 |title=The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses and the Rise of the Tudors |first=Dan |last=Jones |date=2014 |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn= 9780571288090 |page=195}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rnWMjn2iCt0C&pg=PA333 |title=The Wars of the Roses |first=Alison |last=Weir |authorlink=Alison Weir |publisher=Random House |isbn=9780307806857 |date=2011 |page=333}}</ref>\n\nWhile imprisoned, Henry did some writing, including the following poem:{{poemquote|\nKingdoms are but cares\n::State is devoid of stay,\nRiches are ready snares,\n::And hasten to decay\nPleasure is a privy prick\n::Which vice doth still provoke;\nPomps, imprompt; and fame, a flame;\n::Power, a smoldering smoke.\nWho meanth to remove the rock\n::Owst of the slimy mud\nShall mire himself, and hardly scape\n::The swelling of the flood.{{sfn|Cheetham|2000|p=69}}}}\n\n==Return to the throne==\n{{main|Readeption of Henry VI}}\n[[File:Henry VI Angel 1470.jpg|thumb|Gold \"[[Angel (coin)|Angel]]\" coin of Henry's later reign, struck in either London or York, showing the [[Archangel Michael]] (hence the coin's name) slaying the Dragon (left), and Henry's shield being carried aboard a ship (right)]]Queen Margaret, exiled in Scotland and later in France, was determined to win back the throne on behalf of her husband and son.  By herself, there was little she could do.  However, eventually Edward IV fell out with two of his main supporters: Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and his own younger brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence]].  At the urging of King [[Louis XI of France]] they formed a secret alliance with Margaret.  After marrying [[Anne Neville|his daughter]] to Henry and Margaret's son, Edward of Westminster, Warwick returned to England, forced Edward IV into exile, and restored Henry VI to the throne on 3 October 1470; the term \"readeption\" is still sometimes used for this event. However, by this time, years in hiding followed by years in captivity had taken their toll on Henry.  Warwick and Clarence effectively ruled in his name.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=342\u2013344}}\n\nHenry's return to the throne lasted less than six months. Warwick soon overreached himself by declaring war on [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], whose ruler responded by giving Edward IV the assistance he needed to win back his throne by force. Edward IV returned to England in early 1471, after which he was reconciled with Clarence and killed Warwick at the [[Battle of Barnet]]. The Yorkists won a final decisive victory at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] on 4 May 1471, where Henry's son [[Edward of Westminster]] was killed.{{efn|The manner of the prince's death is one of historical speculation.  See: Desmond Seward. \"The Wars of the Roses\", and Charles Ross, \"Wars of the Roses\".

Official chronicles and documents state that the deposed king died on the night of 21 May 1471. In all likelihood, Henry's opponents had kept him alive up to this point rather than leave the Lancasters with a far more formidable leader in Henry's son Edward.  However, once the last of the most prominent Lancastrian supporters were either killed or exiled, it became clear that Henry VI would be a burden to Edward IV's reign.  The common fear was the possibility of another noble using the mentally unstable king to further their own agenda.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV]]'', an official chronicle favourable to Edward IV, Henry died of [[melancholia|melancholy]] on hearing news of the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] and his son's death.<ref>{{cite journal |first=John W. |last=McKenna |date=1965 |title=Henry VI of England and the Dual Monarchy: aspects of royal political propaganda, 1422\u20131432 |journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=28 |pages=145\u2013162 |doi=10.2307/750667 |jstor=750667}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}</ref> It is widely suspected, however, that Edward IV, who was re-crowned the morning following Henry's death, had in fact ordered his murder.{{efn|Either, that with Prince Edward's death, there was no longer any reason to keep Henry alive, or that, ''until'' Prince Edward died, there was little benefit to killing Henry.

He continued a career of architectural patronage started by his father: King's College Chapel and [[Eton College Chapel]] and most of his other architectural commissions (such as his completion of his father's foundation of [[Syon Monastery|Syon Abbey]]) consisted of a late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]]-style church with a monastic or educational foundation attached. Each year on the anniversary of Henry VI's death, the Provosts of Eton and King's lay white lilies and roses, the respective floral emblems of those colleges, on the spot in the Wakefield Tower at the Tower of London where the imprisoned Henry VI was, according to tradition, murdered as he knelt at prayer.

The anti-Yorkist cult was encouraged by Henry Tudor, as dynastic propaganda. A volume was compiled of the miracles attributed to him at St George's Chapel, Windsor, where Richard III had reinterred him, and Henry VII began building a chapel at Westminster Abbey to house Henry VI's relics.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|pp=164\u2013165}} A number of Henry VI's miracles possessed a political dimension, such as [[royal touch|his cure]] of a young girl afflicted with the ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|King's evil]]'', whose parents refused to bring her to the usurper, Richard III.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=165}} By the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[English Reformation|break with Rome]], [[canonisation]] proceedings were under way.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Leigh Ann |last=Craig |date=Summer 2003 |title=Royalty, Virtue, and Adversity: The Cult of King Henry VI |journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=187\u2013209 |doi=10.1017/S0095139000069817 |jstor=4054134}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}</ref> Hymns to him still exist, and until the [[Reformation]] his hat was kept by his tomb at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], where pilgrims would put it on to enlist Henry's aid against migraines.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=161}}\n\nNumerous miracles were credited to the dead king, including his raising the plague victim Alice Newnett from the dead and appearing to her as she was being stitched in her shroud.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=185}} He also intervened in the attempted hanging of a man who had been unjustly condemned to death, accused of stealing some sheep. Henry placed his hand between the rope and the man's windpipe, thus keeping him alive, after which he revived in the cart as it was taking him away for burial.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=188}} He was also capable of inflicting harm, such as when he struck John Robyns blind after Robyns cursed \"Saint Henry\". Robyns was healed only after he went on a pilgrimage to the shrine of King Henry.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=169}} A particular devotional act that was closely associated with the cult of Henry VI was the bending of a silver coin as an offering to the \"saint\" in order that he might perform a miracle. One story had a woman, Katherine Bailey, who was blind in one eye. As she was kneeling at mass, a stranger told her to bend a coin to King Henry. She promised to do so, and as the priest was raising the communion host, her partial blindness was cured.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=184}}\n\nAlthough his shrine was enormously popular as a pilgrimage destination during the early decades of the 16th century,{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=195}} over time, with the lessened need to legitimise Tudor rule, the cult of Henry VI faded.{{sfn|Craig|2003|p=189}}\n\n===Shakespeare's ''Henry VI'' and after===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:First-page-first-folio-1henry6.jpg|thumb|First page of ''The first Part of Henry the Sixt'' from the ''[[First Folio]]'' (1623)]]\nIn 1590 William Shakespeare wrote a trilogy of plays about the life of Henry VI: ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'', and ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]''. His dead body and his ghost also appear in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. Shakespeare's portrayal of Henry is notable in that it does not mention the King's madness. This is considered to have been a politically-advisable move so as to not risk offending [[Elizabeth I]] whose family was descended from Henry's Lancastrian family. Instead Henry is portrayed as a pious and peaceful man ill-suited to the crown. He spends most of his time in contemplation of the [[Bible]] and expressing his wish to be anyone other than a king. Shakespeare's Henry is weak-willed and easily influenced allowing his policies to be led by Margaret and her allies, and being unable to defend himself against York's claim to the throne. He only takes an act of his own volition just before his death when he curses Richard of Gloucester just before he is murdered.\n\nIn screen adaptations of these plays he has been portrayed by: James Berry  in the 1911 silent short ''Richard III''; [[Terry Scully]] in the 1960 [[BBC]] series ''[[An Age of Kings]]'' which contained all the history plays from ''Richard II'' to ''Richard III''; [[Carl Wery]] in the 1964 West German TV version ''K\u00f6nig Richard III''; [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] in ''[[The Wars of the Roses (adaptation)|The Wars of the Roses]]'', a 1965 filmed version of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] performing the three parts of ''Henry VI'' (condensed and edited into two plays, ''Henry VI'' and ''Edward IV'') and ''Richard III''; [[Peter Benson (actor)|Peter Benson]] in the 1983 [[BBC Television Shakespeare|BBC]] version of all three parts of ''Henry VI'' and ''Richard III''; Paul Brennen in the 1989 film version of the full cycle of consecutive history plays performed, for several years, by the [[English Shakespeare Company]]; [[Edward Jewesbury]] in the 1995 film version of ''[[Richard III (1995 film)|Richard III]]''  with [[Ian McKellen]] as Richard; James Dalesandro as Henry in the 2008 modern-day film version of ''[[Richard III (2008 film)|Richard III]]''; and [[Tom Sturridge]] as Henry to [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]'s Richard III in the 2016 second BBC series [[The Hollow Crown (TV series)|''The Hollow Crown'']], an adaptation of ''Henry VI'' (condensed into two parts) and ''Richard III''.\n\n[[Miles Mander]] portrayed him in ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]'', a 1939 horror film loosely dramatising the rise to power of Richard III.\n\n==Arms==\nAs Duke of Cornwall, Henry's arms were those of the kingdom, differenced by a [[label (heraldry)|label]] [[argent]] of three points.<ref>{{cite web|first=Francois R. |last=Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm |title=Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family |website=Heraldica.org |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

The only child of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], he succeeded to the English throne at the age of nine months upon his father's death, and succeeded to the French throne on the death of his maternal grandfather [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] shortly afterwards.\n\nHenry inherited the long-running [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453), in which his uncle [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] contested [[English claims to the French throne|his claim to the French throne]]. He is the only English monarch to also have been crowned [[King of France]] (as '''Henry II''', in 1431). His early reign, when [[Regency government, 1422\u20131437|several people were ruling for him]], saw the pinnacle of English power in France, but subsequent military, diplomatic, and economic problems had seriously endangered the English cause by the time Henry was declared fit to rule in 1437. He found his realm in a difficult position, faced with setbacks in France and divisions among the nobility at home. Unlike his father, Henry is described as timid, shy, passive, well-intentioned, and averse to warfare and violence; he was also at times mentally unstable. His ineffective reign saw the gradual loss of the [[Dual monarchy of England and France|English lands in France]]. Partially in the hope of achieving peace, in 1445 Henry married Charles VII's niece, the ambitious and strong-willed [[Margaret of Anjou]]. The peace policy failed, leading to the murder of one of Henry's key advisers, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole]], and the war recommenced, with France taking the upper hand; by 1453, [[Pale of Calais|Calais]] was Henry's only remaining territory on the continent.\n\nAs the situation in France worsened, there was a related increase in political instability in England. With Henry effectively unfit to rule, power was exercised by quarrelsome nobles, while [[political faction|factions]] and [[favourite]]s encouraged the rise of disorder in the country. Regional magnates and soldiers returning from France formed and maintained increasing numbers of private armed [[retinue|retainers]], with whom they fought one another, terrorised their neighbours, paralysed the courts, and dominated the government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cram |date=1948 |first=Paul |section=Western Europe |title=Encyclopedia of World History |title-link=Encyclopedia of World History |edition=revised |editor=[[William L.

Starting in 1453, Henry had a series of mental breakdowns, and tensions mounted between Margaret and Richard of York over control of the incapacitated king's government, and over the question of [[History of the English line of succession|succession to the throne]]. Civil war broke out in 1455, leading to a long period of [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]] known as the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Henry was deposed on 29 March 1461 after a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Towton]] by Richard's son, who took the throne as [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. Despite Margaret continuing to lead a resistance to Edward, Henry was captured by Edward's forces in 1465 and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. [[Readeption of Henry VI|Henry was restored to the throne]] in 1470, but Edward retook power in 1471, killing [[Edward of Westminster|Henry's only son and heir]] in battle and imprisoning Henry once again.\n\nHaving \"lost his wits, his two kingdoms, and his only son\",{{sfn|Cheetham|2000|p=44}} Henry died in the Tower during the night of 21 May, possibly killed on the orders of Edward. <!--He was buried at [[Chertsey Abbey]], before being moved to [[Windsor Castle]] in 1484. -->[[Miracle]]s were attributed to Henry after his death, and he was informally regarded as a [[saint]] and [[martyr]] until the 16th century.

A few weeks later, on 21 October 1422, in accordance with the [[Treaty of Troyes]] of 1420, he became titular King of France upon his grandfather Charles VI's death. His mother, [[Catherine of Valois]], was then 20 years old. As Charles VI's daughter, she was viewed with considerable suspicion by English nobles and was prevented from playing a full role in her son's upbringing.\n\nOn 28 September 1423, the nobles swore loyalty to Henry VI, who was not yet two years old. They summoned [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in the King's name and established a [[Regency government, 1422\u20131437|regency council]] to govern until the King should come of age. One of Henry V's surviving brothers, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John, Duke of Bedford]], was appointed senior [[regent]] of the realm and was in charge of the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|ongoing war in France]]. During Bedford's absence, the government of England was headed by Henry V's other surviving brother, [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], who was appointed [[Lord Protector]] and Defender of the Realm. His duties were limited to keeping the peace and summoning Parliament. Henry V's half-uncle [[Henry Beaufort]], [[Bishop of Winchester]] (after 1426 also [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]), had an important place on the Council. After the Duke of Bedford died in 1435, the Duke of Gloucester claimed the Regency himself, but was contested in this by the other members of the Council.\n\nFrom 1428, Henry's tutor was [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick]], whose [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick|father]] had been instrumental in [[Lords Appellant|the opposition to Richard II's reign]]. For the period 1430-1432, Henry was also tutored by the physician [[John Somerset]].

After the death of King Henry V, England had lost momentum in the [[Hundred Years' War]], whereas the House of Valois had gained ground beginning with [[Joan of Arc]]'s military victories in the year 1429. The young king came to favour a policy of peace in France and thus favoured the faction around [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]] and [[William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk]], who thought likewise, while [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], and [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], who argued for a continuation of the war, were ignored.\n\n==Marriage==\nAs the English military situation in France deteriorated, talks emerged in England about arranging a marriage for the king to strengthen England's foreign connections{{sfn|Tout|1891|p=58}} and facilitate a peace between the warring parties. In 1434, the English council suggested that peace with the Scots could best be effected by wedding Henry to one of the daughters of the [[James I of Scotland|king of Scotland]]; the proposal came to nothing. During the [[Congress of Arras]] in 1435, the English put forth the idea of a union between the English king and a daughter of [[Charles VII of France]], but the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]] refused even to contemplate the suggestion unless Henry renounced his claim to the French throne. Another proposal in 1438 to a daughter of [[Albert II of Germany|Albert II, King of Germany]], likewise failed.{{sfn|Tout|1891|p=58}}\n\nBetter prospects for England arose amidst a growing effort by French lords to resist the growing power of the French monarchy, a conflict which culminated in the [[Praguerie]] revolt of 1440.{{sfn|Tout|1891|p=58}} Though the English failed to take advantage of the Praguerie itself, the prospect of gaining the allegiance of one of Charles VII's more rebellious nobles was attractive from a military perspective. In about 1441, the recently ransomed [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in an attempt to force Charles VII to make peace with the English, suggested a marriage between Henry VI and a daughter of [[John IV, Count of Armagnac]],{{sfn|Tout|1891|p=59}} a powerful noble in southwestern France who was at odds with the [[House of Valois|Valois]] crown.{{sfn|Dicks|1967|pp=5\u20136}} An alliance with Armagnac would have helped to protect English [[Gascony]] from increasing French threats in the region, especially in the face of defections to the enemy by local English vassals,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=461}} and might have helped to wean some other French nobles to the English party.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The proposal was seriously entertained between 1441 and 1443, but a massive French campaign in 1442 against Gascony disrupted the work of the ambassadors{{sfn|Dicks|1967|pp=9, 11}} and frightened the count of Armagnac into reluctance.{{sfn|Dicks|1967|p=11}} The deal fell through due to problems in commissioning portraits of Armagnac's daughters{{sfn|Dicks|1967|pp=10\u201311}} and the count's imprisonment by Charles VII's men in 1443.{{sfn|Dicks|1967|p=12}}\n\n[[File:MargaretAnjou.jpg|thumb|left|upright|180 px|[[Margaret of Anjou]], depicted in the [[Talbot Shrewsbury Book]], 1444\u201345]]\n\nCardinal Beaufort and the Earl of Suffolk persuaded the king that the best way to pursue peace with France was through a marriage with Margaret of Anjou, the niece of King Charles VII. Henry agreed, especially when he heard reports of Margaret's stunning beauty, and sent Suffolk to negotiate with Charles, who consented to the marriage on condition that he would not have to provide the customary [[dowry]] and instead would receive the province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] from the English. These conditions were agreed in the [[Treaty of Tours]] in 1444, but the cession of Maine was kept secret from parliament, as it was known that this would be hugely unpopular with the English populace. The marriage took place at [[Titchfield Abbey]] on 23 April 1445, one month after Margaret's 15th birthday. She had arrived with an established household, composed primarily not of Angevins, but of members of  Henry's royal servants; this increase in the size of the royal household, and a concomitant increase on the birth of their son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward of Westminster]] in 1453, led to proportionately greater expense but also to greater patronage opportunities at Court.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=298}}\n\nHenry had wavered in yielding Maine to Charles, knowing that the move was unpopular and would be opposed by the dukes of Gloucester and York, and also because Maine was vital to the defence of [[Normandy]]. However, Margaret was determined that he should see it through. As the treaty became public knowledge in 1446, public anger focused on the Earl of Suffolk, but Henry and Margaret were determined to protect him.\n\n==Ascendancy of Suffolk and Somerset==\n[[File:Salut d'or.jpg|thumb|''Salut d'or'', depicting Henry as King of England and France, struck in [[Rouen]]]]\nIn 1447, the King and Queen summoned the Duke of Gloucester to appear before parliament on the charge of treason. Queen Margaret had no tolerance for any sign of disloyalty towards her husband and kingdom, thus any suspicion of this was immediately brought to her attention. This move was instigated by Gloucester's enemies, the Earl of Suffolk, whom Margaret held in great esteem, and the aging Cardinal Beaufort and his nephew, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Earl of Somerset]]. Gloucester was put in custody in [[Bury St Edmunds]], where he died, probably of a heart attack (although contemporary rumours spoke of poisoning) before he could be tried.{{efn|With the king's only remaining uncle dead, there were many, though no obvious, candidates to succeed Henry VI to the throne if he died childless. Henry VI's grandfather [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] had inaugurated a trend of favouring male succession by his deposition of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in 1399. By this logic, the most senior candidate in the royal family, through [[Patrilineality|male line]] descent from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], was Richard of York, or his rival Edmund Beaufort (the Earl of Somerset) in case the Beaufort line was declared eligible to succeed (Henry IV had barred them from succession due to their initial illegitimacy). Through [[primogeniture]] however, which was the traditional method of English succession, the legitimate successor would be [[Afonso V of Portugal]] through his descent from [[Philippa of Lancaster|Henry IV's eldest sister]], but his status as a foreign monarch made him very unlikely to become king. An alternative line of succession would be the descendants of [[Elizabeth of Lancaster, Duchess of Exeter|Henry IV's second sister]], whose son was [[John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter]]. A fifth candidate to the throne was [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]], who was the [[heir general]] of the [[House of Lancaster]] (through Henry IV's semi-legitimate brother, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]]), if the Beaufort family was admitted into the succession line. She would later marry Henry VI's maternal half-brother [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond]], and originate the Tudor claim to the throne.}}\n\nThe Duke of York, being the most powerful duke in the realm, and also being both an [[agnate]] and the [[heir general]] of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] (thus having, according to some, a better claim to the throne than Henry VI himself), probably had the best chances to succeed to the throne after Gloucester. However, he was excluded from the court circle and sent to govern [[Lordship of Ireland|Ireland]], while his opponents, the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset, were promoted to [[Duke]]s, a title at that time still normally reserved for immediate relatives of the monarch.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Keen |title=England in the Later Middle Ages |publisher=Routledge |location=London |date=1973 |isbn=9780415027830 |page=438}}</ref> The new Duke of Somerset was sent to France to assume the command of the English forces; this prestigious position was previously held by the Duke of York himself, who was dismayed at his term not being renewed and at seeing his enemy take control of it.\n\nIn the later years of Henry's reign, the monarchy became increasingly unpopular, due to a breakdown in law and order, corruption, the distribution of royal land to the king's court [[favourite]]s, the troubled state of the crown's finances, and the steady loss of territories in France. In 1447, this unpopularity took the form of a Commons campaign against [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], who was the most unpopular of all the King's entourage and widely seen as a traitor. He was impeached by Parliament to a background that has been called \"the baying for Suffolk\u2019s blood [by] a London mob\",<ref>Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'' Yale 2002, p. 67</ref> to the extent that Suffolk admitted his alarm to the king.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=677}} Ultimately, Henry was forced to send him into [[exile]], but Suffolk's ship was intercepted in the [[English Channel]]. His murdered body was found on the beach at [[Dover]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Norman |editor-last=Davis |title=The Paston Letters |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1999 |chapter=Letter 14 |pages=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nIn 1449, the Duke of Somerset, leading the campaign in France, reopened hostilities in [[Normandy]] (although he had previously been one of the main advocates for peace), but by the autumn he had been pushed back to [[Caen]]. By 1450, the French had retaken the whole province, so hard won by Henry V. Returning troops, who had often not been paid, added to the lawlessness in the southern counties of England. [[Jack Cade]] led a rebellion in [[Kent]] in 1450, calling himself \"John Mortimer\", apparently in sympathy with York, and setting up residence at the [[White Hart]] Inn in Southwark (the [[hart (deer)|white hart]] had been the symbol of the deposed [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]).{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=628}} Henry came to London with an army to crush the rebellion, but on finding that Cade had fled kept most of his troops behind while a small force followed the rebels and met them at [[Sevenoaks]]. The flight proved to have been tactical: Cade successfully ambushed the force in the Battle of Solefields (near Sevenoaks) and returned to occupy London. In the end, the rebellion achieved nothing, and London was retaken after a few days of disorder; but this was principally because of the efforts of its own residents rather than those of the army.  At any rate the rebellion showed that feelings of discontent were running high.<ref>Sevenoaks Preservation Society: ''The Rising in Kent in 1450 A.D.'', J.K.D.  Copy in Sevenoaks public library.</ref>\n\nIn 1451, the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]], held since [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s time, was also lost. In October 1452, an English advance in Aquitaine retook [[Bordeaux]] and was having some success, but by 1453 Bordeaux was lost again, leaving [[Calais]] as England's only remaining territory on the continent.\n\n==Insanity, and the ascendancy of York==\n[[File:Henry VI enthroned - British Library Royal MS 15 E vi f405r (detail).jpg|thumb|300px|Depiction of Henry enthroned, from the [[Talbot Shrewsbury Book]], 1444\u201345]]\nIn 1452, the Duke of York was persuaded to return from Ireland, claim his rightful place on the council and put an end to bad government. His cause was a popular one and he soon raised an army at [[Shrewsbury]]. The court party, meanwhile, raised their own similar-sized force in London. A stand-off took place south of London, with York presenting a list of grievances and demands to the court circle, including the arrest of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. The king initially agreed, but Margaret intervened to prevent the arrest of Beaufort. By 1453, Somerset's influence had been restored, and York was again isolated. The court party was also strengthened by the announcement that the Queen was pregnant.\n\nHowever, on hearing of the final loss of Bordeaux in August 1453, Henry experienced a [[mental breakdown]] and became completely unresponsive to everything that was going on around him for more than a year.<ref>''Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses'', ed. John A. Wagner, (ABC-CLIO, 2001), 48.</ref> He even failed to respond to the birth of a son and heir, who was christened Edward. Henry may have inherited a psychiatric condition from Charles VI of France, his maternal grandfather, who was affected by intermittent periods of insanity during the last thirty years of his life.{{efn|Charles VI, in turn, may have inherited a condition from his mother, [[Joanna of Bourbon]], who also showed signs of [[mental illness]], or other members of her family, who showed signs of psychiatric instability, such as Joanna's father, [[Peter I, Duke of Bourbon]], and her grandfather, [[Louis I, Duke of Bourbon]]. Joanna's brother [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon]], is also reported to have exhibited symptoms of such a condition.}} During his bout of insanity, Henry was attended by the surgeons [[Gilbert Kymer]] and John Marchall. [[Thomas Morstede]] had previously been appointed royal surgeon and died in 1450.\n\nThe Duke of York, meanwhile, had gained a very important ally, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], one of the most influential magnates and possibly richer than York himself. York was named regent as Protector of the Realm in 1454. The queen was excluded completely, and Edmund Beaufort was detained in the Tower of London, while many of York's supporters spread rumours that Edward was not the king's son, but Beaufort's.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sadler |first=John |title=The Red Rose and the White: the Wars of the Roses 1453\u20131487 |publisher=Longman |date=2010 |pages=49\u201351}}</ref> Other than that, York's months as regent were spent tackling the problem of government overspending.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Wars of the Roses==\n{{main|Wars of the Roses}}\n[[File:Silver groat of Henry VI (YORYM 1994 151 265) obverse.jpg|thumb|[[Groat (coin)|Silver groat]] of Henry VI, York Museums Trust]]\n\nAround Christmas Day 1454, King Henry regained his senses. Disaffected nobles who had grown in power during Henry's reign, most importantly the Earls of Warwick and [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]], took matters into their own hands. They backed the claims of the rival [[House of York]], first to the control of government, and then to the throne itself (from 1460), pointing to York's better descent from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. It was agreed that York would become Henry's successor, despite York being older.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}} In 1458, in an attempt to unite the warring factions, Henry staged [[The Love Day]] in London.\n\nThere followed a violent struggle between the houses of [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and York. Henry was defeated and captured at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] on 10 July 1460. The Duke of York was killed by Margaret's forces at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] on 30 December 1460, and Henry was rescued from imprisonment after the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] on 17 February 1461. By then, however, Henry was suffering such a bout of madness that he was apparently laughing and singing while the battle raged. He was defeated at the [[Battle of Towton]] on 29 March 1461 by the son of the Duke of York, Edward of York, who then became King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. Edward failed to capture Henry and his queen, who fled to [[Scotland]]. During the first period of Edward IV's reign, Lancastrian resistance continued mainly under the leadership of Queen Margaret and the few nobles still loyal to her in the northern counties of England and Wales.\n\nFollowing his defeat in the [[Battle of Hexham]] on 15 May 1464, Henry found refuge, sheltered by Lancastrian supporters, at houses across the north of England. By July 1465, he was in hiding at Waddington Hall, in [[Waddington, Lancashire]], the home of Sir Richard Tempest. Here, he was betrayed by \"a black monk of Addington\" and on 13 July, a group of Yorkist men, including Sir Richard's brother John, entered the home to arrest him. Henry fled into nearby woods but was soon captured. He was subsequently held captive in the Tower of London.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OI6BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT195 |title=The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses and the Rise of the Tudors |first=Dan |last=Jones |date=2014 |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn= 9780571288090 |page=195}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rnWMjn2iCt0C&pg=PA333 |title=The Wars of the Roses |first=Alison |last=Weir |authorlink=Alison Weir |publisher=Random House |isbn=9780307806857 |date=2011 |page=333}}</ref>\n\nWhile imprisoned, Henry did some writing, including the following poem:{{poemquote|\nKingdoms are but cares\n::State is devoid of stay,\nRiches are ready snares,\n::And hasten to decay\nPleasure is a privy prick\n::Which vice doth still provoke;\nPomps, imprompt; and fame, a flame;\n::Power, a smoldering smoke.\nWho meanth to remove the rock\n::Owst of the slimy mud\nShall mire himself, and hardly scape\n::The swelling of the flood.{{sfn|Cheetham|2000|p=69}}}}\n\n==Return to the throne==\n{{main|Readeption of Henry VI}}\n[[File:Henry VI Angel 1470.jpg|thumb|Gold \"[[Angel (coin)|Angel]]\" coin of Henry's later reign, struck in either London or York, showing the [[Archangel Michael]] (hence the coin's name) slaying the Dragon (left), and Henry's shield being carried aboard a ship (right)]]Queen Margaret, exiled in Scotland and later in France, was determined to win back the throne on behalf of her husband and son.  By herself, there was little she could do.  However, eventually Edward IV fell out with two of his main supporters: Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and his own younger brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence]].  At the urging of King [[Louis XI of France]] they formed a secret alliance with Margaret.  After marrying [[Anne Neville|his daughter]] to Henry and Margaret's son, Edward of Westminster, Warwick returned to England, forced Edward IV into exile, and restored Henry VI to the throne on 3 October 1470; the term \"readeption\" is still sometimes used for this event. However, by this time, years in hiding followed by years in captivity had taken their toll on Henry.  Warwick and Clarence effectively ruled in his name.{{sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=342\u2013344}}\n\nHenry's return to the throne lasted less than six months. Warwick soon overreached himself by declaring war on [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], whose ruler responded by giving Edward IV the assistance he needed to win back his throne by force. Edward IV returned to England in early 1471, after which he was reconciled with Clarence and killed Warwick at the [[Battle of Barnet]]. The Yorkists won a final decisive victory at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] on 4 May 1471, where Henry's son [[Edward of Westminster]] was killed.{{efn|The manner of the prince's death is one of historical speculation.

Both retell the traditional story that the prince sought sanctuary in Tewkesbury Abbey and was dragged out and butchered in the street.}}\n\n==Imprisonment and death==\n[[File:The site of Henry VI's death.JPG|thumb|upright|Wakefield Tower, which is treated as Henry VI's place of death for the purposes of ceremony.]]\n\nHenry was imprisoned in the Tower of London again, and when the royal party arrived in London, Henry VI was reported dead.  Official chronicles and documents state that the deposed king died on the night of 21 May 1471. In all likelihood, Henry's opponents had kept him alive up to this point rather than leave the Lancasters with a far more formidable leader in Henry's son Edward.  However, once the last of the most prominent Lancastrian supporters were either killed or exiled, it became clear that Henry VI would be a burden to Edward IV's reign.  The common fear was the possibility of another noble using the mentally unstable king to further their own agenda.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV]]'', an official chronicle favourable to Edward IV, Henry died of [[melancholia|melancholy]] on hearing news of the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] and his son's death.<ref>{{cite journal |first=John W. |last=McKenna |date=1965 |title=Henry VI of England and the Dual Monarchy: aspects of royal political propaganda, 1422\u20131432 |journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=28 |pages=145\u2013162 |doi=10.2307/750667 |jstor=750667}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}</ref> It is widely suspected, however, that Edward IV, who was re-crowned the morning following Henry's death, had in fact ordered his murder.{{efn|Either, that with Prince Edward's death, there was no longer any reason to keep Henry alive, or that, ''until'' Prince Edward died, there was little benefit to killing Henry.

He continued a career of architectural patronage started by his father: King's College Chapel and [[Eton College Chapel]] and most of his other architectural commissions (such as his completion of his father's foundation of [[Syon Monastery|Syon Abbey]]) consisted of a late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]]-style church with a monastic or educational foundation attached. Each year on the anniversary of Henry VI's death, the Provosts of Eton and King's lay white lilies and roses, the respective floral emblems of those colleges, on the spot in the Wakefield Tower at the Tower of London where the imprisoned Henry VI was, according to tradition, murdered as he knelt at prayer.

The anti-Yorkist cult was encouraged by Henry Tudor, as dynastic propaganda. A volume was compiled of the miracles attributed to him at St George's Chapel, Windsor, where Richard III had reinterred him, and Henry VII began building a chapel at Westminster Abbey to house Henry VI's relics.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|pp=164\u2013165}} A number of Henry VI's miracles possessed a political dimension, such as [[royal touch|his cure]] of a young girl afflicted with the ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|King's evil]]'', whose parents refused to bring her to the usurper, Richard III.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=165}} By the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[English Reformation|break with Rome]], [[canonisation]] proceedings were under way.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Leigh Ann |last=Craig |date=Summer 2003 |title=Royalty, Virtue, and Adversity: The Cult of King Henry VI |journal=Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=187\u2013209 |doi=10.1017/S0095139000069817 |jstor=4054134}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}</ref> Hymns to him still exist, and until the [[Reformation]] his hat was kept by his tomb at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], where pilgrims would put it on to enlist Henry's aid against migraines.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=161}}\n\nNumerous miracles were credited to the dead king, including his raising the plague victim Alice Newnett from the dead and appearing to her as she was being stitched in her shroud.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=185}} He also intervened in the attempted hanging of a man who had been unjustly condemned to death, accused of stealing some sheep. Henry placed his hand between the rope and the man's windpipe, thus keeping him alive, after which he revived in the cart as it was taking him away for burial.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=188}} He was also capable of inflicting harm, such as when he struck John Robyns blind after Robyns cursed \"Saint Henry\". Robyns was healed only after he went on a pilgrimage to the shrine of King Henry.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=169}} A particular devotional act that was closely associated with the cult of Henry VI was the bending of a silver coin as an offering to the \"saint\" in order that he might perform a miracle. One story had a woman, Katherine Bailey, who was blind in one eye. As she was kneeling at mass, a stranger told her to bend a coin to King Henry. She promised to do so, and as the priest was raising the communion host, her partial blindness was cured.{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=184}}\n\nAlthough his shrine was enormously popular as a pilgrimage destination during the early decades of the 16th century,{{sfn|Duffy|1992|p=195}} over time, with the lessened need to legitimise Tudor rule, the cult of Henry VI faded.{{sfn|Craig|2003|p=189}}\n\n===Shakespeare's ''Henry VI'' and after===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:First-page-first-folio-1henry6.jpg|thumb|First page of ''The first Part of Henry the Sixt'' from the ''[[First Folio]]'' (1623)]]\nIn 1590 William Shakespeare wrote a trilogy of plays about the life of Henry VI: ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'', and ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]''. His dead body and his ghost also appear in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. Shakespeare's portrayal of Henry is notable in that it does not mention the King's madness. This is considered to have been a politically-advisable move so as to not risk offending [[Elizabeth I]] whose family was descended from Henry's Lancastrian family. Instead Henry is portrayed as a pious and peaceful man ill-suited to the crown. He spends most of his time in contemplation of the [[Bible]] and expressing his wish to be anyone other than a king. Shakespeare's Henry is weak-willed and easily influenced allowing his policies to be led by Margaret and her allies, and being unable to defend himself against York's claim to the throne. He only takes an act of his own volition just before his death when he curses Richard of Gloucester just before he is murdered.\n\nIn screen adaptations of these plays he has been portrayed by: James Berry  in the 1911 silent short ''Richard III''; [[Terry Scully]] in the 1960 [[BBC]] series ''[[An Age of Kings]]'' which contained all the history plays from ''Richard II'' to ''Richard III''; [[Carl Wery]] in the 1964 West German TV version ''K\u00f6nig Richard III''; [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] in ''[[The Wars of the Roses (adaptation)|The Wars of the Roses]]'', a 1965 filmed version of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] performing the three parts of ''Henry VI'' (condensed and edited into two plays, ''Henry VI'' and ''Edward IV'') and ''Richard III''; [[Peter Benson (actor)|Peter Benson]] in the 1983 [[BBC Television Shakespeare|BBC]] version of all three parts of ''Henry VI'' and ''Richard III''; Paul Brennen in the 1989 film version of the full cycle of consecutive history plays performed, for several years, by the [[English Shakespeare Company]]; [[Edward Jewesbury]] in the 1995 film version of ''[[Richard III (1995 film)|Richard III]]''  with [[Ian McKellen]] as Richard; James Dalesandro as Henry in the 2008 modern-day film version of ''[[Richard III (2008 film)|Richard III]]''; and [[Tom Sturridge]] as Henry to [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]'s Richard III in the 2016 second BBC series [[The Hollow Crown (TV series)|''The Hollow Crown'']], an adaptation of ''Henry VI'' (condensed into two parts) and ''Richard III''.\n\n[[Miles Mander]] portrayed him in ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]'', a 1939 horror film loosely dramatising the rise to power of Richard III.\n\n==Arms==\nAs Duke of Cornwall, Henry's arms were those of the kingdom, differenced by a [[label (heraldry)|label]] [[argent]] of three points.<ref>{{cite web|first=Francois R. |last=Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm |title=Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family |website=Heraldica.org |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

Her initially harmonious marriage descended into rivalry and contempt; her husband Alfonso, perhaps threatened by her high level of education or disdainful of her pedigree, treated her with a lack of respect throughout the marriage.{{sfn|Tribble|2012}}\n\nTogether, Alfonso and Ippolita had three children:\n* King [[Ferdinand II of Naples]] (26 August 1469 \u2013 October 1496),{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1978|p=767}} married [[Joanna of Naples (1478-1518)|Joanna of Naples]] (15 April 1479 \u2013 27 August 1518)\n* [[Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan|Isabella of Aragon]], Duchess of Bari, Milan and Princess of Rossano (2 October 1470 \u2013 11 February 1524), married her first cousin [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]], Duke of Milan{{sfn|Hollings|1911|p=266}}\n* Piero, Prince of Rossano (31 March 1472 \u2013 17 February 1491),{{sfn|Bernuzzi|2003|p=34}} Lieutenant General of Apulia, died of an infection following leg surgery.\n\nIppolita Maria Sforza died at Naples on 20 August 1484 at the age of thirty-eight.{{sfn|Commire|Klezmer|2000|p=682}}\n\n==Reference==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book  |chapter=Alfonso II of Aragon |first=Marco |last=Bernuzzi |title=Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation |editor-first1=Peter G. |editor-last1=Bietenholz |editor-first2=Thomas Brian |editor-last2=Deutscher |volume=A-Z |publisher=University of Toronto Press  |year=2003 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=Women in World History |volume=Harr-I |editor-first1=Anne |editor-last1=Commire |editor-first2=Deborah |editor-last2=Klezmer |publisher=Yorkin Publications |year=2000 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |first=Nadia |last=Covini |title=Princesses and Ladies of Power at the Sforza Court |year=2006 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=Europe in renaissance and reformation, 1453-1659 |first=Mary Albright |last=Hollings |publisher=Macmillan |year=1911 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History|volume=Volume 2, The Twelfth Century to the Renaissance |first=C.

He served as Leader of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party, the [[Zimbabwe African National Union \u2013 Patriotic Front|ZANU \u2013 Patriotic Front]] (ZANU\u2013PF), from 1980 to 2017. Ideologically an [[African nationalist]], during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]], and as a [[Socialism|socialist]] after the 1990s. His policies have been described as Mugabeism.\n\n<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->\nMugabe was born to a poor [[Shona people|Shona]] family in [[Kutama, Zimbabwe|Kutama]], [[Southern Rhodesia]]. Educated at [[Kutama College]] and the [[University of Fort Hare]], he worked as a school teacher in Southern Rhodesia, [[Northern Rhodesia]], and [[Ghana]]. Angered by [[White people in Zimbabwe|white minority]] rule of his homeland within the [[British Empire]], Mugabe embraced [[Marxism]] and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state controlled by the black majority. After making anti-government comments, he was convicted of [[sedition]] and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. On release, he fled to [[Mozambique]], established his leadership of ZANU, and oversaw its role in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], fighting [[Ian Smith]]'s predominately white government. He reluctantly participated in peace talks in the United Kingdom that resulted in the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], putting an end to the war. In the [[1980 Southern Rhodesian general election|1980 general election]], Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory. As Prime Minister of the newly renamed Zimbabwe, Mugabe's administration expanded healthcare and education and\u2014despite his professed desire for a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]]\u2014adhered largely to [[mainstream economics|mainstream]], conservative economic policies.\n\n<!--Premiership and presidency-->\nMugabe's calls for racial reconciliation failed to stem growing white emigration, while relations with [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) also deteriorated. In the [[Gukurahundi]] of 1982\u20131987, Mugabe's [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]] crushed ZAPU-linked opposition in [[Matabeleland]] in a campaign that killed at least 10,000 people, mostly [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] civilians. Internationally he sent troops into the [[Second Congo War]] and chaired the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (1986\u201389), the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (1997\u201398), and the [[African Union]] (2015\u201316). Pursuing [[decolonisation]], Mugabe emphasised the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|redistribution of land]] controlled by white farmers to landless blacks, initially on a \"willing seller\u2013willing buyer\" basis. Frustrated at the slow rate of redistribution, from 2000 he encouraged black Zimbabweans to violently seize white-owned farms. Food production was severely impacted, leading to famine, economic decline, and Western sanctions. Opposition to Mugabe grew, but he was re-elected in [[2002 Zimbabwean presidential election|2002]], [[2008 Zimbabwean general election|2008]], and [[2013 Zimbabwean general election|2013]] through campaigns dominated by violence, [[electoral fraud]], and nationalistic appeals to his rural Shona voter base. In 2017, members of his own party [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|ousted him in a coup]], replacing him with former vice president [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nHaving dominated Zimbabwe's politics for nearly four decades, Mugabe was a controversial figure. He was praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped free Zimbabwe from British [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], and white minority rule. Critics accused Mugabe of being a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, widespread [[corruption in Zimbabwe]], [[Racism in Zimbabwe|anti-white racism]], [[Human rights in Zimbabwe|human rights abuses]], and [[crimes against humanity]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1924\u20131945===\nRobert Gabriel Mugabe was born on 21 February 1924 at the [[Kutama, Zimbabwe|Kutama Mission]] village in Southern Rhodesia's [[Zvimba District]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=17|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=19}} His father, Gabriel Matibiri, was a carpenter while his mother Bona was a Christian [[catechist]] for the village children.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=17|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3pp=19, 21|4a1=Norman|4y=2008|4p=15}} They had been trained in their professions by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]s, the [[Roman Catholic]] religious order which had established the mission.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=19}} Bona and Gabriel had six children: Miteri (Michael), Raphael, Robert, Dhonandhe (Donald), [[Sabina Mugabe|Sabina]], and Bridgette.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=17}} They belonged to the Zezuru clan, one of the smallest branches of the [[Shona people|Shona tribe]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Mugabe's paternal grandfather was [[Chieftain|Chief]] Constantine Karigamombe, alias \"Matibiri\", a powerful figure who served King [[Lobengula]] in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-118372.html|title=Mugabe's grandfather served King Lobengula|publisher=Bulawayo|date=23 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107223825/http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-118372.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref> Through his father, he claimed membership of the [[chieftaincy]] family that has provided the hereditary rulers of Zvimba for generations.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/president-at-91-how-president-mugabe-became-my-father|title=President At 91: How President Mugabe Became My Father|author= |institution=The Sunday Mail|accessdate=18 February 2020|date= }} </ref>\n\nThe Jesuits were strict disciplinarians and under their influence Mugabe developed an intense self-discipline,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=19}} while also becoming a devout Catholic.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=3}} Mugabe excelled at school,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} where he was a secretive and solitary child,{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=20}} preferring to read, rather than playing sports or socialising with other children.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=20\u201321}} He was taunted by many of the other children, who regarded him as a coward and a [[mother's boy]].{{sfn|Holland|2008|pp=6\u20137}}\n\nIn about 1930 Gabriel had an argument with one of the Jesuits, and as a result the Mugabe family was expelled from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubi\u00e8re.{{sfn|Blair|2002|pp=17\u201318}} The family settled in a village about {{convert|7|mi|km|0|abbr=off|order=flip}} away; the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living with relatives in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home on weekends.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} Around the same time, Robert's older brother Raphael died, likely of [[diarrhoea]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} In early 1934, Robert's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned [[maize]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=18|3a1=Holland|3y=2008|3p=224}} Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment in [[Bulawayo]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=21|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=15}} He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=21}}\n\nLoubi\u00e8re died shortly after and was replaced by an Irishman, Father Jerome O'Hea, who welcomed the return of the Mugabe family to Kutama.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} In contrast to the racism that permeated Southern Rhodesian society, under O'Hea's leadership the Kutama Mission preached an ethos of racial equality.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=15|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=16}} O'Hea nurtured the young Mugabe; shortly before his death in 1970 he described the latter as having \"an exceptional mind and an exceptional heart\".{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=18|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=16}} As well as helping provide Mugabe with a Christian education, O'Hea taught him about the [[Irish War of Independence]], in which Irish revolutionaries had overthrown the British imperial regime.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=21|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=16}} After completing six years of elementary education, in 1941 Mugabe was offered a place on a teacher training course at [[Kutama College]].

It makes for greater unity for the people. It puts all opinions under one umbrella, whether these opinions are radical or reactionary\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=29}} The political scientist Sue Onslow and historian Sean Redding stated that Zimbabwe's situation was \"more complex than pure venial dictatorship\", but that it was an \"ideo-dictatorship\".{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=68}}\n\nNdlovu-Gatsheni argued that since the mid-1990s, Mugabe's rhetoric and speeches came to be dominated by three main themes: an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of belonging and patriotism.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|pp=1139\u20131140}} References to the Rhodesian Bush War featured prominently in his speeches.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=964}} The scholar of [[African studies]] Abiodun Alao noted that Mugabe was determined to \"take advantage of the past in order to secure a firm grip on national security\".{{sfn|Alao|2012|p=xii}}\n\nDavid Blair stated that \"Mugabe's collected writings amount to nothing more than crude [[Marxism]], couched in the ponderous English of the mission school\", remarking that they were heavily informed by [[Karl Marx]], [[Mao Zedong]], and [[Frantz Fanon]], and displayed little originality.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Blair noted that Mugabe's writings called for \"[[Planned economy|command economics]] in a peasant society, mixed with anti-colonial nationalism\", and that in this he held \"the same opinions as almost every other African guerrilla leader\" of that period.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Mugabe argued that following the overthrow of European colonial regimes, Western countries continued to keep African countries in a state of subservience because they desired the continent's natural resources while preventing it from industrialising.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=239}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0441 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0417\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043c \u041c\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0431\u0435 3.jpg|thumb|Mugabe meeting Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2015]]\n\nMugabe measured a little over {{convert|1.70|m}},{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} and exhibited what his biographer David Blair described as \"curious, effeminate mannerisms\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} Mugabe took great care with his appearance, typically wearing a three-piece suit,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} and insisted that members of his cabinet dressed in a similar Anglophile fashion.{{sfn|Holland|2008|pp=109\u2013110}} On taking power in 1980, Mugabe's hallmark was his wide-rimmed glasses,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=14}} and he was also known for his [[toothbrush moustache|tiny moustache]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} Unlike a number of other African leaders, Mugabe did not seek to mythologise his childhood.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=17}} He avoided smoking and drinking,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=23}} and\u2014according to his first biographers, David Smith and Colin Simpson\u2014had \"enormous affection for children\".{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=48}} During his early life he had an operation on his genitals which generated rumours that he had only one testicle or half a penis; such rumours were used by opponents to ridicule him and by supporters to bolster the claim that he was willing to make severe sacrifices for the revolutionary cause.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=174}}\n\nMugabe spoke English fluently with an adopted English accent when pronouncing certain words.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} He was also a fan of the English game of [[cricket]], stating that \"cricket civilizes people and creates good gentlemen\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} David Blair noted that this cultivation of British traits suggested that Mugabe respected and perhaps admired Britain while at the same time resenting and loathing the country.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Holland suggested that these Anglophile traits arose in early life, as Mugabe\u2014who had long experienced the anti-black racism of Rhodesian society\u2014\"grasped Englishness as an antidote\" to the \"self-loathing\" induced by societal racism.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=211}}\n\nThe academic Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that Mugabe was \"an extremely complex figure, not easily captured by conventional categories\".{{sfn|Tendi|2011|pp=307\u2013308}} Similarly, David Blair described him as an \"exceptionally complex personality\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Smith and Simpson noted that the Zimbabwean leader had been \"a serious young man, something of a loner, diligent, hard-working, a voracious reader who used every minute of his time, not much given to laughter: but above all, single-minded\".{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=15\u201316}} Blair commented that Mugabe's \"self-discipline, intelligence and appetite for hard work were remarkable\",{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} adding that his \"prime characteristics\" were \"ruthlessness and resilience\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Blair argued that Mugabe shared many character traits with Ian Smith, stating that they were both \"proud, brave, stubborn, charismatic, deluded fantasists\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=244}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=With his poor childhood development record, even minor criticism would be experienced as a wound by Mugabe.

Merriam-Webster|Mugabe}}</ref> {{IPA-sn|mu\u0261a\u0253e|lang}}; 21 February 1924 \u2013 6 September 2019) was a [[Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean]] revolutionary and politician who served as [[Prime Minister of Zimbabwe]] from 1980 to 1987 and then as [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] from 1987 to 2017. He served as Leader of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party, the [[Zimbabwe African National Union \u2013 Patriotic Front|ZANU \u2013 Patriotic Front]] (ZANU\u2013PF), from 1980 to 2017. Ideologically an [[African nationalist]], during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]], and as a [[Socialism|socialist]] after the 1990s. His policies have been described as Mugabeism.\n\n<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->\nMugabe was born to a poor [[Shona people|Shona]] family in [[Kutama, Zimbabwe|Kutama]], [[Southern Rhodesia]]. Educated at [[Kutama College]] and the [[University of Fort Hare]], he worked as a school teacher in Southern Rhodesia, [[Northern Rhodesia]], and [[Ghana]]. Angered by [[White people in Zimbabwe|white minority]] rule of his homeland within the [[British Empire]], Mugabe embraced [[Marxism]] and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state controlled by the black majority. After making anti-government comments, he was convicted of [[sedition]] and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. On release, he fled to [[Mozambique]], established his leadership of ZANU, and oversaw its role in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], fighting [[Ian Smith]]'s predominately white government. He reluctantly participated in peace talks in the United Kingdom that resulted in the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], putting an end to the war. In the [[1980 Southern Rhodesian general election|1980 general election]], Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory. As Prime Minister of the newly renamed Zimbabwe, Mugabe's administration expanded healthcare and education and\u2014despite his professed desire for a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]]\u2014adhered largely to [[mainstream economics|mainstream]], conservative economic policies.\n\n<!--Premiership and presidency-->\nMugabe's calls for racial reconciliation failed to stem growing white emigration, while relations with [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) also deteriorated. In the [[Gukurahundi]] of 1982\u20131987, Mugabe's [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]] crushed ZAPU-linked opposition in [[Matabeleland]] in a campaign that killed at least 10,000 people, mostly [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] civilians. Internationally he sent troops into the [[Second Congo War]] and chaired the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (1986\u201389), the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (1997\u201398), and the [[African Union]] (2015\u201316). Pursuing [[decolonisation]], Mugabe emphasised the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|redistribution of land]] controlled by white farmers to landless blacks, initially on a \"willing seller\u2013willing buyer\" basis. Frustrated at the slow rate of redistribution, from 2000 he encouraged black Zimbabweans to violently seize white-owned farms. Food production was severely impacted, leading to famine, economic decline, and Western sanctions. Opposition to Mugabe grew, but he was re-elected in [[2002 Zimbabwean presidential election|2002]], [[2008 Zimbabwean general election|2008]], and [[2013 Zimbabwean general election|2013]] through campaigns dominated by violence, [[electoral fraud]], and nationalistic appeals to his rural Shona voter base. In 2017, members of his own party [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|ousted him in a coup]], replacing him with former vice president [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nHaving dominated Zimbabwe's politics for nearly four decades, Mugabe was a controversial figure. He was praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped free Zimbabwe from British [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], and white minority rule. Critics accused Mugabe of being a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, widespread [[corruption in Zimbabwe]], [[Racism in Zimbabwe|anti-white racism]], [[Human rights in Zimbabwe|human rights abuses]], and [[crimes against humanity]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1924\u20131945===\nRobert Gabriel Mugabe was born on 21 February 1924 at the [[Kutama, Zimbabwe|Kutama Mission]] village in Southern Rhodesia's [[Zvimba District]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=17|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=19}} His father, Gabriel Matibiri, was a carpenter while his mother Bona was a Christian [[catechist]] for the village children.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=17|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3pp=19, 21|4a1=Norman|4y=2008|4p=15}} They had been trained in their professions by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]s, the [[Roman Catholic]] religious order which had established the mission.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=19}} Bona and Gabriel had six children: Miteri (Michael), Raphael, Robert, Dhonandhe (Donald), [[Sabina Mugabe|Sabina]], and Bridgette.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=17}} They belonged to the Zezuru clan, one of the smallest branches of the [[Shona people|Shona tribe]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Mugabe's paternal grandfather was [[Chieftain|Chief]] Constantine Karigamombe, alias \"Matibiri\", a powerful figure who served King [[Lobengula]] in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-118372.html|title=Mugabe's grandfather served King Lobengula|publisher=Bulawayo|date=23 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107223825/http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-118372.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref> Through his father, he claimed membership of the [[chieftaincy]] family that has provided the hereditary rulers of Zvimba for generations.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/president-at-91-how-president-mugabe-became-my-father|title=President At 91: How President Mugabe Became My Father|author= |institution=The Sunday Mail|accessdate=18 February 2020|date= }} </ref>\n\nThe Jesuits were strict disciplinarians and under their influence Mugabe developed an intense self-discipline,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=19}} while also becoming a devout Catholic.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=3}} Mugabe excelled at school,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} where he was a secretive and solitary child,{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=20}} preferring to read, rather than playing sports or socialising with other children.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=20\u201321}} He was taunted by many of the other children, who regarded him as a coward and a [[mother's boy]].{{sfn|Holland|2008|pp=6\u20137}}\n\nIn about 1930 Gabriel had an argument with one of the Jesuits, and as a result the Mugabe family was expelled from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubi\u00e8re.{{sfn|Blair|2002|pp=17\u201318}} The family settled in a village about {{convert|7|mi|km|0|abbr=off|order=flip}} away; the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living with relatives in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home on weekends.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} Around the same time, Robert's older brother Raphael died, likely of [[diarrhoea]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} In early 1934, Robert's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned [[maize]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=18|3a1=Holland|3y=2008|3p=224}} Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment in [[Bulawayo]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=21|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=15}} He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=21}}\n\nLoubi\u00e8re died shortly after and was replaced by an Irishman, Father Jerome O'Hea, who welcomed the return of the Mugabe family to Kutama.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} In contrast to the racism that permeated Southern Rhodesian society, under O'Hea's leadership the Kutama Mission preached an ethos of racial equality.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=15|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=16}} O'Hea nurtured the young Mugabe; shortly before his death in 1970 he described the latter as having \"an exceptional mind and an exceptional heart\".{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=18|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=16}} As well as helping provide Mugabe with a Christian education, O'Hea taught him about the [[Irish War of Independence]], in which Irish revolutionaries had overthrown the British imperial regime.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=21|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=16}} After completing six years of elementary education, in 1941 Mugabe was offered a place on a teacher training course at [[Kutama College]]. Mugabe's mother could not afford the tuition fees, which were paid in part by his grandfather and in part by O'Hea.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=14|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=18|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3p=21|4a1=Norman|4y=2008|4p=16}} As part of this education, Mugabe began teaching at his old school,

participate in the country's [[1948 in Southern Rhodesia|1948 general strike]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=19}} In 1949 he won a scholarship to study at the [[University of Fort Hare]] in South Africa's

(ANCYL){{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=17|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=17}} and attended [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] meetings, where he met a number of Jewish South African [[communism|communists]] who introduced him to [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=16|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=22}} He later related that despite this exposure to Marxism,

he mixed with both black and white Rhodesians.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=18\u201319}} [[Guy Clutton-Brock]], who knew Mugabe through this group, later noted that he was \"an extraordinary young man\"

It makes for greater unity for the people. It puts all opinions under one umbrella, whether these opinions are radical or reactionary\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=29}} The political scientist Sue Onslow and historian Sean Redding stated that Zimbabwe's situation was \"more complex than pure venial dictatorship\", but that it was an \"ideo-dictatorship\".{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=68}}\n\nNdlovu-Gatsheni argued that since the mid-1990s, Mugabe's rhetoric and speeches came to be dominated by three main themes: an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of belonging and patriotism.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|pp=1139\u20131140}} References to the Rhodesian Bush War featured prominently in his speeches.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=964}} The scholar of [[African studies]] Abiodun Alao noted that Mugabe was determined to \"take advantage of the past in order to secure a firm grip on national security\".{{sfn|Alao|2012|p=xii}}\n\nDavid Blair stated that \"Mugabe's collected writings amount to nothing more than crude [[Marxism]], couched in the ponderous English of the mission school\", remarking that they were heavily informed by [[Karl Marx]], [[Mao Zedong]], and [[Frantz Fanon]], and displayed little originality.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Blair noted that Mugabe's writings called for \"[[Planned economy|command economics]] in a peasant society, mixed with anti-colonial nationalism\", and that in this he held \"the same opinions as almost every other African guerrilla leader\" of that period.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Mugabe argued that following the overthrow of European colonial regimes, Western countries continued to keep African countries in a state of subservience because they desired the continent's natural resources while preventing it from industrialising.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=239}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0441 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0417\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043c \u041c\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0431\u0435 3.jpg|thumb|Mugabe meeting Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2015]]\n\nMugabe measured a little over {{convert|1.70|m}},{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} and exhibited what his biographer David Blair described as \"curious, effeminate mannerisms\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} Mugabe took great care with his appearance, typically wearing a three-piece suit,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} and insisted that members of his cabinet dressed in a similar Anglophile fashion.{{sfn|Holland|2008|pp=109\u2013110}} On taking power in 1980, Mugabe's hallmark was his wide-rimmed glasses,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=14}} and he was also known for his [[toothbrush moustache|tiny moustache]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} Unlike a number of other African leaders, Mugabe did not seek to mythologise his childhood.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=17}} He avoided smoking and drinking,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=23}} and\u2014according to his first biographers, David Smith and Colin Simpson\u2014had \"enormous affection for children\".{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=48}} During his early life he had an operation on his genitals which generated rumours that he had only one testicle or half a penis; such rumours were used by opponents to ridicule him and by supporters to bolster the claim that he was willing to make severe sacrifices for the revolutionary cause.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=174}}\n\nMugabe spoke English fluently with an adopted English accent when pronouncing certain words.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} He was also a fan of the English game of [[cricket]], stating that \"cricket civilizes people and creates good gentlemen\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} David Blair noted that this cultivation of British traits suggested that Mugabe respected and perhaps admired Britain while at the same time resenting and loathing the country.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Holland suggested that these Anglophile traits arose in early life, as Mugabe\u2014who had long experienced the anti-black racism of Rhodesian society\u2014\"grasped Englishness as an antidote\" to the \"self-loathing\" induced by societal racism.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=211}}\n\nThe academic Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that Mugabe was \"an extremely complex figure, not easily captured by conventional categories\".{{sfn|Tendi|2011|pp=307\u2013308}} Similarly, David Blair described him as an \"exceptionally complex personality\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Smith and Simpson noted that the Zimbabwean leader had been \"a serious young man, something of a loner, diligent, hard-working, a voracious reader who used every minute of his time, not much given to laughter: but above all, single-minded\".{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=15\u201316}} Blair commented that Mugabe's \"self-discipline, intelligence and appetite for hard work were remarkable\",{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} adding that his \"prime characteristics\" were \"ruthlessness and resilience\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Blair argued that Mugabe shared many character traits with Ian Smith, stating that they were both \"proud, brave, stubborn, charismatic, deluded fantasists\".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=244}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=With his poor childhood development record, even minor criticism would be experienced as a wound by Mugabe.

The [[foundation stock]], a general [[landrace]] of small dogs of the region, are widely found throughout the country, have traditionally been more common in urban areas, and have been a popular companion of Greeks for centuries. This breed is also known as the Small Greek Domestic Dog.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name {{lang|el-Latn|Kokoni}} probably derives from the word {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1}} {{lang|el-Latn|kokona}} which is another word for 'daughter' in [[Modern Greek]]. In past times, the daughter's life was mostly in and around the house, so the Kokoni dog was the 'daughter's dog' or the 'dog for the house', unlike the [[hunting dog]]s or the [[livestock guardian dog]]s.\n\n== Breed History ==\nThe Kokoni dog, originated in Malta and has been a part of Greek life for hundreds of years along with their slightly larger cousins, the [[Alopekis|Alopeki]]'s, a breed once thought to be a different variety of the same breed. The knowledge of their heritage has been lost to history, but ancient wall decorations, vases, coins, and other pottery pieces exhibit images of these little dogs, generally depicted as the companions to women and children, particularly those in the aristocracy. Many of these little dogs have been employed as multipurpose dogs throughout history, particularly for those with more modest means, and they proved effective as hunting dogs, helping to find and capture small game, both mammals and birds, as well as ridding the house and barns of pests and even occasionally helping herd livestock, those that didn\u2019t find a domestic home even managed to survive both in and outside of the Grecian cities. The unrestricted breeding ended up developing into a particularly healthy breed compared to many breeds with no specific disorders that are more prevalent to their breed.  This breed is very popular in and around Greece, but it has little representation outside of its home country and is not yet recognized by the major kennel clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wagwalking.com/breed/kokoni|title=Kokoni {{!}} Dog Breed Facts and Information - Wag!

Nose length less than the length of the skull. Skull circumference slightly smaller than its length.  \n\n====== Height and Weight ======\n[[File:Cadela da ra\u00e7a Kokoni.jpg|thumb|The coat is may be slightly wavy]]This breed of dog is considered to be of a small to medium size. Their height is 24 to 28 centimeters (9.45 to 11.02 inches) for males, and 23 to 27 centimeters (9.05 to 10.63 inches) for females. Their weight ranges from 4 to 8 kilograms (8.81 to 17.63 lb). There is a tolerable deviation of 1 cm for height, and 1 kg for weight, above or below the limits. The tolerable deviation range for height is 23 to 29 cm (9.05 to 11.42 inches) for males, and 22 to 28 cm (8.66 to 11.02 inches) for females. The tolerable deviation range for weight is 3 to 9 kg (6.61 to 19.85 lb). A dog outside the tolerable deviation range for height cannot be considered a full purebred Kokoni, however, a full purebred Kokoni can be over the tolerable deviation range for weight, as this breed is prone to overeating, and weight gain, especially if they are spayed or neutered.   \n\n====== Colors ======\nThis breed comes in a variety of colors and combinations of colors, such as black and tan, blonde, cream, and white. All colors and patterns are acceptable in the breed standard, although some are rarer than others. Some colors, such as black, are dominant, while others, like brown/liver, are recessive. Dilute Kokoni's, such as blue or lilac, are extremely rare. Since dilution and liver are both recessive and relatively rare, Isabella/Lilac is the rarest color of Kokoni.  \n\n====== Coat ======\nThe coat of the Kokoni is of three lengths, and is easy to groom. It can be straight or wavy, but it should always feel silky. The coat is rich, dense and weatherproof. Straight coated Kokoni's are genetically dominant to wavy coated Kokoni's; as such, wavy coated Kokoni's are rarer than straight coated Kokoni's. The coat of the Kokoni will be fully expressed by the time the Kokoni reaches two years of age. \n\n====== Tail ======\n[[File:Dog tails types.svg|thumb|Kokoni's can have tails like images 4 & 5; at rest they may appear like image 7, without it being a mistake.]]\nThe sickle-shaped tail of the Kokoni is usually long. The dog holds its tail up high, and has an elegant curve. The coat of this dog forms a brush under its tail, often described as a fan or feather tail. It is carried high, forming a semicircle, its tip resting on the back. It is covered with rich hair, forming a tuft. During the stop or rest, it may fall, without it being a mistake. In the tail and back part of the buttocks the dogs coat is even longer with a length of 8-14 cm (3.15 to 5.5 in). The beautiful tail, that the Kokoni fabulously flaunts, can start showing up at around 6 months of age, but will not be full-length until 9 months to 15 months of age.\n\n====== Eyes ======\nThis breed of dog has large eyes which vary in shape from round to more of an almond shape. They are bright and are not deep-set. The color goes with the color of the coat, but they will never be transparent or blue. Known eye color possibilities include, Brown, Dark Brown, Amber, Light Amber, and Hazel.  \n\n====== Ears ======\nTriangular, medium size, drooping and agile. Located relatively high, above the imaginary line of the eye, they are covered by short hair. Some dogs have longer hairs on the outside, from the base to the middle of the ear. Part of the ears or the whole ear, covered by short and smooth hair 1 cm (0.40 in) long or longer. <ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n====== Muzzle ======\nThe muzzle \"tapers easily to the nose\", and the top-line is level. The nose of the has well-opened nostrils. It is not large compared to the muzzle, and it is moist, flat, and level on the front surface. The jaws are strong, with scissor-bite teeth.\n\n==Health==\nThis is a deep-chested, sturdy, and agile breed, capable of great speeds and valued for its stamina.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  The breed generally has good longevity and lives into their late teens.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  Major health issues are not known.\n\n===Temperament===\n\nKokoni's are like all other dogs in that they can display a wide range of temperaments, behaviors, dispositions, and traits. It is important to remember that temperament and personality are unique to each dog, and the following statements are generalities. \n\nKokoni's have a loud, strong bark for their size though they do not bark much. The Kokoni is said to have an even temper and gentle disposition, and to be lively, cheerful, amiable and not generally aggressive or timid. Other behavioral claims are that they enjoy company, though may initially be standoffish with strangers.{{clarify|date=February 2020|reason=Um, how is this supposed to be in any way different from EVERY DOG BREED ON EARTH?}}  Breeders claim they are intelligent, easily trained, and very devoted to and protective of their keepers.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=Behavioral claims like this almost always need to be deleted as promotional nonsense.}}\n\n=== Grooming ===\nComb and brush regularly with a firm bristle brush, and bathe at least once a month, or when necessary. Small Greek Domestic Dogs shed moderately. It's a natural process of the hair growth cycle. Regular brushing reduces the amount of hair that sheds. Seasonal flea treatment is needed, but cutting the dog's hair by a professional groomer isn't necessary. Clean tear ducts with a warm wet wash cloth daily or once a week at minimum. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.koe.gr/index.php/el/greekbreeds/kokoni The Kennel Club of Greece's breed standard]\n\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Greece]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n<!-- Begin Infobox Dogbreed.

Located relatively high, above the imaginary line of the eye, they are covered by short hair. Some dogs have longer hairs on the outside, from the base to the middle of the ear. Part of the ears or the whole ear, covered by short and smooth hair 1 cm (0.40 in) long or longer. <ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n====== Muzzle ======\nThe muzzle \"tapers easily to the nose\", and the top-line is level. The nose of the has well-opened nostrils. It is not large compared to the muzzle, and it is moist, flat, and level on the front surface. The jaws are strong, with scissor-bite teeth.\n\n==Health==\nThis is a deep-chested, sturdy, and agile breed, capable of great speeds and valued for its stamina.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  The breed generally has good longevity and lives into their late teens.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  Major health issues are not known.\n\n===Temperament===\n\nKokoni's are like all other dogs in that they can display a wide range of temperaments, behaviors, dispositions, and traits. It is important to remember that temperament and personality are unique to each dog, and the following statements are generalities. \n\nKokoni's have a loud, strong bark for their size though they do not bark much. The Kokoni is said to have an even temper and gentle disposition, and to be lively, cheerful, amiable and not generally aggressive or timid. Other behavioral claims are that they enjoy company, though may initially be standoffish with strangers.{{clarify|date=February 2020|reason=Um, how is this supposed to be in any way different from EVERY DOG BREED ON EARTH?}}  Breeders claim they are intelligent, easily trained, and very devoted to and protective of their keepers.{{citation needed|date=February 2020|reason=Behavioral claims like this almost always need to be deleted as promotional nonsense.}}\n\n=== Grooming ===\nComb and brush regularly with a firm bristle brush, and bathe at least once a month, or when necessary. Small Greek Domestic Dogs shed moderately. It's a natural process of the hair growth cycle. Regular brushing reduces the amount of hair that sheds. Seasonal flea treatment is needed, but cutting the dog's hair by a professional groomer isn't necessary. Clean tear ducts with a warm wet wash cloth daily or once a week at minimum. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.koe.gr/index.php/el/greekbreeds/kokoni The Kennel Club of Greece's breed standard]\n\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Greece]]\n", "name_user": "Adelexylem", "label": "safe", "comment": "Superfluous citation after external link.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoni"}

With a population of 17.9 million in 2017, it is the most populous state of Germany. It is also the most densely populated German state apart from the city-states of [[Berlin]], [[Bremen]], and [[Hamburg]], and the fourth-largest by area. The state capital is [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. North Rhine-Westphalia features 30 of the 81 German cities with over 100,000 inhabitants, including [[Cologne]] (over 1 million), [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]] (all between 580,000 and 620,000 inhabitants) and other cities predominantly located in the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] [[metropolitan area]], the largest urban area in Germany and the third-largest on the [[European continent]].\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia was established in 1946 after [[World War II]] from the [[Prussia]]n provinces of [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and the northern part of [[Rhine Province]] ([[North Rhine]]), and the [[Free State of Lippe]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] military administration in [[Allied-occupied Germany]]. North Rhine-Westphalia became a state of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949, and the city of [[Bonn]] served as the federal capital until the [[reunification of Germany]] in 1990 and as the [[seat of government]] until 1999.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of North Rhine-Westphalia}}\n\n===Rhineland===\n{{Main|Rhineland}}\nThe first written account of the area was by its conqueror, [[Julius Caesar]], the territories west of the Rhine were occupied by the [[Eburones]] and east of the Rhine he reported the [[Ubii]] (across from Cologne) and the [[Sugambri]] to their north. The Ubii and some other Germanic tribes such as the [[Cugerni]] were later settled on the west side of the Rhine in the Roman province of [[Germania Inferior]]. Julius Caesar conquered the tribes on the left bank, and Augustus established numerous fortified posts on the Rhine, but the Romans never succeeded in gaining a firm footing on the right bank, where the Sugambri neighboured several other tribes including the [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]]. North of the Sigambri and the Rhine region were the [[Bructeri]].\n\nAs the power of the Roman empire declined, many of these tribes came to be seen collectively as [[Ripuarian Franks]] and they pushed forward along both banks of the Rhine, and by the end of the fifth century had conquered all the lands that had formerly been under Roman influence. By the eighth century, the Frankish dominion was firmly established in western Germany and northern Gaul, but at the same time, to the north, Westphalia was being taken over by [[Saxons]] pushing south.\n\nThe [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] Franks eventually built an empire which controlled first their Ripuarian kin, and then the Saxons. On the division of the [[Carolingian Empire]] at the [[Treaty of Verdun]], the part of the province to the east of the river fell to [[East Francia]], while that to the west remained with the kingdom of [[Lotharingia]].<ref name=\"eb1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Rhine Province}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of [[Otto I]] (d. 973), both banks of the Rhine had become part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and the Rhenish territory was divided between the duchies of [[Upper Lorraine]] on the [[Moselle]] and [[Lower Lorraine]] on the Meuse. The [[Ottonian dynasty]] had both Saxon and Frankish ancestry.\n\n[[File:1801 Cary Map of Westphalia, Germany - Geographicus - Westphalia-cary-1799.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle]] in 1799 by [[John Cary]]]] \nAs the central power of the Holy Roman Emperor weakened, the Rhineland split into numerous small, independent, separate vicissitudes and special chronicles. The old Lotharingian divisions became obsolete, although the name survives for example in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] in France, and throughout the Middle Ages and even into modern times, the nobility of these areas often sought to preserve the idea of a preeminent [[duke]] within Lotharingia, something claimed by the [[Duchy of Limburg|Dukes of Limburg]], and the [[Duchy of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]]. Such struggles as the [[War of the Limburg Succession]] therefore continued to create military and political links between what is now Rhineland-Westphalia and neighbouring [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].\n\nIn spite of its dismembered condition and the sufferings it underwent at the hands of its French neighbours in various periods of warfare, the Rhenish territory prospered greatly and stood in the foremost rank of German culture and progress. Aachen was the place of coronation of the German emperors, and the ecclesiastical principalities of the Rhine bulked largely in German history.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/>\n\nPrussia first set foot on the Rhine in 1609 by the occupation of the [[Duchy of Cleves]] and about a century later [[Prussian Guelders|Upper Guelders]] and [[Moers]] also became Prussian. At the peace of Basel in 1795, the whole of the [[left bank of the Rhine]] was resigned to France, and in 1806, the Rhenish princes all joined the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].\n\nAfter the Congress of Vienna, Prussia was awarded the entire [[Rhineland]], which included the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]], the ecclesiastic electorates of [[Electorate of Trier|Trier]] and [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], the free cities of [[Aachen]] and Cologne, and nearly a hundred small lordships and abbeys. The Prussian [[Rhine province]] was formed in 1822 and Prussia had the tact to leave them in undisturbed possession of the liberal institutions to which they had become accustomed under the republican rule of the French.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> In 1920, the districts of [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] were transferred to Belgium (see [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]]).\n\n===Westphalia===\n{{Main|Westphalia}}\nAround AD&nbsp;1, numerous incursions occurred through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or Romanized settlements. The [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] took place near Osnabr\u00fcck and some of the [[Germanic tribes]] who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia. [[Charlemagne]] is thought to have spent considerable time in [[Paderborn]] and nearby parts. His [[Saxon Wars]] also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary [[Widukind]] to places near [[Detmold]], [[Bielefeld]], [[Lemgo]], Osnabr\u00fcck, and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in [[Enger]], which is also a subject of a legend.\n\nAlong with [[Eastphalia]] and [[Engern]], Westphalia (''Westfalahi'') was originally a district of the [[Duchy of Saxony]]. In 1180, Westphalia was elevated to the rank of a duchy by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]]. The [[Duchy of Westphalia]] comprised only a small area south of the [[Lippe River]].\n\n[[File: Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|Ratification of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 in [[M\u00fcnster]] by Gerard Terborch]]\nParts of Westphalia came under [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]n control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided duchies and other feudal areas of power. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, signed in M\u00fcnster and Osnabr\u00fcck, ended the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The concept of nation-state sovereignty resulting from the treaty became known as \"[[Westphalian sovereignty]]\".\n\nAs a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there is no dominant religion in Westphalia. Roman Catholicism and [[Lutheranism]] are on relatively equal footing. Lutheranism is strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. [[M\u00fcnster]] and especially [[Paderborn]] are thought of as Catholic. Osnabr\u00fcck is divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism.\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 made the Westphalian territories part of the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807 to 1813. It was founded by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and was a [[First French Empire|French]] [[vassal state]]. This state only shared the name with the historical region; it contained only a relatively small part of Westphalia, consisting instead mostly of [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Eastphalia]]n regions.\n\nAfter the [[Congress of Vienna]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] received a large amount of territory in the Westphalian region and created the [[province of Westphalia]] in 1815. The northernmost portions of the former kingdom, including the town of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], had become part of the states of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]].\n\n===North Rhine-Westphalia===\n\n====Creation of the state====\nThe state of North Rhine-Westphalia was established by the [[British Zone of Occupation|British military administration]]'s \"Operation Marriage\" on 23 August 1946, by merging the [[province of Westphalia]] and the northern parts of the [[Rhine Province]], both being political divisions of the former [[state of Prussia]] within the [[German Reich]].<ref name=\"HistoryNRW\">{{cite web|title=History of North Rhine-Westphalia|url=http://www.nrw.de/en/north-rhine-westphalia/history/|publisher=Government of North Rhine-Westphalia|accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=DWNRW>{{cite news|last=Wagener|first=Volker|title=North Rhine-Westphalia: an overview|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3901456,00.html|accessdate=26 July 2011|newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=18 November 2009}}</ref> On 21 January 1947, the former state of [[Lippe (state)|Lippe]] was merged with North Rhine-Westphalia.<ref name=\"HistoryNRW\"/> The [[constitution of North Rhine-Westphalia]] was then ratified through a [[referendum]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:North Rhine-Westphalia Topography 08.png|thumb|left|Geographic map of North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[File:Bonn Drachenfels4.JPG|thumb|View of the [[Rhine]] near [[Bonn]]]]\n[[File:Abendsonne \u00fcber Glehn.JPG|thumb|Sunset near the [[Lower Rhine]]]]\n[[File:Rhein-Ruhr-Region-LEP.png|thumb|[[Rhine-Ruhr]] metropolitan area, the largest [[conurbation]] of the European continent with a population of 11 million]]\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia encompasses the plains of the [[Lower Rhine]] region and parts of the [[Central Uplands]] (''[[die Mittelgebirge]]'') up to the gorge of [[Porta Westfalica (gorge)|Porta Westfalica]]. The state covers an area of {{convert|34,083|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and shares borders with [[Belgium]] ([[Wallonia]]) in the southwest and the [[Netherlands]] ([[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Gelderland]] and [[Overijssel]]) in the west and northwest. It has borders with the German states of [[Lower Saxony]] to the north and northeast, [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] to the south and [[Hesse]] to the southeast.\n\nApproximately half of the state is located in the relative low-lying terrain of the [[Westphalian Lowland]] and the [[Rhineland]], both extending broadly into the [[North German Plain]]. A few isolated hill ranges are located within these lowlands, among them the Hohe Mark, the [[Beckum Hills]], the Baumberge and the [[Stemmer Berge]]. <br>\nThe terrain rises towards the south and in the east of the state into parts of Germany's [[Central Uplands]]. These hill ranges are the [[Weser Uplands]] \u2013 including the [[Egge Hills]], the [[Wiehen Hills]], the [[Wesergebirge]] and the [[Teutoburg Forest]] in the east, the [[Sauerland]], the [[Bergisches Land]], the [[Siegerland]] and the [[Siebengebirge]] in the south, as well as the left-Rhenish [[Eifel]] in the southwest of the state. The [[Rothaargebirge]] in the border region with [[Hesse]] rises to height of about 800 m above sea level. The highest of these mountains are the [[Langenberg (Rothaargebirge)|Langenberg]], at 843.2 m above sea level, the [[Kahler Asten]] (840.7 m) and the Clemensberg (839.2 m).\n\nThe planimetrically-determined centre of North Rhine-Westphalia is located in the south of Dortmund-[[Aplerbeck]] in the Aplerbecker Mark (51\u00b0 28' N, 7\u00b0 33' \u00d6). Its westernmost point is situated near [[Selfkant]] close to the Dutch border, the easternmost near [[H\u00f6xter]] on the [[Weser]]. The southernmost point lies near [[Hellenthal]] in the [[Eifel]] region. The northernmost point is the NRW-Nordpunkt near [[Rahden]] in the northeast of the state. The Nordpunkt has located the only 100&nbsp; km to the south of the North Sea coast. The deepest natural dip is arranged in the district Zyfflich in the city of [[Kranenburg, North Rhine-Westphalia|Kranenburg]] with 9.2 m above sea level in the northwest of the state. Though, the deepest point overground results from mining. The open-pit Hambach reaches at [[Niederzier]] a deep of 293 m below sea level. At the same time, this is the deepest man-made dip in Germany.\n\nThe most important rivers flowing at least partially through North Rhine-Westphalia include: the [[Rhine]], the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]], the [[Ems (river)|Ems]], the [[Lippe River|Lippe]], and the [[Weser]]. The Rhine is by far the most important river in North Rhine-Westphalia: it enters the state as [[Middle Rhine]] near Bad Honnef, where still being part of the [[Mittelrhein (wine region)|Mittelrhein wine region]]. It changes into the [[Lower Rhine]] near Bad Godesberg and leaves North Rhine-Westphalia near Emmerich at a width of 730 metres. Almost immediately after entering the Netherlands, the Rhine splits into many branches.\n\nThe [[Pader (river)|Pader]], which flows entirely within the city of [[Paderborn]], is considered Germany's shortest river.\n\nFor many, North Rhine-Westphalia is synonymous with industrial areas and urban agglomerations.

and spoken language) is a [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Germany]].\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia is located in western Germany covering an area of {{convert|34084|km2|sqmi}}. With a population of 17.9 million in 2017, it is the most populous state of Germany. It is also the most densely populated German state apart from the city-states of [[Berlin]], [[Bremen]], and [[Hamburg]], and the fourth-largest by area. The state capital is [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. North Rhine-Westphalia features 30 of the 81 German cities with over 100,000 inhabitants, including [[Cologne]] (over 1 million), [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]] (all between 580,000 and 620,000 inhabitants) and other cities predominantly located in the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] [[metropolitan area]], the largest urban area in Germany and the third-largest on the [[European continent]].\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia was established in 1946 after [[World War II]] from the [[Prussia]]n provinces of [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and the northern part of [[Rhine Province]] ([[North Rhine]]), and the [[Free State of Lippe]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] military administration in [[Allied-occupied Germany]]. North Rhine-Westphalia became a state of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949, and the city of [[Bonn]] served as the federal capital until the [[reunification of Germany]] in 1990 and as the [[seat of government]] until 1999.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of North Rhine-Westphalia}}\n\n===Rhineland===\n{{Main|Rhineland}}\nThe first written account of the area was by its conqueror, [[Julius Caesar]], the territories west of the Rhine were occupied by the [[Eburones]] and east of the Rhine he reported the [[Ubii]] (across from Cologne) and the [[Sugambri]] to their north. The Ubii and some other Germanic tribes such as the [[Cugerni]] were later settled on the west side of the Rhine in the Roman province of [[Germania Inferior]]. Julius Caesar conquered the tribes on the left bank, and Augustus established numerous fortified posts on the Rhine, but the Romans never succeeded in gaining a firm footing on the right bank, where the Sugambri neighboured several other tribes including the [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]]. North of the Sigambri and the Rhine region were the [[Bructeri]].\n\nAs the power of the Roman empire declined, many of these tribes came to be seen collectively as [[Ripuarian Franks]] and they pushed forward along both banks of the Rhine, and by the end of the fifth century had conquered all the lands that had formerly been under Roman influence. By the eighth century, the Frankish dominion was firmly established in western Germany and northern Gaul, but at the same time, to the north, Westphalia was being taken over by [[Saxons]] pushing south.\n\nThe [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] Franks eventually built an empire which controlled first their Ripuarian kin, and then the Saxons. On the division of the [[Carolingian Empire]] at the [[Treaty of Verdun]], the part of the province to the east of the river fell to [[East Francia]], while that to the west remained with the kingdom of [[Lotharingia]].<ref name=\"eb1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Rhine Province}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of [[Otto I]] (d. 973), both banks of the Rhine had become part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and the Rhenish territory was divided between the duchies of [[Upper Lorraine]] on the [[Moselle]] and [[Lower Lorraine]] on the Meuse. The [[Ottonian dynasty]] had both Saxon and Frankish ancestry.\n\n[[File:1801 Cary Map of Westphalia, Germany - Geographicus - Westphalia-cary-1799.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle]] in 1799 by [[John Cary]]]] \nAs the central power of the Holy Roman Emperor weakened, the Rhineland split into numerous small, independent, separate vicissitudes and special chronicles. The old Lotharingian divisions became obsolete, although the name survives for example in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] in France, and throughout the Middle Ages and even into modern times, the nobility of these areas often sought to preserve the idea of a preeminent [[duke]] within Lotharingia, something claimed by the [[Duchy of Limburg|Dukes of Limburg]], and the [[Duchy of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]]. Such struggles as the [[War of the Limburg Succession]] therefore continued to create military and political links between what is now Rhineland-Westphalia and neighbouring [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].\n\nIn spite of its dismembered condition and the sufferings it underwent at the hands of its French neighbours in various periods of warfare, the Rhenish territory prospered greatly and stood in the foremost rank of German culture and progress. Aachen was the place of coronation of the German emperors, and the ecclesiastical principalities of the Rhine bulked largely in German history.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/>\n\nPrussia first set foot on the Rhine in 1609 by the occupation of the [[Duchy of Cleves]] and about a century later [[Prussian Guelders|Upper Guelders]] and [[Moers]] also became Prussian. At the peace of Basel in 1795, the whole of the [[left bank of the Rhine]] was resigned to France, and in 1806, the Rhenish princes all joined the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].\n\nAfter the Congress of Vienna, Prussia was awarded the entire [[Rhineland]], which included the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]], the ecclesiastic electorates of [[Electorate of Trier|Trier]] and [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], the free cities of [[Aachen]] and Cologne, and nearly a hundred small lordships and abbeys. The Prussian [[Rhine province]] was formed in 1822 and Prussia had the tact to leave them in undisturbed possession of the liberal institutions to which they had become accustomed under the republican rule of the French.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> In 1920, the districts of [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] were transferred to Belgium (see [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]]).\n\n===Westphalia===\n{{Main|Westphalia}}\nAround AD&nbsp;1, numerous incursions occurred through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or Romanized settlements. The [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] took place near Osnabr\u00fcck and some of the [[Germanic tribes]] who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia. [[Charlemagne]] is thought to have spent considerable time in [[Paderborn]] and nearby parts. His [[Saxon Wars]] also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary [[Widukind]] to places near [[Detmold]], [[Bielefeld]], [[Lemgo]], Osnabr\u00fcck, and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in [[Enger]], which is also a subject of a legend.\n\nAlong with [[Eastphalia]] and [[Engern]], Westphalia (''Westfalahi'') was originally a district of the [[Duchy of Saxony]]. In 1180, Westphalia was elevated to the rank of a duchy by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]]. The [[Duchy of Westphalia]] comprised only a small area south of the [[Lippe River]].\n\n[[File: Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|Ratification of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 in [[M\u00fcnster]] by Gerard Terborch]]\nParts of Westphalia came under [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]n control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided duchies and other feudal areas of power. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, signed in M\u00fcnster and Osnabr\u00fcck, ended the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The concept of nation-state sovereignty resulting from the treaty became known as \"[[Westphalian sovereignty]]\".\n\nAs a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there is no dominant religion in Westphalia. Roman Catholicism and [[Lutheranism]] are on relatively equal footing. Lutheranism is strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. [[M\u00fcnster]] and especially [[Paderborn]] are thought of as Catholic. Osnabr\u00fcck is divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism.\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 made the Westphalian territories part of the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807 to 1813. It was founded by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and was a [[First French Empire|French]] [[vassal state]]. This state only shared the name with the historical region; it contained only a relatively small part of Westphalia, consisting instead mostly of [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Eastphalia]]n regions.\n\nAfter the [[Congress of Vienna]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] received a large amount of territory in the Westphalian region and created the [[province of Westphalia]] in 1815. The northernmost portions of the former kingdom, including the town of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], had become part of the states of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]].\n\n===North Rhine-Westphalia===\n\n====Creation of the state====\nThe state of North Rhine-Westphalia was established by the [[British Zone of Occupation|British military administration]]'s \"Operation Marriage\" on 23 August 1946, by merging the [[province of Westphalia]] and the northern parts of the [[Rhine Province]], both being political divisions of the former [[state of Prussia]] within the [[German Reich]].<ref name=\"HistoryNRW\">{{cite web|title=History of North Rhine-Westphalia|url=http://www.nrw.de/en/north-rhine-westphalia/history/|publisher=Government of North Rhine-Westphalia|accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=DWNRW>{{cite news|last=Wagener|first=Volker|title=North Rhine-Westphalia: an overview|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3901456,00.html|accessdate=26 July 2011|newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=18 November 2009}}</ref> On 21 January 1947, the former state of [[Lippe (state)|Lippe]] was merged with North Rhine-Westphalia.<ref name=\"HistoryNRW\"/> The [[constitution of North Rhine-Westphalia]] was then ratified through a [[referendum]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:North Rhine-Westphalia Topography 08.png|thumb|left|Geographic map of North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[File:Bonn Drachenfels4.JPG|thumb|View of the [[Rhine]] near [[Bonn]]]]\n[[File:Abendsonne \u00fcber Glehn.JPG|thumb|Sunset near the [[Lower Rhine]]]]\n[[File:Rhein-Ruhr-Region-LEP.png|thumb|[[Rhine-Ruhr]] metropolitan area, the largest [[conurbation]] of the European continent with a population of 11 million]]\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia encompasses the plains of the [[Lower Rhine]] region and parts of the [[Central Uplands]] (''[[die Mittelgebirge]]'') up to the gorge of [[Porta Westfalica (gorge)|Porta Westfalica]]. The state covers an area of {{convert|34,083|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and shares borders with [[Belgium]] ([[Wallonia]]) in the southwest and the [[Netherlands]] ([[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Gelderland]] and [[Overijssel]]) in the west and northwest. It has borders with the German states of [[Lower Saxony]] to the north and northeast, [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] to the south and [[Hesse]] to the southeast.\n\nApproximately half of the state is located in the relative low-lying terrain of the [[Westphalian Lowland]] and the [[Rhineland]], both extending broadly into the [[North German Plain]]. A few isolated hill ranges are located within these lowlands, among them the Hohe Mark, the [[Beckum Hills]], the Baumberge and the [[Stemmer Berge]]. <br>\nThe terrain rises towards the south and in the east of the state into parts of Germany's [[Central Uplands]]. These hill ranges are the [[Weser Uplands]] \u2013 including the [[Egge Hills]], the [[Wiehen Hills]], the [[Wesergebirge]] and the [[Teutoburg Forest]] in the east, the [[Sauerland]], the [[Bergisches Land]], the [[Siegerland]] and the [[Siebengebirge]] in the south, as well as the left-Rhenish [[Eifel]] in the southwest of the state. The [[Rothaargebirge]] in the border region with [[Hesse]] rises to height of about 800 m above sea level. The highest of these mountains are the [[Langenberg (Rothaargebirge)|Langenberg]], at 843.2 m above sea level, the [[Kahler Asten]] (840.7 m) and the Clemensberg (839.2 m).\n\nThe planimetrically-determined centre of North Rhine-Westphalia is located in the south of Dortmund-[[Aplerbeck]] in the Aplerbecker Mark (51\u00b0 28' N, 7\u00b0 33' \u00d6). Its westernmost point is situated near [[Selfkant]] close to the Dutch border, the easternmost near [[H\u00f6xter]] on the [[Weser]]. The southernmost point lies near [[Hellenthal]] in the [[Eifel]] region. The northernmost point is the NRW-Nordpunkt near [[Rahden]] in the northeast of the state. The Nordpunkt has located the only 100&nbsp; km to the south of the North Sea coast. The deepest natural dip is arranged in the district Zyfflich in the city of [[Kranenburg, North Rhine-Westphalia|Kranenburg]] with 9.2 m above sea level in the northwest of the state. Though, the deepest point overground results from mining. The open-pit Hambach reaches at [[Niederzier]] a deep of 293 m below sea level. At the same time, this is the deepest man-made dip in Germany.\n\nThe most important rivers flowing at least partially through North Rhine-Westphalia include: the [[Rhine]], the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]], the [[Ems (river)|Ems]], the [[Lippe River|Lippe]], and the [[Weser]]. The Rhine is by far the most important river in North Rhine-Westphalia: it enters the state as [[Middle Rhine]] near Bad Honnef, where still being part of the [[Mittelrhein (wine region)|Mittelrhein wine region]]. It changes into the [[Lower Rhine]] near Bad Godesberg and leaves North Rhine-Westphalia near Emmerich at a width of 730 metres. Almost immediately after entering the Netherlands, the Rhine splits into many branches.\n\nThe [[Pader (river)|Pader]], which flows entirely within the city of [[Paderborn]], is considered Germany's shortest river.\n\nFor many, North Rhine-Westphalia is synonymous with industrial areas and urban agglomerations. However, the largest part of the state is used for agriculture (almost 52%) and forests (25%).<ref>Tatsachen \u00fcber Deutschland (2003) ''Nordrhein-Westfalen'', p.&nbsp;44</ref>\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n{{See also|List of places in North Rhine-Westphalia}}\n\nThe state consists of five [[Regierungsbezirk|government regions]] (''Regierungsbezirke''), divided into 31 districts (''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]'') and 23 [[Urban districts of Germany|urban districts]] (''kreisfreie St\u00e4dte'').

His works include ''[[Ripostes]]'' (1912), ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1917\u20131969).\n\nPound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as [[T.

During [[World War II]], he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States, [[Franklin D.

Largely due to a campaign by his fellow writers, he was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958 and returned to live in Italy until his death. His political views ensure that his work remains as controversial now as it was during his lifetime; in 1933, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called him \"a cat that walks by himself, tenaciously unhousebroken and very unsafe for children\".

He submitted his own poems, as well as poems by [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], Yeats, H.D. and Aldington, and collected material for a 64-page anthology, ''Des Imagistes'' (1914). The Imagist movement began to attract attention from critics.<ref>Stock (1970), 143\u2013147; Tytell (1987), 97</ref> In November 1913 Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, rented Stone Cottage in [[Coleman's Hatch]], Sussex, and invited Pound to accompany him as his secretary. They stayed there for 10 weeks, reading and writing, walking in the woods and fencing. It was the first of three winters they spent together at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Pound married on 20 April 1914.<ref>Moody (2007), 240; Longenbach (1988); Longenbach, James.

Dorothy's annual income was \u00a350, aided by \u00a3150 from her family. Her parents eventually consented, perhaps out of fear that she was getting older with no other suitor in sight. Pound's concession to marry in church helped convince them. Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, with the newly wed Hilda (H.D.) and Richard Aldington living next door.<ref>Moody (2007), 246\u2013249</ref>\n\nPound wrote for Wyndham Lewis's literary magazine ''[[Blast (magazine)|Blast]],'' although only two issues were published. An advertisement in ''The Egoist'' promised it would cover \"Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art\". Pound took the opportunity to extend the definition of Imagisme to art, naming it [[Vorticism]]: \"The image is a radiant node or cluster; it is&nbsp;... a ''vortex'', from which, and through which, and into which, ideas are constantly rushing.\"<ref>Moody (2007), 230, 256</ref> Reacting to the magazine, the poet [[Lascelles Abercrombie]] called for the rejection of Imagism and a return to the traditionalism of [[William Wordsworth]]; Pound challenged him to a duel on the basis that \"Stupidity carried beyond a certain point becomes a public menace\".<ref>Stock (1970), 159</ref> Abercrombie suggested their choice of weapon be unsold copies of their own books.<ref name=Campbell>Campbell, James.

But Hilda and Richard were already moving away from Pound's understanding of the movement, as he aligned more with Wyndham Lewis's ideas. When Lowell agreed to finance an anthology of Imagist poets, Pound's work was not included. Upset at Lowell, he began to call ''Imagisme'' \"Amygism\", and in July 1914 he declared the movement dead and asked that the group not continue to call themselves Imagists. They dissented, not believing that the movement was Pound's invention, and Lowell eventually Anglicized the term.<ref>Moody (2007), 222\u2013225</ref>\n\n===World War I, disillusionment===\n{{further|Lost Generation}}\n[[File:T.

In 1915 he persuaded ''Poetry'' to publish [[T. S. Eliot]]'s \"[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]\". Eliot had sent \"Prufrock\" to almost every editor in England, but was rejected. He eventually sent it to Pound, who instantly saw it as a work of genius and submitted it to ''Poetry''.<ref name=Aiken>Aiken (1965), 4\u20135</ref> \"[Eliot] has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN\", Pound wrote to Monroe in October 1914. \"The rest of the promising young have done one or the other but never both.

[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0108/features/letter.html \"Letter by letter\"], ''University of Chicago Magazine'', April 2001.</ref>\n\nAfter the publication in 1915 of ''Cathay'', Pound mentioned he was working on a long poem, casting about for the correct form. He told a friend in August: \"It is a huge, I was going to say, gamble, but shan't\", and in September described it as a \"cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore\". About a year later, in January 1917, he had the first three trial cantos, distilled to one, published as Canto I in ''Poetry''.<ref>Moody (2007), 306\u2013307</ref> He was now a regular contributor to three literary magazines. From 1917 he wrote music reviews for ''The New Age'' under the pen name William Atheling, and weekly pieces for ''The Egoist'' and ''[[The Little Review]]''; many of the latter were directed against provincialism and ignorance. The volume of writing exhausted him. He feared he was wasting his time writing outside poetry,<ref>Moody (2007), 330, 334</ref> exclaiming that he \"''must'' stop writing so much prose\".<ref name=\"m342\">Moody (2007), 342</ref>\n\n[[File:Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound 01 (brightened).jpg|thumb|upright|Pound commissioned this sculpture from [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] in 1913.]]\nPound was deeply affected by the war. He was devastated when Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, from whom he had commissioned a sculpture of himself two years earlier, was killed in the trenches in 1915. He published ''Gaudier-Brzeska: A Memoir'' the following year, in reaction to what he saw as an unnecessary loss.<ref>Stock (1970), 174, 180\u2013182</ref> In the autumn of 1917 his depression worsened. He blamed American provincialism for the seizure of the October issue of ''The Little Review''. The [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]] applied the [[Comstock Laws]] against an article Lewis wrote, describing it as lewd and indecent. Around the same time, Hulme was killed by shell-fire in Flanders, and Yeats married [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]].<ref>Moody (2007), 334\u2013335</ref> In 1918, after a bout of illness which was presumably the [[Spanish influenza]], Pound decided to stop writing for ''The Little Review'', mostly because of the volume of work. He asked the publisher for a raise to hire 23-year-old [[Iseult Gonne]] as a typist, causing rumors that Pound was having an affair with her, but he was turned down.<ref name=\"m342\" />\n\nIn 1919 he published a collection of his essays for ''The Little Review'' as ''Instigations'', and in the March 1919 issue ''Poetry,'' he published ''Poems from the Propertius Series'', which appeared to be a translation of the Latin Poet [[Sextus Propertius]]. When he included this in his next poetry collection in 1921, he had renamed it ''Homage to Sextus Propertius'' in response to criticism of his translation skills. \"Propertius\" is not a strict translation; biographer David Moody describes it as \"the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence\". Harriet Monroe, editor of ''Poetry'', published a letter from a professor of Latin, [[William Gardner Hale|W. G. Hale]], saying that Pound was \"incredibly ignorant\" of the language, and alluded to \"about three-score errors\" in ''Homage''. Monroe did not publish Pound's response, which began \"Cat-piss and porcupines!!\" and continued, \"The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Fitzgerald]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar]] is a translation\". Moore interpreted Pound's silence after that as his resignation as foreign editor.<ref>Kenner (1971), 286</ref>\n\n===''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley''===\n{{further|Wikisource:Hugh Selwyn Mauberley}}\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=left\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>There died a myriad\nAnd of the best, among them,\nFor an old bitch gone in the teeth,\nFor a botched civilization,<br />\nCharm, smiling at the good mouth,\nQuick eyes gone under earth's lid,<br />\nFor two gross of broken statues,\nFor a few thousand battered books.\n</poem>\n |source= \u2014 ''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley'', Section V (1920)}}\n\nHis poem ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' consists of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless.<ref>Pound, Ezra.

He was disgusted by the massive loss of life during the war and was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word ''usury'' appears in his work for the first time. The critic [[F. R. Leavis]] saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.<ref>Adams (2005), 149; Leavis (1932), 134, 150.</ref>\n\nThe war had shattered Pound's belief in modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own future as a poet. He had only the ''New Age'' to write for; his relationship with ''Poetry'' was finished, ''The Egoist'' was quickly running out of money because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's ''Ulysses'', and the funds for ''The Little Review'' had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over and resolved to move to Paris.<ref>Moody (2007), 394\u2013396</ref>\n\n''The New Age'' published Pound's ''Axiomata'' in January 1921, a statement of his views on consciousness and the universe: \"the intimate essence of the universe is ''not'' of the same nature as our own consciousness.\"<ref>Witemeyer (1969), [https://archive.org/details/poetryofezrapoun0000wite_e2d2/page/25 25]; Orage (1921), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOkS64ayYvgC&pg=PA201 201]</ref> Orage wrote in the same issue:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.&nbsp;...

The ''Review'' published works by Pound, Hemingway and [[Gertrude Stein]], as well as extracts from Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', before the money ran out in 1925. It also published several Pound music reviews, later collected into ''Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony''.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 430\u2013431, 448</ref>\n\nHemingway asked Pound to blue-ink his short stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong relationship of mutual respect and friendship, living on the same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. \"They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work\", writes Hemingway biographer [[Jeffrey Meyers]], with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told [[Sherwood Anderson]], \"[Ezra] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish\".<ref name=\"Meyers 1985 70 74\"/>\n\nPound was 36 when he met the 26-year-old American violinist [[Olga Rudge]] in Paris in late 1922, beginning a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer [[John Tytell]] believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had turned a blind eye to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress [[Natalie Barney]] in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]]. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy [[Youngstown, Ohio]], steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the [[Rive Droite|Right Bank]], socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 180; Wilhelm (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UpmBwzOT7hwC&pg=PA251 251]</ref> They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with [[George Antheil]] to apply the concept of [[Vorticism]] to music, and managed to write two operas, including ''Le Testament de Villon''.

She had little interest in raising a child, but may have felt that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, [[Mary de Rachewiltz|Mary]]. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.<ref>Tytell (1987), 198</ref>\n\nWhen Pound told Dorothy about the birth, she separated from him for much of that year and the next.<ref>Wilhelm (1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&pg=PA13 13\u201315]</ref> In December 1925, she left on an extended trip to Egypt.

In September, Hemingway drove Dorothy to the [[American Hospital of Paris]] for the birth of a son, [[Omar Pound]]. In a letter to his parents in October, Pound wrote, \"next generation (male) arrived. Both D & it appear to be doing well\".<ref>Carpenter (1988), 452\u2013453</ref> Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had bought her a house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had a single pair of shoes, and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother.<ref>For the house in Venice, see Tytell (1987), 198, and Mamoli Zorzi (2007), 15, 23; for Mary's memoir, see de Rachewiltz (1971), 1</ref>\n\nIn 1925 the literary magazine ''This Quarter'' dedicated its first issue to Pound, including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce. Pound published ''Cantos XVII\u2013XIX'' in the winter editions. In March 1927 he launched his own literary magazine, ''The Exile'', but only four issues were published. It did well in the first year, with contributions from Hemingway, [[E. E. Cummings]], Basil Bunting, Yeats, William Carlos Williams and [[Robert McAlmon]]; some of the poorest work in the magazine were Pound's rambling editorials on [[Confucianism]] and or in praise of Lenin, according to biographer J. J. Wilhelm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&pg=PA22 Wilhelm (1994), 22\u201324]</ref> He continued to work on Fenollosa's manuscripts, and in 1928 won ''[[The Dial]]'''s poetry award for his translation of the [[Confucian classic]] ''[[Great Learning]]'' (''D\u00e0 Xu\u00e9'', transliterated as ''Ta Hio'').<ref name=Nadelxxii>Nadel (1999), xxi\u2013xxiii</ref> That year his parents Homer and Isabel visited him in Rapallo, seeing him for the first time since 1914.

The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to ''paradiso terrestre''. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922.<ref name=Terrellvii>Terrell (1980), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8uEqOrAnat0C&pg=PR7 vii]</ref> The first three appear in ''Poetry'' in June\u2013August 1917. The ''Malatesta Cantos'' appeared in ''[[The Criterion]]'' in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in ''The Transatlantic Review'' in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of ''A Draft of XVI.

H. Douglas]]'s idea of [[social credit]], and that [[fascism]] was the vehicle for reform. He had met Douglas in the ''New Age'' offices and had been impressed by his ideas.<ref>Preda (2005), 90</ref> He gave a series of lectures on economics, and made contact<!--vague--> with politicians in the United States to discuss education, interstate commerce and international affairs. Although Hemingway advised against it, on 30 January 1933 Pound met [[Benito Mussolini]]. Olga Rudge played for Mussolini and told him about Pound, who had earlier sent him a copy of ''Cantos XXX''. During the meeting Pound tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas, but Mussolini brushed them aside, though he called the ''Cantos'' \"''divertente''\" (entertaining). The meeting was recorded in ''Canto XLI'': \"'Ma questo' / said the boss, '\u00e8 divertente.'\" Pound said he had \"never met anyone who seemed to ''get'' my ideas so quickly as the boss\".<ref>Tytell (1987), 228\u2013232</ref>\n\nWhen Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to organize the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar for the first time in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C., where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.<ref>Tytell (1987), 250\u2013253</ref>\n\nIn June 1939 he received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College, and a week later returned to Italy from the States and began writing [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] material for Italian newspapers. He wrote to [[James Laughlin]] that Roosevelt represented Jewry, and signed the letter with \"[[Heil Hitler]]\". He started writing for ''Action'', a newspaper owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], arguing that the [[Third Reich]] was the \"natural civilizer of Russia\".<ref name=Tytell254>Tytell (1987), 254</ref> After war broke out in September that year, he began a furious letter-writing campaign to the politicians he had petitioned six months earlier, arguing that the war was the result of an international banking conspiracy and that the United States should keep out of it.<ref name=Tytell253>Tytell (1987), 253\u2013265</ref>\n\n===Radio broadcasts===\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote= You let in the Jew and the Jew rotted your empire, and you yourselves out-jewed the Jew.

Pound wrote over 1,000 letters per year during the 1930s and presented his ideas in hundreds of articles as well as in ''The Cantos''. His greatest fear was an economic structure dependent on the armaments industry, where the profit motive would govern war and peace. He read [[George Santayana]] and ''The Law of Civilization and Decay'' by [[Brooks Adams]], finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant. He wrote in ''The Japan Times'' that \"Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a 'country run by Jews,'\" and told Sir Oswald Mosley's newspaper that the English were a slave race governed since Waterloo by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].<ref name=Tytell253/>\n\nPound broadcast over Rome Radio, although the Italian government was at first reluctant, concerned that he might be a double agent. He told a friend: \"It took me, I think it was, two years, insistence and wrangling etc., to get hold of their microphone.\"<ref>Tytell (1987), 260</ref> He recorded over 100 broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940, he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a \"rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar\", that throughout the \"disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage\". The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped\u2014his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo\u2014and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.<ref>Tytell (1987), 264\u2013266</ref>\n\nThe broadcasts were monitored by the United States [[Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service]] listening station at Princeton University, and in July 1943, Pound was indicted ''in absentia'' for treason.

Olga lost possession of her house in Venice and took a small house with Mary above Rapallo at Sant' Ambrogio.<ref>Gery (2010), 222</ref> In 1943 Pound and Dorothy were evicted from their apartment in Rapallo. His mother's apartment was too small, and the couple moved in with Olga. Mary, then 19 and finished with convent school, was quickly sent back to [[Gais, South Tyrol|Gais]] (a German-speaking South Tyrolian village of Italy), leaving Pound, as she would later write, \"pent up with two women who loved him, whom he loved, and who coldly hated each other.\"<ref>Tytell (1987), 262</ref>\n\nPound was in Rome early in September when [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]]. He borrowed a pair of hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked the rest of the way; he apparently traveled over {{convert|450|mile}} in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.{{efn|Stock (1970): \"In a letter written in October 1966 Mrs Pound recalled the period in these words: 'E.P. was in Rome when it was taken and he walked out (in a pair of Degli Uberti's heavy boots, many years later restored to owner) along the only road going north not infested by troops\u2014spent a night in the open and with some peasants\u2014got to a junction where there was a train going north with a herd of the dismantled Italian army ...' In an article published in 1966 his daughter said that during the long journey he slept in farms, in dormitories, and in the open, receiving food from kindly women on the way. Altogether Pound travelled more than 450 miles, arriving at Gais, his daughter said, 'one late afternoon, exhausted, his feet all blisters'.\"<ref>Stock (1970), 401; also see Tytell (1987), 264\u2013273</ref>}}\n\nHe returned home to Rapallo, where on 3 May 1945, four days after Mussolini was shot, armed [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] arrived at the house to find Pound alone.

Engineers reinforced his cage with heavier steel for fear the fascists would try to break him out.<ref>Stock (1970), 408</ref>\n\nPound spent three weeks in isolation in the heat, sleeping on the concrete, denied exercise and communication, except for conversations with the chaplain. After two and a half weeks, he began to break down under the strain. [[Richard Sieburth]] wrote that Pound recorded it in ''Canto LXXX'', where [[Odysseus]] is saved from drowning by [[Leucothea]]: \"hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me.\" Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week. On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists, one of whom found symptoms of a mental breakdown, after which he was transferred to his own tent and allowed reading material.

''Le Figaro'' published an appeal titled \"The Lunatic at St Elizabeths\". ''The New Republic'', ''Esquire'' and ''The Nation'' followed suit; ''The Nation'' argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man, but had rights. In 1958, MacLeish hired [[Thurman Arnold]], a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment.

He wrote about her in ''Canto CXIII'': \"The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill.\" Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to the United States.<ref name=Tytell328>Tytell (1987), 328\u2013332; for the reference to \"Canto 113\", see Sieburth (2003), xl</ref>\n\nBy December 1959, Pound was mired in depression. He saw his work as worthless and ''The Cantos'' botched. In a 1960 interview given in Rome to [[Donald Hall]] for ''Paris Review'', he said: \"You\u2014find me\u2014in fragments.\" Hall wrote that he seemed in an \"abject despair, [[Acedia|accidie]], meaninglessness, [[Aboulia|abulia]], waste\". He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then suddenly sagging, and at one point seemed about to collapse.

He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a [[Neo-fascism|neo-Fascist]] [[May day parade|May Day parade]] in 1962, but his health continued to decline.

The next night he was admitted to the Civil Hospital of Venice, where he died in his sleep on 1 November, of [[septic shock]] caused by complications from an [[intestinal blockage]], with Olga at his side. Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, [[Isola di San Michele]], where he was buried near [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 339; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/11/02/79477128.pdf \"Ezra Pound Dies in Venice at Age of 87\"], ''The New York Times'', 2 November 1972.</ref> Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.<ref name = \"Nadel18\"/>\n\n==Style==\nCritics generally agree that Pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist, particularly in his early work, such as \"The River Merchant's Wife\".<ref>O'Connor (1963), 7, 19</ref> According to Witmeyer a modern style is evident as early as ''Ripostes'', and Nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began ''The Cantos'', writing that Pound wanted his poetry to represent an \"objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own\" without use of symbolism or romanticism.<ref name=Nadel19991>Nadel (1999), 1\u20136; Witmeyer (1999), 47</ref>\n\nDrawing on literature from a variety of disciplines, Pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions, yet led the reader to an intended conclusion, believing the \"thoughtful man\" would apply a sense of organization and uncover the underlying symbolism and structure.<ref>Coats (2009), 87\u201389</ref> Ignoring Victorian and Edwardian grammar and structure, he created a unique form of speech, employing odd and strange words, jargon, avoiding verbs, and using rhetorical devices such as [[parataxis]].<ref>Stark (2001) 10\u201312</ref>\n\nPound's relationship to music is essential to his poetry. Although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as \"raucous, nasal, scratchy\", Michael Ingam writes that Pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound, an \"ear\" for words, imbuing his poetry with [[Ezra Pound's Three Kinds of Poetry|melopoeia]].<ref name = \"Ingham236\"/> His study of troubadour poetry\u2014words written to be sung (''motz et son'')\u2014led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly.<ref name = \"Ingham236\">Ingham (1999), 236\u2013237</ref> He wrote that rhythm is \"the hardest quality of a man's style to counterfeit\".<ref>Pound (1968), 103</ref> Ingham compares the form of ''The Cantos'' to a [[fugue]]; without adhering strictly to the traditions of the form, nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously. He goes on to write that Pound's use of [[counterpoint]] is integral to the structure and cohesion of ''The Cantos'', which show multi-voiced counterpoint and, with the juxtaposition of images, non-linear themes. The pieces are presented in fragments \"which taken together, can be seen to unfold in time as music does\".<ref>Ingham (1999), 244\u2013245</ref>\n\n===Imagism and Vorticism===\n[[File:EzraPound Ripostes.png|thumb|upright|alt=cover|[[Dorothy Shakespear]] designed the Vorticism-inspired [[cover art]] for Pound's 1915 ''Ripostes''.]]\n\nOpinion varies about the nature of Pound's writing style. Nadel writes that imagism was to change Pound's poetry.<ref name=Nadel19991/> Like Wyndham Lewis, Pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in Edwardian writing, saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that the poet should always use the \"exact\" word, stripping the writing down to the \"barest essence\".<ref>Oliver (2011), 87</ref> According to Nadel, \"Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction&nbsp;... replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics.\"<ref name=Nadel19991/> Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate \"all but the hardest kernel\" from a poem, such as in the two-line poem \"In a Station of the Metro\".<ref name = \"Albright60\"/> However, Pound learned that Imagism did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic, so he turned to the more dynamic structure of Vorticism for ''The Cantos''.<ref name = \"Albright60\">Albright (1999), 60</ref>\n\n===Translations===\nPound's translations represent a substantial part of his work. He began his career with translations of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ballads and ended with translations of Egyptian poetry. Yao says the body of translations by modernist poets in general, much of which Pound started, consists of some of the most \"significant modernist achievements in English\".<ref>Yao (2010), 34\u201335</ref> Pound was the first English language poet since [[John Dryden]], some three centuries earlier, to give primacy to translations in English literature. The fullness of the achievement for the modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism, multilingualism, and, perhaps of greater importance, they treated translations not in a strict sense of the word but instead saw a translation as the creation of an original work.<ref>Yao (2010), 33\u201336</ref>\n\n[[Michael J. Alexander|Michael Alexander]] writes that, as a translator, Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Du Fu]], and brought [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al]] and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.<ref>Alexander (1997), 23\u201330</ref>\n\nIn Pound's Fenollosa translations, unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry, which tended to work with strict [[metre (poetry)|metrical]] and [[stanza]]ic patterns, Pound created [[free verse]] translations. Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy.<ref name=Xie1999/> [[Hugh Kenner]] contends that ''Cathay'' should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems. The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to \"rethink the nature of an English poem\". These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West.<ref name=Kenner199>Kenner (1971), 199</ref> Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound's use of language in his translation of \"The Seafarer\" is deliberate, in that he avoids merely \"trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language\".<ref name=Xie1999>Xie (1999), 204\u2013212</ref>\n\n===''The Cantos''===\n{{further|List of cultural references in The Cantos}}\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>And then went down to the ship,\nSet keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and\nWe set up mast and sail on that swart ship,\nBore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also\nHeavy with weeping, and winds from sternward\nBore us out onward with bellying canvas,\nCirce's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.\nThen sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,\nThus with stretched sail, we went over sea til day's end.</poem>\n |source=\u2014 Canto I (1917)}}\n''The Cantos'' is difficult to decipher. In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, [[Elegy|elegies]], essays and memoirs.<ref name=\"Nadel1-6\">Nadel (1999), 1\u20136</ref> Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of the 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century [[comparative literature]]. Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing \"themes and history\" from [[Homer]] to [[Ovid]] and [[Dante]], from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], and many others. The work presents a multitude of protagonists as \"travellers between nations\". The nature of ''The Cantos'', she says, is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against \"a Poundian standard\" of modernism.<ref>Beasley (2010), 662</ref>\n\nPound layered ideas, cultures and historical periods, writing in as many as 15 different languages, using modern [[vernacular]], Classical languages and Chinese ideograms.<ref>Xie (1999), 217</ref> Ira Nadel says ''The Cantos'' is an [[Epic poetry|epic]], that is \"a poem including history\", and that the \"historical figures lend referentiality to the text\". It functions as a contemporary memoir, in which \"personal history [and] lyrical retrospection mingle\"\u2014most clearly represented in the ''Pisan Cantos''.<ref name=\"Nadel1-6\"/> Michael Ingham sees in ''The Cantos'' an American tradition of experimental literature, writing about it, \"These works include everything but the kitchen sink, and then add the kitchen sink\".<ref>Ingham (1999), 240</ref> In the 1960s William O'Connor described ''The Cantos'' as filled with \"cryptic and gnomic utterances, dirty jokes, obscenities of various sorts\".<ref>O'Connor (1963), 7</ref>\n\n[[Allen Tate]] believes the poem is not about anything and is without beginning, middle or end. He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and \"at the mercy of random flights of 'angelic insight,' an [[Icarians|Icarian]] self-indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated\".<ref>Tate (1965), 87</ref> This perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of ''The Cantos''.<ref>Nadel (1999), 8</ref> Pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure, and regretted that he could not \"make it cohere\".<ref>Nicholls (1999), 144</ref>\n\n===Literary criticism and economic theory===\nPound's literary criticism and essays are, according to [[Massimo Bacigalupo]], a \"form of intellectual journal\". In early works, such as ''The Spirit of Romance'' and \"I Gather the Limbs of Osiris\", Pound paid attention to medieval [[troubadour]] poets\u2014[[Arnaut Daniel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]]. The former piece was to \"remain one of Pound's principal sourcebooks for his poetry\"; in the latter he introduces the concept of \"luminous details\".<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 188\u2013191</ref> The [[leitmotif]]s in Pound's literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events, which, he believed, through the use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth; and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures.<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 203</ref>\n\nPound wrote intensively about economic theory with the ''ABC of Economics'' and ''Jefferson and/or Mussolini'', published in the mid-1930s right after he was introduced to Mussolini. These were followed by ''The Guide to Kulchur'', covering 2500 years of history, which [[Tim Redman]] describes as the \"most complete synthesis of Pound's political and economic thought\".<ref>Redman (1999), 258</ref> Pound thought writing the cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics, and he wove his economic theories throughout; neither can be understood without the other.<ref>Redman (1999), 255\u2013260</ref> In these pamphlets and in ''[[The ABC of Reading]]'', he sought to emphasize the value of art and to \"aestheticize the political\", written forcefully, according to Nadel, and in a \"determined voice\".<ref>Nadel (1999), 10</ref> In form his criticism and essays are direct, repetitive and reductionist, his rhetoric minimalist, filled with \"strident impatience\", according to Pound scholar Jason Coats, and frequently failing to make a coherent claim. He rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own, although not very successfully, in Coats's view.<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 203; Coats (2009), 80, 83</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nIn 1922, the literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] reviewed Pound's latest published volume of poetry, ''Poems 1918\u201321'', and took the opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of Pound as poet. In his essay on Pound, titled \"Ezra Pound's Patchwork\", Wilson wrote:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Ezra Pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It is true that he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.&nbsp;... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself&nbsp;...<ref name=Wilson1922>Wilson, Edmund (2007). \"Ezra Pound's Patchwork\", ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s & 30s''. Library of America, 44, 45; the essay was first published on 19 April 1922.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Wilson, the lines in Pound's poems stood isolated, with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that \"do not hang together\". Citing Pound's first seven cantos, Wilson dubbed the writing \"unsatisfactory\". He found ''The Cantos'' disjointed and its contents reflecting a too-obvious reliance on the literary works of other authors, and an awkward use of Latin and Chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of Pound's own life.<ref name=Wilson1922/>\n\nThe rise of [[New Criticism]] during the 1950s, in which author is separated from text, secured Pound's poetic reputation.<ref>Beasley (2010), 651</ref> Nadel writes that the publication of T.S. Eliot's ''Literary Essays'' in 1954 \"initiated the recuperation of Ezra Pound\". Eliot's essays coincided with the work of [[Hugh Kenner]], who visited Pound extensively at St. Elizabeths.<ref name=\"Nadel12\">Nadel (1999), 12</ref> Kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound, adding that there is also no one to appeal more through \"sheer beauty of language\".<ref>Kenner (1983), 16</ref> Along with [[Donald Davie]], Kenner brought a new appreciation to Pound's work in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Alexander (1997), 15\u201318</ref> Donald Gallup's Pound bibliography was published in 1963 and Kenner's ''[[The Pound Era]]'' in 1971.<ref name=\"Nadel12\"/> In the 1970s a literary journal dedicated to Pound studies (''Paideuma'') was established, and Ronald Bush published the first dedicated critical study of ''The Cantos'', to be followed by a number of research editions of ''The Cantos''.<ref name=\"Nadel12\"/>\n\nFollowing Mullins' biography, described by Nadel as \"partisan\" and \"melodramatic\", was Noel Stock's factual 1970 ''Life of Ezra Pound'', although the material included was subject to Dorothy's approval. The 1980s saw three significant biographies: [[John Tytell]]'s \"neutral\" account in 1987, followed by Wilhelm's multi-volume biography. [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s sprawling narrative, a \"complete life\", built on what Stock began; unlike Stock, Carpenter had the benefit of working without intervention from Pound's relatives. In 2007 David Moody published the first of his multi-volume biography, combining narrative with literary criticism, the first work to link the two.<ref>Nadel (2010b), 162\u2013165</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s Mary de Rachewiltz released the first dual-language edition of ''The Cantos'', including \"Canto LXXII\" and \"Canto LXXIII\".<ref name=\"Nadel13\"/> These cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines, and are characterized by 21st-century literary scholars as no more than war-time propaganda.<ref>Feldman (2012), 94</ref> In 1991 a complete facsimile edition of Pound's prose and poetry was published, now considered a \"fundamental research tool\", according to Nadel.<ref name=\"Nadel13\">Nadel (1999), 13</ref> Scholarship in the 1990s turned toward in-depth investigations of his antisemitism and Rome years. Tim Redman writes about Pound's fascism and his relationship with Mussolini, and Leon Surrette about Pound's economic theories, especially during the Italian period, investigating how Pound the poet became Pound the fascist.<ref>Coats (2009), 81</ref> In 1999 Surrette wrote about the state of Pound criticism, that \"the effort to uncover coherence in a&nbsp;... crazy quilt of verse styles, critical principles, crankish economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive the genesis and development of any of these components\". He emphasized that Pound's \"economic and political opinions have not been properly dated, nor has the suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated\".<ref>Surrette (1999) 13</ref>\n\nNadel's 2010 ''Pound in Context'' is a contextual literary approach to Pound scholarship. Pound's life, \"the social, political, historical, and literary developments of his period\", is fully investigated, which, according to Nadel is \"the grid for reading Pound's poetry\".<ref>Nadel (2010a), 1\u20136</ref> In 2012 Matthew Feldman wrote that the more than 1,500 documents in the \"Pound files\" held by the FBI have been ignored by scholars, and almost certainly contain evidence that \"Pound was politically cannier, was more bureaucratically involved with Italian Fascism, and was more involved with Mussolini's regime than has been posited\".<ref>Feldman (2012), 90\u201391</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nPound helped advance the careers of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century. In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway and [[Conrad Aiken]], he befriended and helped [[Marianne Moore]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Basil Bunting]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], [[George Oppen]] and [[Charles Olson]].<ref>Bornstein (1999), 22\u201323</ref> Hugh Witemeyer argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th-century English-language poetry because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him.<ref>Witemeyer (1999), 48</ref> In 1917, [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote in ''Poetry'': \"All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant. Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch. The point is, he will be mentioned.\"<ref>Eliot (1917), 3</ref><!-- Pound strongly influenced the two significant modernising poets in the [[Irish Language]] in the mid-twentieth century, [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in]] and [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]].<ref>O'Brien (1978), 205</ref> -->\n\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>I have tried to write Paradise<br />\nDo not move\n:::Let the wind speak.\n:::::that is paradise.\nLet the Gods forgive what I\n:::::have made\nLet those I love try to forgive\n:::::what I have made.\n</poem>\n |source= \u2014 [[The Cantos#Drafts and fragments of Cantos CX\u2013CXVII|Canto 120]]<ref>Canto 120, the final canto, first published in ''Threshold'', Belfast, and in ''The Anonym Quarterly'', New York, 1969.

University of Michigan Press, 1995, [https://archive.org/details/hallofmirrorsdra0000stoi/page/66 66]</ref>\n}}\nThe outrage after Pound's wartime collaboration with Mussolini's regime was so deep that the imagined method of his execution dominated the discussion. [[Arthur Miller]] considered him worse than Hitler: \"In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra&nbsp;... he knew all America's weaknesses and he played them as expertly as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] ever did.\" The response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists, and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re-evaluation. [[Macha Rosenthal]] wrote that it was \"as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest\" in Ezra Pound.<ref>For Arthur Miller's quote, see Torrey (1984), 200. For Rosenthal, see her ''A Primer of Ezra Pound''. Macmillan, 1960, 2</ref>\n\nPound's antisemitism has soured evaluation of his poetry. Pound scholar Wendy Stallard Flory writes that separating the poetry from the antisemitism is perceived as apologetic. She believes the positioning of Pound as \"National Monster\" and \"designated fascist intellectual\" made him a stand-in for the silent majority in Germany, occupied France and Belgium, as well as Britain and the United States, who, she argues, made the [[Holocaust]] possible by aiding or standing by.<ref>Flory (1999), 285\u2013286, 294\u2013300</ref>\n\nLater in his life, Pound analyzed what he judged to be his own failings as a writer attributable to his adherence to ideological fallacies.<ref name=\"Carpenter898ff\"/> [[Allen Ginsberg]] states that, in a private conversation in 1967, Pound told the young poet, \"my poems don't make sense.\" He went on to say that he \"was not a lunatic, but a moron\", and to characterize his writing as \"stupid and ignorant\", \"a mess\". Ginsberg reassured Pound that he \"had shown us the way\", but Pound refused to be mollified:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">'Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions\u2014the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things,' [he] replied. Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-semitism.'<ref name=\"Carpenter898ff\">Carpenter (1988), 898\u2013899</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Kashner|first= Sam|date= 2005|title= When I Was Cool|url= |location= New York|publisher= HarperCollins Perennial|page= 86|isbn= 006000567-X|author-link= |quote= Allen explained how he tried to deal with anti-Semitic remarks.

His works include ''[[Ripostes]]'' (1912), ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, ''[[The Cantos]]'' (1917\u20131969).\n\nPound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].{{efn|[[Ernest Hemingway]] wrote in 1925: \"[W]e have Pound the major poet devoting, say, one fifth of his time to poetry. With the rest of his time he tries to advance the fortunes, both material and artistic, of his friends. He defends them when they are attacked, he gets them into magazines and out of jail. He loans them money. He sells their pictures. He arranges concerts for them. He writes articles about them. He introduces them to wealthy women. He gets publishers to take their books. He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying and he witnesses their wills. He advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide. And in the end a few of them refrain from knifing him at the first opportunity.\"<ref>Hemingway, \"Homage to Ezra\", ''This Quarter'', 1, Spring 1925, 221\u2013225, in Hemingway (2006), 5\u20136</ref>}} Angered by the carnage of [[World War I]], Pound lost faith in [[Great Britain]] and blamed the war on [[usury]] and international capitalism. He moved to Italy in 1924 and throughout the 1930s and 1940s embraced [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|fascism]], expressed support for [[Adolf Hitler]], and wrote for publications owned by the British fascist [[Sir Oswald Mosley]]. During [[World War II]], he was paid by the Italian government to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Jews]], as a result of which he was arrested in 1945 by American forces in Italy on charges of [[treason]]. He spent months in detention in a U.S. military camp in [[Pisa]], including three weeks in a {{convert|6|by|6|ft|m|adj=on}} outdoor steel cage, which he said triggered a mental breakdown: \"when the raft broke and the waters went over me\".

Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, [[Sidney McCall|Mary McNeill Fenollosa]], decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work; she was looking for someone who cared about poetry rather than philology.<ref>Moody (2007), 239</ref> Pound edited and published Fenellosa's ''The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry'' in 1918.<ref>''The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry: A Critical Edition'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 2008).</ref>\n\nThe title page of the collection ''[[Cathay (poetry collection)|Cathay]]'' (1915), refers to the poet \"Rihaku\", the pronunciation in Japanese of the [[Tang dynasty]] Chinese poet, [[Li Bai]], whose poems were much beloved in China and Japan for their technical mastery and much translated in the West because of their seeming simplicity.

He submitted his own poems, as well as poems by [[James Joyce]], [[Robert Frost]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], Yeats, H.D. and Aldington, and collected material for a 64-page anthology, ''Des Imagistes'' (1914). The Imagist movement began to attract attention from critics.<ref>Stock (1970), 143\u2013147; Tytell (1987), 97</ref> In November 1913 Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, rented Stone Cottage in [[Coleman's Hatch]], Sussex, and invited Pound to accompany him as his secretary. They stayed there for 10 weeks, reading and writing, walking in the woods and fencing. It was the first of three winters they spent together at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Pound married on 20 April 1914.<ref>Moody (2007), 240; Longenbach (1988); Longenbach, James.

Dorothy's annual income was \u00a350, aided by \u00a3150 from her family. Her parents eventually consented, perhaps out of fear that she was getting older with no other suitor in sight. Pound's concession to marry in church helped convince them. Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, with the newly wed Hilda (H.D.) and Richard Aldington living next door.<ref>Moody (2007), 246\u2013249</ref>\n\nPound wrote for Wyndham Lewis's literary magazine ''[[Blast (magazine)|Blast]],'' although only two issues were published. An advertisement in ''The Egoist'' promised it would cover \"Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art\". Pound took the opportunity to extend the definition of Imagisme to art, naming it [[Vorticism]]: \"The image is a radiant node or cluster; it is&nbsp;... a ''vortex'', from which, and through which, and into which, ideas are constantly rushing.\"<ref>Moody (2007), 230, 256</ref> Reacting to the magazine, the poet [[Lascelles Abercrombie]] called for the rejection of Imagism and a return to the traditionalism of [[William Wordsworth]]; Pound challenged him to a duel on the basis that \"Stupidity carried beyond a certain point becomes a public menace\".<ref>Stock (1970), 159</ref> Abercrombie suggested their choice of weapon be unsold copies of their own books.<ref name=Campbell>Campbell, James.

But Hilda and Richard were already moving away from Pound's understanding of the movement, as he aligned more with Wyndham Lewis's ideas. When Lowell agreed to finance an anthology of Imagist poets, Pound's work was not included. Upset at Lowell, he began to call ''Imagisme'' \"Amygism\", and in July 1914 he declared the movement dead and asked that the group not continue to call themselves Imagists. They dissented, not believing that the movement was Pound's invention, and Lowell eventually Anglicized the term.<ref>Moody (2007), 222\u2013225</ref>\n\n===World War I, disillusionment===\n{{further|Lost Generation}}\n[[File:T.

In 1915 he persuaded ''Poetry'' to publish [[T. S. Eliot]]'s \"[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]\". Eliot had sent \"Prufrock\" to almost every editor in England, but was rejected. He eventually sent it to Pound, who instantly saw it as a work of genius and submitted it to ''Poetry''.<ref name=Aiken>Aiken (1965), 4\u20135</ref> \"[Eliot] has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN\", Pound wrote to Monroe in October 1914. \"The rest of the promising young have done one or the other but never both.

[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0108/features/letter.html \"Letter by letter\"], ''University of Chicago Magazine'', April 2001.</ref>\n\nAfter the publication in 1915 of ''Cathay'', Pound mentioned he was working on a long poem, casting about for the correct form. He told a friend in August: \"It is a huge, I was going to say, gamble, but shan't\", and in September described it as a \"cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore\". About a year later, in January 1917, he had the first three trial cantos, distilled to one, published as Canto I in ''Poetry''.<ref>Moody (2007), 306\u2013307</ref> He was now a regular contributor to three literary magazines. From 1917 he wrote music reviews for ''The New Age'' under the pen name William Atheling, and weekly pieces for ''The Egoist'' and ''[[The Little Review]]''; many of the latter were directed against provincialism and ignorance. The volume of writing exhausted him. He feared he was wasting his time writing outside poetry,<ref>Moody (2007), 330, 334</ref> exclaiming that he \"''must'' stop writing so much prose\".<ref name=\"m342\">Moody (2007), 342</ref>\n\n[[File:Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound 01 (brightened).jpg|thumb|upright|Pound commissioned this sculpture from [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] in 1913.]]\nPound was deeply affected by the war. He was devastated when Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, from whom he had commissioned a sculpture of himself two years earlier, was killed in the trenches in 1915. He published ''Gaudier-Brzeska: A Memoir'' the following year, in reaction to what he saw as an unnecessary loss.<ref>Stock (1970), 174, 180\u2013182</ref> In the autumn of 1917 his depression worsened. He blamed American provincialism for the seizure of the October issue of ''The Little Review''. The [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]] applied the [[Comstock Laws]] against an article Lewis wrote, describing it as lewd and indecent. Around the same time, Hulme was killed by shell-fire in Flanders, and Yeats married [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]].<ref>Moody (2007), 334\u2013335</ref> In 1918, after a bout of illness which was presumably the [[Spanish influenza]], Pound decided to stop writing for ''The Little Review'', mostly because of the volume of work. He asked the publisher for a raise to hire 23-year-old [[Iseult Gonne]] as a typist, causing rumors that Pound was having an affair with her, but he was turned down.<ref name=\"m342\" />\n\nIn 1919 he published a collection of his essays for ''The Little Review'' as ''Instigations'', and in the March 1919 issue ''Poetry,'' he published ''Poems from the Propertius Series'', which appeared to be a translation of the Latin Poet [[Sextus Propertius]]. When he included this in his next poetry collection in 1921, he had renamed it ''Homage to Sextus Propertius'' in response to criticism of his translation skills. \"Propertius\" is not a strict translation; biographer David Moody describes it as \"the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence\". Harriet Monroe, editor of ''Poetry'', published a letter from a professor of Latin, [[William Gardner Hale|W. G. Hale]], saying that Pound was \"incredibly ignorant\" of the language, and alluded to \"about three-score errors\" in ''Homage''. Monroe did not publish Pound's response, which began \"Cat-piss and porcupines!!\" and continued, \"The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Fitzgerald]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar]] is a translation\". Moore interpreted Pound's silence after that as his resignation as foreign editor.<ref>Kenner (1971), 286</ref>\n\n===''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley''===\n{{further|Wikisource:Hugh Selwyn Mauberley}}\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=left\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>There died a myriad\nAnd of the best, among them,\nFor an old bitch gone in the teeth,\nFor a botched civilization,<br />\nCharm, smiling at the good mouth,\nQuick eyes gone under earth's lid,<br />\nFor two gross of broken statues,\nFor a few thousand battered books.\n</poem>\n |source= \u2014 ''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley'', Section V (1920)}}\n\nHis poem ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' consists of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless.<ref>Pound, Ezra.

He was disgusted by the massive loss of life during the war and was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word ''usury'' appears in his work for the first time. The critic [[F. R. Leavis]] saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.<ref>Adams (2005), 149; Leavis (1932), 134, 150.</ref>\n\nThe war had shattered Pound's belief in modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own future as a poet. He had only the ''New Age'' to write for; his relationship with ''Poetry'' was finished, ''The Egoist'' was quickly running out of money because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's ''Ulysses'', and the funds for ''The Little Review'' had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over and resolved to move to Paris.<ref>Moody (2007), 394\u2013396</ref>\n\n''The New Age'' published Pound's ''Axiomata'' in January 1921, a statement of his views on consciousness and the universe: \"the intimate essence of the universe is ''not'' of the same nature as our own consciousness.\"<ref>Witemeyer (1969), [https://archive.org/details/poetryofezrapoun0000wite_e2d2/page/25 25]; Orage (1921), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MOkS64ayYvgC&pg=PA201 201]</ref> Orage wrote in the same issue:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.&nbsp;...

The ''Review'' published works by Pound, Hemingway and [[Gertrude Stein]], as well as extracts from Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', before the money ran out in 1925. It also published several Pound music reviews, later collected into ''Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony''.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 430\u2013431, 448</ref>\n\nHemingway asked Pound to blue-ink his short stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong relationship of mutual respect and friendship, living on the same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. \"They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work\", writes Hemingway biographer [[Jeffrey Meyers]], with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told [[Sherwood Anderson]], \"[Ezra] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish\".<ref name=\"Meyers 1985 70 74\"/>\n\nPound was 36 when he met the 26-year-old American violinist [[Olga Rudge]] in Paris in late 1922, beginning a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer [[John Tytell]] believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had turned a blind eye to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress [[Natalie Barney]] in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]]. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy [[Youngstown, Ohio]], steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the [[Rive Droite|Right Bank]], socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 180; Wilhelm (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UpmBwzOT7hwC&pg=PA251 251]</ref> They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with [[George Antheil]] to apply the concept of [[Vorticism]] to music, and managed to write two operas, including ''Le Testament de Villon''. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.<ref>For his operas, see Kenner (1973), 390; for his pieces for violin, see Stock (1970), 252\u2013256</ref>\n\n==Italy (1924\u20131945)==\n\n===Children===\n[[File:Barche-Rapallo.JPG|left|thumb|alt=photograph|The Pounds moved to [[Rapallo]] in 1924.<ref name=Tytell191/>]]\n\nThe Pounds were unhappy in Paris; Dorothy complained about the winters and Ezra's health was poor.

She had little interest in raising a child, but may have felt that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, [[Mary de Rachewiltz|Mary]]. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.<ref>Tytell (1987), 198</ref>\n\nWhen Pound told Dorothy about the birth, she separated from him for much of that year and the next.<ref>Wilhelm (1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&pg=PA13 13\u201315]</ref> In December 1925, she left on an extended trip to Egypt.

In September, Hemingway drove Dorothy to the [[American Hospital of Paris]] for the birth of a son, [[Omar Pound]]. In a letter to his parents in October, Pound wrote, \"next generation (male) arrived. Both D & it appear to be doing well\".<ref>Carpenter (1988), 452\u2013453</ref> Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had bought her a house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had a single pair of shoes, and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother.<ref>For the house in Venice, see Tytell (1987), 198, and Mamoli Zorzi (2007), 15, 23; for Mary's memoir, see de Rachewiltz (1971), 1</ref>\n\nIn 1925 the literary magazine ''This Quarter'' dedicated its first issue to Pound, including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce. Pound published ''Cantos XVII\u2013XIX'' in the winter editions. In March 1927 he launched his own literary magazine, ''The Exile'', but only four issues were published. It did well in the first year, with contributions from Hemingway, [[E. E. Cummings]], Basil Bunting, Yeats, William Carlos Williams and [[Robert McAlmon]]; some of the poorest work in the magazine were Pound's rambling editorials on [[Confucianism]] and or in praise of Lenin, according to biographer J. J. Wilhelm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=s3mw-IZom4sC&pg=PA22 Wilhelm (1994), 22\u201324]</ref> He continued to work on Fenollosa's manuscripts, and in 1928 won ''[[The Dial]]'''s poetry award for his translation of the [[Confucian classic]] ''[[Great Learning]]'' (''D\u00e0 Xu\u00e9'', transliterated as ''Ta Hio'').<ref name=Nadelxxii>Nadel (1999), xxi\u2013xxiii</ref> That year his parents Homer and Isabel visited him in Rapallo, seeing him for the first time since 1914.

They took a small house, Villa Raggio, on a hill above the town.<ref>Tytell (1987), 215</ref>\n\nPound began work on ''[[The Cantos]]'' in earnest after relocating to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a descent into hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to ''paradiso terrestre''. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922.<ref name=Terrellvii>Terrell (1980), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8uEqOrAnat0C&pg=PR7 vii]</ref> The first three appear in ''Poetry'' in June\u2013August 1917. The ''Malatesta Cantos'' appeared in ''[[The Criterion]]'' in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in ''The Transatlantic Review'' in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 of ''A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book''.<ref>Bush (1976), xiii\u2013xv</ref>\n\n===Turn to fascism, World War II===\nPound came to believe that the cause of World War I was finance capitalism, which he called \"[[usury]]\", that the solution lay in [[C. H. Douglas]]'s idea of [[social credit]], and that [[fascism]] was the vehicle for reform. He had met Douglas in the ''New Age'' offices and had been impressed by his ideas.<ref>Preda (2005), 90</ref> He gave a series of lectures on economics, and made contact<!--vague--> with politicians in the United States to discuss education, interstate commerce and international affairs. Although Hemingway advised against it, on 30 January 1933 Pound met [[Benito Mussolini]]. Olga Rudge played for Mussolini and told him about Pound, who had earlier sent him a copy of ''Cantos XXX''. During the meeting Pound tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas, but Mussolini brushed them aside, though he called the ''Cantos'' \"''divertente''\" (entertaining). The meeting was recorded in ''Canto XLI'': \"'Ma questo' / said the boss, '\u00e8 divertente.'\" Pound said he had \"never met anyone who seemed to ''get'' my ideas so quickly as the boss\".<ref>Tytell (1987), 228\u2013232</ref>\n\nWhen Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to organize the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar for the first time in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C., where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.<ref>Tytell (1987), 250\u2013253</ref>\n\nIn June 1939 he received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College, and a week later returned to Italy from the States and began writing [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] material for Italian newspapers.

Pound wrote over 1,000 letters per year during the 1930s and presented his ideas in hundreds of articles as well as in ''The Cantos''. His greatest fear was an economic structure dependent on the armaments industry, where the profit motive would govern war and peace. He read [[George Santayana]] and ''The Law of Civilization and Decay'' by [[Brooks Adams]], finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant. He wrote in ''The Japan Times'' that \"Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a 'country run by Jews,'\" and told Sir Oswald Mosley's newspaper that the English were a slave race governed since Waterloo by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].<ref name=Tytell253/>\n\nPound broadcast over Rome Radio, although the Italian government was at first reluctant, concerned that he might be a double agent. He told a friend: \"It took me, I think it was, two years, insistence and wrangling etc., to get hold of their microphone.\"<ref>Tytell (1987), 260</ref> He recorded over 100 broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940, he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a \"rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar\", that throughout the \"disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage\". The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped\u2014his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo\u2014and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.<ref>Tytell (1987), 264\u2013266</ref>\n\nThe broadcasts were monitored by the United States [[Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service]] listening station at Princeton University, and in July 1943, Pound was indicted ''in absentia'' for treason.

Olga lost possession of her house in Venice and took a small house with Mary above Rapallo at Sant' Ambrogio.<ref>Gery (2010), 222</ref> In 1943 Pound and Dorothy were evicted from their apartment in Rapallo. His mother's apartment was too small, and the couple moved in with Olga. Mary, then 19 and finished with convent school, was quickly sent back to [[Gais, South Tyrol|Gais]] (a German-speaking South Tyrolian village of Italy), leaving Pound, as she would later write, \"pent up with two women who loved him, whom he loved, and who coldly hated each other.\"<ref>Tytell (1987), 262</ref>\n\nPound was in Rome early in September when [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]]. He borrowed a pair of hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked the rest of the way; he apparently traveled over {{convert|450|mile}} in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.{{efn|Stock (1970): \"In a letter written in October 1966 Mrs Pound recalled the period in these words: 'E.P. was in Rome when it was taken and he walked out (in a pair of Degli Uberti's heavy boots, many years later restored to owner) along the only road going north not infested by troops\u2014spent a night in the open and with some peasants\u2014got to a junction where there was a train going north with a herd of the dismantled Italian army ...' In an article published in 1966 his daughter said that during the long journey he slept in farms, in dormitories, and in the open, receiving food from kindly women on the way. Altogether Pound travelled more than 450 miles, arriving at Gais, his daughter said, 'one late afternoon, exhausted, his feet all blisters'.\"<ref>Stock (1970), 401; also see Tytell (1987), 264\u2013273</ref>}}\n\nHe returned home to Rapallo, where on 3 May 1945, four days after Mussolini was shot, armed [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] arrived at the house to find Pound alone.

After two and a half weeks, he began to break down under the strain. [[Richard Sieburth]] wrote that Pound recorded it in ''Canto LXXX'', where [[Odysseus]] is saved from drowning by [[Leucothea]]: \"hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me.\" Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week. On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists, one of whom found symptoms of a mental breakdown, after which he was transferred to his own tent and allowed reading material.

He refused to talk to psychiatrists with Jewish-sounding names, dismissed people he disliked as \"Jews\", and urged visitors to read the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1903), a forgery claiming to represent a Jewish plan for world domination.<ref name=Tytell289/> He struck up a friendship with the conspiracy theorist and antisemite [[Eustace Mullins]], believed to be associated with the Aryan League of America, and author of the 1961 biography ''This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound''.<ref name=\"Wilhelm286\">Wilhelm (1994), 286, 306</ref>\n\nEven more damaging was his friendship with [[John Kasper]], a far-right activist and [[Ku Klux Klan]] member. Kasper had come to admire Pound during literature classes at university, and after he wrote to Pound in 1950 the two had become friends. Kasper opened a bookstore in [[Greenwich Village]] in 1953 called \"Make it New\", reflecting his commitment to Pound's ideas; the store specialized in far-right material, including Nazi literature, and Pound's poetry and translations were displayed on the window front.<ref name=Hickman127>Hickman (2005), 127</ref> Kasper and another follower of Pound's, David Horton, set up a publishing imprint, Square Dollar Series, which Pound used as a vehicle for his tracts about economic reform.<ref name=Tytell306>Tytell (1987), 306\u2013308</ref> Wilhelm writes that there were a lot of conventional people visiting Pound too, such as the classicist J.P.

''Le Figaro'' published an appeal titled \"The Lunatic at St Elizabeths\". ''The New Republic'', ''Esquire'' and ''The Nation'' followed suit; ''The Nation'' argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man, but had rights. In 1958, MacLeish hired [[Thurman Arnold]], a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment.

He wrote about her in ''Canto CXIII'': \"The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill.\" Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to the United States.<ref name=Tytell328>Tytell (1987), 328\u2013332; for the reference to \"Canto 113\", see Sieburth (2003), xl</ref>\n\nBy December 1959, Pound was mired in depression.

He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a [[Neo-fascism|neo-Fascist]] [[May day parade|May Day parade]] in 1962, but his health continued to decline.

Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.<ref name = \"Nadel18\"/>\n\n==Style==\nCritics generally agree that Pound was a strong yet subtle lyricist, particularly in his early work, such as \"The River Merchant's Wife\".<ref>O'Connor (1963), 7, 19</ref> According to Witmeyer a modern style is evident as early as ''Ripostes'', and Nadel sees evidence of modernism even before he began ''The Cantos'', writing that Pound wanted his poetry to represent an \"objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own\" without use of symbolism or romanticism.<ref name=Nadel19991>Nadel (1999), 1\u20136; Witmeyer (1999), 47</ref>\n\nDrawing on literature from a variety of disciplines, Pound intentionally layered often confusing juxtapositions, yet led the reader to an intended conclusion, believing the \"thoughtful man\" would apply a sense of organization and uncover the underlying symbolism and structure.<ref>Coats (2009), 87\u201389</ref> Ignoring Victorian and Edwardian grammar and structure, he created a unique form of speech, employing odd and strange words, jargon, avoiding verbs, and using rhetorical devices such as [[parataxis]].<ref>Stark (2001) 10\u201312</ref>\n\nPound's relationship to music is essential to his poetry. Although he was tone deaf and his speaking voice is described as \"raucous, nasal, scratchy\", Michael Ingam writes that Pound is on a short list of poets possessed of a sense of sound, an \"ear\" for words, imbuing his poetry with [[Ezra Pound's Three Kinds of Poetry|melopoeia]].<ref name = \"Ingham236\"/> His study of troubadour poetry\u2014words written to be sung (''motz et son'')\u2014led him to think modern poetry should be written similarly.<ref name = \"Ingham236\">Ingham (1999), 236\u2013237</ref> He wrote that rhythm is \"the hardest quality of a man's style to counterfeit\".<ref>Pound (1968), 103</ref> Ingham compares the form of ''The Cantos'' to a [[fugue]]; without adhering strictly to the traditions of the form, nevertheless multiple themes are explored simultaneously. He goes on to write that Pound's use of [[counterpoint]] is integral to the structure and cohesion of ''The Cantos'', which show multi-voiced counterpoint and, with the juxtaposition of images, non-linear themes. The pieces are presented in fragments \"which taken together, can be seen to unfold in time as music does\".<ref>Ingham (1999), 244\u2013245</ref>\n\n===Imagism and Vorticism===\n[[File:EzraPound Ripostes.png|thumb|upright|alt=cover|[[Dorothy Shakespear]] designed the Vorticism-inspired [[cover art]] for Pound's 1915 ''Ripostes''.]]\n\nOpinion varies about the nature of Pound's writing style. Nadel writes that imagism was to change Pound's poetry.<ref name=Nadel19991/> Like Wyndham Lewis, Pound reacted against decorative flourishes found in Edwardian writing, saying poetry required a precise and economic use of language and that the poet should always use the \"exact\" word, stripping the writing down to the \"barest essence\".<ref>Oliver (2011), 87</ref> According to Nadel, \"Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction&nbsp;... replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics.\"<ref name=Nadel19991/> Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate \"all but the hardest kernel\" from a poem, such as in the two-line poem \"In a Station of the Metro\".<ref name = \"Albright60\"/> However, Pound learned that Imagism did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic, so he turned to the more dynamic structure of Vorticism for ''The Cantos''.<ref name = \"Albright60\">Albright (1999), 60</ref>\n\n===Translations===\nPound's translations represent a substantial part of his work. He began his career with translations of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ballads and ended with translations of Egyptian poetry. Yao says the body of translations by modernist poets in general, much of which Pound started, consists of some of the most \"significant modernist achievements in English\".<ref>Yao (2010), 34\u201335</ref> Pound was the first English language poet since [[John Dryden]], some three centuries earlier, to give primacy to translations in English literature. The fullness of the achievement for the modernists is that they renewed interest in multiculturalism, multilingualism, and, perhaps of greater importance, they treated translations not in a strict sense of the word but instead saw a translation as the creation of an original work.<ref>Yao (2010), 33\u201336</ref>\n\n[[Michael J. Alexander|Michael Alexander]] writes that, as a translator, Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Du Fu]], and brought [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al]] and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive at a time when poets no longer considered translations central to their craft.<ref>Alexander (1997), 23\u201330</ref>\n\nIn Pound's Fenollosa translations, unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry, which tended to work with strict [[metre (poetry)|metrical]] and [[stanza]]ic patterns, Pound created [[free verse]] translations. Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy.<ref name=Xie1999/> [[Hugh Kenner]] contends that ''Cathay'' should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems. The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to \"rethink the nature of an English poem\". These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West.<ref name=Kenner199>Kenner (1971), 199</ref> Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound's use of language in his translation of \"The Seafarer\" is deliberate, in that he avoids merely \"trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language\".<ref name=Xie1999>Xie (1999), 204\u2013212</ref>\n\n===''The Cantos''===\n{{further|List of cultural references in The Cantos}}\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>And then went down to the ship,\nSet keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and\nWe set up mast and sail on that swart ship,\nBore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also\nHeavy with weeping, and winds from sternward\nBore us out onward with bellying canvas,\nCirce's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.\nThen sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,\nThus with stretched sail, we went over sea til day's end.</poem>\n |source=\u2014 Canto I (1917)}}\n''The Cantos'' is difficult to decipher. In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, [[Elegy|elegies]], essays and memoirs.<ref name=\"Nadel1-6\">Nadel (1999), 1\u20136</ref> Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to a rejection of the 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century [[comparative literature]]. Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing \"themes and history\" from [[Homer]] to [[Ovid]] and [[Dante]], from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], and many others. The work presents a multitude of protagonists as \"travellers between nations\". The nature of ''The Cantos'', she says, is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against \"a Poundian standard\" of modernism.<ref>Beasley (2010), 662</ref>\n\nPound layered ideas, cultures and historical periods, writing in as many as 15 different languages, using modern [[vernacular]], Classical languages and Chinese ideograms.<ref>Xie (1999), 217</ref> Ira Nadel says ''The Cantos'' is an [[Epic poetry|epic]], that is \"a poem including history\", and that the \"historical figures lend referentiality to the text\". It functions as a contemporary memoir, in which \"personal history [and] lyrical retrospection mingle\"\u2014most clearly represented in the ''Pisan Cantos''.<ref name=\"Nadel1-6\"/> Michael Ingham sees in ''The Cantos'' an American tradition of experimental literature, writing about it, \"These works include everything but the kitchen sink, and then add the kitchen sink\".<ref>Ingham (1999), 240</ref> In the 1960s William O'Connor described ''The Cantos'' as filled with \"cryptic and gnomic utterances, dirty jokes, obscenities of various sorts\".<ref>O'Connor (1963), 7</ref>\n\n[[Allen Tate]] believes the poem is not about anything and is without beginning, middle or end. He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and \"at the mercy of random flights of 'angelic insight,' an [[Icarians|Icarian]] self-indulgence of prejudice which is not checked by a total view to which it could be subordinated\".<ref>Tate (1965), 87</ref> This perceived lack of logical consistency or form is a common criticism of ''The Cantos''.<ref>Nadel (1999), 8</ref> Pound himself felt this absence of form was his great failure, and regretted that he could not \"make it cohere\".<ref>Nicholls (1999), 144</ref>\n\n===Literary criticism and economic theory===\nPound's literary criticism and essays are, according to [[Massimo Bacigalupo]], a \"form of intellectual journal\". In early works, such as ''The Spirit of Romance'' and \"I Gather the Limbs of Osiris\", Pound paid attention to medieval [[troubadour]] poets\u2014[[Arnaut Daniel]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]]. The former piece was to \"remain one of Pound's principal sourcebooks for his poetry\"; in the latter he introduces the concept of \"luminous details\".<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 188\u2013191</ref> The [[leitmotif]]s in Pound's literary criticism are recurrent patterns found in historical events, which, he believed, through the use of judicious juxtapositions illuminate truth; and in them he reveals forgotten writers and cultures.<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 203</ref>\n\nPound wrote intensively about economic theory with the ''ABC of Economics'' and ''Jefferson and/or Mussolini'', published in the mid-1930s right after he was introduced to Mussolini. These were followed by ''The Guide to Kulchur'', covering 2500 years of history, which [[Tim Redman]] describes as the \"most complete synthesis of Pound's political and economic thought\".<ref>Redman (1999), 258</ref> Pound thought writing the cantos meant writing an epic about history and economics, and he wove his economic theories throughout; neither can be understood without the other.<ref>Redman (1999), 255\u2013260</ref> In these pamphlets and in ''[[The ABC of Reading]]'', he sought to emphasize the value of art and to \"aestheticize the political\", written forcefully, according to Nadel, and in a \"determined voice\".<ref>Nadel (1999), 10</ref> In form his criticism and essays are direct, repetitive and reductionist, his rhetoric minimalist, filled with \"strident impatience\", according to Pound scholar Jason Coats, and frequently failing to make a coherent claim. He rejected traditional rhetoric and created his own, although not very successfully, in Coats's view.<ref>Bacigalupo (1999), 203; Coats (2009), 80, 83</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nIn 1922, the literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] reviewed Pound's latest published volume of poetry, ''Poems 1918\u201321'', and took the opportunity to provide an overview of his estimation of Pound as poet. In his essay on Pound, titled \"Ezra Pound's Patchwork\", Wilson wrote:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">Ezra Pound is really at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It is true that he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could scarcely have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.&nbsp;... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself&nbsp;...<ref name=Wilson1922>Wilson, Edmund (2007). \"Ezra Pound's Patchwork\", ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s & 30s''. Library of America, 44, 45; the essay was first published on 19 April 1922.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Wilson, the lines in Pound's poems stood isolated, with fragmentary wording contributing to poems that \"do not hang together\". Citing Pound's first seven cantos, Wilson dubbed the writing \"unsatisfactory\". He found ''The Cantos'' disjointed and its contents reflecting a too-obvious reliance on the literary works of other authors, and an awkward use of Latin and Chinese translations as a device inserted among reminiscences of Pound's own life.<ref name=Wilson1922/>\n\nThe rise of [[New Criticism]] during the 1950s, in which author is separated from text, secured Pound's poetic reputation.<ref>Beasley (2010), 651</ref> Nadel writes that the publication of T.S. Eliot's ''Literary Essays'' in 1954 \"initiated the recuperation of Ezra Pound\". Eliot's essays coincided with the work of [[Hugh Kenner]], who visited Pound extensively at St. Elizabeths.<ref name=\"Nadel12\">Nadel (1999), 12</ref> Kenner wrote that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound, adding that there is also no one to appeal more through \"sheer beauty of language\".<ref>Kenner (1983), 16</ref> Along with [[Donald Davie]], Kenner brought a new appreciation to Pound's work in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Alexander (1997), 15\u201318</ref> Donald Gallup's Pound bibliography was published in 1963 and Kenner's ''[[The Pound Era]]'' in 1971.<ref name=\"Nadel12\"/> In the 1970s a literary journal dedicated to Pound studies (''Paideuma'') was established, and Ronald Bush published the first dedicated critical study of ''The Cantos'', to be followed by a number of research editions of ''The Cantos''.<ref name=\"Nadel12\"/>\n\nFollowing Mullins' biography, described by Nadel as \"partisan\" and \"melodramatic\", was Noel Stock's factual 1970 ''Life of Ezra Pound'', although the material included was subject to Dorothy's approval. The 1980s saw three significant biographies: [[John Tytell]]'s \"neutral\" account in 1987, followed by Wilhelm's multi-volume biography. [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s sprawling narrative, a \"complete life\", built on what Stock began; unlike Stock, Carpenter had the benefit of working without intervention from Pound's relatives. In 2007 David Moody published the first of his multi-volume biography, combining narrative with literary criticism, the first work to link the two.<ref>Nadel (2010b), 162\u2013165</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s Mary de Rachewiltz released the first dual-language edition of ''The Cantos'', including \"Canto LXXII\" and \"Canto LXXIII\".<ref name=\"Nadel13\"/> These cantos had originally been published in fascist magazines, and are characterized by 21st-century literary scholars as no more than war-time propaganda.<ref>Feldman (2012), 94</ref> In 1991 a complete facsimile edition of Pound's prose and poetry was published, now considered a \"fundamental research tool\", according to Nadel.<ref name=\"Nadel13\">Nadel (1999), 13</ref> Scholarship in the 1990s turned toward in-depth investigations of his antisemitism and Rome years. Tim Redman writes about Pound's fascism and his relationship with Mussolini, and Leon Surrette about Pound's economic theories, especially during the Italian period, investigating how Pound the poet became Pound the fascist.<ref>Coats (2009), 81</ref> In 1999 Surrette wrote about the state of Pound criticism, that \"the effort to uncover coherence in a&nbsp;... crazy quilt of verse styles, critical principles, crankish economic theories and distasteful political affiliations has made it difficult to perceive the genesis and development of any of these components\". He emphasized that Pound's \"economic and political opinions have not been properly dated, nor has the suddenness of his radicalization been appreciated\".<ref>Surrette (1999) 13</ref>\n\nNadel's 2010 ''Pound in Context'' is a contextual literary approach to Pound scholarship. Pound's life, \"the social, political, historical, and literary developments of his period\", is fully investigated, which, according to Nadel is \"the grid for reading Pound's poetry\".<ref>Nadel (2010a), 1\u20136</ref> In 2012 Matthew Feldman wrote that the more than 1,500 documents in the \"Pound files\" held by the FBI have been ignored by scholars, and almost certainly contain evidence that \"Pound was politically cannier, was more bureaucratically involved with Italian Fascism, and was more involved with Mussolini's regime than has been posited\".<ref>Feldman (2012), 90\u201391</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nPound helped advance the careers of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century. In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway and [[Conrad Aiken]], he befriended and helped [[Marianne Moore]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Basil Bunting]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], [[George Oppen]] and [[Charles Olson]].<ref>Bornstein (1999), 22\u201323</ref> Hugh Witemeyer argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th-century English-language poetry because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him.<ref>Witemeyer (1999), 48</ref> In 1917, [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote in ''Poetry'': \"All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant. Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch. The point is, he will be mentioned.\"<ref>Eliot (1917), 3</ref><!-- Pound strongly influenced the two significant modernising poets in the [[Irish Language]] in the mid-twentieth century, [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in]] and [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]].<ref>O'Brien (1978), 205</ref> -->\n\n{{Quote box\n | width=250px\n | align=right\n | quoted=\n | bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n | salign=right\n | style = padding:1.75em\n | fontsize=95%\n | quote=<poem>I have tried to write Paradise<br />\nDo not move\n:::Let the wind speak.\n:::::that is paradise.\nLet the Gods forgive what I\n:::::have made\nLet those I love try to forgive\n:::::what I have made.\n</poem>\n |source= \u2014 [[The Cantos#Drafts and fragments of Cantos CX\u2013CXVII|Canto 120]]<ref>Canto 120, the final canto, first published in ''Threshold'', Belfast, and in ''The Anonym Quarterly'', New York, 1969.

University of Michigan Press, 1995, [https://archive.org/details/hallofmirrorsdra0000stoi/page/66 66]</ref>\n}}\nThe outrage after Pound's wartime collaboration with Mussolini's regime was so deep that the imagined method of his execution dominated the discussion. [[Arthur Miller]] considered him worse than Hitler: \"In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra&nbsp;... he knew all America's weaknesses and he played them as expertly as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] ever did.\" The response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists, and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re-evaluation. [[Macha Rosenthal]] wrote that it was \"as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest\" in Ezra Pound.<ref>For Arthur Miller's quote, see Torrey (1984), 200. For Rosenthal, see her ''A Primer of Ezra Pound''. Macmillan, 1960, 2</ref>\n\nPound's antisemitism has soured evaluation of his poetry. Pound scholar Wendy Stallard Flory writes that separating the poetry from the antisemitism is perceived as apologetic. She believes the positioning of Pound as \"National Monster\" and \"designated fascist intellectual\" made him a stand-in for the silent majority in Germany, occupied France and Belgium, as well as Britain and the United States, who, she argues, made the [[Holocaust]] possible by aiding or standing by.<ref>Flory (1999), 285\u2013286, 294\u2013300</ref>\n\nLater in his life, Pound analyzed what he judged to be his own failings as a writer attributable to his adherence to ideological fallacies.<ref name=\"Carpenter898ff\"/> [[Allen Ginsberg]] states that, in a private conversation in 1967, Pound told the young poet, \"my poems don't make sense.\" He went on to say that he \"was not a lunatic, but a moron\", and to characterize his writing as \"stupid and ignorant\", \"a mess\". Ginsberg reassured Pound that he \"had shown us the way\", but Pound refused to be mollified:\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">'Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions\u2014the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things,' [he] replied. Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-semitism.'<ref name=\"Carpenter898ff\">Carpenter (1988), 898\u2013899</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Kashner|first= Sam|date= 2005|title= When I Was Cool|url= |location= New York|publisher= HarperCollins Perennial|page= 86|isbn= 006000567-X|author-link= |quote= Allen explained how he tried to deal with anti-Semitic remarks.
