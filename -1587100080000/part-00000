It is in the heart of the [[Barkly Tableland]]s cattle country. In fact, the town promotes itself as \"The Heart of the Beef Country.\" \n\nThe tiny settlement is on the [[Stuart Highway]], north of the intersection of the [[Barkly Highway]] and [[Tennant Creek]]. It is 662 kilometres from [[Alice Springs]], the largest town in the [[Outback]], and 820&nbsp;km from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]].\n\nRenner Springs is usually regarded as the border between the tropical [[Top End]] and the temperate [[Red Centre]] regions. \n\n[[File:Renner Springs Windmill.jpg|thumb|Renner Springs Windmill at the Renner Springs Desert Inn]]\n\n\n\n==History==\nLike so many places along the Stuart Highway, it owes its origins to the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]]. It was named after [[Dr. Frederick Renner]], who was dispensing medical advice to the team working on the telegraph line when they passed through the springs in 1872. In 1877, Dr. Renner saw a flock of birds while working on the telegraph line and found that the birds were drawn to this particular area by the natural springs, which was later named Mud Springs. These freshwater springs, which bubble up from underground, helped the area surrounding Renner Springs achieve its importance because they provided water to the area. Lake Woods is just north of the town, near [[Elliott, Northern Territory|Elliott]] and [[Newcastle Waters, Northern Territory]].\n\n==Roadhouse==\nEstablished in the 1950s, the  Renner Springs Desert Hotel/Motel  also has gas, a bar and restaurant, game room and limited Internet access. A caravan park and shaded camp sites are also available. \n\nThe roadhouse building is an old army hut relocated after World War II from the army\u2019s staging camp 50&nbsp;km away at [[Banka Banka Station]], which dates from 1885.\n\n==Attractions==\n===Churchill's Head Rock===\nChurchill's Head Rock, considered one of Australia's most crass tourist attractions, is on the old Stuart Highway 78&nbsp;km south of Renner Springs. The rock, on the east of the old highway, looks vaguely like a profile of [[Winston Churchill]]. In order to make the image more persuasive, someone has stuck a piece of piping where the mouth should be so that the profile appears to be smoking a rather large cigar.\n\n===Attack Creek===\nAnother 11&nbsp;km south of Renner Springs is a monument marking the place where on 25 June 1860, [[John McDouall Stuart]], on his second attempt to cross Australia, was repulsed by hostile [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]. It became appropriately known as Attack Creek.\n\n===Lubra's Lookout===\nA small plateau formation along the roadside where tribal women are said to watch the approach of tribes from a considerable distance. \n\n===Easter Rodeo===\nEach Easter, Renner Springs has a local rodeo and race meeting that attracts stockmen and punters from all over the Northern Territory. Being such a small community, the annual get-together, known as the Renner Springs Races, is actually held in Tennant Creek. \n\n==Temperatures==\nRenner Springs has high summer temperatures. The summer average maximum is about 35\u00b0C. The summer low is about 24\u00b0C.\n\nRenner Springs has warm winter temperatures. The winter high temperature is about 20\u00b0C.

In fact, the town promotes itself as \"The Heart of the Beef Country.\" \n\nThe tiny settlement is on the [[Stuart Highway]], north of the intersection of the [[Barkly Highway]] and [[Tennant Creek]]. It is 662 kilometres from [[Alice Springs]], the largest town in the [[Outback]], and 820&nbsp;km from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]].\n\nRenner Springs is usually regarded as the border between the tropical [[Top End]] and the temperate [[Red Centre]] regions. \n\n[[File:Renner Springs Windmill.jpg|thumb|Renner Springs Windmill at the Renner Springs Desert Inn]]\n\n\n\n==History==\nLike so many places along the Stuart Highway, it owes its origins to the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]]. It was named after [[Dr. Frederick Renner]], who was dispensing medical advice to the team working on the telegraph line when they passed through the springs in 1872. In 1877, Dr. Renner saw a flock of birds while working on the telegraph line and found that the birds were drawn to this particular area by the natural springs, which was later named Mud Springs. These freshwater springs, which bubble up from underground, helped the area surrounding Renner Springs achieve its importance because they provided water to the area. Lake Woods is just north of the town, near [[Elliott, Northern Territory|Elliott]] and [[Newcastle Waters, Northern Territory]].\n\n==Roadhouse==\nEstablished in the 1950s, the  Renner Springs Desert Hotel/Motel  also has gas, a bar and restaurant, game room and limited Internet access. A caravan park and shaded camp sites are also available. \n\nThe roadhouse building is an old army hut relocated after World War II from the army\u2019s staging camp 50&nbsp;km away at [[Banka Banka Station]], which dates from 1885.\n\n==Attractions==\n===Churchill's Head Rock===\nChurchill's Head Rock, considered one of Australia's most crass tourist attractions, is on the old Stuart Highway 78&nbsp;km south of Renner Springs. The rock, on the east of the old highway, looks vaguely like a profile of [[Winston Churchill]]. In order to make the image more persuasive, someone has stuck a piece of piping where the mouth should be so that the profile appears to be smoking a rather large cigar.\n\n===Attack Creek===\nAnother 11&nbsp;km south of Renner Springs is a monument marking the place where on 25 June 1860, [[John McDouall Stuart]], on his second attempt to cross Australia, was repulsed by hostile [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]. It became appropriately known as Attack Creek.\n\n===Lubra's Lookout===\nA small plateau formation along the roadside where tribal women are said to watch the approach of tribes from a considerable distance. \n\n===Easter Rodeo===\nEach Easter, Renner Springs has a local rodeo and race meeting that attracts stockmen and punters from all over the Northern Territory. Being such a small community, the annual get-together, known as the Renner Springs Races, is actually held in Tennant Creek. \n\n==Temperatures==\nRenner Springs has high summer temperatures. The summer average maximum is about 35\u00b0C. The summer low is about 24\u00b0C.\n\nRenner Springs has warm winter temperatures. The winter high temperature is about 20\u00b0C. The winter low is about 5\u00b0C.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Northern-Territory/Renner-Springs/2005/02/17/1108500201661.html SMH Travel]\n*[http://www.totaltravel.com.au/travel/nt/redcentre/tennantcreek/guide/renner-springs Total Travel]\n*[http://www.australianexplorer.com/renner_springs.htm Australian Explorer]\n\n[[Category:Towns in the Northern Territory]]\n\n[[Category:Roadhouses in the Northern Territory]]\n", "name_user": "Cowdy001", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renner_Springs"}

After the heat source is shut off, the cream is skimmed and left to chill (and mildly [[fermentation (food)|ferment]]) for several hours or days. Kaymak has a high percentage of [[milk fat]], typically about 60%. It has a thick, creamy consistency (not entirely compact, because of milk protein fibers) and a rich taste.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word kaymak has [[Central Asia]]n [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] origins, possibly formed from the verb kaymak, which means melt and molding of metal in [[Turkic languages|Turkic]].<ref name=\"nisanyansozluk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=kaymak|title=kaymak|publisher=Ni\u015fanyanS\u00f6zl\u00fck|language=Turkish|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> The first written records of the word kaymak is in the well-known book of [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]], ''[[D\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk]]''. The word remains as ''kaylgmak'' in Mongolian, and with small variations in Turkic languages as ''qaymaq'' in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], ''qaymoq'' in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], \u049b\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u049b in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Shor language|Shor]], \u043a\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u043a in [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], ''kaymak'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]<ref name=\"nisanyansozluk.com\"/>, ga\u00fdmak in [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], \u10d9\u10d0\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10e6\u10d8 (''kaimaghi'') in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and \u03ba\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 (''ka\u00efm\u00e1ki'') in [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\n==Turkey==\nShops in [[Turkey]] have been devoted to kaymak production and consumption for centuries. Kaymak is mainly consumed today for breakfast along with the traditional [[Turkish breakfast]]. One type of kaymak is found in the [[Afyonkarahisar]] region where the water buffalo are fed from the residue of poppy seeds pressed for oil. Kaymak can also describe the creamy foam in the traditional \"black\" Turkish coffee. Kaymak is traditionally eaten with [[baklava]] and other [[Turkish desserts]], fruit preserve and honey or as a filling in [[pancake]]s.\n\n==Balkans==\n[[File:Cicvara (10274863185).jpg|thumb|''Palenta'', cornmeal mush with kajmak and [[\u010dvarci]]]]\n[[File:Traditional wooden bowls for making kaymak.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Traditional wooden bowls for making and storing kaymak ([[Ethnographic Museum, Belgrade]])]]\nKnown as ''kajmak'', it is almost always made at home, though there is beginning to be commercial production. Kajmak is most expensive when freshest&mdash;only a day or two old. It can keep for weeks in the fridge but becomes harder and loses quality.<ref name=NIN>{{cite news |title=Sve srpske ka\u0161ike |first=Nikola|last=Vrzi\u0107 |url=http://www.nin.co.rs/2000-12/28/15928.html |work=[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]] |date=December 28, 2000 |accessdate=13 June 2012 |language=Serbian |format=Windows-1250}}</ref> Kajmak can also be matured in dried animal skin sacks; variation is called ''skorup''. ''Kajmak'' also describes the creamy foam in the Turkish coffee.\n\nIt is usually enjoyed as an [[appetizer]] or for Saturday morning breakfast, as Saturdays are market days with the best kajmak, but also as a [[condiment]]. The simplest recipe is ''lepinja sa kajmakom'' ([[bun]] [[bread]] filled with kaymak in Serbia) consumed for breakfast or as [[fast food]]. [[Bosnians]], [[Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]], and [[North Macedonia|Macedonians]] consider it a national meal. Other traditional dishes with kajmak (sold in restaurants) include ''[[pljeskavica]] sa kajmakom'' (the [[Balkans|Balkan]] version of a hamburger patty topped with melted kajmak), as well as ''ribi\u0107 u kajmaku'' (beef shank, simmered with kajmak).\n\n==Iraq==\n[[File:Iraqi-Gaimar-Kaymak.jpg|thumbnail|150px|Iraqi Gaimar made from [[water buffalo]] milk]]\nIn [[Iraq]], it is called gaimar, geymar or qaimar and is very popular. Iraqi gaimar is usually made from the rich, fatty milk of water buffaloes, which are prevalent in the marshes of Southern Iraq.\n\nIt is available both factory-produced and from local vendors (farmers) commonly known as Arab, Arbans or [[Madan (people)|Madan]], and so is sometimes referred to as ''gaimar Arab'', ''gaimar maadan'', or farmer's ''gaimar''.\n\nIraqis like to serve Gaimar for breakfast with fresh bread, honey or jam.  However, the most popular way is to spread it on a type of Iraqi pastry bread called \"Kahi\", smother it with [[date honey]] and then wash it down with hot tea.  Gaimar on kahi with date syrup is a long-standing traditional breakfast all over Baghdad and throughout the whole of Southern Iraq.\n\n==Iran==\nIn [[Iran]], ''sarsheer'' (\u0633\u0631\u0634\u06cc\u0631) is used to describe a different method which does not involve heating the milk, thus keeping enzymes and other cultures of the milk alive. The word ''kaymak'' (''qaymaq'') is also used for the boiled method. ''Qaymaq'' is a Turkish word used to describe this product among the Azari people of Iran.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nIn [[Afghanistan]], ''Qaimak'' or qaymaq has a thinner quality and is eaten for breakfast meals usually with bread. People typically top qaimak with honey, sugar, or mix it with jam. It can be spread on pastries or even added to milk tea. Qaimak can be purchased at grocery stores in Afghanistan or made at home. It is quite a long process to make at home, involving hours of stirring the milk pot. Qaimak can be found at Afghan/Iranian grocery stores in the west, packaged qaimak is not as rich as homemade. While a lot qaimak variations are made from buffalo milk, Afghan qaimak can be made from cows' milk.\n\n==Georgia==\n[[File:Kaimaghi.jpg|thumb|A bucket containing kaimaghi in a home in Keda, Georgia.]]\nIn the [[Adjara]] region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], bordering Turkey, \u10d9\u10d0\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10e6\u10d8 or ''kaimaghi'' is made from cow milk in homes in the mountainous municipalities of [[Keda, Georgia|Keda]], [[Shuakhevi]], and [[Khulo]]. It is typically eaten with [[Georgian cheese]] and/or bread, and is only rarely served in restaurants.\n\n==Greece==\n''Kaimaki'' in [[Greece]] refers to mastic-flavored ice cream that is widely available and often served alongside traditional desserts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Malai]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928145321/http://editore.slowfood.com/editore/riviste/slowark/EN/25/papavero.html The Poppy Growers of \u0130smailk\u00f6y (2002)]\n* Davidson, Alan.

Kaymak has a high percentage of [[milk fat]], typically about 60%. It has a thick, creamy consistency (not entirely compact, because of milk protein fibers) and a rich taste.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word kaymak has [[Central Asia]]n [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] origins, possibly formed from the verb kaymak, which means melt and molding of metal in [[Turkic languages|Turkic]].<ref name=\"nisanyansozluk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=kaymak|title=kaymak|publisher=Ni\u015fanyanS\u00f6zl\u00fck|language=Turkish|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> The first written records of the word kaymak is in the well-known book of [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]], ''[[D\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk]]''. The word remains as ''kaylgmak'' in Mongolian, and with small variations in Turkic languages as ''qaymaq'' in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], ''qaymoq'' in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], \u049b\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u049b in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Shor language|Shor]], \u043a\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u043a in [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], ''kaymak'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]<ref name=\"nisanyansozluk.com\"/>, ga\u00fdmak in [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], \u10d9\u10d0\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10e6\u10d8 (''kaimaghi'') in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and \u03ba\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 (''ka\u00efm\u00e1ki'') in [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\n==Turkey==\nShops in [[Turkey]] have been devoted to kaymak production and consumption for centuries. Kaymak is mainly consumed today for breakfast along with the traditional [[Turkish breakfast]]. One type of kaymak is found in the [[Afyonkarahisar]] region where the water buffalo are fed from the residue of poppy seeds pressed for oil. Kaymak can also describe the creamy foam in the traditional \"black\" Turkish coffee. Kaymak is traditionally eaten with [[baklava]] and other [[Turkish desserts]], fruit preserve and honey or as a filling in [[pancake]]s.\n\n==Balkans==\n[[File:Cicvara (10274863185).jpg|thumb|''Palenta'', cornmeal mush with kajmak and [[\u010dvarci]]]]\n[[File:Traditional wooden bowls for making kaymak.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Traditional wooden bowls for making and storing kaymak ([[Ethnographic Museum, Belgrade]])]]\nKnown as ''kajmak'', it is almost always made at home, though there is beginning to be commercial production. Kajmak is most expensive when freshest&mdash;only a day or two old. It can keep for weeks in the fridge but becomes harder and loses quality.<ref name=NIN>{{cite news |title=Sve srpske ka\u0161ike |first=Nikola|last=Vrzi\u0107 |url=http://www.nin.co.rs/2000-12/28/15928.html |work=[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]] |date=December 28, 2000 |accessdate=13 June 2012 |language=Serbian |format=Windows-1250}}</ref> Kajmak can also be matured in dried animal skin sacks; variation is called ''skorup''. ''Kajmak'' also describes the creamy foam in the Turkish coffee.\n\nIt is usually enjoyed as an [[appetizer]] or for Saturday morning breakfast, as Saturdays are market days with the best kajmak, but also as a [[condiment]]. The simplest recipe is ''lepinja sa kajmakom'' ([[bun]] [[bread]] filled with kaymak in Serbia) consumed for breakfast or as [[fast food]]. [[Bosnians]], [[Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]], and [[North Macedonia|Macedonians]] consider it a national meal. Other traditional dishes with kajmak (sold in restaurants) include ''[[pljeskavica]] sa kajmakom'' (the [[Balkans|Balkan]] version of a hamburger patty topped with melted kajmak), as well as ''ribi\u0107 u kajmaku'' (beef shank, simmered with kajmak).\n\n==Iraq==\n[[File:Iraqi-Gaimar-Kaymak.jpg|thumbnail|150px|Iraqi Gaimar made from [[water buffalo]] milk]]\nIn [[Iraq]], it is called gaimar, geymar or qaimar and is very popular. Iraqi gaimar is usually made from the rich, fatty milk of water buffaloes which are prevalent in the marshes of Southern Iraq. \nIt is available both factory produced and from local vendors (farmers) commonly known as Arab, Arbans or [[Madan (people)|Madan]], thus the product is sometimes referred to as ''gaimar Arab'', ''gaimar maadan'', or farmer's ''gaimar''. \n\nIraqis like to serve Gaimar for breakfast with fresh bread, honey or jam.  However the most popular way is to spread it on a type of Iraqi pastry bread called \"Kahi\", smother it with [[date honey]] and then wash it down with hot tea.  Gaimar on kahi with date syrup is a long-standing traditional breakfast all over Baghdad and throughout the whole of Southern Iraq.\n\n==Iran==\nIn [[Iran]], ''sarsheer'' (\u0633\u0631\u0634\u06cc\u0631) is used to describe a different method which does not involve heating the milk, thus keeping enzymes and other cultures of the milk alive. The word ''kaymak'' (''qaymaq'') is also used for the boiled method. ''Qaymaq'' is a Turkish word used to describe this product among the Azari people of Iran.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nIn [[Afghanistan]], ''Qaimak'' or qaymaq has a thinner quality and is eaten for breakfast meals usually with bread. People typically top qaimak with honey, sugar, or mix it with jam. It can be spread on pastries or even added to milk tea. Qaimak can be purchased at grocery stores in Afghanistan or made at home. It is quite a long process to make at home, involving hours of stirring the milk pot. Qaimak can be found at Afghan/Iranian grocery stores in the west, packaged qaimak is not as rich as homemade. While a lot qaimak variations are made from buffalo milk, Afghan qaimak can be made from cows' milk.\n\n==Georgia==\n[[File:Kaimaghi.jpg|thumb|A bucket containing kaimaghi in a home in Keda, Georgia.]]\nIn the [[Adjara]] region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], bordering Turkey, \u10d9\u10d0\u10d8\u10db\u10d0\u10e6\u10d8 or ''kaimaghi'' is made from cow milk in homes in the mountainous municipalities of [[Keda, Georgia|Keda]], [[Shuakhevi]], and [[Khulo]]. It is typically eaten with [[Georgian cheese]] and/or bread, and is only rarely served in restaurants.\n\n==Greece==\n''Kaimaki'' in [[Greece]] refers to mastic-flavored ice cream that is widely available and often served alongside traditional desserts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Malai]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928145321/http://editore.slowfood.com/editore/riviste/slowark/EN/25/papavero.html The Poppy Growers of \u0130smailk\u00f6y (2002)]\n* Davidson, Alan.

[[Mexico City]] is situated north of Morelos.\n\nMorelos is the second-smallest state in the nation, just after [[Tlaxcala]]. It was part of the very large province, then State of Mexico until 1869, when [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] decreed that its territory would be separated and named in honor of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n]], who [[Siege of Cuautla|defended the city]] of [[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]] from royalist forces during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. Most of the state enjoys a warm climate year-round, which is good for the raising of [[sugar cane]] and other crops. Morelos has attracted visitors from the [[Valley of Mexico]] since [[Aztec]] times.\n\nThe state is also known for the [[Chinelos]], a type of costumed dancer that appears at festivals, especially [[Carnival]], which is celebrated in a number of communities in the state.

Morelos and his men held out for 58 days when reinforcement arrived, breaking the [[Siege of Cuautla]]. This was one of the early vital wins for the insurgent movement.

Much of this sugar made its way to European markets. As a result, the city of Cuernavaca, serving as an important trade center for exports, became a well-established outpost along the Camino Real (Royal Road) to Acapulco. But the sugar cane estates were worlds unto themselves: great luxury for the (often absentee) owners and misery, debt, and poverty for the workers.<ref>http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/morelos.html accessed Dec 29, 2018</ref>\n\nAfter winning independence, what is now the state of Morelos was the district of Cuernavaca as part of the very large State of Mexico, created in 1824. The entity would change status between state and department depending on whether liberal or conservative factions were in charge. Under the Constitution of 1857, the State of Mexico and all other states would keep their federal status permanently.<ref name=gobhistoria/>\n\n[[Cuernavaca]] gained the title of city in 1834.<ref name=enchistoria/> During the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], this city was taken by the Americans under [[George Cadwalader|General Cadwalader]].<ref name=gobhistoria/>\n\nThe next conflict was the uprising against President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] under the [[Plan of Ayutla]] in 1854. Armed rebellion broke out in Cuautla, and Santa Anna responded by burning entire villages. However, the rebellion dislodged Santa Anna, naming [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] as president.

Despite the heroic efforts on that day, the French eventually managed to gain control of the country and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor in 1864. Maximilian chose the ''Jardin Borda'' in Cuernavaca as his summer residence,<ref>Secretaria, pp. 138\u2013139.</ref> and he built''La Casa del Olindo'' in Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca supposedly for Margarita Leguizmo Sedano, his mistress known as \"La India Bonita.\"<ref name=guia45>Morelos Gu\u00eda Tur\u00edstica, p. 85</ref> The French emperor improved the roads from Mexico City to Cuernavaca; telegraph service between the two began in 1866.<ref name=enchistoria/> However, resistance to French rule was well underway. On January 1, 1867, Republican troops under the leadership of ''Francisco Leyva, Ignacio Figueroa'', and ''Ignacio Manuel Altamirano'' began an eight-day siege of Cuernavaca. France, under [[Napoleon III]], withdrew its troops soon after that, and Maximilian was defeated by Republican forces and executed.<ref>Secretaria, pp. 139\u2013140</ref>\n\nAfter the French were expelled by forces under [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], there were efforts to divide the State of Mexico. This resulted in the approval of the state of Morelos on September 21, 1868, by the federal Congress, followed by the official admittance of Morelos as the country's 27th state on April 17, 1869. The territory of the state was the Third Military District of the State of Mexico as defined by the Ju\u00e1rez government; the name \"Morelos\" and the capital \"Cuernavaca\" were selected by the state's first legislature. The first state constitution was finalized in 1870, and [[Francisco Leyva Arciniegas]] became the first Constitutional [[Governor of Morelos]].\tThere were boundary disputes between the new state with Mexico State and the Federal District, but these were resolved by the 1890s.<ref name=gobhistoria/>\n\nA telegraph line from Mexico City to Cuernavaca had been laid between 1867 and 1869; in 1870 it was extended to [[Iguala]], [[Chilpancingo]], and Tixla.

A temperate and semi-humid climate covers about 10% of the territory and is found in the north of the state around the municipalities of [[Huitzilac, Morelos|Huitzilac]], [[Tlanepantla, Morelos|Tlanepantla]], [[Totolapan]], [[Tetela del Volc\u00e1n]] and parts of Cuernavaca, Tepoztlan, Ocuituco, Tlayacapan and [[Miacatl\u00e1n]]. This area has an average temperature of between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius, with mixed forests of pine and [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]]. A semi-cold and semi-humid climate accounts for only 2% of the territory and found along the borders of the Federal District, Mexico State, and Puebla. This area has pine forests and some [[Alpine tundra|alpine meadows]]. The coldest climate is found in the upper parts of Popocatepetl that belong to the state. Average temperature here is less than 5 degrees Celsius with frequent freezes. Most of the vegetation is alpine meadow or moss.<ref name=mediofisico/>\n\nThe natural resources of the state have been taken advantage of for centuries and have suffered changes as a consequence, especially in landscapes, water sources, flora and fauna. This change accelerates as the population grows.<ref name=mediofisico/> The state has one major national park called the [[Lagunas de Zempoala National Park|Lagunas de Zempoala]]. It is one of Mexico's largest national parks, located on the southern flank of the Sierra Madre mountains. The park had five mountain-fed lakes and abundant wildlife when the park was established in 1937. This park is being stressed due to [[illegal logging]], with subsequent [[soil erosion]] and water from its last dark blue lake to drainage. Much of this drainage is to provide water to Cuernavaca, whose population uses 785 liters of water per day per person, twice that of Mexico City. The park's area has shrunk from {{convert|55000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} to 12,500.<ref name=restorepark/>\n\nMuch of the state's ecological woes stem from the housing explosion, which is mostly centered in the capital of Cuernavaca, but it is a problem in places such as Cuautla as well. Groups such as the Frente de Pueblos en Defensa de la Tierra y el Agua and Guardianes de los \u00c0rboles have criticized the government for allowing city areas to grow with insufficient planning and control. They also claim that it is hurting much of the state's ecosystem and water supply.<ref name=reprueban/>\n\nMexico is located near the North American, Pacific, Cocos, Rivera, and Caribbean Tectonic Plates, making the country highly susceptible to earthquakes.

It is followed by the urban area of Cuautla-Yautepec-Ayala with just under 20%.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nThe state has had a higher than average population increase since the mid-1990s at about 4%. In some areas, population growth has been very high at points, such as in Jiutepec (over 21%) and Emiliano Zapata (over 15%). Much of this growth has been in the main cities of Cuernavaca, Cuautla, Ayala and Yautepec. This growth has meant the loss of the state's ability to feed itself, with less than 40% of grains consumed grown inside Morelos. Population growth has also put strain on infrastructure such as water, sewer, potable water, electricity, roads and schools.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nThe Catholic religion dominates, but there are significant minorities of evangelical Protestants and those of the Jewish faith.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nThe indigenous population of the state is estimated at 8%, just under the national average of 10%.<ref name=perfilsoc/> However, only 2% of the population is counted as speaking an indigenous language compared to 7% nationally.<ref name=inegientidad/> The total counted in 2005 by INEGI was 24,757.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\nHistorically, various [[Nahua peoples]] have dominated the state. This population severely diminished during the colonial period and again during the Porfiriato (late 19th and early 20th centuries), when many indigenous peasants were sent to other parts of the country to work. Those considered to be ethnically indigenous are located in 33 municipalities with most concentrated in 15 of these. Many identify as Mixtec, [[Tlapaneco]] and Zapotec who have immigrated from Puebla, Guerrero and Oaxaca. Most of those who identify as Nahua are native to the state. Many of the immigrant indigenous are migrant workers, traveling among fields of sugar cane, corn, tomatoes and onions. Some return to their home states in the off-season and some remain permanently in Morelos.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nWhile indigenous languages have largely disappeared since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], many old customs and traditions continue to live on as part of many people's identity. Many ethnic Nahuas conserve much of their ancient knowledge, such as dances, music agricultural practices and rituals, although most are mixed with Catholic and moderns beliefs and practices. Since Mexico's census only counts the indigenous by language spoken and not by ethnicity, it is not possible to be sure of the precise number of Nahua in Morelos. Between 32 and 35 communities in the state have been identified as being \"indigenous\" based on prevailing customs and tradition. However, this does not take into account migrant workers or who have immigrated to the state from other parts of Mexico. In 2000, 30,896 people were counted as speaking an indigenous language, with the municipalities of Cuautla, Cuernavaca, Ayala, Puente de Ixtla, Temixco and Tetela del Volc\u00e0n having the highest number of speakers.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nOf the eleven municipalities which are classified as highly marginalized economically, only three have a significant indigenous population (Temoac, Miacatl\u00e1n and Tetela del Volc\u00e1n).

Two of the factors in the development of the state's economy since the 1960s are the opening of the Mexico City-[[Acapulco]] highway through the state in 1952 and the creation of the [[Civac]] (Ciudad Industrial Valle de Cuernavaca) industrial complex in 1965. This concentrated the population growth into the northern part of the state. Eleven of the state's 36 municipalities are considered to have a serious degree of marginalization: Tlalnepantla, Totolapan, Tlayacapan, Tetela del Volc\u00e1n, Ocuituco, Zaculapan, Temoac, Tepalcingo, Amacuzac, Coatl\u00e1n del R\u00edo, Miacatl\u00e1n and some parts of Puente de Ixtla.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n[[File:CucumberFieldTlaya.JPG|thumb|left|Cucumber field in Tlayacapan]]\nSince the 1980s, the agricultural sector of the economy has been steadily shrinking but it remains an important part of the state's economy, as there are still a significant number of communities that rely on it.<ref name=perfilsoc/> Just under 20% of the working population of the state is involved in farming, ranching, fish farming or forestry.<ref name=actecon/> Land available for human exploitation outside of populated areas is divided between agriculture/grazing (45%) and forestry (55%).<ref name=mediofisico/> Agricultural and forestry lands are further subdivided by climate and the type of forest (conifer vs. rainforest). Roughly 70% of the state has a subtropical climate, providing ideal conditions for agriculture, in particular sugar cane, and most farming is done in the warmer areas.<ref name=schmal/><ref name=mediofisico/> Sugar cane has been an important crop since colonial times and still is important today, although the percentage of land dedicated to it has decreased since the 1960s. Another important crop is rice.<ref name=perfilsoc/> The production of rice in the state has fallen drastically, from a height of 100,000 tons annually to only 21,000 tons due to the reduction in cultivation areas and the high costs of production.

At ''Reposado'', nouvelle Mexican offerings include ''huitlacoche'' (mushroom) fondue, salmon in ''adobo'' and game hen in peanut ''mole''. In addition to the more famous restaurants, Cuernavaca has its share of mom-and-pop eateries, which feature a good variety of enchiladas with various fillings and sauces, and local specialties like rabbit in ''ancho chile adobo'' and chicken in peach sauce. The latter is a very characteristic dish of the region since it combines chicken with fruit, of which Morelos has seemingly endless varieties. The ''taco acorazado'', consisting of two large tortillas, rice, and beef or chicken, is the most typical food of Cuernavaca. ''Tacos al Pastor'', which is marinated pork slowly cooked by a gas flame on a vertical rotisserie and served on small tortillas, is also popular in the area.<ref name=\"jimenez\" />\n\nTravelers from Mexico City to Cuernavaca often stop in ''Tres Marias,'' located in the Municipio of [[Huitzilac]].

The ''Teatro Ocampo'' in Cuernavaca is one of the few places which has live theater.\n\nStudents who wish to study acting can attend the state university [[UAEM]], the ''Centro de Bellas Artes'', or ''Escuela Laboratorio de Teatro La Rueca'' Hacienda Tetala, Cuernavaca.\n\nNumerous scenes from television and movies have been filmed in Morelos, including:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=Cuernavaca,+Morelos,+Mexico|title=Filming Location Matching \"Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico\" (Sorted by Popularity Ascending)|website=IMDb}}</ref> ''Second Chance'', 1953; ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'', 1954; ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', 1960 (Tlyacapan); ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', 1969 (Tlayacapan); ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sarah]]'', 1970 (Tlayacapan); ''[[Rio Lobo]]'', 1970 (Cuernavaca); ''[[Under the Volcano (film)]]'', 1984 (Yautepec, Cuautla, and Cuernavaca); ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'', 1994 (Cuernavaca); ''Vantage Point'', 2008 (Cuernavaca); and ''A Dying King: The Shah of Iran'' (documentary), 2017 (Cuernavaca).\n\n===Music, dance, and ''Carnaval''===\n[[File:Chinelos tepoztecas.jpg|thumb|Chinelos]]\nMost of the state's traditional music is associated with [[corridos]]. The ''corrido'' is sung and played in many parts of Mexico. Those performed in Morelos belong to the \"sure\u00f1o\" (southern) type, which can be complicated but, unlike the northern version, is not meant for dancing. The lyrics of this type of corrido generally have eight syllables per line forming stanzas of five verses each. This type of corrido dates back before the Mexican Revolution, but the tradition has waned. One band noted for saving traditional melodies and songs is the ''Banda Tlayacapan'', based in [[Tlayacapan]] in the north of the state. This band was formed in 1870 and is the state's oldest band organization. In popular music, the best-known composer from the state is [[Arturo M\u00e1rquez]], who was born in [[Samosa, Sonora]], but has lived in Cuernavaca for a long time. He is known for his [[danz\u00f3n|danzones]].<ref name=rincones1920>Gonzalez, pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\nOne tradition that is identified with the state of Morelos is the Dance of the [[Chinelos]]. The dance is popular on many occasions but especially during [[Carnival|Carnaval]] (English: Carnival).<ref name=brinco>{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-brinco-del-chinelo-morelos.html |title= El brinco del chinelo (Morelos) |date=February 2000 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Chinelo Dance (Morelos) |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref> The origin of the dance or tradition is not known. One story dates the origin to 1870 when a group of youths decided to dress in old clothes, covering their faces in cloth to shout and jump around in the streets. Other stories place the origin in the colonial past, either as a syncretism between Spanish and indigenous dances, or as a protest or mockery of the indigenous' Spanish overlords. However, it has clearly been identified as originating in Tlayacapan and later spreading to various parts of Morelos, Puebla, and Mexico City.<ref name=pormorelos/><ref name=brinco/>\n\nToday, the Chinelo is a symbol of the identity of the state. Although Chinelos are most frequently found in Tepoztl\u00e1n, Chinelos groups exist in many communities such as Yautepec, Oacalco, Cualtlixco, Atlahuahuac\u00e0n, Oaxtepec, Jojutla and Totolapan. They can also be found in certain parts of Puebla. The Chinelos dance in groups near each other. Each dancer has his or her own style that has been developed since childhood.<ref name=pormorelos/><ref name=brinco/>\n\nAlthough not as well known as the ''Carnaval'' of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], a number of communities in the state hold Carnival celebrations in the days leading up to [[Ash Wednesday]]. These include Jiutepec, Tlaltizap\u00e1n, Emiliano Zapata, Tepoztl\u00e1n, Tlayacapan, Yautepec, and Xochitepec. What distinguishes carnivals in Morelos from others in Mexico is the participation of the Chinelos and bands with wind instruments.<ref name=carnavales>{{cite web |url= http://www.morelosturistico.com/espanol/pagina/z_362_Calendario_de_Carnavales_en_Morelos.php |title= Calendario de Carnavales en Morelos. |publisher=Secretary of Tourism of Morelos |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Calendar of Carnivals in Morelos |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref> In Tepotzlan on the Sunday before Ash Wednesday, the traditional [[tianguis]] market is cleared away from the main square and hundreds of multicolored stands move onto the streets in order to make way for Carnival. The street stands mostly specialize in items needed to enjoy the event. Chinelo dancers dominate the event, many in costumes which have been very expensive to assemble. Other events during Carnival there are processions, including the principal one in which there are representatives of all the communities of the municipality. The events last from Sunday to midnight Tuesday, signaling the beginning of Ash Wednesday and [[Lent]]. Each day, the Chinelos dance more energetically than the last.<ref name=brinco/>\n\n===Art and literature===\n[[File:RobertBradyMusCasaTorre.JPG|thumb|left|Exterior of the Robert Brady Museum in Cuernavaca, known for its collection of [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|handcrafts and folk art]].]]\nMost of the state's art scene dates from the 20th century. After the [[Mexican Revolution]], and partly because of state's role in it, a number of muralists came to the state and painted works with social themes in places such as the [[Palacio de Cort\u00e9s]] and the [[Museo de la Tallera Siqueiros]]. Cuernavaca has several art museums:\n* [[The Robert Brady Museum]] of folk art, which is located in the ''Centro Historico'' (Historical Center) of the city, around the corner from the cathedral.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://universaldomainexchange.com/vivacue2/robert-brady-museum/|title=Robert Brady Museum \u2013 Viva Cuernavaca}}</ref> Brady was an heir of the Mayflower moving company in the U.S. and an art collector. \n* The ''Museo Morelense de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo [[Juan Soriano (artist)|Juan Soriano]]'' (MMAC) is a project by JSa Arquitectura led by the architect Javier S\u00e1nchez Corral. Its location links Amatitl\u00e1n, an emblematic town of Cuernavaca whose origins date back 1500 years, to the Historic Center of Cuernavaca, enriching the urban experience. It is the largest exhibition space in the state of Morelos, distributed in two galleries for temporary exhibitions: Central Gallery and Cube, in addition to an Open Forum, a multidisciplinary space. The museum includes a library, a sculptural garden, and workshops for public programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mmacjuansoriano.org/en/museo/|title=MMAC \u2014 Museum}}</ref>\n\nPublic art includes the mural on the library of ''Parque Alameda Solidaridad Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta'', in Cuernavaca. The mural depicts the history of the state. In addition, there is a large fountain that resembles a pre-Hispanic ball field. Also, at the entrance to the ''Fraccionamiento Lomas de Cuernavaca'' in the municipality of Temixco, just outside Cuernavaca, is the ''Glorieta de La Luna'' with Venetian mosaic by Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Narezo. Along the main street, ''Paseo de la Reforma'', there are numerous shapes covered with ceramic tiles in the Gaud\u00ed style, with diverse representations, including the stars, dragons, and signs of the Zodiac. These are popularly called ''Las Bolas'', (the balls), and are a favorite play area for children.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://asoclcuernavaca.com/hisotria/lomas-cuernavaca.html|title=Super Fraccionamiento Lomas de Cuernavaca|website=asoclcuernavaca.com}}</ref> In the 1960s, Rosell built the ''Fuente de las mariposas'', (Butterfly Fountain) at the entrance to Tequesquitengo.\n\nBecause of the state's mild climate and Cuernavaca's cultural tradition, many Mexican and foreign artists and writers have made the state home. [[Joy Laville]] is from Wight, England and resides in Cuernavaca. She is known for her landscapes which often include nude humans. Some of her works are ''Mujer viendo una casa'', ''Mujer en perfil'' and ''Mujer con flores''. Jorge C\u00e1zares Campos is a native of the state who is a self-taught painter, mostly of Mexican landscapes. Rafael Cauduro was born in Mexico City and his artwork has brought him fame not only in Morelos but internationally as well. Magali Lara is also originally from Mexico City and has had shows in various countries. Morelos native Carlos Campos Campus is known for his sculpture with pre-Hispanic influence. John Spencer was an American artist and writer whose legacy includes the ''Casona Spencer'' across from the cathedral and the murals of the ''Church of the Three Kings'' in the Santa Maria neighborhood in the north part of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://casonaspencer.org/john-spencer/|title=John Spencer \u2013 La Casona Spencer}}</ref>\n\nAs for the literary heritage of Morelos, the most important writer was [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], author of ''[[El Zarco]]'', the story of the leader of a group of bandits based in Yautepec during the [[Reform War]], 1857\u20131860. Another well-known writer is [[Malcolm Lowry]], an Englishman who wrote ''Bajo del Volc\u00e1n'' in the first half of the 20th century. It is set in Cuernavaca and made the city internationally famous. Elena Garro is an important Mexican writer originally from Puebla, but who lived most of her life in Cuernavaca. She is known for works such as ''Los Recuerdos del Porvenir'', ''El \u00c1rbol'' and ''Andarse por las ramas''. Another Mexican transplant to Cuernavaca is Franciso Hinojosa, one of the best-known authors of children's literature in the country.<ref name=rincones1417>Gonzalez, pp. 14\u201317</ref>\n\nPoets Ra\u00fal Isidro Burgos (b. in Cuernavaca 1890, d. in Mexico City 1971), Ra\u00fal Isidro Burgos (b. in Jojutla 1975), Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz Palos (b. in Cuernavaca 1972), and Luis Ruiz de Velasco (b. in Jojutla 1909, d. in Mexico City 2003).\n\nOther writers are Agust\u00edn Arag\u00f3n y Le\u00f3n (b. in Jonacatepec 1870, d. in Mexico City 1954), Erwin M\u00f6ller (b. in Cuernavaca 1954), and Gerardo Horacio Porcayo (b. in Cuernavaca 1964),\n\n===Architecture===\n\n====Pre-Hispanic====\n\nThe most important pre-Hispanic ruins are found at the [[Xochicalco]]. This is a fortified city that was built on top of a large hill, including a Temple of [[Quetzalcoatl]] as its center. There is an observatory, three ball courts, and a ''tezmacal'' (steam bath) as well as a large museum. Xochicalco displays significant influence from [[Teotihuacan]], the [[Maya civilization]], and [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]].\n\n[[Teopanzolco]] is located in Cuernavaca. The twin temple and several smaller structures were built by ''Tlahuicas''. Recent excavations suggest it dates from 1200 CE and it may have served as a model for the ''Templo Mayor'' in Mexico City.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/quake-damage-reveals-older-structure-inside-mexico-pyramid|title=Earthquake rips open 13th century Mexican pyramid to reveal even older temple inside|newspaper=National Post|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44806790|title=Mexico earthquake leads to discovery of ancient temple|date=July 12, 2018|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther important archaeological sites in Morelos are: ''Olintepec'', [[Ciudad Ayala|Ayala]]. 14 structures that date from 1500\u20131200 BCE; ''Las Pilas'', [[Jonacatepec]]. 4 pyramids and 2 plazas from 700\u2013500 BCE located inside a water park; [[Tepozteco]], Tepoztlan.

In the first half of the 16th century, a series of fortress-like church and monastery complexes were built around the slopes of the [[Popocatepetl]] volcano from Cuernavaca to [[Tetela del Volc\u00e1n]], and on into Puebla state, all related to early evangelization efforts.

The government's role in education expanded after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In Morelos, the government founded \"Casas del Pueblo\" (People's Houses) staffed with a teacher for the community to become a central figure. In 1936, the ''Escuela Regional Campesina'' (Farm Workers' Regional School) was established in Yautepec and a short time after that President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] founded the ''Escuela Normal Feminina de Palmira'' (Palmira Teachers College for Women) and the ''Instituto Federal de Capacitacion del Magisterio'' for those to earn or complete their teaching credentials.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nUntil 1991, education was rigidly centralized and bureaucratic, causing difficulties in providing adequate education to many areas.

[[Mexico City]] is situated north of Morelos.\n\nMorelos is the second-smallest state in the nation, just after [[Tlaxcala]]. It was part of the very large province, then State of Mexico until 1869, when [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] decreed that its territory would be separated and named in honor of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n]], who [[Siege of Cuautla|defended the city]] of [[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]] from royalist forces during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. Most of the state enjoys a warm climate year-round, which is good for the raising of [[sugar cane]] and other crops. Morelos has attracted visitors from the [[Valley of Mexico]] since [[Aztec]] times.\n\nThe state is also known for the [[Chinelos]], a type of costumed dancer that appears at festivals, especially [[Carnival]], which is celebrated in a number of communities in the state. It is also home to the [[Monasteries on the slopes of Popocat\u00e9petl]], a designated [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Hispanic period===\n{{anchor|History}}\n[[File:Xochicalcotempleofinscriptions.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Temple of the Feathered Serpent, Xochicalco]]\nHistorian Ward Barrett considers that the \"region now known as Morelos has a physical unity sufficient to define and set it in strong contrast to other regions of Mexico.\"<ref>Ward Barrett, \"Morelos and Its Sugar Industry in the Late Eighteenth Century,\" in Ida Altman and James Lockhart, ''The Provinces of Early Mexico: Variants of Spanish American Regional Evolution''.

Cortes continued his march on Xiutepec ([[Jiutepec]]) and on April 13 faced the city of Cuauhnahuac ([[Cuernavaca]]). The bridges across the Ravine of Annanalco had been destroyed, but both Cortes and [[Bernal Diaz del Castillo]] relate how they were able to cross the ravine upriver via a fallen tree. The ''cacique'' of Cuauhnahuac surrendered quickly, and Cortes burned and sacked the city, and the women were raped.

Morelos and his men held out for 58 days when reinforcement arrived, breaking the [[Siege of Cuautla]]. This was one of the early vital wins for the insurgent movement. Morelos would eventually be captured by royalists and executed in 1815, but the memory of this battle would lead to the future state being named after him.<ref name=enchistoria/><ref name=schmal/>\n\nIn the post-war period, the sugar industry of Morelos made this region one of the richest parts of the Mexican Republic. Much of this sugar made its way to European markets. As a result, the city of Cuernavaca, serving as an important trade center for exports, became a well-established outpost along the Camino Real (Royal Road) to Acapulco. But the sugar cane estates were worlds unto themselves: great luxury for the (often absentee) owners and misery, debt, and poverty for the workers.<ref>http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/morelos.html accessed Dec 29, 2018</ref>\n\nAfter winning independence, what is now the state of Morelos was the district of Cuernavaca as part of the very large State of Mexico, created in 1824. The entity would change status between state and department depending on whether liberal or conservative factions were in charge. Under the Constitution of 1857, the State of Mexico and all other states would keep their federal status permanently.<ref name=gobhistoria/>\n\n[[Cuernavaca]] gained the title of city in 1834.<ref name=enchistoria/> During the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], this city was taken by the Americans under [[George Cadwalader|General Cadwalader]].<ref name=gobhistoria/>\n\nThe next conflict was the uprising against President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] under the [[Plan of Ayutla]] in 1854. Armed rebellion broke out in Cuautla, and Santa Anna responded by burning entire villages. However, the rebellion dislodged Santa Anna, naming [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] as president. Alvarez moved the Mexican capital to Cuernavaca.

Despite the heroic efforts on that day, the French eventually managed to gain control of the country and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor in 1864. Maximilian chose the ''Jardin Borda'' in Cuernavaca as his summer residence,<ref>Secretaria, pp. 138\u2013139.</ref> and he built''La Casa del Olindo'' in Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca supposedly for Margarita Leguizmo Sedano, his mistress known as \"La India Bonita.\"<ref name=guia45>Morelos Gu\u00eda Tur\u00edstica, p. 85</ref> The French emperor improved the roads from Mexico City to Cuernavaca; telegraph service between the two began in 1866.<ref name=enchistoria/> However, resistance to French rule was well underway. On January 1, 1867, Republican troops under the leadership of ''Francisco Leyva, Ignacio Figueroa'', and ''Ignacio Manuel Altamirano'' began an eight-day siege of Cuernavaca. France, under [[Napoleon III]], withdrew its troops soon after that, and Maximilian was defeated by Republican forces and executed.<ref>Secretaria, pp. 139\u2013140</ref>\n\nAfter the French were expelled by forces under [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], there were efforts to divide the State of Mexico. This resulted in the approval of the state of Morelos on September 21, 1868, by the federal Congress, followed by the official admittance of Morelos as the country's 27th state on April 17, 1869. The territory of the state was the Third Military District of the State of Mexico as defined by the Ju\u00e1rez government; the name \"Morelos\" and the capital \"Cuernavaca\" were selected by the state's first legislature. The first state constitution was finalized in 1870, and [[Francisco Leyva Arciniegas]] became the first Constitutional [[Governor of Morelos]].\tThere were boundary disputes between the new state with Mexico State and the Federal District, but these were resolved by the 1890s.<ref name=gobhistoria/>\n\nA telegraph line from Mexico City to Cuernavaca had been laid between 1867 and 1869; in 1870 it was extended to [[Iguala]], [[Chilpancingo]], and Tixla.

A temperate and semi-humid climate covers about 10% of the territory and is found in the north of the state around the municipalities of [[Huitzilac, Morelos|Huitzilac]], [[Tlanepantla, Morelos|Tlanepantla]], [[Totolapan]], [[Tetela del Volc\u00e1n]] and parts of Cuernavaca, Tepoztlan, Ocuituco, Tlayacapan and [[Miacatl\u00e1n]]. This area has an average temperature of between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius, with mixed forests of pine and [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]]. A semi-cold and semi-humid climate accounts for only 2% of the territory and found along the borders of the Federal District, Mexico State, and Puebla. This area has pine forests and some [[Alpine tundra|alpine meadows]]. The coldest climate is found in the upper parts of Popocatepetl that belong to the state. Average temperature here is less than 5 degrees Celsius with frequent freezes. Most of the vegetation is alpine meadow or moss.<ref name=mediofisico/>\n\nThe natural resources of the state have been taken advantage of for centuries and have suffered changes as a consequence, especially in landscapes, water sources, flora and fauna. This change accelerates as the population grows.<ref name=mediofisico/> The state has one major national park called the [[Lagunas de Zempoala National Park|Lagunas de Zempoala]]. It is one of Mexico's largest national parks, located on the southern flank of the Sierra Madre mountains. The park had five mountain-fed lakes and abundant wildlife when the park was established in 1937. This park is being stressed due to [[illegal logging]], with subsequent [[soil erosion]] and water from its last dark blue lake to drainage. Much of this drainage is to provide water to Cuernavaca, whose population uses 785 liters of water per day per person, twice that of Mexico City. The park's area has shrunk from {{convert|55000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} to 12,500.<ref name=restorepark/>\n\nMuch of the state's ecological woes stem from the housing explosion, which is mostly centered in the capital of Cuernavaca, but it is a problem in places such as Cuautla as well. Groups such as the Frente de Pueblos en Defensa de la Tierra y el Agua and Guardianes de los \u00c0rboles have criticized the government for allowing city areas to grow with insufficient planning and control. They also claim that it is hurting much of the state's ecosystem and water supply.<ref name=reprueban/>\n\nMexico is located near the North American, Pacific, Cocos, Rivera, and Caribbean Tectonic Plates, making the country highly susceptible to earthquakes.

It is followed by the urban area of Cuautla-Yautepec-Ayala with just under 20%.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nThe state has had a higher than average population increase since the mid-1990s at about 4%. In some areas, population growth has been very high at points, such as in Jiutepec (over 21%) and Emiliano Zapata (over 15%). Much of this growth has been in the main cities of Cuernavaca, Cuautla, Ayala and Yautepec. This growth has meant the loss of the state's ability to feed itself, with less than 40% of grains consumed grown inside Morelos. Population growth has also put strain on infrastructure such as water, sewer, potable water, electricity, roads and schools.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nThe Catholic religion dominates, but there are significant minorities of evangelical Protestants and those of the Jewish faith.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nThe indigenous population of the state is estimated at 8%, just under the national average of 10%.<ref name=perfilsoc/> However, only 2% of the population is counted as speaking an indigenous language compared to 7% nationally.<ref name=inegientidad/> The total counted in 2005 by INEGI was 24,757.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\nHistorically, various [[Nahua peoples]] have dominated the state. This population severely diminished during the colonial period and again during the Porfiriato (late 19th and early 20th centuries), when many indigenous peasants were sent to other parts of the country to work. Those considered to be ethnically indigenous are located in 33 municipalities with most concentrated in 15 of these. Many identify as Mixtec, [[Tlapaneco]] and Zapotec who have immigrated from Puebla, Guerrero and Oaxaca. Most of those who identify as Nahua are native to the state. Many of the immigrant indigenous are migrant workers, traveling among fields of sugar cane, corn, tomatoes and onions. Some return to their home states in the off-season and some remain permanently in Morelos.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nWhile indigenous languages have almost completely disappeared since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], many old customs and traditions continue to live on as part of many people's identity. Many ethnic Nahuas conserve much of their ancient knowledge, such as dances, music agricultural practices and rituals, although most are mixed with Catholic and moderns beliefs and practices. Since Mexico's census only counts the indigenous by language spoken and not by ethnicity, it is not possible to be sure of the precise number of Nahua in Morelos. Between 32 and 35 communities in the state have been identified as being \"indigenous\" based on prevailing customs and tradition. However, this does not take into account migrant workers or who have immigrated to the state from other parts of Mexico. In 2000, 30,896 people were counted as speaking an indigenous language, with the municipalities of Cuautla, Cuernavaca, Ayala, Puente de Ixtla, Temixco and Tetela del Volc\u00e0n having the highest number of speakers.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nOf the eleven municipalities which are classified as highly marginalized economically, only three have a significant indigenous population (Temoac, Miacatl\u00e1n and Tetela del Volc\u00e1n).

Two of the factors in the development of the state's economy since the 1960s are the opening of the Mexico City-[[Acapulco]] highway through the state in 1952 and the creation of the [[Civac]] (Ciudad Industrial Valle de Cuernavaca) industrial complex in 1965. This concentrated the population growth into the northern part of the state. Eleven of the state's 36 municipalities are considered to have a serious degree of marginalization: Tlalnepantla, Totolapan, Tlayacapan, Tetela del Volc\u00e1n, Ocuituco, Zaculapan, Temoac, Tepalcingo, Amacuzac, Coatl\u00e1n del R\u00edo, Miacatl\u00e1n and some parts of Puente de Ixtla.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n[[File:CucumberFieldTlaya.JPG|thumb|left|Cucumber field in Tlayacapan]]\nSince the 1980s, the agricultural sector of the economy has been steadily shrinking but it remains an important part of the state's economy, as there are still a significant number of communities that rely on it.<ref name=perfilsoc/> Just under 20% of the working population of the state is involved in farming, ranching, fish farming or forestry.<ref name=actecon/> Land available for human exploitation outside of populated areas is divided between agriculture/grazing (45%) and forestry (55%).<ref name=mediofisico/> Agricultural and forestry lands are further subdivided by climate and the type of forest (conifer vs. rainforest). Roughly 70% of the state has a subtropical climate, providing ideal conditions for agriculture, in particular sugar cane, and most farming is done in the warmer areas.<ref name=schmal/><ref name=mediofisico/> Sugar cane has been an important crop since colonial times and still is important today, although the percentage of land dedicated to it has decreased since the 1960s. Another important crop is rice.<ref name=perfilsoc/> The production of rice in the state has fallen drastically, from a height of 100,000 tons annually to only 21,000 tons due to the reduction in cultivation areas and the high costs of production.

At ''Reposado'', nouvelle Mexican offerings include ''huitlacoche'' (mushroom) fondue, salmon in ''adobo'' and game hen in peanut ''mole''. In addition to the more famous restaurants, Cuernavaca has its share of mom-and-pop eateries, which feature a good variety of enchiladas with various fillings and sauces, and local specialties like rabbit in ''ancho chile adobo'' and chicken in peach sauce. The latter is a very characteristic dish of the region since it combines chicken with fruit, of which Morelos has seemingly endless varieties. The ''taco acorazado'', consisting of two large tortillas, rice, and beef or chicken, is the most typical food of Cuernavaca. ''Tacos al Pastor'', which is marinated pork slowly cooked by a gas flame on a vertical rotisserie and served on small tortillas, is also popular in the area.<ref name=\"jimenez\" />\n\nTravelers from Mexico City to Cuernavaca often stop in ''Tres Marias,'' located in the Municipio of [[Huitzilac]].

The ''Teatro Ocampo'' in Cuernavaca is one of the few places which has live theater.\n\nStudents who wish to study acting can attend the state university [[UAEM]], the ''Centro de Bellas Artes'', or ''Escuela Laboratorio de Teatro La Rueca'' Hacienda Tetala, Cuernavaca.\n\nNumerous scenes from television and movies have been filmed in Morelos, including:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=Cuernavaca,+Morelos,+Mexico|title=Filming Location Matching \"Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico\" (Sorted by Popularity Ascending)|website=IMDb}}</ref> ''Second Chance'', 1953; ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'', 1954; ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', 1960 (Tlyacapan); ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', 1969 (Tlayacapan); ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sarah]]'', 1970 (Tlayacapan); ''[[Rio Lobo]]'', 1970 (Cuernavaca); ''[[Under the Volcano (film)]]'', 1984 (Yautepec, Cuautla, and Cuernavaca); ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'', 1994 (Cuernavaca); ''Vantage Point'', 2008 (Cuernavaca); and ''A Dying King: The Shah of Iran'' (documentary), 2017 (Cuernavaca).\n\n===Music, dance, and ''Carnaval''===\n[[File:Chinelos tepoztecas.jpg|thumb|Chinelos]]\nMost of the state's traditional music is associated with [[corridos]]. The ''corrido'' is sung and played in many parts of Mexico. Those performed in Morelos belong to the \"sure\u00f1o\" (southern) type, which can be complicated but, unlike the northern version, is not meant for dancing. The lyrics of this type of corrido generally have eight syllables per line forming stanzas of five verses each. This type of corrido dates back before the Mexican Revolution, but the tradition has waned. One band noted for saving traditional melodies and songs is the ''Banda Tlayacapan'', based in [[Tlayacapan]] in the north of the state. This band was formed in 1870 and is the state's oldest band organization. In popular music, the best-known composer from the state is [[Arturo M\u00e1rquez]], who was born in [[Samosa, Sonora]], but has lived in Cuernavaca for a long time. He is known for his [[danz\u00f3n|danzones]].<ref name=rincones1920>Gonzalez, pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\nOne tradition that is identified with the state of Morelos is the Dance of the [[Chinelos]]. The dance is popular on many occasions but especially during [[Carnival|Carnaval]] (English: Carnival).<ref name=brinco>{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-brinco-del-chinelo-morelos.html |title= El brinco del chinelo (Morelos) |date=February 2000 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Chinelo Dance (Morelos) |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref> The origin of the dance or tradition is not known. One story dates the origin to 1870 when a group of youths decided to dress in old clothes, covering their faces in cloth to shout and jump around in the streets. Other stories place the origin in the colonial past, either as a syncretism between Spanish and indigenous dances, or as a protest or mockery of the indigenous' Spanish overlords. However, it has clearly been identified as originating in Tlayacapan and later spreading to various parts of Morelos, Puebla, and Mexico City.<ref name=pormorelos/><ref name=brinco/>\n\nToday, the Chinelo is a symbol of the identity of the state. Although Chinelos are most frequently found in Tepoztl\u00e1n, Chinelos groups exist in many communities such as Yautepec, Oacalco, Cualtlixco, Atlahuahuac\u00e0n, Oaxtepec, Jojutla and Totolapan. They can also be found in certain parts of Puebla. The Chinelos dance in groups near each other. Each dancer has his or her own style that has been developed since childhood.<ref name=pormorelos/><ref name=brinco/>\n\nAlthough not as well known as the ''Carnaval'' of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], a number of communities in the state hold Carnival celebrations in the days leading up to [[Ash Wednesday]]. These include Jiutepec, Tlaltizap\u00e1n, Emiliano Zapata, Tepoztl\u00e1n, Tlayacapan, Yautepec, and Xochitepec. What distinguishes carnivals in Morelos from others in Mexico is the participation of the Chinelos and bands with wind instruments.<ref name=carnavales>{{cite web |url= http://www.morelosturistico.com/espanol/pagina/z_362_Calendario_de_Carnavales_en_Morelos.php |title= Calendario de Carnavales en Morelos. |publisher=Secretary of Tourism of Morelos |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Calendar of Carnivals in Morelos |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref> In Tepotzlan on the Sunday before Ash Wednesday, the traditional [[tianguis]] market is cleared away from the main square and hundreds of multicolored stands move onto the streets in order to make way for Carnival. The street stands mostly specialize in items needed to enjoy the event. Chinelo dancers dominate the event, many in costumes which have been very expensive to assemble. Other events during Carnival there are processions, including the principal one in which there are representatives of all the communities of the municipality. The events last from Sunday to midnight Tuesday, signaling the beginning of Ash Wednesday and [[Lent]]. Each day, the Chinelos dance more energetically than the last.<ref name=brinco/>\n\n===Art and literature===\n[[File:RobertBradyMusCasaTorre.JPG|thumb|left|Exterior of the Robert Brady Museum in Cuernavaca, known for its collection of [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|handcrafts and folk art]].]]\nMost of the state's art scene dates from the 20th century. After the [[Mexican Revolution]], and partly because of state's role in it, a number of muralists came to the state and painted works with social themes in places such as the [[Palacio de Cort\u00e9s]] and the [[Museo de la Tallera Siqueiros]]. Cuernavaca has several art museums:\n* [[The Robert Brady Museum]] of folk art, which is located in the ''Centro Historico'' (Historical Center) of the city, around the corner from the cathedral.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://universaldomainexchange.com/vivacue2/robert-brady-museum/|title=Robert Brady Museum \u2013 Viva Cuernavaca}}</ref> Brady was an heir of the Mayflower moving company in the U.S. and an art collector. \n* The ''Museo Morelense de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo [[Juan Soriano (artist)|Juan Soriano]]'' (MMAC) is a project by JSa Arquitectura led by the architect Javier S\u00e1nchez Corral. Its location links Amatitl\u00e1n, an emblematic town of Cuernavaca whose origins date back 1500 years, to the Historic Center of Cuernavaca, enriching the urban experience. It is the largest exhibition space in the state of Morelos, distributed in two galleries for temporary exhibitions: Central Gallery and Cube, in addition to an Open Forum, a multidisciplinary space. The museum includes a library, a sculptural garden, and workshops for public programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mmacjuansoriano.org/en/museo/|title=MMAC \u2014 Museum}}</ref>\n\nPublic art includes the mural on the library of ''Parque Alameda Solidaridad Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta'', in Cuernavaca. The mural depicts the history of the state. In addition, there is a large fountain that resembles a pre-Hispanic ball field. Also, at the entrance to the ''Fraccionamiento Lomas de Cuernavaca'' in the municipality of Temixco, just outside Cuernavaca, is the ''Glorieta de La Luna'' with Venetian mosaic by Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Narezo. Along the main street, ''Paseo de la Reforma'', there are numerous shapes covered with ceramic tiles in the Gaud\u00ed style, with diverse representations, including the stars, dragons, and signs of the Zodiac. These are popularly called ''Las Bolas'', (the balls), and are a favorite play area for children.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://asoclcuernavaca.com/hisotria/lomas-cuernavaca.html|title=Super Fraccionamiento Lomas de Cuernavaca|website=asoclcuernavaca.com}}</ref> In the 1960s, Rosell built the ''Fuente de las mariposas'', (Butterfly Fountain) at the entrance to Tequesquitengo.\n\nBecause of the state's mild climate and Cuernavaca's cultural tradition, many Mexican and foreign artists and writers have made the state home. [[Joy Laville]] is from Wight, England and resides in Cuernavaca. She is known for her landscapes which often include nude humans. Some of her works are ''Mujer viendo una casa'', ''Mujer en perfil'' and ''Mujer con flores''. Jorge C\u00e1zares Campos is a native of the state who is a self-taught painter, mostly of Mexican landscapes. Rafael Cauduro was born in Mexico City and his artwork has brought him fame not only in Morelos but internationally as well. Magali Lara is also originally from Mexico City and has had shows in various countries. Morelos native Carlos Campos Campus is known for his sculpture with pre-Hispanic influence. John Spencer was an American artist and writer whose legacy includes the ''Casona Spencer'' across from the cathedral and the murals of the ''Church of the Three Kings'' in the Santa Maria neighborhood in the north part of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://casonaspencer.org/john-spencer/|title=John Spencer \u2013 La Casona Spencer}}</ref>\n\nAs for the literary heritage of Morelos, the most important writer was [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], author of ''[[El Zarco]]'', the story of the leader of a group of bandits based in Yautepec during the [[Reform War]], 1857\u20131860. Another well-known writer is [[Malcolm Lowry]], an Englishman who wrote ''Bajo del Volc\u00e1n'' in the first half of the 20th century. It is set in Cuernavaca and made the city internationally famous. Elena Garro is an important Mexican writer originally from Puebla, but who lived most of her life in Cuernavaca. She is known for works such as ''Los Recuerdos del Porvenir'', ''El \u00c1rbol'' and ''Andarse por las ramas''. Another Mexican transplant to Cuernavaca is Franciso Hinojosa, one of the best-known authors of children's literature in the country.<ref name=rincones1417>Gonzalez, pp. 14\u201317</ref>\n\nPoets Ra\u00fal Isidro Burgos (b. in Cuernavaca 1890, d. in Mexico City 1971), Ra\u00fal Isidro Burgos (b. in Jojutla 1975), Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz Palos (b. in Cuernavaca 1972), and Luis Ruiz de Velasco (b. in Jojutla 1909, d. in Mexico City 2003).\n\nOther writers are Agust\u00edn Arag\u00f3n y Le\u00f3n (b. in Jonacatepec 1870, d. in Mexico City 1954), Erwin M\u00f6ller (b. in Cuernavaca 1954), and Gerardo Horacio Porcayo (b. in Cuernavaca 1964),\n\n===Architecture===\n\n====Pre-Hispanic====\n\nThe most important pre-Hispanic ruins are found at the [[Xochicalco]]. This is a fortified city that was built on top of a large hill, including a Temple of [[Quetzalcoatl]] as its center. There is an observatory, three ball courts, and a ''tezmacal'' (steam bath) as well as a large museum. Xochicalco displays significant influence from [[Teotihuacan]], the [[Maya civilization]], and [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]].\n\n[[Teopanzolco]] is located in Cuernavaca. The twin temple and several smaller structures were built by ''Tlahuicas''. Recent excavations suggest it dates from 1200 CE and it may have served as a model for the ''Templo Mayor'' in Mexico City.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/quake-damage-reveals-older-structure-inside-mexico-pyramid|title=Earthquake rips open 13th century Mexican pyramid to reveal even older temple inside|newspaper=National Post|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44806790|title=Mexico earthquake leads to discovery of ancient temple|date=July 12, 2018|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther important archaeological sites in Morelos are: ''Olintepec'', [[Ciudad Ayala|Ayala]]. 14 structures that date from 1500\u20131200 BCE; ''Las Pilas'', [[Jonacatepec]]. 4 pyramids and 2 plazas from 700\u2013500 BCE located inside a water park; [[Tepozteco]], Tepoztlan.

In the first half of the 16th century, a series of fortress-like church and monastery complexes were built around the slopes of the [[Popocatepetl]] volcano from Cuernavaca to [[Tetela del Volc\u00e1n]], and on into Puebla state, all related to early evangelization efforts.

The government's role in education expanded after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In Morelos, the government founded \"Casas del Pueblo\" (People's Houses) staffed with a teacher for the community to become a central figure. In 1936, the ''Escuela Regional Campesina'' (Farm Workers' Regional School) was established in Yautepec and a short time after that President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] founded the ''Escuela Normal Feminina de Palmira'' (Palmira Teachers College for Women) and the ''Instituto Federal de Capacitacion del Magisterio'' for those to earn or complete their teaching credentials.<ref name=perfilsoc/>\n\nUntil 1991, education was rigidly centralized and bureaucratic, causing difficulties in providing adequate education to many areas.
