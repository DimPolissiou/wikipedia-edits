Her family returned to live in [[Nigeria]] when she was two. A\u1e63a grew up in [[Lagos]] city, in the south-western part of Nigeria, and 18 years later, returned to Paris, where her life as an artist took off.<ref name=Sahara />\n\nAsa's music influences grew over the years from the collection of great music her father had built up for his work as a cinematographer. These records featuring American, Nigerian and African soul classics, included musical greats such as [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Fela Kuti]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[King Sunny Ad\u00e9]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Miriam Makeba]].  A\u1e63a went on to draw inspiration from them.\n\n==Career==\nIn 2004, Asa met her manager and friend, Janet Nwose,<ref>[https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/entertainment/Why-Asa-and-her-female-manager-are-still-best-of-friends-474422# \"Why Asa and her female manager are still best of friends\"] ''GhanaWeb'', 3 October 2016.</ref> who introduced her to [[Cobhams Asuquo|Cobhams Emmanuel Asuquo]], who in turn became the producer of her first studio album ''Asa (Asha)''.\n\nA\u1e63a returned to France at the age of 20 to study at the IMFP school of Jazz music, where she was told by teachers that she should go ahead and become a recording artist because she was ready and needed no schooling. Back in Nigeria, her first single, \"Ey\u00e9 Adaba,\" was beginning to get airplay. A\u1e63a soon signed to [[Na\u00efve Records]]. Partnered with Cobhams Asuquo, and with the new involvement of Christophe Dupouy and Benjamin Constant, she produced her first platinum selling self-titled album, ''A\u1e63a''. The release of the album saw A\u1e63a charting radios across Europe, Asia and Africa and went on to win the prestigious French Constantin Award in 2008, when she was voted best fresh talent of 10 singers or groups by a jury of 19 music-industry specialists in Paris.<ref>Rhoads, Celeste, [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/asa-mn0001024291/biography \"Artist Biography\"], ''AllMusic''.</ref>\n\nHer second album, ''Beautiful Imperfection'', in collaboration with French composer Nicolas Mollard, was released on 25 October 2010, went platinum in 2011.

These have included the use of samples from serious sources such as [[NASA]] transmissions to comedic clips from films like [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''. ''U.F.Orb'' especially expressed a fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the album's title itself.<ref name=\"phoenix\"/> The title of its most popular single, \"Blue Room\", is a reference to the supposed Blue Room of [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], which was investigated as a possible UFO evidence holding room.<ref name=\"times-hippie\"/> Their 2001 album is named after the [[Cydonia Mensae]] region of Mars.<ref name=\"remixmag-orblivion\"/> Due to Paterson's focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena, ''The Guardian'' described Paterson as \"pop [music]'s primary spokesperson on aliens\".<ref name=\"dont-print-that\"/>\n\n== Techniques, technology, live performances ==\n[[File:The Orb in performance (Walt Disney Concert Hall, 19-03-2006).jpg|thumb|left|[[Alex Paterson|Paterson]] and [[Thomas Fehlmann|Fehlmann]] at a 2006 performance at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]]]]\n\nIn the Orb's early DJ events in the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty performed with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player all of which were mixed through an [[Akai]] 12-track [[mixing console|mixer]].<ref name=\"shih\"/> They used their equipment to harmonise recorded music and sound effect samples into an \"endless sound continuum\" for audiences of worn out dancers.<ref name=\"century\"/> Even after the Orb began producing original material, they kept the same sample-heavy model for live acts by spontaneously integrating obscure samples into their pre-recorded tracks. During promotional tours for ''Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'' and ''U.F.Orb'', they performed using a [[digital audio tape]] machine and experimented with other media sources such as [[dubplate]]s. The tape machines held individual chords, rhythms, and basslines for each composition, allowing the Orb to reprocess them and mimic the act of DJing.<ref name=\"tandt\"/> Members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect [[amp rack|racks]].<ref name=\"keyboard\"/> Often, the Orb had a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar.

''U.F.Orb'' especially expressed a fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the album's title itself.<ref name=\"phoenix\"/> The title of its most popular single, \"Blue Room\", is a reference to the supposed Blue Room of [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], which was investigated as a possible UFO evidence holding room.<ref name=\"times-hippie\"/> Their 2001 album is named after the [[Cydonia Mensae]] region of Mars.<ref name=\"remixmag-orblivion\"/> Due to Paterson's focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena, ''The Guardian'' described Paterson as \"pop [music]'s primary spokesperson on aliens\".<ref name=\"dont-print-that\"/>\n\n== Techniques, technology, live performances ==\n[[File:The Orb in performance (Walt Disney Concert Hall, 19-03-2006).jpg|thumb|left|[[Alex Paterson|Paterson]] and [[Thomas Fehlmann|Fehlmann]] at a 2006 performance at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]]]]\n\nIn the Orb's early DJ events in the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty performed with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player all of which were mixed through an [[Akai]] 12-track [[mixing console|mixer]].<ref name=\"shih\"/> They used their equipment to harmonise recorded music and sound effect samples into an \"endless sound continuum\" for audiences of worn out dancers.<ref name=\"century\"/> Even after the Orb began producing original material, they kept the same sample-heavy model for live acts by spontaneously integrating obscure samples into their pre-recorded tracks. During promotional tours for ''Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'' and ''U.F.Orb'', they performed using a [[digital audio tape]] machine and experimented with other media sources such as [[dubplate]]s. The tape machines held individual chords, rhythms, and basslines for each composition, allowing the Orb to reprocess them and mimic the act of DJ-ing.<ref name=\"tandt\"/> Members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect [[amp rack|racks]].<ref name=\"keyboard\"/> Often, the Orb had a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar. Their shows in the early 1990s would often be three hours of semi-improvised, continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples, voices, and pre-recorded tracks which were barely identifiable as the original piece.<ref name=\"times-anything\">{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] |last=Gray |first=Louise |date=18 November 1993 |title=Where anything goes}}</ref><ref name=\"times-anything\"/>\n\nThe Orb began performing regularly at the [[Brixton Academy]] in the early 1990s, where they used the high ceilings and large space for their \"well-suited amorphous sound\", frequently performing their newest and more experimental pieces there.<ref name=\"guardian-performance97\">{{cite news|last=Cartwright |first=Garth |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 April 1997 |title=Pop the Orb: Brixton Academy Review}}</ref> Andy Hughes took Weston's place at live performances after the 1993 tour, though Weston did reappear for the Orb's concert at the rainy [[Woodstock '94]].<ref name=\"amg-bio\"/> The Orb played for late night raves on the first two nights of Woodstock '94 in addition to artists including [[Aphex Twin]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], and [[Deee-Lite]]. The next year, the Orb's touring group consisted of Paterson, Hughes, Nick Burton on drums, and Simon Phillips on bass.

For more recent albums such as ''Cydonia'', they used inexpensive equipment such as [[Korg]]'s [[Electribe]] products, which Paterson described as employing more of a \"bedroom techno\" approach.<ref name=\"remixmag-orblivion\"/> Despite their use of laptops during performances and in-studio computers, Paterson says that he still cherishes vinyl and does not find purchasing CDs or downloading music to be nearly as satisfying.<ref name=\"guardian-interview\"/>\n\n=== Sampling and remixing ===\nOne of the Orb's most notable contributions to electronic music is their idea of blurring the distinction between sampling and remixing.<ref name=\"tandt\"/> Albums such as ''Pomme Fritz'', though released as a piece of original work, consist largely of manipulated samples. Conversely, the Orb's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single \"Toxygene\". \"Toxygene\" was originally commissioned as a remix of [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s \"Oxygene 8\" from ''[[Oxygene 7-13]]''.<ref name=\"spheres\">{{cite news|work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |title=Music of the Spheres: Orb |last=Smith |first=Andrew |date=16 February 1997 |page=13}}</ref> The Orb \"obliterated it\" and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly refused to release it;<ref name=\"spheres\"/> The Orb released the track themselves under the name \"Toxygene\", which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted \"The French are always five years behind us, anyway.\"<ref name=\"spheres\"/> In statements made after the release of \"Toxygene\", Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it.<ref name=\"dotmusic\">{{cite web|date=27 January 1997 |last=Aston |first=Martin |title=Dotmusic Talent: Jean Michel Jarre |url=http://www.dotmusic.co.uk/MWtalentjjarre.html |work=Dotmusic (retrieved from the [[Internet Archive]]) |accessdate=30 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19980708105644/http://www.dotmusic.co.uk/MWtalentjjarre.html |archivedate = 8 July 1998}}</ref>\n\nOther artists have become agitated due to the Orb sampling their work, though Paterson jokingly suggests that \"[t]hey don't know the half of it.\"<ref name=\"citypaper\"/> Paterson says that he finds a \"beauty\" and a \"cleverness\" with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it.<ref name=\"keyboard\"/> Even though fans often try to guess the origins of many of the samples, Paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would \"die\" if they discovered, for example, where the drums on \"Little Fluffy Clouds\" originated from.<ref name=\"remixmag-orblivion\"/> He has said that record labels have cautioned him, \"Don't tell anyone where you got your samples until we get them cleared!\".<ref name=\"remixmag-orblivion\"/>\n\n{{listen\n | filename    = OrbToxygene.ogg\n | title       = \"Toxygene\" (1997)\n | description = Clip from \"[[Toxygene]]\", The Orb's controversial pseudo-remix of [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s \"[[Oxygene 7-13|Oxygene 8]]\".\n | format      = \n}}\n\nThe Orb have used a wide variety of audio clips from sources ranging from [[McCarthy era]] speeches to prank phone calls by [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] to [[David Thewlis]]' apocalypse-driven rant from the film ''[[Naked (1993 film)|Naked]]''.<ref name=\"rollingstone-live97\"/> Paterson obtains many samples from recording TV and radio for hours at a time and picking out his favourite clips.<ref name=\"keyboard\"/> He and other members of the Orb record nature sounds for use on albums, especially ''FFWD'' and ''Orbus Terrarum''.
