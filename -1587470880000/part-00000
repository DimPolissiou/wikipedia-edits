Practitioners of Buddhism can be found amongst the Sinhalese population as well as the Tamil population. Buddhism has been given the foremost place under Article 9 of the Constitution which can be traced back to an attempt to bring the status of Buddhism back to the status it enjoyed prior to being destroyed by colonialists. However, by virtue of Article 10 of the Sri Lankan constitution, religious rights of all communities are preserved. Sri Lanka is the traditionally oldest religious Buddhist country where Buddhist Aryan culture is protected and preserved.<ref>\"Census of Population and Housing of Sri Lanka, 2012 \u2013 [http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/CPH2011/Pages/Activities/Reports/FinalReport/Population/Table%20A4.pdf Table A4: Population by district, religion and sex]\" (PDF). Department of Census & Statistics, Sri Lanka.</ref> The island has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century [[Common Era|BCE]] producing eminent scholars such as [[Buddhaghosa]] and preserving the vast [[P\u0101li Canon]]. Throughout most of its history,hi Sri Lankan kings have played a major role in the maintenance and revival of the Buddhist institutions of the island. During the 19th century, a modern Buddhist revival took place on the island which promoted Buddhist education and learning. There are around 6,000 Buddhist monasteries on Sri Lanka with approximately 15,000 monks.<ref name=Perera>Perera, HR, Buddhism in Sri Lanka A Short History, 2007, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/perera/wheel100.html</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Introduction of Buddhism===\n\nAccording to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]'', Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the [[Third Buddhist council]] by [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Arhanth\u00e0 Mahinda thero]], son of Emperor [[Ashoka]], during the reign of [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]]. After the arrival of Arahantha Mahinda, he invited his sister Sangamitta Thera to bring a sapling of the [[Bodhi Tree]] (where Buddha was enlightened) to Sri Lanka and the first Buddhist monastery, monuments and monk were introduced. Among these, the [[Isurumuniya]] and the [[Vessagiriya]] remain important centers of worship. He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka [[cetiya]], the Jambukola [[vihara|vih\u0101ra]] and the Hatth\u0101lhaka vih\u0101ra and the refectory. The Pali Canon, having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first converted into writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE. Along with Mahinda came his sibling Sanghamitra. She gave the nun ordinace to women devotees.\n\n''Mahavamsa'' \u00a729{{sfn|McEvilley|2012|p=558}} records that during the rule of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]], a [[Yona]] head monk named [[Mahadharmaraksita]] led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \"the Greek city of Alasandra\" ([[v]], around {{convert|150|km}} north of modern [[Kabul]], Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], indicating that [[Greco-Buddhism]] contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism. See also the ''[[Milinda Panha]]''.\n\n===Center of Pali literature===\nAs a result of the work of [[Buddhaghosa]] and other compilers such as [[Dhammapala]], Sri Lanka developed a strong tradition of written textual transmission of the Pali Canon. The compilation of the [[Atthakatha]] (commentaries) along with the [[Nik\u0101ya]]s and other Pitakas were committed to writing for the first time in the [[Aluvihare Rock Temple]] during the first century BCE.<ref name=Perera /> Buddhist literature in Sinhalese also thrived and by 410, Sri Lankan monks traveled widely throughout India and Asia introducing their works.\n\n===Therav\u0101da subdivisions===\n\nOver much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of Therav\u0101da existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the three [[mahavihara]]s: [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya]], [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra]] and [[Jetavanaramaya]].<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\">Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 280</ref> The Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya was the first tradition to be established while Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra and Jetavanaramaya were established by monks who had broken away from the Maha Viharaya tradition.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\"/> According to A.K. Warder, the Indian [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]] established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravadas into which they were later absorbed.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\"/> Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\nIn the 7th century, Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the \"Mahayana Sthaviras\" and the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra tradition as the \"[[Hinayana]] Sthaviras.\"<ref>Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53</ref> Abhayagiri appears to have been a center for Mahayana and [[Vajrayana]] teachings;<ref>\"Esoteric Buddhism in Southeast Asia in the Light of Recent Scholarship\" by Hiram Woodward. ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'', Vol. 35, No. 2 (Jun., 2004), p. 341</ref> Xuanzang writes, \"The Mah\u0101vih\u0101rav\u0101sins reject the Mah\u0101y\u0101na and practice the H\u012bnay\u0101na, while the Abhayagirivih\u0101rav\u0101sins study both H\u012bnay\u0101na and Mah\u0101y\u0101na teachings and propagate the ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka]]''.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na.'' 2007. p. 121</ref>\n\nIn the 8th century, both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Vajrayana Buddhism in China, [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Amoghavajra]], visited the island during this time.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na.'' 2007. pp. 125\u2013126</ref>\n\nIn Pali commentaries, terms used for the Mahayanins of Abhayagiri were Vaitulya, Vaipulya and Vaidalya. According to HR Perera, the Theravada commentaries considered them heretical and their doctrines included:\n{{quote|They held the view that the Buddha, having been born in the [[Tushita|Tusita heaven]], lived there and never came down to earth and it was only a created form that appeared among men. This created form and \u0100nanda, who learned from it, preached the doctrine. They also held that nothing whatever given to the Order bears fruit, for the Sangha, which in the ultimate sense of the term meant only the path and fruition, does not accept anything. According to them any human pair may enter upon sexual intercourse by mutual consent.<ref name=Perera />}}\n\n===Accounts of Chinese pilgrims===\n\nIn the 5th century, [[Faxian]] visited Sri Lanka and lived there for two years with the monks. Faxian obtained a [[Sanskrit]] copy of the [[Vinaya]] of the [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]] at the [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra]] c. 406. The Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya was then translated into Chinese in 434 by Buddhajiva and [[Zhu Daosheng]].<ref>Hsing Yun. ''Humanistic Buddhism.'' 2005. p. 163</ref> This translation of the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya remains extant in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] as [[Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka]] 1421.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/files/k0895.html|title=The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalog (T 1421)}}</ref>\n\nThe 7th-century pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] first learned for several years at [[Nalanda]] and then intended to go to Sri Lanka to seek out further instruction. However, after meeting Sri Lankan monks in the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] capital who were refugees, he decided not to visit:\n{{quote|At the time of Hiuen Tsang's visit the capital was visited by 300 [[bhikkhu|Bhikshus]] of Ceylon who had left the island in consequence of [[famine]] and [[revolution]] there. On the pilgrim telling them of his intended visit to Ceylon for instruction, they told him that there were no Brethren there superior to them. Then the pilgrim discussed some [[Yogacara|Yoga]] texts with them and found that their explanations could not excel those given to him by [[\u015a\u012blabhadra]] at N\u0101land\u0101.{{sfn|Mookerji|1998|p=520}}}}\n\n===Decline and revival===\nFrom the 5th century to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw continuous warfare between local kings, pretenders and foreign invaders such as the South Indian Chola and [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan]] dynasties. This warfare saw the sacking of viharas and made the situation difficult for Buddhism.<ref name=Perera /> In 1070, [[Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa]] conquered the island and set about repairing the monasteries. The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; therefore, he sent an embassy to [[Burma]], which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts.<ref name=Perera /> The king oversaw the ordination of thousands of monks. The royal reforming of Sri Lankan Buddhism continued under [[Parakramabahu I]] (c. 1153), who restored many stupas and monasteries. During this period, Sri Lankan Buddhist literature thrived once again and the three greats writers [[Mah\u0101kassapa Thera]] of [[Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara]], Moggallana Thera and [[S\u0101riputta Thera]] compiled Pali commentaries and [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|sub-commentaries]]. [[Parakramabahu II of Dambadeniya]] (from c. 1236) was a learned king and wrote several Sinhalese Buddhist texts.\n\n===Abolition of other Theravada traditions===\nBefore the 12th century, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiris and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiris as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na.'' 2007. p. 125</ref><ref>Sujato, Bhikkhu. ''Sects & Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools.'' 2006. p. 59</ref> The trend of Abhayagiri being the dominant sect changed in the 12th century, when the Maha Viharaya gained the political support of Parakramabahu I (1153\u20131186), who completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanaya traditions.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na.'' 2007. p. 126</ref><ref name=\"Williams, Duncan 1999. p. 134\">Williams, Duncan. Queen, Christopher. ''American Buddhism: Methods and Findings in Recent Scholarship.'' 1999. p. 134</ref> The monks of these two traditions were then defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently or attempting reordination under the Maha Viharaya tradition as [[\u015br\u0101ma\u1e47era|s\u0101ma\u1e47era]]s.<ref name=\"Williams, Duncan 1999. p. 134\"/><ref>Gombrich, Richard.

''Therav\u0101da Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo.'' 1988. p. 159</ref>\n\n===Mahayana legacy===\nVeneration of [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] has continued to the present day in Sri Lanka, where he is called N\u0101tha.<ref>Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 137</ref> In more recent times, some western-educated Therav\u0101dins have attempted to identify N\u0101tha with [[Maitreya]]. However, traditions and basic iconography, including an image of [[Amit\u0101bha]] on his crown, identify N\u0101tha as Avalokite\u015bvara.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/lanka/matara/we01.html|title=Art & Archaeology \u2013 Sri Lanka \u2013 Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara}}</ref>\n{{quote|It is clear from sculptural evidence alone that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na was fairly widespread throughout [Sri Lanka], although the modern account of the history of Buddhism on the island presents an unbroken and pure lineage of Therav\u0101da. (One can only assume that similar trends were transmitted to other parts of Southeast Asia with Sri Lankan ordination lineages.) Relics of an extensive cult of Avalokite\u015bvara can be seen in the present-day figure of N\u0101tha.<ref name=\"Skilton, Andrew 2004. p. 151\">Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. p. 151</ref>}}\nEarly reports by Europeans from the 18th century describe the Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka as being engaged in the recitation of [[mantra]]s and using [[Buddhist prayer beads]] for counting as practiced in Mahayana Buddhism.<ref name=\"Skilton, Andrew 2004. p. 151\"/>\n\n===Lineage continuity===\nSri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation, with the Sangha having existed in a largely unbroken lineage since its introduction in the 3rd century BCE. During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Burma and [[Thailand]].\n\n===Colonialism and Christianity===\n[[File:AMH-7013-KB Procession of monks on Ceylon.jpg|thumb|230px|Dutch painting of the Buddhist religious festival in Ceylon, c. 1672]]\nFrom the 16th century onwards, [[missionary|missionaries]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] colonizers of Sri Lanka have attempted to convert the local population to [[Christianity]]. The wars with the Portuguese and their allies weakened the Sangha. In 1592, [[Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy]] sought aid from Burma in order to ordain Buddhist monks on the island as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left.<ref name=Perera /> From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island with the Sinhalese caught in the middle, the Dutch won and occupied the maritime sections of the island that had been occupied by the Portuguese until 1796 when they surrendered their territories to the British. The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing though they still discriminated against Buddhists which were not allowed to register with the local authorities therefore many Sinhalese pretended to be Protestant.<ref name=Perera /> During this period many religiously inclined Sinhalese rulers of the interior such as [[Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy]] (1706\u20131739) and [[Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Kandy]] (1739\u20131747) continued to patronize Buddhism, restoring temples and monasteries.\n\nIn the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as [[upasampada]], which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Thai Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by [[Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero]] during the reign of king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe.<ref>[http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items05/270405-2.html Weliwita Sri Saranankara Theroenerable Weliwita Sri Saranankara Mahathera], Dr. Daya Hewapathirane, Lankaweb</ref>\n\nIn 1813 the American Ceylon Mission (Protestant) was established in [[Jaffna]]. In 1815 a British army captured Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king ending a line of Buddhist kings lasting 2301 years, they retained Sri Lanka until 1948. Like the Dutch, the British refused to register unbaptized infants and to accept non-Christian marriages. They also always preferred Christians in government administration. The British also supported various Christian missionary groups who established schools on the island. Education in these schools (which disparaged Buddhism) was a requirement for government office. Missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and promoting Christianity<ref name=Perera />\n\n===Buddhist revival===\n<!--\"Eight Precepts\" links here. If this section is renamed or removed, please adjust wikilink over there accordingly.-->\n[[File:Olcott and Buddhists.jpg|thumb|250px|Henry Olcott and Buddhists (Colombo, 1883).]]\nIn the 19th century, a national Buddhist movement began as a response to Christian proselytizing, and was empowered by the results of the [[Panadura]] debate between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as [[Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera]] and [[Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera]] which was widely seen as a victory for the Buddhists.<ref>[http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local/buddhists-must-safeguard-religion-sangha-thera Buddhists must safeguard religion, Sangha \u2013 Thera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416202308/http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local%2Fbuddhists-must-safeguard-religion-sangha-thera |date=2015-04-16 }}, Daily News</ref> In 1880 [[Henry Steel Olcott]] arrived in Sri Lanka with [[Madame Blavatsky]] of the [[Theosophical Society]]; he had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and after learning about Buddhism converted to the religion. Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of establishing Buddhist schools (there were only three at the time, by 1940, there were 429 Buddhist schools on the island).<ref name=Perera /> The society also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, ''Sarasavisandarasa'', and its English counterpart, ''The Buddhist''. As a result of their efforts, [[Vesak]] became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased. Another important figure in the revival is [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], initially an interpreter for Olcott, who traveled around the island preaching and writing. After traveling to India, he established the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinara]].<ref name=\"maha\">[http://mahabodhisociety.com/ Maha Bodhi Society]</ref> His efforts saw the restoration of these sites and a renewal of interest in Buddhism among some Indians. The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist texts, and promotion of Buddhist scholarship. Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir [[D. B. Jayatilaka]], [[F. R. Senanayake]], [[Walisinghe Harischandra]] and [[W. A. de Silva]].<ref name=Perera /> Several Buddhist shrines were also rebuilt. Buddhist leaders were also active in the movement for Sri Lankan independence. Since independence, Buddhism has continued to thrive on the island. \n[[File:Zahntempel Kandy.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Temple of the Tooth]] was renovated during the Buddhist revival.]]\n\nThe Buddhist revival also resulted in Sinhala Buddhists carrying the torch of Buddhism and igniting it on foreign shores. Anagarika Dharmapala and [[Asoka Weeraratna]] are two such leading pioneers among many others. They pioneered the establishment of Buddhist Viharas in Europe. Anagarika Dharmapala founded the London Buddhist Vihara in 1926 while Asoka Weeraratna opened a new chapter for the spread of Buddhism in Germany and Europe by establishing the Berlin Buddhist Vihara in [[Paul Dahlke (Buddhist)|Dr. Paul Dahlke]]\u2019s Das Buddhistische Haus in 1957 with monks from Sri Lanka stationed on a long-term footing to spread the Dhamma. This was the first Theravada Buddhist Vihara in Germany and continental Europe.\n\nSince the Buddhist revival Sri Lanka has also been an important center of Western Buddhist scholarship. One of the first western bhikkhus, [[Nyanatiloka]] Mahathera studied in Sri Lanka, established the [[Island Hermitage]] there and ordained several western monks. Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as [[Nanamoli Bhikkhu]] and Ven. [[Nyanaponika]] (who established the [[Buddhist Publication Society]] along with [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]]) were responsible for many important translations of the [[Pali Canon]] and other texts on Buddhism in English and German.\n\n===Bhikkhuni ordination===\nA few years after the arrival of Mahinda, [[Bhikkhuni]] [[Sanghamitta]], who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka came to Sri Lanka. She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century.\n\nMany women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996.<ref>''Buddhist Studies Review'', vol. 24.2, p. 227</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1996 through the efforts of [[Sakyadhita International Association of Buddhist Women|Sakyadhita]], an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived, when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure held by Ven.

Practitioners of Buddhism can be found amongst the Sinhalese population as well as the Tamil population. Buddhism has been given the foremost place under Article 9 of the Constitution which can be traced back to an attempt to bring the status of Buddhism back to the status it enjoyed prior to being destroyed by colonialists. However, by virtue of Article 10 of the Sri Lankan constitution, religious rights of all communities are preserved. Sri Lanka is the traditionally oldest religious Buddhist country where Buddhist Aryan culture is protected and preserved.<ref>\"Census of Population and Housing of Sri Lanka, 2012 \u2013 [http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/CPH2011/Pages/Activities/Reports/FinalReport/Population/Table%20A4.pdf Table A4: Population by district, religion and sex]\" (PDF). Department of Census & Statistics, Sri Lanka.</ref> The island has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century [[Common Era|BCE]] producing eminent scholars such as [[Buddhaghosa]] and preserving the vast [[P\u0101li Canon]]. Throughout most of its history, Sri Lankan kings have played a major role in the maintenance and revival of the Buddhist institutions of the island. During the 19th century, a modern Buddhist revival took place on the island which promoted Buddhist education and learning. There are around 6,000 Buddhist monasteries on Sri Lanka with approximately 15,000 monks.<ref name=Perera>Perera, HR, Buddhism in Sri Lanka A Short History, 2007, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/perera/wheel100.html</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Introduction of Buddhism===\n\nAccording to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]'', Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the [[Third Buddhist council]] by [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Arhanth\u00e0 Mahinda thero]], son of Emperor [[Ashoka]], during the reign of [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]]. After the arrival of Arahantha Mahinda, he invited his sister Sangamitta Thera to bring a sapling of the [[Bodhi Tree]] (where Buddha was enlightened) to Sri Lanka and the first Buddhist monastery, monuments and monk were introduced. Among these, the [[Isurumuniya]] and the [[Vessagiriya]] remain important centers of worship. He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka [[cetiya]], the Jambukola [[vihara|vih\u0101ra]] and the Hatth\u0101lhaka vih\u0101ra and the refectory. The Pali Canon, having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first converted into writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE. Along with Mahinda came his sibling Sanghamitra. She gave the nun ordinace to women devotees.\n\n''Mahavamsa'' \u00a729{{sfn|McEvilley|2012|p=558}} records that during the rule of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]], a [[Yona]] head monk named [[Mahadharmaraksita]] led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \"the Greek city of Alasandra\" ([[v]], around {{convert|150|km}} north of modern [[Kabul]], Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], indicating that [[Greco-Buddhism]] contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism. See also the ''[[Milinda Panha]]''.\n\n===Center of Pali literature===\nAs a result of the work of [[Buddhaghosa]] and other compilers such as [[Dhammapala]], Sri Lanka developed a strong tradition of written textual transmission of the Pali Canon. The compilation of the [[Atthakatha]] (commentaries) along with the [[Nik\u0101ya]]s and other Pitakas were committed to writing for the first time in the [[Aluvihare Rock Temple]] during the first century BCE.<ref name=Perera /> Buddhist literature in Sinhalese also thrived and by 410, Sri Lankan monks traveled widely throughout India and Asia introducing their works.\n\n===Therav\u0101da subdivisions===\n\nOver much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of Therav\u0101da existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the three [[mahavihara]]s: [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya]], [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra]] and [[Jetavanaramaya]].<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\">Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 280</ref> The Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya was the first tradition to be established while Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra and Jetavanaramaya were established by monks who had broken away from the Maha Viharaya tradition.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\"/> According to A.K. Warder, the Indian [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]] established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravadas into which they were later absorbed.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\"/> Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\nIn the 7th century, Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the \"Mahayana Sthaviras\" and the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra tradition as the \"[[Hinayana]] Sthaviras.\"<ref>Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53</ref> Abhayagiri appears to have been a center for Mahayana and [[Vajrayana]] teachings;<ref>\"Esoteric Buddhism in Southeast Asia in the Light of Recent Scholarship\" by Hiram Woodward. ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'', Vol. 35, No. 2 (Jun., 2004), p. 341</ref> Xuanzang writes, \"The Mah\u0101vih\u0101rav\u0101sins reject the Mah\u0101y\u0101na and practice the H\u012bnay\u0101na, while the Abhayagirivih\u0101rav\u0101sins study both H\u012bnay\u0101na and Mah\u0101y\u0101na teachings and propagate the ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka]]''.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na.'' 2007. p. 121</ref>\n\nIn the 8th century, both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Vajrayana Buddhism in China, [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Amoghavajra]], visited the island during this time.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na.'' 2007. pp. 125\u2013126</ref>\n\nIn Pali commentaries, terms used for the Mahayanins of Abhayagiri were Vaitulya, Vaipulya and Vaidalya. According to HR Perera, the Theravada commentaries considered them heretical and their doctrines included:\n{{quote|They held the view that the Buddha, having been born in the [[Tushita|Tusita heaven]], lived there and never came down to earth and it was only a created form that appeared among men. This created form and \u0100nanda, who learned from it, preached the doctrine. They also held that nothing whatever given to the Order bears fruit, for the Sangha, which in the ultimate sense of the term meant only the path and fruition, does not accept anything. According to them any human pair may enter upon sexual intercourse by mutual consent.<ref name=Perera />}}\n\n===Accounts of Chinese pilgrims===\n\nIn the 5th century, [[Faxian]] visited Sri Lanka and lived there for two years with the monks. Faxian obtained a [[Sanskrit]] copy of the [[Vinaya]] of the [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]] at the [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra]] c. 406. The Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya was then translated into Chinese in 434 by Buddhajiva and [[Zhu Daosheng]].<ref>Hsing Yun. ''Humanistic Buddhism.'' 2005. p. 163</ref> This translation of the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya remains extant in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] as [[Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka]] 1421.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/files/k0895.html|title=The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalog (T 1421)}}</ref>\n\nThe 7th-century pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] first learned for several years at [[Nalanda]] and then intended to go to Sri Lanka to seek out further instruction. However, after meeting Sri Lankan monks in the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] capital who were refugees, he decided not to visit:\n{{quote|At the time of Hiuen Tsang's visit the capital was visited by 300 [[bhikkhu|Bhikshus]] of Ceylon who had left the island in consequence of [[famine]] and [[revolution]] there. On the pilgrim telling them of his intended visit to Ceylon for instruction, they told him that there were no Brethren there superior to them. Then the pilgrim discussed some [[Yogacara|Yoga]] texts with them and found that their explanations could not excel those given to him by [[\u015a\u012blabhadra]] at N\u0101land\u0101.{{sfn|Mookerji|1998|p=520}}}}\n\n===Decline and revival===\nFrom the 5th century to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw continuous warfare between local kings, pretenders and foreign invaders such as the South Indian Chola and [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan]] dynasties. This warfare saw the sacking of viharas and made the situation difficult for Buddhism.<ref name=Perera /> In 1070, [[Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa]] conquered the island and set about repairing the monasteries. The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; therefore, he sent an embassy to [[Burma]], which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts.<ref name=Perera /> The king oversaw the ordination of thousands of monks. The royal reforming of Sri Lankan Buddhism continued under [[Parakramabahu I]] (c. 1153), who restored many stupas and monasteries. During this period, Sri Lankan Buddhist literature thrived once again and the three greats writers [[Mah\u0101kassapa Thera]] of [[Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara]], Moggallana Thera and [[S\u0101riputta Thera]] compiled Pali commentaries and [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|sub-commentaries]]. [[Parakramabahu II of Dambadeniya]] (from c. 1236) was a learned king and wrote several Sinhalese Buddhist texts.\n\n===Abolition of other Theravada traditions===\nBefore the 12th century, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiris and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiris as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na.'' 2007. p. 125</ref><ref>Sujato, Bhikkhu. ''Sects & Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools.'' 2006. p. 59</ref> The trend of Abhayagiri being the dominant sect changed in the 12th century, when the Maha Viharaya gained the political support of Parakramabahu I (1153\u20131186), who completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanaya traditions.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira.

''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 137</ref> In more recent times, some western-educated Therav\u0101dins have attempted to identify N\u0101tha with [[Maitreya]]. However, traditions and basic iconography, including an image of [[Amit\u0101bha]] on his crown, identify N\u0101tha as Avalokite\u015bvara.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/lanka/matara/we01.html|title=Art & Archaeology \u2013 Sri Lanka \u2013 Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara}}</ref>\n{{quote|It is clear from sculptural evidence alone that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na was fairly widespread throughout [Sri Lanka], although the modern account of the history of Buddhism on the island presents an unbroken and pure lineage of Therav\u0101da.

Relics of an extensive cult of Avalokite\u015bvara can be seen in the present-day figure of N\u0101tha.<ref name=\"Skilton, Andrew 2004. p. 151\">Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. p. 151</ref>}}\nEarly reports by Europeans from the 18th century describe the Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka as being engaged in the recitation of [[mantra]]s and using [[Buddhist prayer beads]] for counting as practiced in Mahayana Buddhism.<ref name=\"Skilton, Andrew 2004. p. 151\"/>\n\n===Lineage continuity===\nSri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation, with the Sangha having existed in a largely unbroken lineage since its introduction in the 3rd century BCE. During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Burma and [[Thailand]].\n\n===Colonialism and Christianity===\n[[File:AMH-7013-KB Procession of monks on Ceylon.jpg|thumb|230px|Dutch painting of the Buddhist religious festival in Ceylon, c. 1672]]\nFrom the 16th century onwards, [[missionary|missionaries]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] colonizers of Sri Lanka have attempted to convert the local population to [[Christianity]]. The wars with the Portuguese and their allies weakened the Sangha. In 1592, [[Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy]] sought aid from Burma in order to ordain Buddhist monks on the island as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left.<ref name=Perera /> From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island with the Sinhalese caught in the middle, the Dutch won and occupied the maritime sections of the island that had been occupied by the Portuguese until 1796 when they surrendered their territories to the British. The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing though they still discriminated against Buddhists which were not allowed to register with the local authorities therefore many Sinhalese pretended to be Protestant.<ref name=Perera /> During this period many religiously inclined Sinhalese rulers of the interior such as [[Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy]] (1706\u20131739) and [[Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Kandy]] (1739\u20131747) continued to patronize Buddhism, restoring temples and monasteries.\n\nIn the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as [[upasampada]], which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Thai Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by [[Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero]] during the reign of king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe.<ref>[http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items05/270405-2.html Weliwita Sri Saranankara Theroenerable Weliwita Sri Saranankara Mahathera], Dr. Daya Hewapathirane, Lankaweb</ref>\n\nIn 1813 the American Ceylon Mission (Protestant) was established in [[Jaffna]]. In 1815 a British army captured Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king ending a line of Buddhist kings lasting 2301 years, they retained Sri Lanka until 1948. Like the Dutch, the British refused to register unbaptized infants and to accept non-Christian marriages. They also always preferred Christians in government administration. The British also supported various Christian missionary groups who established schools on the island. Education in these schools (which disparaged Buddhism) was a requirement for government office. Missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and promoting Christianity<ref name=Perera />\n\n===Buddhist revival===\n<!--\"Eight Precepts\" links here. If this section is renamed or removed, please adjust wikilink over there accordingly.-->\n[[File:Olcott and Buddhists.jpg|thumb|250px|Henry Olcott and Buddhists (Colombo, 1883).]]\nIn the 19th century, a national Buddhist movement began as a response to Christian proselytizing, and was empowered by the results of the [[Panadura]] debate between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as [[Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera]] and [[Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera]] which was widely seen as a victory for the Buddhists.<ref>[http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local/buddhists-must-safeguard-religion-sangha-thera Buddhists must safeguard religion, Sangha \u2013 Thera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416202308/http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local%2Fbuddhists-must-safeguard-religion-sangha-thera |date=2015-04-16 }}, Daily News</ref> In 1880 [[Henry Steel Olcott]] arrived in Sri Lanka with [[Madame Blavatsky]] of the [[Theosophical Society]]; he had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and after learning about Buddhism converted to the religion. Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of establishing Buddhist schools (there were only three at the time, by 1940, there were 429 Buddhist schools on the island).<ref name=Perera /> The society also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, ''Sarasavisandarasa'', and its English counterpart, ''The Buddhist''. As a result of their efforts, [[Vesak]] became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased. Another important figure in the revival is [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], initially an interpreter for Olcott, who traveled around the island preaching and writing. After traveling to India, he established the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinara]].<ref name=\"maha\">[http://mahabodhisociety.com/ Maha Bodhi Society]</ref> His efforts saw the restoration of these sites and a renewal of interest in Buddhism among some Indians. The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist texts, and promotion of Buddhist scholarship. Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir [[D. B. Jayatilaka]], [[F. R. Senanayake]], [[Walisinghe Harischandra]] and [[W. A. de Silva]].<ref name=Perera /> Several Buddhist shrines were also rebuilt. Buddhist leaders were also active in the movement for Sri Lankan independence. Since independence, Buddhism has continued to thrive on the island. \n[[File:Zahntempel Kandy.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Temple of the Tooth]] was renovated during the Buddhist revival.]]\n\nThe Buddhist revival also resulted in Sinhala Buddhists carrying the torch of Buddhism and igniting it on foreign shores. Anagarika Dharmapala and [[Asoka Weeraratna]] are two such leading pioneers among many others. They pioneered the establishment of Buddhist Viharas in Europe. Anagarika Dharmapala founded the London Buddhist Vihara in 1926 while Asoka Weeraratna opened a new chapter for the spread of Buddhism in Germany and Europe by establishing the Berlin Buddhist Vihara in [[Paul Dahlke (Buddhist)|Dr. Paul Dahlke]]\u2019s Das Buddhistische Haus in 1957 with monks from Sri Lanka stationed on a long-term footing to spread the Dhamma. This was the first Theravada Buddhist Vihara in Germany and continental Europe.\n\nSince the Buddhist revival Sri Lanka has also been an important center of Western Buddhist scholarship. One of the first western bhikkhus, [[Nyanatiloka]] Mahathera studied in Sri Lanka, established the [[Island Hermitage]] there and ordained several western monks. Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as [[Nanamoli Bhikkhu]] and Ven. [[Nyanaponika]] (who established the [[Buddhist Publication Society]] along with [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]]) were responsible for many important translations of the [[Pali Canon]] and other texts on Buddhism in English and German.\n\n===Bhikkhuni ordination===\nA few years after the arrival of Mahinda, [[Bhikkhuni]] [[Sanghamitta]], who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka came to Sri Lanka. She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century.\n\nMany women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996.<ref>''Buddhist Studies Review'', vol. 24.2, p. 227</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1996 through the efforts of [[Sakyadhita International Association of Buddhist Women|Sakyadhita]], an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived, when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure held by Ven.
