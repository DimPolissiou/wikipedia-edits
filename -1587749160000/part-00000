Bruce and the trucking company owners who move the cash [[Skimming (fraud)|skim]] $8 million, which causes their cartel contact Del to kill Bruce, Bruce's fianc\u00e9e Liz, and the father-son trucking company owners. To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Marty begins activities at the Blue Cat, despite the suspicions of Rachel, the primary owner.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration.

Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop with Marty as an investor. Roy also convinces Russ to say he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him again unless Marty is dead. After returning home, Charlotte goes for a night swim. Ignoring Marty's advice to stay near the shore, she swims far into the lake.

Rachel attempts to obtain evidence against Marty, and Roy uses stolen drugs to keep her in line.

Roy pressures Rachel for useful information, including pretending to be a Blue Cat bar customer. Rachel has bathroom sex with a bar pickup and calls him Marty to irritate Roy, who is monitoring her transmitter. To deflect Marty's suspicion from her, Rachel suggests the man from the Blue Cat (Roy) might be a police officer. An infuriated Roy threatens her with a violent end if she does not produce evidence. The Byrdes' planned bribe of a state gaming official ends when Wendy correctly suspects a trap. Wendy tries to provide money to Mason, who angrily refuses. Marty pays scant attention to Ruth while handling other problems, so she confides in Rachel, who uses the relationship to gather evidence for Roy.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation. Ruth does not crack, and Helen tells Marty she is impressed with Ruth's willpower. Marty reminds Wendy that she cheated on him, and Charlotte overhears and informs Jonah. Charlotte and Jonah discuss using what is left of their money took to buy a van and run away. Helen tells the Snells to burn their poppies so Roy will not find any evidence, but Darlene resists.

Marty and the Snells disinter several Snell ancestors and use their remains to replace the bones the FBI found, throwing off the test results and enabling Jacob to claim authorities desecrated his family's ancient burial places. Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

Darlene tells him she guessed his plan and poisoned his coffee, and they pledge their love to each other before he dies. Wilkes arranges for the Byrdes to meet the gaming commissioners and the chairman requests a non-union site in exchange for his support, to which Marty agrees, despite knowing it will anger Frank.

Instead, Ruth tells Wyatt, who drives away in anger. Angry that Cade attacked Charlotte while trying to find Marty's money, Wendy offers him $500,000 to leave town.
