Released on 3 March 1986, it was the theme song to the 1986 [[Absolute Beginners (film)|film of the same name]] (itself an adaptation of the book ''[[Absolute Beginners (novel)|Absolute Beginners]]'').\n\nAlthough the film was not a commercial success, the song was a big hit: reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It also reached the top ten on the main singles charts in [[David Bowie discography| ten other countries]], becoming his last single to achieve that. It was less successful in the US, peaking at No. 53 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \n\nBowie performed \"Absolute Beginners\" live on his 1987 [[Glass Spider Tour]], his 2000 [[Mini Tour (David Bowie)|\"Mini\" Tour]], and his 2002 [[Heathen Tour]]. The song has been included on a number of Bowie's compilation and \"Best-of\" releases, and was included as a bonus track on the 1995 re-release of ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' (1984).\n\n==Background and recording==\nBowie was good friends with the film's director, [[Julien Temple]] (who had worked with him in 1984 on the ''[[Jazzin' for Blue Jean]]'' short film). Bowie agreed to Temple's request to write music for the film if he could also play the part of Vendice Partners.\n\nIt was recorded at Langer & Winstanley's Westside Studios, London. The sessions were completed rapidly, but the song was delayed due to the problems with completing the film. [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] wanted the release to tie in with the film's opening. The song featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano, who had previously performed on Bowie's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" single and ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' album.

Released on 3 March 1986, it was the theme song to the 1986 [[Absolute Beginners (film)|film of the same name]] (itself an adaptation of the book ''[[Absolute Beginners (novel)|Absolute Beginners]]'').\n\nAlthough the film was not a commercial success, the song was a big hit: reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It also reached the top ten on the main singles charts in [[David Bowie discography| ten other countries]], becoming his last single to achieve that. It was less successful in the US, peaking at No. 53 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \n\nBowie performed \"Absolute Beginners\" live on his 1987 [[Glass Spider Tour]], his 2000 [[Mini Tour (David Bowie)|\"Mini\" Tour]], and his 2002 [[Heathen Tour]]. The song has been included on a number of Bowie's compilation and \"Best-of\" releases, and was included as a bonus track on the 1995 re-release of ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' (1984).\n\n==Background and recording==\nBowie was good friends with the film's director, [[Julien Temple]] (who had worked with him in 1984 on the ''[[Jazzin' for Blue Jean]]'' short film). Bowie agreed to Temple's request to write music for the film if he could also play the part of Vendice Partners.\n\nIt was recorded at Langer & Winstanley's Westside Studios, London. The sessions were completed rapidly, but the song was delayed due to the problems with completing the film. [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] wanted the release to tie in with the film's opening.

In this way the activities of young and student members remain formally independent from but closely engaged with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nYoung Liberals has had an active branch in Northern Ireland since 2010, under the name of Liberal Youth Northern Ireland, which operates as the youth branch of the Northern Ireland Liberal Democrats. Since 2014 it has become an official branch of Young Liberals, though for administrative purposes it is a branch of the English Young Liberals rather than a separate state branch. Liberal Youth Northern Ireland maintains a close working relationship with Alliance Youth, the youth wing of the Alliance Party.\n\n===Conferences===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe federal Conference is the sovereign body of the Young Liberals and has power to determine policy and direction. The federal Young Liberals usually hosts two conferences a year, a conference in the Winter and a training weekend known as 'Activate' in the Summer, which also acts as the constitutionally mandated Annual General Meeting. At conferences policy motions which shape YL policy and amendments to the organisations constitution are debated, alongside training and speaker sessions.\n\nIn addition, during each conference there is an Executive Scrutiny session, whereby members of the executive submit reports to conference on their activities and actions in their job. After each report motions on officers are debated, wherein any member can submit a Motion of commendation, Motion of censure or Motion of no confidence in an officer. Motions of commendation and censure are non-binding opinions of conference passed by a simple majority, expressing either positive or negative opinion on the actions of an officer. Motions of no confidence are binding motions which if passed have the effect of removing an officer from their position and require a two thirds majority in order to pass.\n\n====Conference Locations====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In Scotland, there was a separate Scottish Young Liberal Democrats (which also included students of all ages). Liberal Democrat Youth and Students was itself created in 1993 from a merger of the Student Liberal Democrats  and the Young Liberal Democrats of England who had shared many resources in the run-up.  The merger talks were overseen by a committee which included Sarah Gurling, who later married the late [[Charles Kennedy]]. LDYS reorganised into a federal structure in 2000 and then admitted Scottish Young Liberal Democrats as its Scottish federal unit in 2002 - forming a single GB-wide organisation for the first time since the combined ULS-NLYL committees of the 1970s.\n\n===List of former Chairs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!\n!

The Convenor of each of these groups organises the regional activity of Young Liberals.{{cn}}\n\n===Executive===\nThe federal organisation of Young Liberals organises liaisons with Liberal Democrats and affiliated organisations. The Federal Executive (current positions: Chair, Vice-Chair, Events Officer, Campaigns Officer, Communications Officer, Finance Officer, International Officer, Policy Officer, Membership Development Officer, Accessibility, Diversity and Standards Officer and Non Portfolio Officer,<ref name=exec>{{Cite web |url=http://www.youngliberqls.uk/exec | title = Meet The Exec | accessdate = 13 March 2018 }}</ref>) operates alongside committees for Conferences, Policy and International affairs. These committees, barring ''ex officio'' members such as representatives from state organisations and delegates from the executive, are elected by the Young Liberals membership via an all-member ballot, terms beginning on 1 November and are responsible to Conference. The English, Scottish and Welsh representatives are elected by the memberships of the state organisations - [[English Young Liberals]], [[Scottish Young Liberals]] and [[Welsh Young Liberals]].<ref name=libyouthconst>{{Cite web| url = http://www.liberalyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Constitution-Liberal-Youth-2011.pdf| title = The Federal Constitution &ndash; Liberal Youth| accessdate = 7 November 2011| format = pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111203115012/http://www.liberalyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Constitution-Liberal-Youth-2011.pdf| archive-date = 3 December 2011| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In this way the activities of young and student members remain formally independent from but closely engaged with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nYoung Liberals has had an active branch in Northern Ireland since 2010, under the name of Liberal Youth Northern Ireland, which operates as the youth branch of the Northern Ireland Liberal Democrats. Since 2014 it has become an official branch of Young Liberals, though for administrative purposes it is a branch of the English Young Liberals rather than a separate state branch. Liberal Youth Northern Ireland maintains a close working relationship with Alliance Youth, the youth wing of the Alliance Party.\n\n===Conferences===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe federal Conference is the sovereign body of the Young Liberals and has power to determine policy and direction. The federal Young Liberals usually hosts two conferences a year, a conference in the Winter and a training weekend known as 'Activate' in the Summer, which also acts as the constitutionally mandated Annual General Meeting. At conferences policy motions which shape YL policy and amendments to the organisations constitution are debated, alongside training and speaker sessions.\n\nIn addition, during each conference there is an Executive Scrutiny session, whereby members of the executive submit reports to conference on their activities and actions in their job. After each report motions on officers are debated, wherein any member can submit a Motion of commendation, Motion of censure or Motion of no confidence in an officer. Motions of commendation and censure are non-binding opinions of conference passed by a simple majority, expressing either positive or negative opinion on the actions of an officer. Motions of no confidence are binding motions which if passed have the effect of removing an officer from their position and require a two thirds majority in order to pass.\n\n====Conference Locations====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In Scotland, there was a separate Scottish Young Liberal Democrats (which also included students of all ages). Liberal Democrat Youth and Students was itself created in 1993 from a merger of the Student Liberal Democrats  and the Young Liberal Democrats of England who had shared many resources in the run-up.  The merger talks were overseen by a committee which included Sarah Gurling, who later married the late [[Charles Kennedy]]. LDYS reorganised into a federal structure in 2000 and then admitted Scottish Young Liberal Democrats as its Scottish federal unit in 2002 - forming a single GB-wide organisation for the first time since the combined ULS-NLYL committees of the 1970s.\n\n===List of former Chairs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!\n!

When the [[Indian National Congress]] had its first meeting in Bombay (Mumbai), two leaders from Rajahmundry, Nyapathi Subba Rao and Kandukuri Veeresalingam, participated in it. Subba Rao, founder of Hindu Samaj in Rajahmundry, was also one of the six founders of India's noted English daily, ''[[The Hindu]]''.\n\nThe Renaissance of Andhra Pradesh started in Rajahmundry. [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] is known as the Father of reforms in Andhra Pradesh. He started a monthly magazine Vivekavardhini, and a school for girls at [[Dowleswaram]] in 1874. The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in \"Pal Chowk\" (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). [[Annie Besant]] visited Rajahmundry twice. First, she came during the foundations of a branch of the Divya Gyan Samaj at Alcot Gardens were being laid. She came again during the opening ceremony.

The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in \"Pal Chowk\" (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). [[Annie Besant]] visited Rajahmundry twice.

In research conducted by the [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]] at [[Harvard University]] and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by CNN of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007: \"The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates\u2014by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. It's not that Democrats, other than Obama, fared well on CNN either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator\u2019s stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative. But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative, that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shorensteincenter.org/2007/10/the-invisible-primary-invisible-no-longer/ |title=The Invisible Primary \u2014 Invisible No Longer - Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy |publisher=Shorensteincenter.org |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>\nIn September 2009, a Pew Research Poll showed that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to rate the network favorably, and Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to see CNN unfavorably.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/business/media/14survey.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Trust in News Media Falls to New Low in Pew Survey | first=Richard | last=P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a | date=September 14, 2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Octavia Nasr firing===\nIn 2010, Chief [[Middle East]] correspondent [[Octavia Nasr]] was fired after a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying she was \"Sad to hear of the passing of Saved [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]]...

In research conducted by the [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]] at [[Harvard University]] and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by CNN of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007: \"The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates\u2014by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. It's not that Democrats, other than Obama, fared well on CNN either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator\u2019s stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative. But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative, that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shorensteincenter.org/2007/10/the-invisible-primary-invisible-no-longer/ |title=The Invisible Primary \u2014 Invisible No Longer - Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy |publisher=Shorensteincenter.org |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>\nIn September 2009, a Pew Research Poll showed that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to rate the network favorably, and Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to see CNN unfavorably.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/business/media/14survey.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Trust in News Media Falls to New Low in Pew Survey | first=Richard | last=P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a | date=September 14, 2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Octavia Nasr firing===\nIn 2010, Chief [[Middle East]] correspondent [[Octavia Nasr]] was fired after a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying she was \"Sad to hear of the passing of Saved [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]]...
