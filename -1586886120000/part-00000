He was born in [[St Andrews]], [[Fife]], the \"home of golf\" and location of the [[St Andrews Links]], and died there as well. [[Young Tom Morris]] (died 1875), also a golfer, was his son.\n\n==Early golf career==\nMorris was the son of a weaver, and was educated at [[Madras College]] in his home town. He began golf by age ten, by knocking wine-bottle corks pierced with nails (to serve as balls) around the streets of the town using a homemade club, in informal matches against other youths; this was known as 'sillybodkins'. He started [[caddying]] and playing golf from a young age, and formally was hired as an apprentice at age 14 to [[Allan Robertson]], generally regarded as the world's first professional golfer; Robertson ran the St Andrews Links and an equipment-making business. Morris served four years as apprentice and a further five years as [[journeyman]] under Robertson, by most accounts the world's top player from about 1843 until his death in 1859.\n\nFrom the early 1840s, Robertson often chose Morris as his partner in challenge matches, played by alternate shot format, which were the principal form of competition at that time. It was said the two never lost a team match played on even terms. The team became known as \"The Invincibles\". By the time Morris was in his early 20s he was the second-best player in St. Andrews, close to Robertson in golf skill, and won an informal match from him over the Old Course in 1843, but the two players rarely played seriously head-to-head. As Robertson's employee, Morris was in somewhat of an awkward position.<ref>''Tommy's Honor'', by Kevin Cook, Gotham Books, New York 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-59240-342-4}}, pp. 23\u201333</ref>\n\n==Moves to Prestwick==\nMorris worked under Robertson at St Andrews until 1851, when he was fired on the spot after being caught by Robertson playing the new [[guttie]] golf ball; Robertson had a profitable business making the featherie ball, which was threatened by the emergence of the guttie. Morris was then hired by [[Prestwick Golf Club]], which was just starting up. At Prestwick, he designed, laid out, and maintained the course, ran his own golf equipment business selling gutties and clubs, gave instruction to players, and ran events. He was influential in beginning [[The Open Championship]] in 1860, along with [[James Ogilvie Fairlie|James Fairlie]], and struck the very first shot in that event.\n\n==Return to St Andrews==\nMorris returned to St Andrews as [[greenskeeper]] and professional in 1865, at a then-generous salary of [[\u20a4]]50 per year. He was sought out by the Royal and Ancient, which formally passed a motion in 1864 calling for his rehiring. St Andrews was then in very poor condition, and his first task was to correct this. He did so by widening the fairways, enlarging the greens, applying greenkeeping techniques he had developed at Prestwick, building two new greens (on holes 1 and 18), and \"managing\" the hazards. He stayed in the post until 1903, a total of 39 years, and was kept on afterward by the R & A at full salary.<ref name=\"Tommy's Honor 2007\">''Tommy's Honor'', by Kevin Cook, New York 2005, Gotham Books</ref>\n\n==Competitive highlights==\nMorris worked as a greenkeeper, clubmaker, ballmaker, golf instructor, and [[golf course architect|course designer]], as well as playing match and tournament golf. He came second in the first [[The Open Championship|Open Championship]] in 1860, and won the following year. He followed this up with further victories in 1862, 1864 and 1867. He still holds the record as the oldest winner of The Open Championship at 46. Also, he was part of the only father/son couple being winner and runner-up.<ref name=\"lorrin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lorringolf.com/OldTomMorris.stm|title=Old Tom Morris|publisher=Lorrin Golf|accessdate=18 November 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080630093938/http://www.lorringolf.com/OldTomMorris.stm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nMorris held the record for the largest margin of victory in a major championship (13 strokes in the 1862 Open Championship), which stood until [[Tiger Woods]] won the 2000 [[U.S. Open (golf)|US Open]] by 15 strokes. He became the second player to break 80 over the Old Course, scoring 79; Robertson had been the first to do it. Once his son [[Young Tom Morris]] became an accomplished player in his own right by his mid-teens, in the mid-1860s, father and son formed a team for challenge matches, usually played by alternate shot (foursomes play), where they proved very successful. Their partnership, although not exclusive, would continue until the death of Young Tom in 1875.<ref name=\"Tommy's Honor 2007\"/>\n\n==Golf course design, greenkeeping innovations==\nMorris played a role in designing courses across the British Isles. He began by assisting Robertson lay out ten holes at [[Carnoustie]] in 1842. His subsequent work included [[Kingussie Golf Club]] in 1895, Kinghorn Golf Club in 1887, Kirkcaldy Golf Club Nov 1904 9- holes then May 1906 18 holes, [[Prestwick Golf Club|Prestwick]], [[Muirfield (Scotland)|Muirfield]], [[Machrihanish]], the Jubilee Course at St Andrews, [[Balcomie]] at Crail, [[Moray Golf Club|Moray]], Bridge of Allan Golf Club, [[Askernish]] in [[South Uist]], [[Lahinch Golf Club|Lahinch]] and [[Downings|Rosapenna]] in Ireland, [[Warkworth, Northumberland|Warkworth]], Wallasey and [[Royal North Devon Golf Club]] (Westward Ho!) in England, King Edward Bay Golf Club in the [[Isle of Man]] and the Castletown Golf Club in the Isle of Man.<ref name=\"uscot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/m/oldtommorris.html|title=Old Tom Morris|publisher=Undiscovered Scotland|accessdate=18 November 2007}}</ref> \t[http://www.glasgowgolfclub.com Glasgow Golf Club\u2019s] Killermont course was his last 18 hole design, opening in 1904, just four years before his death.\n\n[[File:The grave of Old Tom Morris, St Andrews Cathedral churchyard.JPG|thumb|300px|The simple grave of Old Tom Morris, St Andrews Cathedral churchyard]]\n\nMorris was also the father of modern greenkeeping. He introduced the concept of top-dressing greens with sand, which significantly helped turf growth. He introduced many novel ideas on turf and course management, including actively managing hazards (in the past, bunkers and the like were largely left to their own devices, becoming truly \"hazardous\") and yardage markers. He was the first to use a push mower to cut greens. He improved play at St Andrews by widening fairways to handle increased play, improving greens, and establishing separate teeing areas on each hole; all of these measures spread out play over larger areas, and led to better turf conditions. He created a new first green on the Old Course, and was responsible for the initial design of the New Course 1895 and Jubilee course in 1897. He also introduced the modern idea of placing hazards so that the golf ball could be routed around them; this was the beginning of strategic design, which has dominated golf course design ever since. Before his time hazards were thought of as obstacles that either had to be carried or were there to punish a wayward ball.<ref name=\"uscot\"/> When he was 77 he was nearly beaten by [[Rhona Adair]] at [[St Andrews Links]]. Adair who was one of the leading women players. He is quoted as having said \"I'll no' be licked by a lassie\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/old-tom-had-plenty-to-be-worried-about-1.314610 |title=Old Tom had plenty to be worried about |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=23 June 2001 |first=Dermot |last=Gilleece |access-date=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nMorris kept working right up until his death, just before his 87th birthday. He died after falling down a flight of stairs in the clubhouse of the New Golf Club in St Andrews.\n\nHe is buried against the eastern wall of the churchyard of [[St Andrews Cathedral|St Andrew's Cathedral]]. The grave is simple but stands beneath the highly notable monument to his son, Young Tom Morris, which carries a bronze statue of the golfer in high relief against a white background, and is visible across the breadth of the churchyard. His grave attracts thousands of golfers each year who wish to pay homage to this golfing hero.\n\n==Major championships==\n[[Image:Old Tom Morris 1880.jpg|thumb|Old Tom Morris in 1880]]\n\n===Wins (4)===\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Year!!Championship!!24 holes!!Winning score!!Margin!!Runner-up\n|-style=\"background:#ABCDEF;\"\n| align=center|[[1861 Open Championship|1861]] ||[[The Open Championship]] ||2 shot deficit || 54-56-53=163 ||4 strokes||{{flagicon|SCO}} [[Willie Park, Sr.]]\n|-style=\"background:#ABCDEF;\"\n| align=center|[[1862 Open Championship|1862]] ||The Open Championship <small> (2)</small> ||11 shot lead || 52-55-56=163 ||13 strokes ||{{flagicon|SCO}} [[Willie Park, Sr.]]\n|-style=\"background:#ABCDEF;\"\n| align=center|[[1864 Open Championship|1864]] ||The Open Championship <small> (3)</small> ||1 shot lead || 54-58-55=167 ||2 strokes ||{{flagicon|SCO}} [[Andrew Strath]]\n|-style=\"background:#ABCDEF;\"\n| align=center|[[1867 Open Championship|1867]] ||The Open Championship <small> (4)</small> ||2 shot lead || 58-54-58=170 ||2 strokes||{{flagicon|SCO}} [[Willie Park, Sr.]]\n|}\n\n===Results timeline===\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n!align=\"left\"|Tournament\n!1860\n!1861\n!1862\n!1863\n!1864\n!1865\n!1866\n!1867\n!1868\n!1869\n|-\n|[[The Open Championship]]\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|2\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:lime;\"|'''1'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:lime;\"|'''1'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|2\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:lime;\"|'''1'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|5\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|4\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:lime;\"|'''1'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|2\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|6\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n!align=\"left\"|Tournament\n!1870\n!1871\n!1872\n!1873\n!1874\n!1875\n!1876\n!1877\n!1878\n!1879\n|-\n|[[The Open Championship]]\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|4\n|align=\"center\"|NT\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T4\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|7\n|align=\"center\"|T18\n|align=\"center\"|DNP\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T4\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T8\n|align=\"center\"|11\n|align=\"center\"|T14\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n!align=\"left\"|Tournament\n!1880\n!1881\n!1882\n!1883\n!1884\n!1885\n!1886\n!1887\n!1888\n!1889\n|-\n|[[The Open Championship]]\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|10\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T5\n|align=\"center\"|DNP\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T10\n|align=\"center\"|T13\n|align=\"center\"|T29\n|align=\"center\"|T27\n|align=\"center\"|T28\n|align=\"center\"|T27\n|align=\"center\"|T15\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n!align=\"left\"|Tournament\n!1890\n!1891\n!1892\n!1893\n!1894\n!1895\n!1896\n|-\n|[[The Open Championship]]\n|align=\"center\"|WD\n|align=\"center\"|T58\n|align=\"center\"|50\n|align=\"center\"|52\n|align=\"center\"|WD\n|align=\"center\"|47\n|align=\"center\"|WD\n|}\n\nNT = No tournament<br>\nDNP = Did not play<br>\nWD = Withdrew<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place<br>\nGreen background for wins.

He was born in [[St Andrews]], [[Fife]], the \"home of golf\" and location of the [[St Andrews Links]], and died there as well. [[Young Tom Morris]] (died 1875), also a golfer, was his son.\n\n==Early golf career==\nMorris was the son of a weaver, and was educated at [[Madras College]] in his home town. He began golf by age ten, by knocking wine-bottle corks pierced with nails (to serve as balls) around the streets of the town using a homemade club, in informal matches against other youths; this was known as 'sillybodkins'. He started [[caddying]] and playing golf from a young age, and formally was hired as an apprentice at age 14 to [[Allan Robertson]], generally regarded as the world's first professional golfer; Robertson ran the St Andrews Links and an equipment-making business. Morris served four years as apprentice and a further five years as [[journeyman]] under Robertson, by most accounts the world's top player from about 1843 until his death in 1859.\n\nFrom the early 1840s, Robertson often chose Morris as his partner in challenge matches, played by alternate shot format, which were the principal form of competition at that time. It was said the two never lost a team match played on even terms. The team became known as \"The Invincibles\". By the time Morris was in his early 20s he was the second-best player in St. Andrews, close to Robertson in golf skill, and won an informal match from him over the Old Course in 1843, but the two players rarely played seriously head-to-head. As Robertson's employee, Morris was in somewhat of an awkward position.<ref>''Tommy's Honor'', by Kevin Cook, Gotham Books, New York 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-59240-342-4}}, pp. 23\u201333</ref>\n\n==Moves to Prestwick==\nMorris worked under Robertson at St Andrews until 1851, when he was fired on the spot after being caught by Robertson playing the new [[guttie]] golf ball; Robertson had a profitable business making the featherie ball, which was threatened by the emergence of the guttie. Morris was then hired by [[Prestwick Golf Club]], which was just starting up. At Prestwick, he designed, laid out, and maintained the course, ran his own golf equipment business selling gutties and clubs, gave instruction to players, and ran events. He was influential in beginning [[The Open Championship]] in 1860, along with [[James Ogilvie Fairlie|James Fairlie]], and struck the very first shot in that event.\n\n==Return to St Andrews==\nMorris returned to St Andrews as [[greenskeeper]] and professional in 1865, at a then-generous salary of [[\u20a4]]50 per year. He was sought out by the Royal and Ancient, which formally passed a motion in 1864 calling for his rehiring. St Andrews was then in very poor condition, and his first task was to correct this. He did so by widening the fairways, enlarging the greens, applying greenkeeping techniques he had developed at Prestwick, building two new greens (on holes 1 and 18), and \"managing\" the hazards. He stayed in the post until 1903, a total of 39 years, and was kept on afterward by the R & A at full salary.<ref name=\"Tommy's Honor 2007\">''Tommy's Honor'', by Kevin Cook, New York 2005, Gotham Books</ref>\n\n==Competitive highlights==\nMorris worked as a greenkeeper, clubmaker, ballmaker, golf instructor, and [[golf course architect|course designer]], as well as playing match and tournament golf. He came second in the first [[The Open Championship|Open Championship]] in 1860, and won the following year. He followed this up with further victories in 1862, 1864 and 1867. He still holds the record as the oldest winner of The Open Championship at 46. Also, he was part of the only father/son couple being winner and runner-up.<ref name=\"lorrin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lorringolf.com/OldTomMorris.stm|title=Old Tom Morris|publisher=Lorrin Golf|accessdate=18 November 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080630093938/http://www.lorringolf.com/OldTomMorris.stm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nMorris held the record for the largest margin of victory in a major championship (13 strokes in the 1862 Open Championship), which stood until [[Tiger Woods]] won the 2000 [[U.S. Open (golf)|US Open]] by 15 strokes. He became the second player to break 80 over the Old Course, scoring 79; Robertson had been the first to do it. Once his son [[Young Tom Morris]] became an accomplished player in his own right by his mid-teens, in the mid-1860s, father and son formed a team for challenge matches, usually played by alternate shot (foursomes play), where they proved very successful. Their partnership, although not exclusive, would continue until the death of Young Tom in 1875.<ref name=\"Tommy's Honor 2007\"/>\n\n==Golf course design, greenkeeping innovations==\nMorris played a role in designing courses across the British Isles. He began by assisting Robertson lay out ten holes at [[Carnoustie]] in 1842. His subsequent work included [[Kingussie Golf Club]] in 1895, Kinghorn Golf Club in 1887, Kirkcaldy Golf Club Nov 1904 9- holes then May 1906 18 holes, [[Prestwick Golf Club|Prestwick]], [[Muirfield (Scotland)|Muirfield]], [[Machrihanish]], the Jubilee Course at St Andrews, [[Balcomie]] at Crail, [[Moray Golf Club|Moray]], Bridge of Allan Golf Club, [[Askernish]] in [[South Uist]], [[Lahinch Golf Club|Lahinch]] and [[Downings|Rosapenna]] in Ireland, [[Warkworth, Northumberland|Warkworth]], Wallasey and [[Royal North Devon Golf Club]] (Westward Ho!) in England, King Edward Bay Golf Club in the [[Isle of Man]] and the Castletown Golf Club in the Isle of Man.<ref name=\"uscot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/m/oldtommorris.html|title=Old Tom Morris|publisher=Undiscovered Scotland|accessdate=18 November 2007}}</ref> \t[http://www.glasgowgolfclub.com Glasgow Golf Club\u2019s] Killermont course was his last 18 hole design, opening in 1904, just four years before his death.\n\n[[File:The grave of Old Tom Morris, St Andrews Cathedral churchyard.JPG|thumb|300px|The simple grave of Old Tom Morris, St Andrews Cathedral churchyard]]\n\nMorris was also the father of modern greenkeeping. He introduced the concept of top-dressing greens with sand, which significantly helped turf growth. He introduced many novel ideas on turf and course management, including actively managing hazards (in the past, bunkers and the like were largely left to their own devices, becoming truly \"hazardous\") and yardage markers. He was the first to use a push mower to cut greens. He improved play at St Andrews by widening fairways to handle increased play, improving greens, and establishing separate teeing areas on each hole; all of these measures spread out play over larger areas, and led to better turf conditions. He created a new first green on the Old Course, and was responsible for the initial design of the New Course 1895 and Jubilee course in 1897. He also introduced the modern idea of placing hazards so that the golf ball could be routed around them; this was the beginning of strategic design, which has dominated golf course design ever since. Before his time hazards were thought of as obstacles that either had to be carried or were there to punish a wayward ball.<ref name=\"uscot\"/> When he was 77 he was nearly beaten by [[Rhona Adair]] at [[St Andrews Links]]. Adair who was one of the leading women players. He is quoted as having said \"I'll no' be licked by a lassie\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/old-tom-had-plenty-to-be-worried-about-1.314610 |title=Old Tom had plenty to be worried about |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=23 June 2001 |first=Dermot |last=Gilleece |access-date=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nMorris kept working right up until his death, just before his 87th birthday. He died after falling down a flight of stairs in the clubhouse of the New Golf Club in St Andrews.\n\nHe is buried against the eastern wall of the churchyard of [[St Andrews Cathedral|St Andrew's Cathedral]]. The grave is simple but stands beneath the highly notable monument to his son, Young Tom Morris, which carries a bronze statue of the golfer in high relief against a white background, and is visible across the breadth of the churchyard. His grave attracts thousands of golfers each year who wish to pay homage to this golfing hero.\n\n==Major championships==\n[[Image:Old Tom Morris 1880.jpg|thumb|Old Tom Morris in 1880]]\n\n===Wins (4)===\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Year!!Championship!!24 holes!!Winning score!!Margin!!Runner-up\n|-style=\"background:#ABCDEF;\"\n| align=center|[[1861 Open Championship|1861]] ||[[The Open Championship]] ||2 shot deficit || 54-56-53=163 ||4 strokes||{{flagicon|SCO}} [[Willie Park, Sr.]]\n|-style=\"background:#ABCDEF;\"\n| align=center|[[1862 Open Championship|1862]] ||The Open Championship <small> (2)</small> ||11 shot lead || 52-55-56=163 ||13 strokes ||{{flagicon|SCO}} [[Willie Park, Sr.]]\n|-style=\"background:#ABCDEF;\"\n| align=center|[[1864 Open Championship|1864]] ||The Open Championship <small> (3)</small> ||1 shot lead || 54-58-55=167 ||2 strokes ||{{flagicon|SCO}} [[Andrew Strath]]\n|-style=\"background:#ABCDEF;\"\n| align=center|[[1867 Open Championship|1867]] ||The Open Championship <small> (4)</small> ||2 shot lead || 58-54-58=170 ||2 strokes||{{flagicon|SCO}} [[Willie Park, Sr.]]\n|}\n\n===Results timeline===\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n!align=\"left\"|Tournament\n!1860\n!1861\n!1862\n!1863\n!1864\n!1865\n!1866\n!1867\n!1868\n!1869\n|-\n|[[The Open Championship]]\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|2\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:lime;\"|'''1'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:lime;\"|'''1'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|2\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:lime;\"|'''1'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|5\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|4\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:lime;\"|'''1'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|2\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|6\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n!align=\"left\"|Tournament\n!1870\n!1871\n!1872\n!1873\n!1874\n!1875\n!1876\n!1877\n!1878\n!1879\n|-\n|[[The Open Championship]]\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|4\n|align=\"center\"|NT\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T4\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|7\n|align=\"center\"|T18\n|align=\"center\"|DNP\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T4\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T8\n|align=\"center\"|11\n|align=\"center\"|T14\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n!align=\"left\"|Tournament\n!1880\n!1881\n!1882\n!1883\n!1884\n!1885\n!1886\n!1887\n!1888\n!1889\n|-\n|[[The Open Championship]]\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|10\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T5\n|align=\"center\"|DNP\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:yellow;\"|T10\n|align=\"center\"|T13\n|align=\"center\"|T29\n|align=\"center\"|T27\n|align=\"center\"|T28\n|align=\"center\"|T27\n|align=\"center\"|T15\n|-\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n!align=\"left\"|Tournament\n!1890\n!1891\n!1892\n!1893\n!1894\n!1895\n!1896\n|-\n|[[The Open Championship]]\n|align=\"center\"|WD\n|align=\"center\"|T58\n|align=\"center\"|50\n|align=\"center\"|52\n|align=\"center\"|WD\n|align=\"center\"|47\n|align=\"center\"|WD\n|}\n\nNT = No tournament<br>\nDNP = Did not play<br>\nWD = Withdrew<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place<br>\nGreen background for wins.

He chaired the geology department at [[Oberlin College]] later serving as its provost and president. Powell also served as president of [[Franklin & Marshall College]] as well as [[Reed College]]. Following his positions in higher education, Powell presided over the [[Franklin Institute]] and the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Natural History Museum of Los Angeles]].\n\nPowell served 12 years on the [[National Science Board]] and is currently the executive director of [http://www.stemfellowships.org Graduate Fellowships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Diversity]. \n\nHis book, ''Night Comes to the Cretaceous'', explores the scientific debate regarding [[dinosaur extinction]]. In ''Four Revolutions in the Earth Sciences'', Powell addresses dinosaur extinction in addition to three other scientific debates: [[deep time]], [[continental drift]] and [[global warming]].\n\nPowell has posited that the scientific consensus on [[global warming]] nears universality and he actively counters [[climate change denialism]] in his research and other publications.\n\n== Education ==\nPowell earned a BA degree in 1958 from [[Berea College]], a private liberal arts college located in Powell's home town of [[Berea, Kentucky]]. Powell then received a PhD in [[Geochemistry]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1962.{{R|\"AMWS\"}}\n\n== Career ==\nPowell began his career at [[Oberlin College]] in 1962 where he held the position of chair of the geology department from 1965 to 1973. He became the associate dean of arts and science in 1973, then vice president and provost in 1975.{{R|\"AMWS\"}} After serving two years as a visiting administrator at [[Stanford University]], Powell returned to Oberlin to serve as its acting president from 1981 to 1983.{{R|\"OberlinArchive\"}}\n\nFollowing a 20-year career at Oberlin, Powell served as president of [[Franklin and Marshall College]] from 1983 to 1988,{{R|\"FandM\"}} then president of [[Reed College]] from 1988 to 1991.{{R|\"Reed\"}} Powell left academia to preside over the [[Franklin Institute]] (1991-1994){{R|\"FranklinInstitute\"}} followed by the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|National History Museum of Los Angeles]] (1994-2001).{{R|\"NHMLA\"}} Since 2001, Powell has been serving as the executive director of the [[National Physical Science Consortium]].{{R|\"Reed\"}}{{R|\"PowellBio\"}}\n\nPowell served 12 years on the [[National Science Board]] first appointed by [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986 and serving as its vice chair in 1990.{{R|\"NSF\"}}\n\nIn 2015, Powell was named a fellow for the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].{{R|\"CSI\"}}\n\n== Debate on Climate Change Consensus ==\n\n[[File:The Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming, 2017.jpg|thumb|Peer-reviewed studies of the consensus on anthropogenic global warming]]\n\nPowell has researched the scientific consensus view of anthropogenic [[global warming]] (AGW) in a series of studies evaluating the peer-reviewed literature. In 2012, Powell reviewed 13,950 peer-reviewed publications between 1991 and 2012 with \"global warming\u201d or \u201cglobal climate change\" as keywords. Evaluating this dataset, Powell showed a 99.97% scientific consensus view supporting AGW.{{R|\"Plait\"|\"Sheppard\"}} In 2016, Powell duplicated this method on articles published during 2013 and 2014. In this set, Powell found a 99.99% consensus \"verging on unanimity\" by the scientific community.{{R|\"BSTS1\"}}\n\nWhile agreeing that the consensus on AGW is high, other scientists have argued that the consensus is closer to 97%.{{R|\"Cook\"}} {{R|\"PNAS\"}} The debate centers around the selection of scientific papers identified as supporting AGW and therefore included in the study.{{R|\"Skuce\"}} For example, in their 2013 study, Cook et al. excluded 66.4% of the papers examined because the abstracts did not endorse AGW either explicitly or implicitly.{{R|\"Cook\"}} Powell reviewed the abstracts of hundreds of articles on plate tectonics, evolution, and impact cratering to show that scientists almost never directly affirm the ruling paradigm of their discipline. On that basis, Powell included papers in the study as long as the abstracts did not explicitly reject AGW.{{R|\"BSTS1\"}}\n\nPowell has further argued that the extent of the scientific consensus is important. In ''The Consensus on Anthropogenic Warming Matters'' Powell argues that the \"stronger the public believe the consensus to be, the more they support the action on global warming that human society so desperately needs.\" This metastudy included 54,195 publications from five earlier studies by Powell and others demonstrating that the scientific consensus on AGW is 99.94%.{{R|\"BSTS2\"}}\n\nIn November 2019, Powell published \"Scientists Reach 100% Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming.\"<ref>  Powell, J. (2019). Scientists Reach 100% Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming. Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society. https://doi.org/10.1177/0270467619886266\n\n</ref> He reviewed over 11,600 peer-reviewed articles published in the first seven months of 2019 but found none that rejected anthropogenic global warming. \n\n== Views and Scientific Activism ==\nPowell has encouraged scientists to do more than publish in scientific journals. \"I think it\u2019s time for scientists to get up from the lab bench and speak out.\" Concerning the consequences of global warming, Powell said: \"I want my grandchildren to be able to say... he did something. He tried to do something.\"{{R|\"BigThink\"}}\n\nThere is no scientific debate regarding the existence of AGW according to Powell. Through his research and other publications Powell has criticized politicians and others who defy the scientific consensus by denying AGW. {{R|\"BigThink\"}}{{R|\"BSTS1\"}}{{R|\"Salon\"}}\n\nIn a 2014 editorial, Powell urged the university presidents of [[Brown University]] and [[Harvard University]] to change course by divesting their institutions from fossil fuels.{{R|\"Harvard\"}} A [[The New York Times|New York Times]] editorial co-authored by Powell and [[Michael E. Mann]] recommended that the [[American Museum of Natural History]] remove [[Rebekah Mercer]] from their board as her family foundation supported [[climate change denialism]].{{R|\"Mercer\"}}\n\n== Recognition ==\nPowell is the recipient of several honorary degrees. [[Oberlin College]] awarded Powell an honorary doctorate of science in 1983. The [[Tohoku Gakuin University]] of Japan honored Powell with a Doctor of Humane Letters in 1986. [[Beaver College]] and [[Berea College]] (his alma matter) have also honored Powell with honorary degrees.{{R|\"AMWS\"}}{{R|\"BereaDegree\"}}\n\nThe minor planet, [[9739 Powell]], discovered by [[Carolyn Shoemaker]], was named for Powell in 1987.{{R|\"planet\"}}\n\n== Books ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=2RptQgAACAAJ&dq=Night+Comes+to+the+Cretaceous:+Dinosaur+Extinction+and+the+Transformation+of+Modern+Geology&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjt-Pznjq_gAhUKIjQIHcVNCLwQ6AEIKTAA Night Comes to the Cretaceous: Dinosaur Extinction and the Transformation of Modern Geology], W.H.

He chaired the geology department at [[Oberlin College]] later serving as its provost and president. Powell also served as president of [[Franklin & Marshall College]] as well as [[Reed College]]. Following his positions in higher education, Powell presided over the [[Franklin Institute]] and the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Natural History Museum of Los Angeles]].\n\nPowell served 12 years on the [[National Science Board]] and is currently the executive director of the [[National Physical Science Consortium]].\n\nHis book, ''Night Comes to the Cretaceous'', explores the scientific debate regarding [[dinosaur extinction]]. In ''Four Revolutions in the Earth Sciences'', Powell addresses dinosaur extinction in addition to three other scientific debates: [[deep time]], [[continental drift]] and [[global warming]].\n\nPowell has posited that the scientific consensus on [[global warming]] nears universality and he actively counters [[climate change denialism]] in his research and other publications.\n\n== Education ==\nPowell earned a BA degree in 1958 from [[Berea College]], a private liberal arts college located in Powell's home town of [[Berea, Kentucky]]. Powell then received a PhD in [[Geochemistry]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1962.{{R|\"AMWS\"}}\n\n== Career ==\nPowell began his career at [[Oberlin College]] in 1962 where he held the position of chair of the geology department from 1965 to 1973. He became the associate dean of arts and science in 1973, then vice president and provost in 1975.{{R|\"AMWS\"}} After serving two years as a visiting administrator at [[Stanford University]], Powell returned to Oberlin to serve as its acting president from 1981 to 1983.{{R|\"OberlinArchive\"}}\n\nFollowing a 20-year career at Oberlin, Powell served as president of [[Franklin and Marshall College]] from 1983 to 1988,{{R|\"FandM\"}} then president of [[Reed College]] from 1988 to 1991.{{R|\"Reed\"}} Powell left academia to preside over the [[Franklin Institute]] (1991-1994){{R|\"FranklinInstitute\"}} followed by the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|National History Museum of Los Angeles]] (1994-2001).{{R|\"NHMLA\"}} Since 2001, Powell has been serving as the executive director of the [[National Physical Science Consortium]].{{R|\"Reed\"}}{{R|\"PowellBio\"}}\n\nPowell served 12 years on the [[National Science Board]] first appointed by [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986 and serving as its vice chair in 1990.{{R|\"NSF\"}}\n\nIn 2015, Powell was named a fellow for the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].{{R|\"CSI\"}}\n\n== Debate on Climate Change Consensus ==\n\n[[File:The Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming, 2017.jpg|thumb|Peer-reviewed studies of the consensus on anthropogenic global warming]]\n\nPowell has researched the scientific consensus view of anthropogenic [[global warming]] (AGW) in a series of studies evaluating the peer-reviewed literature. In 2012, Powell reviewed 13,950 peer-reviewed publications between 1991 and 2012 with \"global warming\u201d or \u201cglobal climate change\" as keywords. Evaluating this dataset, Powell showed a 99.97% scientific consensus view supporting AGW.{{R|\"Plait\"|\"Sheppard\"}} In 2016, Powell duplicated this method on articles published during 2013 and 2014. In this set, Powell found a 99.99% consensus \"verging on unanimity\" by the scientific community.{{R|\"BSTS1\"}}\n\nWhile agreeing that the consensus on AGW is high, other scientists have argued that the consensus is closer to 97%.{{R|\"Cook\"}} {{R|\"PNAS\"}} The debate centers around the selection of scientific papers identified as supporting AGW and therefore included in the study.{{R|\"Skuce\"}} For example, in their 2013 study, Cook et al. excluded 66.4% of the papers examined because the abstracts did not endorse AGW either explicitly or implicitly.{{R|\"Cook\"}} Powell reviewed the abstracts of hundreds of articles on plate tectonics, evolution, and impact cratering to show that scientists almost never directly affirm the ruling paradigm of their discipline. On that basis, Powell included papers in the study as long as the abstracts did not explicitly reject AGW.{{R|\"BSTS1\"}}\n\nPowell has further argued that the extent of the scientific consensus is important. In ''The Consensus on Anthropogenic Warming Matters'' Powell argues that the \"stronger the public believe the consensus to be, the more they support the action on global warming that human society so desperately needs.\" This metastudy included 54,195 publications from five earlier studies by Powell and others demonstrating that the scientific consensus on AGW is 99.94%.{{R|\"BSTS2\"}}\n\nIn November 2019, Powell published \"Scientists Reach 100% Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming.\"<ref>  Powell, J. (2019). Scientists Reach 100% Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming. Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society. https://doi.org/10.1177/0270467619886266\n\n</ref> He reviewed over 11,600 peer-reviewed articles published in the first seven months of 2019 but found none that rejected anthropogenic global warming. \n\n== Views and Scientific Activism ==\nPowell has encouraged scientists to do more than publish in scientific journals. \"I think it\u2019s time for scientists to get up from the lab bench and speak out.\" Concerning the consequences of global warming, Powell said: \"I want my grandchildren to be able to say... he did something. He tried to do something.\"{{R|\"BigThink\"}}\n\nThere is no scientific debate regarding the existence of AGW according to Powell. Through his research and other publications Powell has criticized politicians and others who defy the scientific consensus by denying AGW. {{R|\"BigThink\"}}{{R|\"BSTS1\"}}{{R|\"Salon\"}}\n\nIn a 2014 editorial, Powell urged the university presidents of [[Brown University]] and [[Harvard University]] to change course by divesting their institutions from fossil fuels.{{R|\"Harvard\"}} A [[The New York Times|New York Times]] editorial co-authored by Powell and [[Michael E. Mann]] recommended that the [[American Museum of Natural History]] remove [[Rebekah Mercer]] from their board as her family foundation supported [[climate change denialism]].{{R|\"Mercer\"}}\n\n== Recognition ==\nPowell is the recipient of several honorary degrees. [[Oberlin College]] awarded Powell an honorary doctorate of science in 1983. The [[Tohoku Gakuin University]] of Japan honored Powell with a Doctor of Humane Letters in 1986. [[Beaver College]] and [[Berea College]] (his alma matter) have also honored Powell with honorary degrees.{{R|\"AMWS\"}}{{R|\"BereaDegree\"}}\n\nThe minor planet, [[9739 Powell]], discovered by [[Carolyn Shoemaker]], was named for Powell in 1987.{{R|\"planet\"}}\n\n== Books ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=2RptQgAACAAJ&dq=Night+Comes+to+the+Cretaceous:+Dinosaur+Extinction+and+the+Transformation+of+Modern+Geology&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjt-Pznjq_gAhUKIjQIHcVNCLwQ6AEIKTAA Night Comes to the Cretaceous: Dinosaur Extinction and the Transformation of Modern Geology], W.H.
