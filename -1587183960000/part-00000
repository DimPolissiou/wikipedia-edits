It is in the north of Mumbai City and is governed by the [[Mira-Bhayandar]] Municipal Corporation (MBMC).It was once Asia's largest steel utensils manufacturer. It is also a [[Bhayandar railway station|railway station]] on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]].The city is Just 5.6 KM away from [[Ghodbunder Fort]] and port which was once major port of India for Arabian Horse Imports. The city is the major Tourist gateway for [[Global Vipassana Pagoda]] which is 14.8 Km south of the city and to Essle world and Water Kingdom[https://www.esselworld.in/] which is Asia's Biggest Amusement Park.The city has a plenty of Hotels and Temples.The city has a majority of Population of Hindus followed by Jain's and the Muslims.The city also has 2 public Library and well designed Study Hubs.Bhayander is well connected to rest of Mumbai by railways ([[Mumbai Suburban Railway]]) and Roadways.The current Mayor of Bhayander is [[Geeta Bharat Jain]].\n\nIt is in the north of Mumbai City 8 km away and is governed by the [[Mira-Bhayandar]] Municipal Corporation (MBMC). It is also a [[Bhayandar railway station|railway station]] on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]].\n\nLike all railway stations on Mumbai suburban railway, Bhayandar is divided into two parts by the rail line: East and West. The West was traditionally residential, and the East was predominantly an industrial area. Another distinct distribution between East and West Bhayandar is the food. East will provide you a huge range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes whereas West region offers predominantly vegetarian food. Recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between Bhayandar and neighboring Mira Road on the east side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous suburb. Government-owned [[Salt pan (evaporation)|salt pans]] and [[marshland]] in West Mira Road have restricted the southward spread of Bhayandar. There is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a gargantuan industrial complex.\n\nThe east Indian villages in Bhayandar are Murdha, Rai,Morva, Dongri, Uttan, Pali Chowk, Tarodi, etc. They were formed by Portuguese travelers when [[Vasai]] (formerly Bassein) was a famous port. One route for \"Essel World\" is via Gorai, one of the villages close to Bhayandar. [[Gorai]] is popular for its beach and nearby Manori beach and is a popular weekend getaway for Bhayandar residents. It also is a great place for meditators who visit the Pagoda. In the 1970s Bhayandar was a village before the builders converted the fertile farming land into a concrete jungle.\n\nThe MBMC's (Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation) main office is in Bhayandar (West). Departments like Property Tax, Octroi, Transportation, Health, Ambulance for Emergency, Library, Water, Education, Birth-Death Registration, Tree, Advertising Fee, Animals, Public Construction, City Development, Accounts, etc. are a part of the MBMC's suite.\n\nThe recent success of real estate in Mumbai has helped Bhayandar become one of the populated stations on the Western railway circuit. There are trains starting and ending at this station; this shows the growth of Bhayandar in the last decade. Nowadays Mira Bhayandar Municipal Transport (MBMT) bus service are provided which runs in the Mira - Bhayandar city. Mahanagar Gas (MGL) pipeline service is available. Tata Power as well as Reliance Energy has 24-hour electric supply. Multiplex and hyper market called Maxus Mall which includes a six-screen multiplex and [[Big Bazaar]]. D-Mart and Sahakari Bhandar have made a mark in the city. Bhayandar has witnessed hike in property rates in a short time and have shown that Bhayandar is coming up as an important destination. The famous residential landmarks are Chandan Park, Jesal Park, Sarvoday Paradise, Golden Nest, Indralok in the East side.\n\nThere are many hotels in Bhayandar. One of the best is the Veg Sagar near flyover end, Bhayandar west. There are many playing grounds for children such as Netaji SubhashChandra Bose Ground, Agarwal and Maxus cricket ground and morva bhati ground.\n\nMost recent development has been noticed with regards to hospitals having world class facilities for all.One of them being MIrabhayandar Institute for Reproductive Assistance (MIRA) providing fertility clinic and total woman care.\n\n==Mira Bhayander Sports Complex==\nFirst-ever sports complex in Mira Bhayander which gives sports enthusiasts a great platform to the participants to show their talent and chase their passion of sports with the help of professional coaches and live their dreams.\n==Schools==\n[[File:Bhayandar stationboard.jpg|alt=Bhayander Railway station - one of the busiest railway station in Western Suburban Railways.|thumb|Bhayandar Railway Station]]\n\n*ST.Xavier's High school (SSC)\n*Mother Mary English High School (SSC)\n*RBK International School (IGCSE)\n*Our Lady Of Nazareth High school and Jr. College (SSC)\n*Sardar Vallabhai Patel vidyalaya (SSC)\n*St. Francis High School\n*RBK Global School (CBSE) \n*Mother Teresa High school\n*D'silva High School (SSC)\n*St. Soldier Public School\n*St  Aloysius English  High School\n*Tapovan Vidhyalay CBSE School\n*S.L.

In 1762, after losing the [[French and Indian War]] to Great Britain, France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. In 1763 France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain.\n\nIt regained the western territory under [[Napoleon]], who sold it in 1803 to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. He had decided to get rid of the New World territories after failing to regain control of [[Saint-Domingue]], where a slave rebellion had toppled colonial control. In 1804 [[Haiti]] declared independence as the second republic of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Plains Indians retained control of much of their territory until the late 19th century, giving way finally before superior United States arms and technology. Their territories were invaded by settlers, and crossed by the development of improved routes for settlers' emigrant wagon trains to the West Coast, followed by more permanent construction of transcontinental railroads. These brought tens of thousands of settlers to the Plains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized; and in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].  '''Ellsworth County''' was established February 26, 1867.  The county was named after the old [[Fort Ellsworth]], named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Allen Ellsworth of the 7th Iowa Cavalry (Company H), who supervised construction of the fort in 1864 during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The fort was subsequently moved to a new site about one mile to the northeast, and the old fort's remaining buildings were ordered torn down in June 1867.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nOn March 22, 1869, Fourteen [[Pawnee people|Pawnee Indians]], including scouts who had been honorably discharged after working for the army, were traveling through Ellsworth County when they ran into U.S. cavalry troops.

In 1762, after losing the [[French and Indian War]] to Great Britain, France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. In 1763 France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain.\n\nIt regained the western territory under [[Napoleon]], who sold it in 1803 to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. He had decided to get rid of the New World territories after failing to regain control of [[Saint-Domingue]], where a slave rebellion had toppled colonial control. In 1804 [[Haiti]] declared independence as the second republic of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Plains Indians retained control of much of their territory until the late 19th century, giving way finally before superior United States arms and technology. Their territories were invaded by settlers, and crossed by the development of improved routes for settlers' emigrant wagon trains to the West Coast, followed by more permanent construction of transcontinental railroads. These brought tens of thousands of settlers to the Plains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized; and in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].  '''Ellsworth County''' was established February 26, 1867.  The county was named after the old [[Fort Ellsworth]], named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Allen Ellsworth of the 7th Iowa Cavalry (Company H), who supervised construction of the fort in 1864 during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The fort was subsequently moved to a new site about one mile to the northeast, and the old fort's remaining buildings were ordered torn down in June 1867.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nOn March 22, 1869, Fourteen [[Pawnee people|Pawnee Indians]], including scouts who had been honorably discharged after working for the army, were traveling through Ellsworth County when they ran into U.S. cavalry troops. Though the Pawnees had discharge papers from the army, a fight ensued. The Indians retreated to a sandstone cave, known today as Palmer's Cave. Their attackers set fire to grass at the cave's entrance, and six to nine Pawnees were killed as they ran out. The others died from exposure without their possessions. A few days later, the post surgeon at nearby [[Fort Harker (Kansas)|Fort Harker]], in today's town of [[Kanopolis, Kansas|Kanopolis]], removed six heads from their bodies, and shipped them to the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., for cranial study.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Unspeakable Sadness: The Dispossession of the Nebraska Indians|last=Wishart|first=David|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=182, 183|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kansaspublicradio.org/kpr-news/painting-symbolizes-dark-chapter-kansas-history-one-youve-likely-never|title=Spencer Painting Symbolizes Dark Chapter of Kansas History Few Have Ever Read|date=2017-01-27|newspaper=Kansas Public Radio|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the later 19th century, this area became known for cattle ranching and cattle drives.

The Raptors compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the league's [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]]. They play their home games at the [[Scotiabank Arena]], which they share with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's [[Expansion of the National Basketball Association|expansion]] into Canada, along with the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]]. Since the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|relocated]] from [[Vancouver]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].\n\nAs with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years; but after the acquisition of [[Vince Carter]] through a [[1998 NBA draft|draft-day trade in 1998]], the franchise set league-attendance records and made the [[NBA playoffs]] in [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000]], [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001]], and [[2002 NBA Playoffs|2002]]. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the [[2002\u201303 Toronto Raptors season|2002\u201303]] and [[2003\u201304 Toronto Raptors season|2003\u201304 seasons]], they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey Nets]].\n\nAfter Carter left, [[Chris Bosh]] emerged as the team leader. For the [[2006\u201307 Toronto Raptors season|2006\u201307 season]], [[Bryan Colangelo]] was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick [[Andrea Bargnani]], and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their [[2007 NBA Playoffs|first playoff berth in five years]], capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the [[2007\u201308 Toronto Raptors season|2007\u201308 season]], they also advanced to the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] but failed to reach the post-season in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the [[2009\u201310 Toronto Raptors season|2009\u201310 season]] in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the [[Miami Heat]] in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\n\n[[Masai Ujiri]] replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Kyle Lowry]]. The Raptors returned to the [[2014 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in [[2017\u201318 Toronto Raptors season|2018]]. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach [[Dwane Casey]] after the [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018 playoffs]] concluded, and conduct the high-profile trade of DeRozan for [[Kawhi Leonard]] and [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]] later that summer, as well as acquiring [[Marc Gasol]] before the [[Trade (sports)#NBA 2|trade deadline]]. In the [[2019 NBA playoffs|2019 playoffs]], the Raptors won their first [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference]] title and advanced to their first [[2019 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n==Franchise history==\n===Creation===\nThe Toronto Raptors were established on November 4, 1993, when the NBA, as part of its expansion into Canada, awarded its 28th [[Professional sports league organization|franchise]] to a group headed by Toronto businessman [[John Bitove]] for a then-record expansion fee of [[United States dollar|US$]]125 million.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-nba-is-coming-to-toronto|title=The NBA is coming to Toronto|date=November 14, 1993|accessdate=March 19, 2017|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref><ref name=\"groundwork\" /> Bitove and [[Allan Slaight]] of [[Slaight Communications]] each owned 44 per cent, with the [[Scotiabank|Bank of Nova Scotia]] (10 per cent), [[David Peterson]] (1 per cent), and Phil Granovsky (1 per cent) being minority partners.<ref name=\"groundwork\" /><ref name=arenawars>{{cite news|title=Arena wars [The Raptors and the Leafs needed new arenas and it would have been smart to share]|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|date=December 1997|newspaper=[[Toronto Life]]}}</ref> [[Sports betting|Wagering on NBA games]] in [[Ontario]] nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling.

The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and \"Naismith silver\" (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, [[James Naismith]]). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales.<ref name=\"groundwork\"/> For the 2008\u221209 season, the franchise dropped the colour purple from the original logo, making bright red the predominant colour in both the logo and the team's jerseys.\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as \"a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor\".<ref name=\"NewRaptorsLogo\"/>\n\n====Court art====\nThe Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams. Beginning in [[2017\u201318 Toronto Raptors season|early 2018]], in some games, the Raptors use the Welcome Toronto logo, as the Raptors have strong connections with Toronto-based rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], as well as the 3D Raptors logo. Scotiabank subsidiary [[Tangerine Bank]]'s name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly [[ING Direct]]<!--Do not bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]--> Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).\n\n===Uniforms===\n====Uniform evolution====\nThe uniforms the Raptors unveiled prior to the 1995\u201396 season, and wore until 1999, had black and white tears as pinstripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw on one side of the shorts, a raptor biting the \u2018T\u2019 of the \u2018TR\u2019 franchise acronym on the other side; and featured a red giant and aggressive ''Velociraptor'' dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled these new jerseys in 1999\u22122000, launching a unique road jersey that had a purple front and a black back. In 2003\u221204, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006\u221207 onward as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From 2008\u221209 through 2014\u221215, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.\n<div style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n;1995\u22121998\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_throwback_white\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_throwback_white\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_throwback\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_throwback\n| body       = 000000\n| shorts     = 000000\n| title      = Road\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{clear}}\n\n<div style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n;1999\u22122006\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_99home\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_99home\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_99road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_99road\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_03road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_08road\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = 2003-05 Alt.\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{clear}}\n\n<div style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n;2006\u22122015\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_03home\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_08home\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_03road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_08road\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_08roadalt\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_08roadalt\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = 2008 Road Alt.\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{Clear}}\n\n====2015 redesign====\nOn August 3, 2015, the Toronto Raptors unveiled four new uniforms. The uniforms were released in partnership with [[2K Sports]]' ''[[NBA 2K16]]'' video game. The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on [[National colours of Canada|Canada's national colours of red and white]], whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of \"We The North\". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's \"We The North\" slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jersey. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of the waistband, and the letter \"T\" is now on the sides of the shorts with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's [[Name of Toronto#Nicknames|\"T-Dot\" nickname]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Raptors Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/press-releases/uniforms-080315|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Raptors.com|date=August 3, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:left; width:35%;\">\n;2015\u22122017\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| body       = 000000\n| shorts     = 000000\n| title      = Road\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road Alt.\n}}\n|\n{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road (OVO)\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{clear}}\n\n====2017 onward====\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's partnership with Nike, each team was alotted four primary uniforms, classified as \u201ceditions\".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Nike and the NBA Reveal the First of the League\u2019s 2017-18 Game Uniforms|url=https://news.nike.com/news/nike-nba-game-uniforms|publisher=Nike|website=nike.com|date=June 18, 2017|accessdate=}}</ref> The Raptors made small changes to their regular home (now called \"Association edition\") and road (now the \"Icon edition\") uniforms, as well as their alternate (\"Statement edition\") uniforms.

The campaign was immediately embraced by fans during the playoffs and following season; the launch commercial was viewed over 500,000 times in the two days following its release, \"We The North\"-branded shirts and flags became a common sight at games, while [[Ryerson University]] sports marketing professor Cheri Bradish compared the campaign to [[Molson]]'s former \"[[I Am Canadian]]\" [[alcohol advertising]] campaign in how it resonated with the country.<ref name=gandm-wethenorth>{{cite news|title=How the Raptors redefined their brand \u2013 and took Toronto by the throat|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/how-the-raptors-redefined-their-brand-and-took-toronto-by-the-throat/article21360335/|accessdate=January 16, 2015|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=October 28, 2014|first=Rachel|last=Brady}}</ref><ref name=torstar-wethenorth>{{cite news|title=Raptors rebrand and embrace The North|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2014/04/16/raptors_rebrand_and_embrace_the_north.html|accessdate=January 16, 2015|work=Toronto Star}}</ref>\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Raptors soft-launched a new logo also designed by Sid Lee, which features a basketball with claw marks.

Raptors''' are<!-- Canadian English (individual teams agree with the plural form) --> a Canadian professional [[basketball]] team based in [[Toronto]]<!-- Please don't add Ontario and/or Canada, since it is redundant -->. The Raptors compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the league's [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]]. They play their home games at the [[Scotiabank Arena]], which they share with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's [[Expansion of the National Basketball Association|expansion]] into Canada, along with the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]]. Since the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]], the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|relocated]] from [[Vancouver]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].\n\nAs with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years; but after the acquisition of [[Vince Carter]] through a [[1998 NBA draft|draft-day trade in 1998]], the franchise set league-attendance records and made the [[NBA playoffs]] in [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000]], [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001]], and [[2002 NBA Playoffs|2002]]. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the [[2002\u201303 Toronto Raptors season|2002\u201303]] and [[2003\u201304 Toronto Raptors season|2003\u201304 seasons]], they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey Nets]].\n\nAfter Carter left, [[Chris Bosh]] emerged as the team leader. For the [[2006\u201307 Toronto Raptors season|2006\u201307 season]], [[Bryan Colangelo]] was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick [[Andrea Bargnani]], and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their [[2007 NBA Playoffs|first playoff berth in five years]], capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the [[2007\u201308 Toronto Raptors season|2007\u201308 season]], they also advanced to the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] but failed to reach the post-season in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the [[2009\u201310 Toronto Raptors season|2009\u201310 season]] in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the [[Miami Heat]] in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\n\n[[Masai Ujiri]] replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Kyle Lowry]]. The Raptors returned to the [[2014 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in [[2017\u201318 Toronto Raptors season|2018]]. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach [[Dwane Casey]] after the [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018 playoffs]] concluded, and conduct the high-profile trade of DeRozan for [[Kawhi Leonard]] and [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]] later that summer, as well as acquiring [[Marc Gasol]] before the [[Trade (sports)#NBA 2|trade deadline]]. In the [[2019 NBA playoffs|2019 playoffs]], the Raptors won their first [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference]] title and advanced to their first [[2019 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n==Franchise history==\n===Creation===\nThe Toronto Raptors were established on November 4, 1993, when the NBA, as part of its expansion into Canada, awarded its 28th [[Professional sports league organization|franchise]] to a group headed by Toronto businessman [[John Bitove]] for a then-record expansion fee of [[United States dollar|US$]]125 million.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-nba-is-coming-to-toronto|title=The NBA is coming to Toronto|date=November 14, 1993|accessdate=March 19, 2017|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref><ref name=\"groundwork\" /> Bitove and [[Allan Slaight]] of [[Slaight Communications]] each owned 44 per cent, with the [[Scotiabank|Bank of Nova Scotia]] (10 per cent), [[David Peterson]] (1 per cent), and Phil Granovsky (1 per cent) being minority partners.<ref name=\"groundwork\" /><ref name=arenawars>{{cite news|title=Arena wars [The Raptors and the Leafs needed new arenas and it would have been smart to share]|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|date=December 1997|newspaper=[[Toronto Life]]}}</ref> [[Sports betting|Wagering on NBA games]] in [[Ontario]] nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling.

The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and \"Naismith silver\" (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, [[James Naismith]]). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales.<ref name=\"groundwork\"/> For the 2008\u221209 season, the franchise dropped the colour purple from the original logo, making bright red the predominant colour in both the logo and the team's jerseys.\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as \"a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor\".<ref name=\"NewRaptorsLogo\"/>\n\n====Court art====\nThe Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams. Beginning in [[2017\u201318 Toronto Raptors season|early 2018]], in some games, the Raptors use the Welcome Toronto logo, as the Raptors have strong connections with Toronto-based rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], as well as the 3D Raptors logo. Scotiabank subsidiary [[Tangerine Bank]]'s name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly [[ING Direct]]<!--Do not bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]--> Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).\n\n===Uniforms===\n====Uniform evolution====\nThe uniforms the Raptors unveiled prior to the 1995\u201396 season, and wore until 1999, had black and white tears as pinstripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw on one side of the shorts, a raptor biting the \u2018T\u2019 of the \u2018TR\u2019 franchise acronym on the other side; and featured a red giant and aggressive ''Velociraptor'' dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled these new jerseys in 1999\u22122000, launching a unique road jersey that had a purple front and a black back. In 2003\u221204, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006\u221207 onward as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From 2008\u221209 through 2014\u221215, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.\n<div style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n;1995\u22121998\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_throwback_white\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_throwback_white\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_throwback\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_throwback\n| body       = 000000\n| shorts     = 000000\n| title      = Road\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{clear}}\n\n<div style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n;1999\u22122006\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_99home\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_99home\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_99road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_99road\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_03road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_08road\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = 2003-05 Alt.\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{clear}}\n\n<div style=\"float:left; width:25%;\">\n;2006\u22122015\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_03home\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_08home\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_03road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_08road\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_08roadalt\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_08roadalt\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = 2008 Road Alt.\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{Clear}}\n\n====2015 redesign====\nOn August 3, 2015, the Toronto Raptors unveiled four new uniforms. The uniforms were released in partnership with [[2K Sports]]' ''[[NBA 2K16]]'' video game. The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on [[National colours of Canada|Canada's national colours of red and white]], whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of \"We The North\". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's \"We The North\" slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jersey. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of the waistband, and the letter \"T\" is now on the sides of the shorts with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's [[Name of Toronto#Nicknames|\"T-Dot\" nickname]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Raptors Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/press-releases/uniforms-080315|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Raptors.com|date=August 3, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:left; width:35%;\">\n;2015\u22122017\n{{Fb_kit_header}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15home\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Home\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15road\n| body       = 000000\n| shorts     = 000000\n| title      = Road\n}}\n|{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road Alt.\n}}\n|\n{{Basketball kit\n| pattern_b  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| pattern_s  = _torontoraptors_15roadalt2\n| body       = ffffff\n| shorts     = ffffff\n| title      = Road (OVO)\n}}\n{{Fb kit footer|s=[http://www.jerseymuseum.org/team/toronto-raptors/jerseys/ jerseymuseum.org]|date=July 2019}}\n</div>{{clear}}\n\n====2017 onward====\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's partnership with Nike, each team was alotted four primary uniforms, classified as \u201ceditions\".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Nike and the NBA Reveal the First of the League\u2019s 2017-18 Game Uniforms|url=https://news.nike.com/news/nike-nba-game-uniforms|publisher=Nike|website=nike.com|date=June 18, 2017|accessdate=}}</ref> The Raptors made small changes to their regular home (now called \"Association edition\") and road (now the \"Icon edition\") uniforms, as well as their alternate (\"Statement edition\") uniforms.

The campaign was immediately embraced by fans during the playoffs and following season; the launch commercial was viewed over 500,000 times in the two days following its release, \"We The North\"-branded shirts and flags became a common sight at games, while [[Ryerson University]] sports marketing professor Cheri Bradish compared the campaign to [[Molson]]'s former \"[[I Am Canadian]]\" [[alcohol advertising]] campaign in how it resonated with the country.<ref name=gandm-wethenorth>{{cite news|title=How the Raptors redefined their brand \u2013 and took Toronto by the throat|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/how-the-raptors-redefined-their-brand-and-took-toronto-by-the-throat/article21360335/|accessdate=January 16, 2015|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=October 28, 2014|first=Rachel|last=Brady}}</ref><ref name=torstar-wethenorth>{{cite news|title=Raptors rebrand and embrace The North|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2014/04/16/raptors_rebrand_and_embrace_the_north.html|accessdate=January 16, 2015|work=Toronto Star}}</ref>\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Raptors soft-launched a new logo also designed by Sid Lee, which features a basketball with claw marks. The new logo was officially implemented during the 2015\u20132016 season.<ref name=\"NewRaptorsLogo\" /> The logo's introduction was marred by a disorganized launch, which saw a black and white version initially shown before the eventual unveiling of coloured versions later in the day, mixed reviews for the design itself, with some (especially on the black and white version) comparing it to that of the Brooklyn Nets, and despite teasing merchandise with the new logo, not releasing any until at least mid-2015.<ref name=torstar-raptorsbaffled>{{cite web|title=Raptors' launch of new logo baffles marketing experts|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/raptors/2014/12/22/raptors_launch_of_new_logo_baffles_marketing_experts.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> There were also alleged tensions between MLSE staff and Drake surrounding the new design\u2014in particular, the performer had pushed for the team to change its primary colour from red to gold (a colour seen in one of the official variants of the logo unveiled that day).

It was filmed on location from September 24 to November 20, 1992,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106627/business The Crush Box Office]</ref> in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.\n\n==Plot==\nWriter Nick Eliot ([[Cary Elwes]]) secures a job at ''Pique'' magazine and lodging in a guest house belonging to Cliff and Liv Forrester ([[Kurtwood Smith]] and [[Gwynyth Walsh]]). The handsome Nick soon makes the acquaintance of the Forrester's 14-year-old daughter Adrienne ([[Alicia Silverstone]]), a precocious girl who develops an intense attraction to him. She secretly helps Nick by sneaking into his room and rewriting one of his ''Pique'' stories, which subsequently wins a rave review from his editor/boss, Michael (Matthew Walker). At a party thrown by the Forresters, Nick agrees to accompany the lonely girl on a nighttime drive to a romantic spot, where she kisses him.\n\nThis intensifies Adrienne's crush on Nick, but he quickly wises up and attempts to put her off, having begun a budding romance with coworker Amy ([[Jennifer Rubin (actress)|Jennifer Rubin]]). Adrienne continues to boldly pursue him, even going so far as to undress in his view while he is hiding in her closet. Nick, however, continues to rebuff her advances, and Adrienne\u2019s actions become destructive. She defaces a car he's restored and erases his computer discs, yet he's unable to convince Cliff and Liv of what's going on. Cheyenne ([[Amber Benson]]), a friend of Adrienne\u2019s who tries to warn Nick about her, meets with an \"accident\" at the riding school they attend together. After Darian spies on Nick in bed with Amy, she locks Amy in her darkroom and empties a wasps' nest into the vents, knowing of Amy's spheksophobia. Amy survives, and Nick, now convinced that Adrienne is big trouble, attempts to find new lodging. However, Adrienne manages to sabotage his efforts. She accuses him of sexually assaulting her with \"evidence\" obtained from a used condom from Nick's trash, leading to his arrest. After Michael bails him out (and suspends him until trial), Nick is met once again by Cheyenne. She informs Nick that she knows he did not do anything to Adrienne, and that Adrienne had behaved like this before to a previous crush, a camp counselor named Rick who \"accidentally\" died by eating something poisonous. Cheyenne also informs Nick of a diary Adrienne kept that can exonerate him.\n\nWhen Cheyenne leaves, Nick goes looking for her when he hears strange noises from the Forrester's house. He discovers Cheyenne bound and gagged in the attic on the carousel, and is confronted by Adrienne and then an amazed Cliff, who attacks him thinking he is the enemy. Adrienne, while still infatuated, knocks her father unconscious, leaving Nick free to subdue her with one punch, knocking her out cold and freeing Cheyenne. Acquitted, Nick goes to live with Amy while Adrienne, confined to a psychiatric hospital, wishes to express her remorse for what she has done to Nick. Her doctor comments that she is making good progress, unaware she is developing a crush on him now.\n\nUltimately, she returns to her room in the psychiatric hospital, where she looks at her doctor's wedding photo with an evil glare.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Cary Elwes]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Eliot\n*[[Alicia Silverstone]] as Adrienne Forrester\n*[[Jennifer Rubin (actress)|Jennifer Rubin]] as Amy Maddik\n*[[Kurtwood Smith]] as Cliff Forrester\n*[[Gwynyth Walsh]] as Liv Forrester\n*[[Amber Benson]] as Cheyenne\n*[[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]] as Michael\n\n==Home media==\n''The Crush'' was released on VHS in 1993 and reissued in 1995 for [[rental]] and [[sell-through]].

Taking a degree in [[history of architecture|architectural history]] from [[Cambridge University]] in 1978, he moved directly into working as a carpenter on building sites and set up a small workshop, trading as Bloomsbury Joinery, in [[London|London\u2019s]] [[Covent Garden]] that year<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. In 1981 he bought a former vegetable warehouse in the same district at a much reduced price because it was earmarked by the [[Greater London Council]] for compulsory purchase, demolition and redevelopment. (The Council was abolished<ref>{{cite report |author=Hansard|date=1803-2005 |title=Streamlining the Cities |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/may/22/streamlining-the-cities |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> before the plans could be realized.)\n\nIn the early 1980s the workshop\u2019s output consisted of high quality furniture for the residential market. Exposure to an increasing number of institutional clients came from a chance encounter with Colonel David Gordon-Lennox, commanding officer of the [[Grenadier Guards]], whose own kitchen shelving led to a commission for the regiment\u2019s archive library, and from there a series of bookcases for Inns of Court lawyers<ref>{{cite news |last=Steiner |first=Rupert |date=29 June 1997 |title=Carpenter carved out success by going against the grain | work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>. Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as [[Heal\u2019s]], [[Liberty\u2019s]] and [[John Lewis]]. [[Venture capital]] was raised and significant investment made in a factory in [[Wiltshire]] which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Much was owed in this strategic shift to Ray Leigh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GRDM-Newsletter-22.pdf|title=22nd e-newsletter of the Gordon Russell Design Museum|website=www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>, appointed chairman of the limited company in 1990, and an architect whose own background included work on the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951 and a long career, first as design director then managing director, of iconic [[Cotswold]] furniture manufacturer [[Gordon Russell (designer)|Gordon Russell]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Leigh | first=Ray | title=Advance the Product |date=2015 |publisher=Gordon Russell Trust|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Myerson | first=Jeremy | title=Gordon Russell, Designer of Furniture |date=1992 |publisher=The Design Council of Great Britain|}}</ref>.

The first [[Oxbridge]] commission, of dining hall furniture for [[Corpus Christi College Cambridge]], came in 1991, a job which also marked the company\u2019s first use of computer-aided design<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. The first commission for the Foreign Office \u2013 the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Buenos Aires|British Embassy in Buenos Aires]] \u2013 and the first order over \u00a3250,000, for [[Merton College Oxford]], followed in 1992. 1997 saw a high-profile commission at the height of the \u2018[[Cool Britannia]]\u2019 years for the idiosyncratic new [[British Embassy in Moscow]], designed by [[Ahrends Burton Koralek]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Melvin | first=Jeremy | title=British Embassy in Moscow |date=1999 |publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Powell | first=Kenneth | title=From Russia with live - the Moscow embassy |date=2000 |publisher=Royal Academy Journal|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Taylor | first=David | title=ABK's Moscow Embassy - Britain at its best |date=2000 |publisher=Architect's Journal|}}</ref>, and in 1998 came the first order of over \u00a3500,000, for [[St Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford|St Hugh's College Oxford]].

Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the architecture is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the architect who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically. Most buildings cannot function without the furniture, yet inappropriate furniture can grossly undermine great architecture<ref>{{cite news | last=Lim | first=Candice | date=2012 |title=In conversation with Luke Hughes | work=Futurarc: the Voice of Green Architecture in Asia | edition=vol 27 }}</ref>.  \n\nThe company\u2019s design practice is focused not only on responding to the aesthetic and functional qualities of the buildings that house its furniture, but also the economic outcomes. Analysis and re-arrangement of the leg positions on the tables in a dining hall such as New College Oxford<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=236}}</ref> or an overhaul of the seating geometry in a small historic theatre<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=150}}</ref> add capacity, improving the efficiency and profitability of the building.

The proposition is that the longer a building and its furniture stay relevant, the longer the carbon stays locked up, and the longer it stays locked up, the less CO2 emissions. Luke Hughes furniture is designed for long life, 30 \u2013 50 years minimum.  The strict company policy is to buy solid hardwoods from suppliers who derive their raw material from forests managed to the standards of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification), SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) or equivalent, where replanting and controlled felling are part of the overall plan.

Taking a degree in architectural history from Cambridge University in 1978, he moved directly into working as a carpenter on building sites and set up a small workshop, trading as Bloomsbury Joinery, in London\u2019s Covent Garden that year<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. In 1981 he bought a former vegetable warehouse in the same district at a much reduced price because it was earmarked by the Greater London Council for compulsory purchase, demolition and redevelopment. (The Council was abolished<ref>{{cite report |author=Hansard|date=1803-2005 |title=Streamlining the Cities |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/may/22/streamlining-the-cities |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> before the plans could be realized.)\n\nIn the early 1980s the workshop\u2019s output consisted of high quality furniture for the residential market. Exposure to an increasing number of institutional clients came from a chance encounter with Colonel David Gordon-Lennox, commanding officer of the Grenadier Guards, whose own kitchen shelving led to a commission for the regiment\u2019s archive library, and from there a series of bookcases for Inns of Court lawyers<ref>{{cite news |last=Steiner |first=Rupert |date=29 June 1997 |title=Carpenter carved out success by going against the grain | work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>. Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as Heal\u2019s, Liberty\u2019s and John Lewis. Venture capital was raised and significant investment made in a factory in Wiltshire which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Much was owed in this strategic shift to Ray Leigh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GRDM-Newsletter-22.pdf|title=22nd e-newsletter of the Gordon Russell Design Museum|website=www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>, appointed chairman of the limited company in 1990, and an architect whose own background included work on the Festival of Britain in 1951 and a long career, first as design director then managing director, of iconic Cotswold furniture manufacturer Gordon Russell<ref>{{Cite book | last=Leigh | first=Ray | title=Advance the Product |date=2015 |publisher=Gordon Russell Trust|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Myerson | first=Jeremy | title=Gordon Russell, Designer of Furniture |date=1992 |publisher=The Design Council of Great Britain|}}</ref>.

The first Oxbridge commission, of dining hall furniture for Corpus Christi College Cambridge, came in 1991, a job which also marked the company\u2019s first use of computer-aided design<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. The first commission for the Foreign Office \u2013 the British Embassy in Buenos Aires \u2013 and the first order over \u00a3250,000, for Merton College Oxford, followed in 1992. 1997 saw a high-profile commission at the height of the \u2018Cool Britannia\u2019 years for the idiosyncratic new British Embassy in Moscow, designed by Ahrends Burton Koralek<ref>{{Cite book | last=Melvin | first=Jeremy | title=British Embassy in Moscow |date=1999 |publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Powell | first=Kenneth | title=From Russia with live - the Moscow embassy |date=2000 |publisher=Royal Academy Journal|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Taylor | first=David | title=ABK's Moscow Embassy - Britain at its best |date=2000 |publisher=Architect's Journal|}}</ref>, and in 1998 came the first order of over \u00a3500,000, for St Hugh\u2019s College Oxford. The late 90s also saw the development of meeting and conference room tables for the executive boardroom market<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Corbett |first=Sue |date=22 October 1998 |title=Table d'Art | magazine=Country Life}}</ref>, culminating in two widely publicised corporate HQs for Unilever and Diageo<ref>{{cite news |date=February 2003 |title=The spirit of enlightenment \u2013 Diageo headquarters | work=Architecture Today | edition=AT 135 }}</ref>.\n\nSince 2000 the company has concentrated on commissions for public buildings, a large proportion of them of either historic or architectural interest or both.\n\n==Company Philosophy & Identity==\nThe \u2018core proposition\u2019 of the Luke Hughes brand is \u2018Furniture in Architecture\u2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lukehughes.co.uk/project/overview-furniture-in-architecture|title=Company website's 'Furniture in Architecture' projects page|website=lukehughes.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>. Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the architecture is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the architect who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically. Most buildings cannot function without the furniture, yet inappropriate furniture can grossly undermine great architecture<ref>{{cite news | last=Lim | first=Candice | date=2012 |title=In conversation with Luke Hughes | work=Futurarc: the Voice of Green Architecture in Asia | edition=vol 27 }}</ref>.  \n\nThe company\u2019s design practice is focused not only on responding to the aesthetic and functional qualities of the buildings that house its furniture, but also the economic outcomes. Analysis and re-arrangement of the leg positions on the tables in a dining hall such as New College Oxford<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=236}}</ref> or an overhaul of the seating geometry in a small historic theatre<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=150}}</ref> add capacity, improving the efficiency and profitability of the building.

The proposition is that the longer a building and its furniture stay relevant, the longer the carbon stays locked up, and the longer it stays locked up, the less CO2 emissions. Luke Hughes furniture is designed for long life, 30 \u2013 50 years minimum.  The strict company policy is to buy solid hardwoods from suppliers who derive their raw material from forests managed to the standards of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification), SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) or equivalent, where replanting and controlled felling are part of the overall plan. Tree-planting schemes are actively supported and the company is a founder member of the Woodland Heritage Trust<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.woodlandheritage.org|title=Woodland Heritage website|website=woodlandheritage.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>. Timbers listed as endangered in the CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) are  not used.
