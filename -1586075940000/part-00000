The program was established by Congress in 1991 to preserve and protect the nation's scenic but often less-traveled roads and promote [[tourism]] and economic development. The National Scenic Byways Program (NSBP) is administered by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA).\n\nThe most scenic byways are designated '''All-American Roads''', which must meet two out of the six intrinsic qualities. The designation means they have features that do not exist elsewhere in the United States and are unique and important enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves. As of November 2010, there are 120&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and 31&nbsp;All-American Roads, located in 46&nbsp;states (all except [[Hawaii]], [[Nebraska]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Texas]]).<ref>{{cite web |author = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://byways.org/press/listbyways.html |title = List of America's Byways |work = America's Byways |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = November 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe NSBP was established under the [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] of 1991, which provided $74.3&nbsp;million in discretionary grants. On May&nbsp;18, 1995, FHWA specified the intrinsic qualities that would serve as criteria for designating road as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads. In September U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Federico Pe\u00f1a]] announced the first 14&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and six All-American Roads. On June&nbsp;9, 1998, the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st&nbsp;Century]] (TEA-21) provided $148&nbsp;million to states so they could develop state roads to take advantage of the program.\n\nOn August&nbsp;10, 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users]] (SAFETEA-LU), which provided $175&nbsp;million to states and Indian tribes. Most recently, on October&nbsp;16, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Ray LaHood]] designated 37&nbsp;new roads as National Scenic Byways and five new All-American Roads.<ref>{{cite web |author = National Scenic Byways Program |title = History of the Program |url = http://www.bywaysonline.org/program/history.html |work = Program Information |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = August 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Requirements==\nNational Scenic Byways go through a nomination procedure. They must already be designated state scenic byways to be nominated (However, roads that meet all criteria for national designation but not state designation may be considered for national designation on a case-by-case basis).<ref name=policy>{{cite journal |first = Rodney E. |last = Slater |url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1995-05-18/html/95-12211.htm |title = National Scenic Byways Program Interim Policy |journal = [[Federal Register]] |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |volume = 60 |issue = 96 |pages = 26759\u201362 |date = May 18, 1995 |accessdate = May 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Intrinsic qualities===\nFor designation as a National Scenic Byway a road must have one of six intrinsic qualities. To be designated an All-American Road, a road must have at least two of the six qualities.<ref name=policy/>\n\n*'''Scenic quality''' is the heightened visual experience derived from the view of natural and manmade elements of the visual environment of the scenic byway corridor. The characteristics of the landscape are strikingly distinct and offer a pleasing and most memorable visual experience.\n*'''Natural quality''' applies to those features in the visual environment that are in a relatively undisturbed state. These features predate the arrival of human populations and may include geological formations, [[fossil]]s, landform, water bodies, vegetation, and wildlife. There may be evidence of human activity, but the natural features reveal minimal disturbances.\n*'''Historic quality''' encompasses legacies of the past that are distinctly associated with physical elements of the landscape, whether natural or manmade, that are of such historic significance that they educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past. The historic elements reflect the actions of people and may include buildings, settlement patterns, and other examples of human activity.\n*'''Cultural quality''' is evidence and expressions of the customs or traditions of a distinct group of people. Cultural features include, but are not limited to, crafts, music, dance, rituals, festivals, speech, food, special events, or [[vernacular architecture]].\n*'''Archeological quality''' involves those characteristics of the scenic byways corridor that are physical evidence of historic or prehistoric human life or activity. The scenic byway corridor's archeological interest, as identified through ruins, artifacts, structural remains, and other physical evidence have scientific significance that educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past.\n*'''Recreational quality''' involves outdoor recreational activities directly associated with and dependent upon the natural and cultural elements of the corridor's landscape. The recreational activities provide opportunities for active and passive recreational experiences. They include, but are not limited to, downhill skiing, rafting, boating, fishing, and hiking. Driving the road itself may qualify as a pleasurable recreational experience. The recreational activities may be seasonal, but the quality and importance of the recreational activities as seasonal operations must be well recognized.\n\n===Corridor management plans===\nA corridor management plan must also be developed, with community involvement, and the plan \"should provide for the conservation and enhancement of the byway's intrinsic qualities as well as the promotion of tourism and economic development\". The plan includes, but is not limited to:\n\n*A map identifying the corridor boundaries and the location of intrinsic qualities and different land uses within the corridor.\n*A strategy for maintaining and enhancing those intrinsic qualities.\n*A strategy describing how existing development might be enhanced and new development might be accommodated while still preserving the intrinsic qualities of the corridor.\n*A general review of the road's or highway's safety and accident record to identify any correctable faults in highway design, maintenance, or operations.\n*A signage plan that demonstrates how the State will insure and make the number and placement of signs more supportive of the visitor experience.\n*A narrative describing how the National Scenic Byway will be positioned for marketing.<ref name=policy/>\n\nCorridor management plans for All-American Roads must also include:<ref name=policy/>\n\n*A narrative on how the All-American Road would be promoted, interpreted, and marketed in order to attract travelers, especially those from other countries.\n*A plan to encourage the accommodation of increased tourism, if this is projected. Some demonstration that the roadway, lodging and dining facilities, roadside rest areas, and other tourist necessities will be adequate for the number of visitors induced by the byway's designation as an All-American Road.\n*A plan for addressing multi-lingual information needs.\n\nThe final step is when the highway (or highways) is approved for designation by the [[United States Secretary of Transportation]].<ref name=policy/>\n\n==List of byways==\n{{inc-transport|date=February 2017}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders hlist\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Type\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (mi)\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (km)\n!scope=\"col\" | State(s)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Southern or western terminus\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Northern or eastern terminus\n!scope=\"col\" | Date designated\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{abbr|Ref(s)|References}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=e7e7ff align=center | NSB\n!

The program was established by Congress in 1991 to preserve and protect the nation's scenic but often less-traveled roads and promote [[tourism]] and economic development. The National Scenic Byways Program (NSBP) is administered by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA).\n\nThe most scenic byways are designated '''All-American Roads''', which must meet two out of the six intrinsic qualities. The designation means they have features that do not exist elsewhere in the United States and are unique and important enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves. As of November 2010, there are 120&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and 31&nbsp;All-American Roads, located in 46&nbsp;states (all except [[Hawaii]], [[Nebraska]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Texas]]).<ref>{{cite web |author = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://byways.org/press/listbyways.html |title = List of America's Byways |work = America's Byways |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = November 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe NSBP was established under the [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] of 1991, which provided $74.3&nbsp;million in discretionary grants. On May&nbsp;18, 1995, FHWA specified the intrinsic qualities that would serve as criteria for designating road as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads. In September U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Federico Pe\u00f1a]] announced the first 14&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and six All-American Roads. On June&nbsp;9, 1998, the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st&nbsp;Century]] (TEA-21) provided $148&nbsp;million to states so they could develop state roads to take advantage of the program.\n\nOn August&nbsp;10, 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users]] (SAFETEA-LU), which provided $175&nbsp;million to states and Indian tribes. Most recently, on October&nbsp;16, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Ray LaHood]] designated 37&nbsp;new roads as National Scenic Byways and five new All-American Roads.<ref>{{cite web |author = National Scenic Byways Program |title = History of the Program |url = http://www.bywaysonline.org/program/history.html |work = Program Information |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = August 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Requirements==\nNational Scenic Byways go through a nomination procedure. They must already be designated state scenic byways to be nominated (However, roads that meet all criteria for national designation but not state designation may be considered for national designation on a case-by-case basis).<ref name=policy>{{cite journal |first = Rodney E. |last = Slater |url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1995-05-18/html/95-12211.htm |title = National Scenic Byways Program Interim Policy |journal = [[Federal Register]] |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |volume = 60 |issue = 96 |pages = 26759\u201362 |date = May 18, 1995 |accessdate = May 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Intrinsic qualities===\nFor designation as a National Scenic Byway a road must have one of six intrinsic qualities. To be designated an All-American Road, a road must have at least two of the six qualities.<ref name=policy/>\n\n*'''Scenic quality''' is the heightened visual experience derived from the view of natural and manmade elements of the visual environment of the scenic byway corridor. The characteristics of the landscape are strikingly distinct and offer a pleasing and most memorable visual experience.\n*'''Natural quality''' applies to those features in the visual environment that are in a relatively undisturbed state. These features predate the arrival of human populations and may include geological formations, [[fossil]]s, landform, water bodies, vegetation, and wildlife. There may be evidence of human activity, but the natural features reveal minimal disturbances.\n*'''Historic quality''' encompasses legacies of the past that are distinctly associated with physical elements of the landscape, whether natural or manmade, that are of such historic significance that they educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past. The historic elements reflect the actions of people and may include buildings, settlement patterns, and other examples of human activity.\n*'''Cultural quality''' is evidence and expressions of the customs or traditions of a distinct group of people. Cultural features include, but are not limited to, crafts, music, dance, rituals, festivals, speech, food, special events, or [[vernacular architecture]].\n*'''Archeological quality''' involves those characteristics of the scenic byways corridor that are physical evidence of historic or prehistoric human life or activity. The scenic byway corridor's archeological interest, as identified through ruins, artifacts, structural remains, and other physical evidence have scientific significance that educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past.\n*'''Recreational quality''' involves outdoor recreational activities directly associated with and dependent upon the natural and cultural elements of the corridor's landscape. The recreational activities provide opportunities for active and passive recreational experiences. They include, but are not limited to, downhill skiing, rafting, boating, fishing, and hiking. Driving the road itself may qualify as a pleasurable recreational experience. The recreational activities may be seasonal, but the quality and importance of the recreational activities as seasonal operations must be well recognized.\n\n===Corridor management plans===\nA corridor management plan must also be developed, with community involvement, and the plan \"should provide for the conservation and enhancement of the byway's intrinsic qualities as well as the promotion of tourism and economic development\". The plan includes, but is not limited to:\n\n*A map identifying the corridor boundaries and the location of intrinsic qualities and different land uses within the corridor.\n*A strategy for maintaining and enhancing those intrinsic qualities.\n*A strategy describing how existing development might be enhanced and new development might be accommodated while still preserving the intrinsic qualities of the corridor.\n*A general review of the road's or highway's safety and accident record to identify any correctable faults in highway design, maintenance, or operations.\n*A signage plan that demonstrates how the State will insure and make the number and placement of signs more supportive of the visitor experience.\n*A narrative describing how the National Scenic Byway will be positioned for marketing.<ref name=policy/>\n\nCorridor management plans for All-American Roads must also include:<ref name=policy/>\n\n*A narrative on how the All-American Road would be promoted, interpreted, and marketed in order to attract travelers, especially those from other countries.\n*A plan to encourage the accommodation of increased tourism, if this is projected. Some demonstration that the roadway, lodging and dining facilities, roadside rest areas, and other tourist necessities will be adequate for the number of visitors induced by the byway's designation as an All-American Road.\n*A plan for addressing multi-lingual information needs.\n\nThe final step is when the highway (or highways) is approved for designation by the [[United States Secretary of Transportation]].<ref name=policy/>\n\n==List of byways==\n{{inc-transport|date=February 2017}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders hlist\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Type\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (mi)\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (km)\n!scope=\"col\" | State(s)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Southern or western terminus\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Northern or eastern terminus\n!scope=\"col\" | Date designated\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{abbr|Ref(s)|References}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=e7e7ff align=center | NSB\n!

Although in some cases the proper solution to Dunash's riddles is debated, Rodr\u00edguez gives the following: apple, watermelon, candlewick, feather (\u00d72), the earth, cock, the sun, the day and the night, unknown.\n\nSubsequent exponents included [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]] (born 993).

The genre was characterised by alluding to words in languages other than Hebrew (''lo\u2018ez'') in order to provide clues to the solution. For example, one riddle includes the Hebrew phrase ''Eh ko nistarti'' ('I am hidden somewhere here'). The first two of these words sound the same as the Italian/Spanish word ''eco'' ('echo'), and 'echo' (Hebrew ''hed'') is indeed the solution to the poem. Each riddle would include an '[[emblem]]' (''tsurah'') near the opening in the form of an allusive picture, poem, or phrase, or a combination of these, after which the riddle proper would commence. Poems in this genre were [[occasional poems|occasional]], composed in celebration of specific high-society events such as weddings and circumcisions. The topic of the riddle would often reflect the occasion and audience (with solutions such as 'wisdom' for a gathering of scholars, or 'love' at a wedding), and the riddle might make use of information about the people at the gathering in ways which would make little sense to a wider audience.<ref>Arthur Lesley, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20689297 The Riddles of Dan Pagis]', ''Prooftexts'', 11.1 (January 1991), 76-80.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the [[Haggadah]], there is also the [[Echad Mi Yodea]], characterised by [[Joseph Jacobs]] as 'a curious riddle'.<ref name=\"Joseph Jacobs 1907\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n* Yehuda Ratzaby, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23415145 Halakhic Poetic Riddles of R.

The genre was characterised by alluding to words in languages other than Hebrew (''lo\u2018ez'') in order to provide clues to the solution. For example, one riddle includes the Hebrew phrase ''Eh ko nistarti'' ('I am hidden somewhere here'). The first two of these words sound the same as the Italian/Spanish word ''eco'' ('echo'), and 'echo' (Hebrew ''hed'') is indeed the solution to the poem. Each riddle would include an '[[emblem]]' (''tsurah'') near the opening in the form of an allusive picture, poem, or phrase, or a combination of these, after which the riddle proper would commence. Poems in this genre were [[occasional poems|occasional]], composed in celebration of specific high-society events such as weddings and circumcisions. The topic of the riddle would often reflect the occasion and audience (with solutions such as 'wisdom' for a gathering of scholars, or 'love' at a wedding), and the riddle might make use of information about the people at the gathering in ways which would make little sense to a wider audience.<ref>Arthur Lesley, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20689297 The Riddles of Dan Pagis]', ''Prooftexts'', 11.1 (January 1991), 76-80.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the [[Haggadah]], there is also the [[Echad Mi Yodea]], characterised by [[Joseph Jacobs]] as 'a curious riddle'.<ref name=\"Joseph Jacobs 1907\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n* Yehuda Ratzaby, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23415145 Halakhic Poetic Riddles of R.

He has a rare distinction of governing under three kings, [[Hyder Ali]], [[Tipu Sultan]] and [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar III]]. He governed the [[Mysore kingdom]] from 1782 to 1811. He was known for his skill with [[Account (bookkeeping)|accounts]], prodigious memory and proficiency in several [[languages]]. He was also a wartime [[military commander]] while serving under [[Tipu Sultan]]. After [[Tipu Sultan]]'s defeat, [[Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar]] was educated and trained by Purniah from 1799 till 1810 (when [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar III]] came of age), he governed the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] together with the English resident of the [[East India Company]].\n[[File:Yellandur1.jpg|thumb|Residence built by Purniah in Yelandur, now a museum.]]\n\n==Early years and rise==\nPurniah came from an orthodox [[Deshastha Brahmin|Deshastha Madhva Brahmin]] family.<ref>{{cite book|title=Western colonial policy: a study on its impact on Indian society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDY-AAAAMAAJ|page=257|publisher=Institute of Historical Studies|year=1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TdrzDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA359|title=India, Modernity and the Great Divergence: Mysore and Gujarat (17th to 19th C.)|page=359|author=Kaveh Yazdani|publisher=BRILL|accessdate=10 January 2017|isbn=9789004330795|date=10 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society (Bangalore)., Volume 72|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=RwNuAAAAMAAJ|publisher=The Society|year=1981|page=182|quote=Poorniah himself was a Marathi Madhwa brahmin and there were many more such.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Explorations in the Deccan History|author=A.

He lost his father at the age of eleven and had to seek employment to support his family. He started writing accounts at a trader's shop. This grocer had close contact with a rich merchant, Annadana Shetty, who supplied large quantities of groceries to Hyder Ali's palace and army.\n\nThrough this connection Purniah very soon earned confidence of Hyder Ali because of his proficiency in accounting and excellent handwriting. Endowed with prodigious memory, proficiency in several languages and sheer hard work, Purniah became head of Accounts Department and a confidant of the ruler.\n\nPurniah knew [[Kannada]], [[Sanskrit]] and Persian. He understood [[English language|English]], but could not read or write the language.\n\n==Years with Tipu==\nIn 1782, when Hyder Ali died, near [[Chittoor]], Tipu was encamping in [[Malabar coast]]. Purniah kept the king's death a top secret, and sent the word to Tipu by the speediest way possible. Meanwhile, Hyder's body was kept embalmed, and business went on usual. Purniah thus played a key role in keeping the news of Hyder's death confidential, as many adversaries could have seized this advantage and tried to usurp throne. Purniah thus paved the way for the succession of Tipu. Purniah became a member of Tipu's inner cabinet.\n<ref name=Parsons>{{cite book|last1=Parsons|first1=Constance E|title=Seringapatam|date=1931|publisher=H.

In the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]], Purniah commanded the forces of Mysore against the English in some of the battles including [[Battle of Sultanpet Tope]]. Tipu died on the battlefield in 1799.\n\n==Meeting with British==\n{{tone|date=January 2015}}\n[[File:Lord Harris Residence 01, Seringapatam.jpg |thumb|200px|Lord Harris Residence, later residence of Puraniah, [[Seringapatam]]]]\n[[File:Lord Harris Residence 02, Seringapatam.jpg |thumb|200px|Inscription at the Lord Harris Residence, Seringapatam]]\nAfter Tipu's death Purniah sought an interview with the [[George Harris, 1st Baron Harris|General Harris]], who was very much impressed with Purniah's political acumen, maturity and fearlessness. He informed the General that administration had nearly collapsed, many of the able army and civil officers were killed and plundering had already set in.\n\nThe British were convinced and made Purniah the first Dewan of the newly formed [[state of Mysore]](thus he became beneficiary of Tipu's defeat instead of Mir Sadiq which raises doubts that who actually did said treason against Tipu). Queen Regent Lakshammanni readily agreed to the arrangement. The child-king, later Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, was educated and trained by Purniah. He was granted the [[jagir]] of Yelandur, which yielded an annual revenue of 10000 star pagodas, by the Maharaja of Mysore at a special Durbar on 27 December 1807. The British Resident Sir John Malcolm and the [[East India Company]] honoured him on his retirement by presenting him a horse, an elephant and a rich killat.<ref name=\"Parsons\"/>\n\nKrishnaraja Wodeyar attained the age of 16 in early 1810 and hence attained the age of discretion. After discussing with the British Resident, A. H. Cole, the reins of the state were transferred from Dewan Purnaiah to the king. Purniah retired from service in 1811.\n\nAfter his retirement from service in 1811, Purnaiah lived at the house is known as Lord Harris's House or The Doctor's Bungalow or Puraniah's Bungalow in Seringapatam, near the [[Scott\u2019s Bungalow, Seringapatam|Scott\u2019s Bungalow]] and [[Garrison Cemetery, Seringapatam|Garrison Cemetery]], and died there on 28 March 1812. Days before his death, he wrote a letter to his friend Col. Hill, Commandant of Seringapatam, ''Old and infirm, after a life of unusual activity and care, I am going to the land of my fathers'', for which Col.

He has a rare distinction of governing under three kings, [[Hyder Ali]], [[Tipu Sultan]] and [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar III]]. He governed the [[Mysore kingdom]] from 1782 to 1811. He was known for his skill with [[Account (bookkeeping)|accounts]], prodigious memory and proficiency in several [[languages]]. He was also a wartime [[military commander]] while serving under [[Tipu Sultan]]. After [[Tipu Sultan]]'s defeat, [[Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar]] was educated and trained by Purniah from 1799 till 1810 (when [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar III]] came of age), he governed the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] together with the English resident of the [[East India Company]].\n[[File:Yellandur1.jpg|thumb|Residence built by Purniah in Yelandur, now a museum.]]\n\n==Early years and rise==\nPurniah came from an orthodox [[Deshastha Brahmin|Deshastha Madhva Brahmin]] family.<ref>{{cite book|title=Western colonial policy: a study on its impact on Indian society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDY-AAAAMAAJ|page=257|publisher=Institute of Historical Studies|year=1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TdrzDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA359|title=India, Modernity and the Great Divergence: Mysore and Gujarat (17th to 19th C.)|page=359|author=Kaveh Yazdani|publisher=BRILL|accessdate=10 January 2017|isbn=9789004330795|date=10 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society (Bangalore)., Volume 72|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=RwNuAAAAMAAJ|publisher=The Society|year=1981|page=182|quote=Poorniah himself was a Marathi Madhwa brahmin and there were many more such.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Explorations in the Deccan History|author=A.

He lost his father at the age of eleven and had to seek employment to support his family. He started writing accounts at a trader's shop. This grocer had close contact with a rich merchant, Annadana Shetty, who supplied large quantities of groceries to Hyder Ali's palace and army.\n\nThrough this connection Purniah very soon earned confidence of Hyder Ali because of his proficiency in accounting and excellent handwriting. Endowed with prodigious memory, proficiency in several languages and sheer hard work, Purniah became head of Accounts Department and a confidant of the ruler.\n\nPurniah knew [[Kannada]], [[Sanskrit]] and Persian. He understood [[English language|English]], but could not read or write the language.\n\n==Years with Tipu==\nIn 1782, when Hyder Ali died, near [[Chittoor]], Tipu was encamping in [[Malabar coast]]. Purniah kept the king's death a top secret, and sent the word to Tipu by the speediest way possible. Meanwhile, Hyder's body was kept embalmed, and business went on usual. Purniah thus played a key role in keeping the news of Hyder's death confidential, as many adversaries could have seized this advantage and tried to usurp throne. Purniah thus paved the way for the succession of Tipu. Purniah became a member of Tipu's inner cabinet.\n<ref name=Parsons>{{cite book|last1=Parsons|first1=Constance E|title=Seringapatam|date=1931|publisher=H.

In the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]] of 1792, Purniah commanded a rocket units (131 men).<ref>[http://www.nal.res.in/pdf/pdfrocket.pdf], Page 5 of Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 1750-1850 A.D.</ref> In his [[Battle of Seringapatam|last battle with the British]], Tipu had entrusted his eldest son and heir-apparent to Purniah's care. In the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]], Purniah commanded the forces of Mysore against the English in some of the battles including [[Battle of Sultanpet Tope]]. Tipu died on the battlefield in 1799.\n\n==Meeting with British==\n{{tone|date=January 2015}}\n[[File:Lord Harris Residence 01, Seringapatam.jpg |thumb|200px|Lord Harris Residence, later residence of Puraniah, [[Seringapatam]]]]\n[[File:Lord Harris Residence 02, Seringapatam.jpg |thumb|200px|Inscription at the Lord Harris Residence, Seringapatam]]\nAfter Tipu's death Purniah sought an interview with the [[George Harris, 1st Baron Harris|General Harris]], who was very much impressed with Purniah's political acumen, maturity and fearlessness. He informed the General that administration had nearly collapsed, many of the able army and civil officers were killed and plundering had already set in.\n\nThe British were convinced and made Purniah the first Dewan of the newly formed [[state of Mysore]](thus he became beneficiary of Tipu's defeat instead of Mir Sadiq which raises doubts that who actually did said treason against Tipu). Queen Regent Lakshammanni readily agreed to the arrangement. The child-king, later Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, was educated and trained by Purniah. He was granted the [[jagir]] of Yelandur, which yielded an annual revenue of 10000 star pagodas, by the Maharaja of Mysore at a special Durbar on 27 December 1807. The British Resident Sir John Malcolm and the [[East India Company]] honoured him on his retirement by presenting him a horse, an elephant and a rich killat.<ref name=\"Parsons\"/>\n\nKrishnaraja Wodeyar attained the age of 16 in early 1810 and hence attained the age of discretion. After discussing with the British Resident, A. H. Cole, the reins of the state were transferred from Dewan Purnaiah to the king. Purniah retired from service in 1811.\n\nAfter his retirement from service in 1811, Purnaiah lived at the house is known as Lord Harris's House or The Doctor's Bungalow or Puraniah's Bungalow in Seringapatam, near the [[Scott\u2019s Bungalow, Seringapatam|Scott\u2019s Bungalow]] and [[Garrison Cemetery, Seringapatam|Garrison Cemetery]], and died there on 28 March 1812. Days before his death, he wrote a letter to his friend Col. Hill, Commandant of Seringapatam, ''Old and infirm, after a life of unusual activity and care, I am going to the land of my fathers'', for which Col. Hill replied ''Say I am travelling the same road'', and passed away a short time after Purnaiah.
