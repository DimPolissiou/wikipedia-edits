In the 14th century, [[Guillaume Tirel]], a [[Court (royal)|court]] [[chef]] known as \"Taillevent\", wrote ''[[Le Viandier]]'', one of the earliest [[recipe]] collections of [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval France]]. In the 17th century, chefs [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne]] and [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style. [[French cheese|Cheese]] and [[French wine|wine]] are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and ''[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nFrench cuisine was made important in the 20th century by [[Auguste Escoffier]] to become the modern ''[[haute cuisine]]''; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary character to be found in the [[regions of France]] and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. [[Culinary tourism]] and the ''[[Guide Michelin]]'' helped to acquaint people{{who|date=November 2019}} with the ''[[cuisine bourgeoise]]'' of the urban elites{{dubious|date=November 2019}} and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. [[Gascony|Gascon]] cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.\n\nKnowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards and [[culinary art|culinary education]]. In November 2010, French [[gastronomy]] was added by the [[UNESCO]] to its lists of the world's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|\"intangible cultural heritage\"]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-culture_17int.ART.State.Edition1.b21e71.html Bon app\u00e9tit: Your meal is certified by the UN] Dallas Morning News</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/celebrations_healing_techniques_crafts_and_culinary_arts_added_to_the_representative_list_of_the_intangible_cultural_heritage/ |title=Celebrations, healing techniques, crafts and culinary arts added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage |publisher=UNESCO |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n    [[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|left|[[John, Duke of Berry]] enjoying a grand meal.

On the table to the left of the Duke is a golden [[salt cellar]], or ''nef'', in the shape of a ship; illustration from ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'', circa 1410.]]\n\nIn French [[medieval cuisine]], banquets were common among the [[aristocracy]]. Multiple courses would be prepared, but served in a style called ''service en confusion'', or all at once. Food was generally eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, and it was not until the very end of the [[Late Middle Ages]] that the [[shortcrust pastry|shortcrust]] pie was developed. Meals often ended with an ''issue de table'', which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of ''[[drag\u00e9e]]s'' (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as [[hypocras]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\">{{Cite book | last = Wheaton | first = Barbara Ketcham | title = Savoring the Past: The French Kitchen and Table from 1300 to 1789 | publisher = First Touchstone | year = 1996 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-684-81857-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_d5z8 }}</ref>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\nThe ingredients of the time varied greatly according to the seasons and the church calendar, and many items were preserved with salt, spices, honey, and other preservatives. Late spring, summer, and autumn afforded abundance, while winter meals were more sparse. Livestock were slaughtered at the beginning of winter. Beef was often salted, while pork was salted and smoked. Bacon and sausages would be smoked in the chimney, while the tongue and hams were [[brine]]d and dried.  Cucumbers were brined as well, while greens would be packed in jars with salt. Fruits, nuts and root vegetables would be boiled in honey for preservation. Whale, dolphin and porpoise were considered fish, so during [[Lent]], the salted meats of these sea mammals were eaten.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|9\u201312}}\n\nArtificial freshwater ponds (often called ''stews'') held [[carp]], [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[tench]], [[bream]], [[Eel (food)|eel]], and other fish. Poultry was kept in special yards, with pigeon and [[Squab (food)|squab]] being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included [[venison]], [[wild boar]], hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as [[tansy]], [[rue]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], and [[hyssop]], which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time \u2013 they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and [[mace (spice)|mace]]. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are [[cubeb]]s, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), [[grains of paradise]], and [[galangal|galengale]]. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and ''[[verjus]]'' combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial to make use of nutrients.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|13\u201315}}\n\nVisual display was prized. Brilliant colors were obtained by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of [[leek]]s. Yellow came from [[saffron]] or egg yolk, while red came from [[sunflower]], and purple came from ''[[Crozophora tinctoria]]'' or ''[[Heliotropium europaeum]]''. Gold and [[Metal leaf|silver leaf]] were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as ''tourte parmerienne'' which was a pastry dish made to look like a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with [[gold leaf]]. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast [[swan]] or [[peafowl|peacock]] sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being [[gilded]]. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|15\u201316}}\n\nThe most well known French chef of the Middle Ages was [[Guillaume Tirel]], also known as Taillevent. Taillevent worked in numerous royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], then the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] who was son of [[John II of France|John II]]. The Dauphin became King [[Charles V of France]] in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, ''marmites'', on it.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|18\u201321}}\n\n===Ancien R\u00e9gime===\n\nParis was the central hub of culture and economic activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as ''[[Les Halles]]'', ''la M\u00e9gisserie'', those found along ''[[Rue Mouffetard]]'', and similar smaller versions in other cities were very important to the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the [[guild]] system, which developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government as well as by the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|71\u201372}}\n\nThere were two groups of guilds \u2013 first, those that supplied the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers, [[pastry chef|pastry cook]]s, sauce makers, poulterers, and [[caterer]]s. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the ''[[charcuterie|charcutiers]]'' and ''r\u00f4tisseurs'' (purveyors of roasted meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|72\u201373}}  The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed a high level of income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the [[guild]] hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks' guild regulations allowed for this movement.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|73}}\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the [[New World]]. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519\u20131589?) serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|81}}  The dish called [[cassoulet]] has its roots in the New World discovery of [[haricot bean]]s, which are central to the dish's creation, but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|85}}\n\n''Haute cuisine'' ({{IPA-fr|ot k\u0265izin|pron}}, \"high cuisine\") has foundations during the 17th century with a chef named [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne]]. As author of works such as ''Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois'', he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His book includes the earliest known reference to [[roux]] using pork fat. The book contained two sections, one for meat days, and one for [[fasting]]. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers. La Varenne also published a book on pastry in 1667 entitled ''Le Parfait confitvrier'' (republished as ''Le Confiturier fran\u00e7ois'') which similarly updated and codified the emerging ''haute cuisine'' standards for desserts and pastries.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|114\u2013120}}\n\nChef [[Fran\u00e7ois Massialot]] wrote ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' in 1691, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. The book contains menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a [[marinade]] is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|149\u2013154}}\n\nThe successive updates of ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' include important refinements such as adding a glass of wine to [[stock (food)|fish stock]]. Definitions were also added to the 1703 edition. The 1712 edition, retitled ''Le Nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois'', was increased to two volumes, and was written in a more elaborate style with extensive explanations of technique. Additional smaller preparations are included in this edition as well, leading to lighter preparations, and adding a third course to the meal. [[Ragout]], a stew still central to French cookery, makes its first appearance as a single dish in this edition as well; prior to that, it was listed as a garnish.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|155}}\n\n===Late 18th century \u2013  early 19th century===\n\n[[File:Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, reine de France (original copy) by Jean-Marc Nattier.png|thumb|The [[Poland|Polish]] wife of [[Louis XV of France]], Queen [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], influenced French cuisine.]]\n[[File:M-A-Careme.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]]]]\nShortly before the French Revolution, dishes like [[bouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la Reine]] gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine produced by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on [[vol-au-vent]] created under the influence of Queen [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], the Polish-born wife of [[Louis XV]]. This recipe is still popular today, as are other recipes from Queen Marie Leszczy\u0144ska like [[consomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la Reine]] and [[filet d'aloyau brais\u00e9 \u00e0 la royale]]. Queen Marie is also credited with introducing [[lentil]]s to the French diet and [[Polonaise (sauce)|Polonaise garnishing]].\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] was integral to the expansion of French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Bread was a significant food source among peasants and the working class in the late 18th century, with many of the nation's people being dependent on it. In French provinces, bread was often consumed three times a day by the people of France.<ref name=Brace>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1843902|jstor=1843902|title=The Problem of Bread and the French Revolution at Bordeaux|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=51|issue=4|pages=649\u2013667|year=1946|last1=Brace|first1=Richard Munthe}}</ref> According to Brace, bread was referred to as the basic dietary item for the masses, and it was also used as a foundation for soup.  In fact, bread was so important that harvest, interruption of commerce by wars, heavy flour exploration, and prices and supply were all watched and controlled by the French Government. Among the underprivileged, constant fear of famine was always prevalent. From 1725 to 1789, there was fourteen years of bad yields to blame for low grain supply. In Bordeaux, during 1708\u20131789, thirty-three bad harvests occurred.<ref name=Brace/>\n\n[[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] was born in 1784, five years before the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. He spent his younger years working at a ''[[Pastry|p\u00e2tisserie]]'' until he was discovered by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], who would later cook for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Car\u00eame had become known for his ''[[Pi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e|pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es]]'', which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.<ref name=\"Mennell\">{{Cite book | last = Mennell | first = Stephen | title = All Manners of Food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present, 2nd ed. | publisher=University of Illinois Press | year = 1996 | location = Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-06490-6}}</ref>{{rp|144\u2013145}}\n\nMore important to Car\u00eame's career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking was his sauces, which he named [[mother sauce]]s. Often referred to as [[fond]]s, meaning \"foundations\", these base sauces, ''[[espagnole]]'', ''[[velout\u00e9]]'', and ''[[b\u00e9chamel]]'', are still known today. Each of these sauces was made in large quantities in his kitchen, then formed the basis of multiple derivatives. Car\u00eame had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire. In his writings, souffl\u00e9s appear for the first time. Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that existed beforehand. Central to his codification of the cuisine were ''Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais'' (1822), ''Le Cuisinier parisien'' (1828) and ''L'Art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1833\u20135).<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|144\u2013148}}\n\n===Late 19th century \u2013 early 20th century===\n[[File:Auguste Escoffier 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]]]]\n[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]] is commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of ''haute cuisine'' and organizing what would become the national cuisine of France. His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s \u2013 1890s. The [[Savoy Hotel]] managed by [[C\u00e9sar Ritz]] was an early hotel in which Escoffier worked, but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921. He created a system of \"parties\" called the [[brigade system]], which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations.\n\nThese five stations included the \"[[garde manger]]\" that prepared cold dishes; the \"entremettier\" prepared starches and vegetables, the \"r\u00f4tisseur\" prepared roasts, grilled and fried dishes; the \"[[saucier]]\" prepared sauces and soups; and the \"p\u00e2tissier\" prepared all pastry and desserts items. This system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on one's own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish. An example used is \"oeufs au plat Meyerbeer\", the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish, while in the new system, the eggs would be prepared by the entremettier, kidney grilled by the r\u00f4tisseur, truffle sauce made by the saucier and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|157\u2013159}}\n\nEscoffier also simplified and organized the modern menu and structure of the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his ''Livre des menus'' in 1912. This type of service embraced the [[service \u00e0 la russe]] (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which F\u00e9lix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''[[Le Guide Culinaire]]'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Phil\u00e9as Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|159\u2013160}}\n\n''Le Guide Culinaire'' deemphasized the use of heavy sauces and leaned toward lighter [[White stock|fumet]]s, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose function is to add to the flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Car\u00eame, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's ''Viander'', which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of ''haute cuisine''.\n\nExpensive ingredients would replace the common ingredients, making the dishes much less humble. The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself, who invented many new dishes, such as [[p\u00eache Melba]].<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|160\u2013162}}  Escoffier updated ''Le Guide Culinaire'' four times during his lifetime, noting in the foreword to the book's first edition that even with its 5,000 recipes, the book should not be considered an \"exhaustive\" text, and that even if it were at the point when he wrote the book, \"it would no longer be so tomorrow, because progress marches on each day.\"<ref>{{Cite book | last = Escoffier | first = Georges Auguste | title = Escoffier: The Complete Guide to the Art of Modern Cookery | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year = 2002 | location = New York | pages = Foreword | isbn = 978-0-471-29016-2}}</ref>\n\n===Mid-20th century \u2013 late 20th century===\n[[File:Paul Bocuse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Bocuse]]]]\nThe 1960s brought about innovative thought to the French cuisine, especially because of the contribution of Portuguese immigrants who had come to the country fleeing the forced drafting to the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial Wars]] Portugal was fighting in Africa. Many new dishes were introduced, as well as techniques.\n\nThis period is also marked by the appearance of the [[nouvelle cuisine]]. The term \"nouvelle cuisine\" has been used many times in the history of French cuisine which emphasized the freshness, lightness and clarity of flavor and inspired by new movements in world cuisine. In the 1740s, [[Menon (cookbook author)|Menon]] first used the term, but the cooking of [[Vincent La Chapelle]] and Fran\u00e7ois Marin was also considered modern. In the 1960s, [[Henri Gault]] and [[Christian Millau]] revived it to describe the cooking of [[Paul Bocuse]], [[Jean Troisgros|Jean]] and [[Pierre Troisgros]], [[Michel Gu\u00e9rard]], Roger Verg\u00e9 and [[Raymond Oliver]].<ref>''Joyeuse encyclop\u00e9die anecdotique de la gastronomie'', [[Michel Ferracci-Porri]] and Maryline Paoli, Preface by Christian Millau, Ed. Normant 2012, France {{ISBN|978-2-915685-55-8}}</ref> These chefs were working toward rebelling against the \"orthodoxy\" of [[Escoffier]]'s cuisine. Some of the chefs were students of [[Fernand Point]] at the ''[[La Pyramide|Pyramide]]'' in [[Vienne]], and had left to open their own restaurants. Gault and Millau \"discovered the formula\" contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nThe first characteristic was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and p\u00e2t\u00e9s was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as [[espagnole]] and b\u00e9chamel thickened with flour based \"roux\", in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of ''haute cuisine'' dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth and finally, the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nSome have speculated that a contributor to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Hewitt | first = Nicholas | title = The Cambridge Companion to Modern French Culture | publisher=The Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | location = Cambridge | pages = 109\u2013110 | isbn = 978-0-521-79465-7}}</ref> By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the ''haute cuisine'' style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n==National cuisine==\n{{Main article|List of French dishes}}\nThere are many dishes that are considered part of French national cuisine today.\n\nA meal often consists of three courses, ''hors d'\u0153uvre'' or ''entr\u00e9e'' (introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), ''fromage'' (cheese course) or ''dessert'', sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert.\n\n;Hors d'\u0153uvre\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|''Basil salmon [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]''\nFile:Lobster bisque.jpg|''[[Bisque (food)|Bisque]]'' is a smooth and creamy French ''[[potage]]''.\nFile:Foie gras en cocotte.jpg|''[[Foie gras]]'' with mustard seeds and green onions in duck ''[[Au jus|jus]]''\nFile:Croque monsieur.jpg|''[[Croque monsieur]]''\n</gallery>\n\n;Plat principal\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Pot-au-feu2.jpg|''[[Pot-au-feu]]'' is a ''[[cuisine classique]]'' dish.\nFile:Flickr - cyclonebill - B\u00f8f med pommes frites (1).jpg|''[[Steak frites]]'' is a simple and popular dish.\n</gallery>\n\n;P\u00e2tisserie\n\n<gallery perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Lille Meert2.JPG|Typical French ''[[p\u00e2tisserie]]''\nFile:Mille-feuille 20100916.jpg|''[[Mille-feuille]]''\nFile:Arc-en-ciel comestible.jpg|''[[Macaron]]\nFile:Eclairs at Fauchon in Paris.jpg|''[[\u00c9clair]]\n</gallery>\n\n;Dessert\n\n<gallery perrow=\"7\">\nFile:Creme Brulee.jpeg|''[[Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]]''\nFile:Chocolate mousse.jpg|''[[Chocolate mousse|Mousse au chocolat]]''\nFile:Cr\u00eape Suzette au Citron.jpg|''[[Cr\u00eape]]\nFile:Ujuvad saarekesed.jpg|''floating island''\n</gallery>\n\n==Regional cuisine==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements+r\u00e9gions (France).svg|thumb|250px|The 22 [[regions of France|regions]] and 96 [[departments of France|departments]] of [[metropolitan France]] include [[Corsica]] (''Corse'', lower right).

High-quality produce comes from the region's hinterland, especially goat cheese. This region and in the [[Vend\u00e9e]] is grazing ground for ''Parthenaise'' cattle, while poultry is raised in [[Challans]]. The region of [[Poitou-Charentes]] purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. [[Cognac (drink)|Cognac]] is also made in the region along the [[Charente River]]. [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] is home to the [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin cattle]], as well as sheep. The woodlands offer game and mushrooms. The southern area around [[Brive]] draws its cooking influence from [[P\u00e9rigord]] and [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] to produce a robust cuisine.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|237}}\n\n===Bordeaux, P\u00e9rigord, Gascony, and Basque country===\n{{Main article|Basque cuisine}}\n[[Bordeaux]] is known for its wine, with certain areas offering specialty grapes for wine-making. Fishing is popular in the region for the cuisine, sea fishing in the [[Bay of Biscay]], trapping in the [[Garonne]] and stream fishing in the [[Pyrenees]]. The Pyrenees also support lamb, such as the ''\"Agneau de Pauillac\"'', as well as sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the ''[[Blonde d'Aquitaine]]'', ''Boeuf de Chalosse'', ''Boeuf Gras de Bazas'', and ''Garonnaise''. Free-range chicken, turkey, pigeon, [[capon]], goose and duck prevail in the region as well.  [[Gascony]] and [[P\u00e9rigord]] cuisines includes ''pat\u00e9s'', ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s'', ''[[confit]]s'' and ''magrets''. This is one of the regions notable for its production of [[foie gras]] or fattened goose or duck liver. The cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based.  [[Armagnac (drink)|Armagnac]] is also from this region, as are prunes from [[Agen]].<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|259,295}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Confitdecanard.jpg|''[[Confit de canard]]''\nFile:Foie gras with sauternes.jpg|A ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]'' of ''[[foie gras]]'' with a bottle of ''[[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]''\nFile:Truffe coup\u00e9e.jpg|Black P\u00e9rigord ''[[Truffle]]''\nFile:Tourin.jpg|''[[Tourin]]'', a garlic soup from [[Dordogne]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Toulouse, Quercy, and Aveyron===\n[[Gers]], a department of France, is within this region and has poultry, while [[La Montagne Noire]] and [[Lacaune]] area offers hams and dry sausages. White corn is planted heavily in the area both for use in fattening the ducks and geese for foie gras and for the production of ''millas'', a cornmeal porridge.  [[Haricot bean]]s are also grown in this area, which are central to the dish [[cassoulet]]. The finest sausage in France is commonly acknowledged to be the ''saucisse de Toulouse'', which also finds its way into their version of ''cassoulet'' of [[Toulouse]]. The [[Cahors]] area produces a  specialty \"black wine\" as well as [[truffle]]s and mushrooms.\n\nThis region also produces milk-fed lamb. Unpasteurized [[domestic sheep|ewe]]'s milk is used to produce the [[Roquefort]] in [[Aveyron]], while  in [[Laguiole]] is producing unpasteurized cow's milk cheese. The [[Salers]] cattle produce milk for cheese, as well as beef and veal products. The volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|313}} Cab\u00e9cou cheese is from Rocamadour, a medieval settlement erected directly on a cliff, in the rich countryside of Causses du Quercy.  This area is one of the region's oldest milk producers; it has chalky soil, marked by history and human activity, and is favourable for the raising of goats.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bol d'aligot.jpg|''[[Aligot]]''\nFile:Roquefort cheese.jpg|''[[Roquefort]]'' cheese\nFile:Bowl of cassoulet.JPG|''[[Cassoulet]]''\n</gallery>\n\n===Roussillon, Languedoc, and C\u00e9vennes===\nRestaurants are popular in the area known as ''[[Le Midi]]''. Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the restaurants of Bouzigues, Meze, and [[S\u00e8te]]. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of S\u00e8te, ''Bourride'', ''Tielles'' and ''Rouille de seiche''. In the [[Languedoc]]  ''jambon cru'', sometimes known as ''jambon de montagne'' is produced. High quality ''[[Roquefort]]'' comes from the ''brebis'' (sheep) on the [[Larzac]] plateau. The [[C\u00e9vennes|Les C\u00e9vennes]] area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, ''p\u00e2t\u00e9s'' and goat cheeses.  [[Catalan people|Catalan]] influence can be seen in the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a pur\u00e9e of dried [[Cod (food)|cod]] wrapped in [[Chard|mangold]] leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific ''Catalan'' style known as a ''cargolade''. [[Wild boar]] can be found in the more mountainous regions of the ''Midi''.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|349,360}}\n\n===Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur===\n{{See also|Provencal cuisine}}\n\nThe [[Provence]] and [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] region is rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits and herbs; the region is one of the largest suppliers of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. [[Lavender]] is used in many dishes found in ''Haute Provence''. Other important herbs in the cuisine include [[thyme]], [[Common sage|sage]], [[rosemary]], [[basil]], [[Satureja|savory]], [[fennel]], [[marjoram]], [[tarragon]], [[oregano]], and [[bay leaf]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice-cooking.com/la-cuisine-nicoise/|title=Nice Cooking|publisher=La Cuisine Ni\u00e7oise|accessdate=2015-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011041615/http://www.nice-cooking.com/la-cuisine-nicoise/|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in ''Poulet Proven\u00e7al'', which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and [[Pastis]] is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. [[Thirteen desserts]] in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provenceweb.fr/e/mag/terroir/traditions/ukindex.htm |title=Christmas traditions |publisher=Provenceweb.fr |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> e.g. [[quince cheese]], biscuits, almonds, [[nougat]], apple, and [[fougasse (bread)|fougasse]].\n\nRice is grown in the [[Camargue]], which is the northernmost rice growing area in Europe, with [[Camargue red rice]] being a specialty.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|387,403,404,410,416}} Anibal Camous, a Marseillais who lived to be 104, maintained that it was by eating garlic daily that he kept his \"youth\" and brilliance.

Cheeses are also produced, with \"[[brocciu]]\" being the most popular. [[Chestnut]]s, growing in the Castagniccia forest, are used to produce flour, which is used in turn to make bread, cakes and [[polenta]]. The forest provides acorns used to feed the pigs and [[boar]]s that provide much of the protein for the island's cuisine. Fresh fish and seafood are common. The island's pork is used to make fine hams, sausage and other unique items including ''[[capicola|coppa]]'' (dried rib cut), ''lonzu'' (dried pork fillet), ''figatella'', ''salumu'' (a dried sausage) ''salcietta'', ''Panzetta'', bacon, ''figatellu'' (smoked and dried liverwurst) and ''prisuttu'' (farmer's ham).  [[Clementine]]s (which hold an AOC designation), lemons, nectarines and figs are grown there. Candied [[citron]] is used in [[nougat]]s, while and the aforementioned brocciu and chestnuts are also used in desserts. Corsica offers a variety of wines and fruit liqueurs, including [[Cap Corse]], [[Patrimonio]], ''C\u00e9dratine'', ''Bonapartine'', ''liqueur de myrte'', ''vins de fruit'', ''Rappu'', and ''[[eau-de-vie]] de ch\u00e2taigne''.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|435,441,442}}\n\n===French Guiana===\n{{See also|Guianan cuisine|Awara broth}}\n\n'''French Guianan cuisine''' or '''Guianan cuisine''' is a blend of the different cultures that have settled in [[French Guiana]]. Creole and Chinese restaurants are common in major cities such as [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]] and [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]]. Many indigenous animal species such as [[caiman]] and [[tapir]] are used in spiced stews.\n\n==Specialties by season==\nFrench cuisine varies according to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.\n\nWith the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned ''[[hypermarch\u00e9]]'', these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, but they are still observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. [[Crayfish (food)|Crayfish]], for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season.<ref>Imported crayfish are unrestricted, and many arrive from Pakistan.</ref> Moreover, they do not freeze well.\n\n==Foods and ingredients==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown vegetables, such as ''pomme de terre'' (potato), ''bl\u00e9'' ([[wheat]]), ''[[Green bean|haricots verts]]'' (a type of French green bean), ''carotte'' (carrot), ''poireau'' ([[leek]]), ''navet'' ([[turnip]]), ''aubergine'' ([[eggplant]]), ''courgette'' ([[zucchini]]), and ''\u00e9chalotte'' ([[shallot]]).\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown fungi, such as ''truffe'' ([[Tuber (genus)|truffle]]), ''champignon de Paris'' ([[button mushroom]]), ''chanterelle ou girolle'' ([[chanterelle]]), ''pleurote (en hu\u00eetre)'' ([[oyster mushroom]]s), and ''c\u00e8pes'' ([[porcini]]).\n\nCommon fruits include oranges, tomatoes, [[tangerine]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[plum]]s, [[Cherry|cherries]], [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[redcurrant]]s, [[Blackberry|blackberries]], [[grape]]s, [[grapefruit]], and [[blackcurrant]]s.\n\nVarieties of meat consumed include ''poulet'' ([[Chicken (food)|chicken]]), ''pigeon'' ([[Squab (food)|squab]]), ''canard'' ([[Duck (food)|duck]]), ''oie'' ([[goose]], the source of [[foie gras]]), ''b\u0153uf'' ([[beef]]), ''veau'' ([[veal]]), ''porc'' ([[pork]]), ''agneau'' ([[Lamb (food)|lamb]]), ''mouton'' ([[mutton]]), ''caille'' ([[quails in cookery|quail]]), ''cheval'' ([[horse meat|horse]]), ''grenouille'' ([[frog legs|frog]]), and ''[[escargot]]'' (snails). Commonly consumed fish and seafood include [[Cod (food)|cod]], [[canned sardines]], [[sardine (food)|fresh sardines]], canned [[tuna]], fresh tuna, [[Salmon (food)|salmon]], [[trout]], [[mussel]]s, [[Herring (food)|herring]], [[oyster]]s, [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]] and [[calamari]].\n\nEggs are fine quality and often eaten as: [[omelette]]s, hard-boiled with [[mayonnaise]], [[Scrambled eggs|scrambled]] plain, scrambled ''haute cuisine'' preparation, \u0153uf \u00e0 la coque.\n\nHerbs and seasonings vary by region, and include ''[[fleur de sel]]'', ''[[herbes de Provence]]'', [[tarragon]], [[rosemary]], [[marjoram]], [[lavender]], [[thyme]], [[fennel]], and [[Common sage|sage]].\n\nFresh fruit and vegetables, as well as fish and meat, can be purchased either from supermarkets or specialty shops. Street markets are held on certain days in most localities; some towns have a more permanent covered market enclosing food shops, especially meat and fish retailers. These have better shelter than the periodic street markets.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Herbesdeprovence.jpg|''[[Herbes de provence]]''\nFile:Charetveau.jpg|''[[Charolais cattle]]''\nFile:Champignons Agaricus.jpg|''[[Champignon de Paris]]''\nFile:HaricotsVerts2.JPG|''[[Haricot bean|Haricots verts]]''\nFile:France-AOC Piment d'Espelette-2005-08-05.jpg|''[[Espelette pepper|Piments d'Espelette]]''\nFile:Fleur de sel2.jpg|''[[Fleur de sel]] de [[Gu\u00e9rande]]''\nFile:Wine grapes03.jpg|''[[Grape|Grappe de raisin]]''\nFile:Bresseh\u00fchner-1.jpg|''[[Poulet de Bresse]]''\nFile:Wheat close-up.JPG|''Bl\u00e9 ([[Wheat]])''\nFile:Truffe noire du P\u00e9rigord.jpg|''[[Black Truffle|Black P\u00e9rigord truffle]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Structure of meals==\n\n===Breakfast===\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coffee|Caf\u00e9]] with a [[croissant]] for breakfast]]\n\n''Le petit d\u00e9jeuner'' (breakfast) is traditionally a quick meal consisting of ''tartines'' (slices) of French bread with butter and honey or jam (sometimes [[brioche]]), along with caf\u00e9 au lait (also called \"caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me\"), or black coffee, or tea<ref>{{cite book|title=Larousse Gastronomique|year=2009|publisher=Clarkson Potter|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-46491-0|page=780}}</ref> and rarely hot chicory. Children often drink [[hot chocolate]] in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts. ''[[Croissants]]'', ''[[pain aux raisins]]'' or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' (also named ''chocolatine'' in the south of France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. Breakfast of some kind is always served in caf\u00e9s opening early in the day.\n\nThere are also savoury dishes for breakfast. An example is \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner gaulois\" or \"petit d\u00e9jeuner fermier\" with the famous long narrow bread slices with soft white cheese topped or boiled ham, called ''mouillettes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/mouillette/52900|title=D\u00e9finitions : mouillette - Dictionnaire de fran\u00e7ais Larousse|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|website=www.larousse.fr|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> which is dipped in a soft-boiled egg and some fruit juice and hot drink.\n\nAnother variation called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner chasseur\", meant to be very hearty, is served with p\u00e2t\u00e9 and other charcuterie products. A more classy version is called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner du voyageur\", where delicatessens serve gizzard, bacon, salmon, omelet, or croque-monsieur, with or without soft-boiled egg and always with the traditional coffee/tea/chocolate along fruits or fruit juice. When the egg is cooked sunny-side over the croque-monsieur, it is called a croque-madame.\n\nIn ''Germinal'' and other novels, \u00c9mile Zola also reported the ''briquet'': two long bread slices stuffed with butter, cheese and or ham. It can be eaten as a standing/walking breakfast, or meant as a \"second\" one before lunch.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]'', Philippe Abrams ([[Kad Merad]]) and Antoine Bailleul ([[Dany Boon]]) share together countless breakfasts consisting of ''tartines de Maroilles'' (a rather strong cheese) along with their hot chicory.\n\n===Lunch===\n''Le d\u00e9jeuner'' (lunch) is a two-hour mid-day meal or a one-hour lunch break. In some smaller towns and in the south of France, the two-hour lunch may still be customary. Sunday lunches are often longer and are taken with the family.<ref name=\"Steele\"/> Restaurants normally open for lunch at noon and close at 2:30&nbsp;pm.

For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for [[white-collar worker]]s to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and ''[[traiteur (culinary profession)|traiteurs]]''; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three courses of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among [[blue-collar worker]]s, is eating sandwiches followed by a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets at budget prices.\n\n===Dinner===\n''Le d\u00eener'' (dinner) often consists of three [[full course dinner|courses]], ''[[hors d'\u0153uvre]]'' or ''[[entr\u00e9e]]'' (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, [[French wine|wine]] and [[mineral water]]. Most of the time the bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{Cite book | last = Steele | first = Ross | title = The French Way, 2nd ed. | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year = 2001  | location = New York | isbn = }}</ref>{{rp|82}} Restaurants often open at 7:30&nbsp;pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00&nbsp;pm and 11:00&nbsp;pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.<ref name=\"Fodors\" />{{rp|342}}\n\n==Beverages and drinks <span id=\"drinks\"></span>==\nIn French cuisine, beverages that precede a meal are called [[ap\u00e9ritif]]s (literally: ''that opens the appetite''), and can be served with [[amuse-bouche]]s (literally: ''mouth amuser''). Those that end it are called [[digestif]]s.\n\n;Ap\u00e9ritifs\n\nThe ap\u00e9ritif varies from region to region: [[Pastis]] is popular in the south of France, [[Cr\u00e9mant d'Alsace]] in the eastern region. [[Champagne]] can also be served. [[Kir (cocktail)|Kir]], also called ''Blanc-cassis'', is a common and popular ap\u00e9ritif-cocktail made with a measure of [[cr\u00e8me de cassis]] (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with [[white wine]]. The phrase ''Kir Royal'' is used when white wine is replaced with a ''Champagne'' wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as [[Beaujolais nouveau]], can also be presented as an ap\u00e9ritif, accompanied by [[amuse-bouche]]s. Some ap\u00e9ritifs can be [[fortified wine]]s with added herbs, such as [[cinchona]], [[gentian]] and [[vermouth]]. Trade names that sell well include [[Suze (drink)|Suze]] (the classic gentiane), [[Byrrh]], [[Dubonnet]], and [[Noilly Prat]].\n\n;Digestifs\n\nDigestifs are traditionally stronger, and include [[Cognac (brandy)|Cognac]], [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]], [[Calvados (brandy)|Calvados]], [[Eau de vie]] and fruit alcohols.\n\n==Christmas==\nA typical French Christmas dish is turkey with chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and ''foie gras''. The Yule log is a very French tradition during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal in reference to the twelve apostles and Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheznoscousins.com/2014/12/30/10-traditions-noel-francaises/|title=10 traditions de No\u00ebl fran\u00e7aises - Cheznoscousins.com|date=30 December 2014|accessdate=6 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009113740/http://www.cheznoscousins.com/2014/12/30/10-traditions-noel-francaises/|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009134140/http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |archivedate=9 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ambafrance-at.org/Noel-le-Nouvel-An-et-la-Fete-des-Rois ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://referat.clopotel.ro/Les_fetes_de_Noel_en_France-14079.html|title=LES FETES DE NOEL EN FRANCE|website=referat.clopotel.ro|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:B\u00fbche de No\u00ebl chocolat framboise maison.jpg|thumb|Yule log, a French Christmas tradition]]\n\n==Food establishments==\n[[File:Cooks 050918 154402.jpg|thumb|Cooks at work]]\n\n===History{{Anchor|History of restaurants}}===\nThe modern restaurant has its origins in French culture. Prior to the late 18th century, diners who wished to \"dine out\" would visit their local [[guild]] member's kitchen and have their meal prepared for them. However, guild members were limited to producing whatever their guild registry delegated to them.<ref name=\"Spang\">{{Cite book | last = Spang | first = Rebecca L. | title = The Invention of the Restaurant, 2nd Ed. | publisher=Harvard University Press | year = 2001 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-674-00685-0}}</ref>{{rp|8\u201310}} These guild members offered food in their own homes to steady clientele that appeared day-to-day but at set times. The guest would be offered the meal [[table d'h\u00f4te]], which is a meal offered at a set price with very little choice of dishes, sometimes none at all.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\nThe first steps toward the modern restaurant were locations that offered ''restorative'' [[Bouillon (broth)|bouillons]], or ''restaurants'' \u2013 these words being the origin of the name \"restaurant\". This step took place during the 1760s\u20131770s. These locations were open at all times of the day, featuring ornate tableware and reasonable prices. These locations were meant more as meal replacements for those who had \"lost their appetites and suffered from jaded palates and weak chests.\"<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|34\u201335}}\n\nIn 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, [[pastry chef]] to the future [[Louis XVIII]], opened one of the most popular restaurants of the time \u2013 the ''Grande Taverne de Londres'' \u2013 in the arcades of the [[Palais-Royal]]. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing [[Kings of France|monarchy of France]], in the period leading up to the [[French Revolution]]. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and the substantial discretionary income of the [[French Directory]]'s ''[[nouveau riche]]'' helped keep these new restaurants in business.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|140\u2013144}}\n\n[[File:Train bleu 05.jpg|thumb|Restaurant ''Le Train Bleu'', in Paris]]\n[[File:Bouchon leTablier.jpg|thumb|A [[bouchon]], ''Le tablier'' (the apron), in Vieux Lyon]]\n[[File:Caf\u00e9 de Flore.jpg|thumb|''Caf\u00e9 de Flore'', in Paris]]\n[[File:Lille - Estaminet 'T Rijsel - 20190423 (1).jpg|thumb|An estaminet in Lille]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Categories\n!English\n!French\n!Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=2|[[Restaurant]]\n|More than 5,000 in Paris alone, with varying levels of prices and menus.

In the 14th century, [[Guillaume Tirel]], a [[Court (royal)|court]] [[chef]] known as \"Taillevent\", wrote ''[[Le Viandier]]'', one of the earliest [[recipe]] collections of [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval France]]. In the 17th century, chefs [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne]] and [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style. [[French cheese|Cheese]] and [[French wine|wine]] are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and ''[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nFrench cuisine was made important in the 20th century by [[Auguste Escoffier]] to become the modern ''[[haute cuisine]]''; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary character to be found in the [[regions of France]] and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. [[Culinary tourism]] and the ''[[Guide Michelin]]'' helped to acquaint people{{who|date=November 2019}} with the ''[[cuisine bourgeoise]]'' of the urban elites{{dubious|date=November 2019}} and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. [[Gascony|Gascon]] cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.\n\nKnowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards and [[culinary art|culinary education]]. In November 2010, French [[gastronomy]] was added by the [[UNESCO]] to its lists of the world's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|\"intangible cultural heritage\"]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-culture_17int.ART.State.Edition1.b21e71.html Bon app\u00e9tit: Your meal is certified by the UN] Dallas Morning News</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/celebrations_healing_techniques_crafts_and_culinary_arts_added_to_the_representative_list_of_the_intangible_cultural_heritage/ |title=Celebrations, healing techniques, crafts and culinary arts added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage |publisher=UNESCO |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n    [[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|left|[[John, Duke of Berry]] enjoying a grand meal.

On the table to the left of the Duke is a golden [[salt cellar]], or ''nef'', in the shape of a ship; illustration from ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'', circa 1410.]]\n\nIn French [[medieval cuisine]], banquets were common among the [[aristocracy]]. Multiple courses would be prepared, but served in a style called ''service en confusion'', or all at once. Food was generally eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, and it was not until the very end of the [[Late Middle Ages]] that the [[shortcrust pastry|shortcrust]] pie was developed. Meals often ended with an ''issue de table'', which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of ''[[drag\u00e9e]]s'' (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as [[hypocras]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\">{{Cite book | last = Wheaton | first = Barbara Ketcham | title = Savoring the Past: The French Kitchen and Table from 1300 to 1789 | publisher = First Touchstone | year = 1996 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-684-81857-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_d5z8 }}</ref>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\nThe ingredients of the time varied greatly according to the seasons and the church calendar, and many items were preserved with salt, spices, honey, and other preservatives. Late spring, summer, and autumn afforded abundance, while winter meals were more sparse. Livestock were slaughtered at the beginning of winter. Beef was often salted, while pork was salted and smoked. Bacon and sausages would be smoked in the chimney, while the tongue and hams were [[brine]]d and dried.  Cucumbers were brined as well, while greens would be packed in jars with salt. Fruits, nuts and root vegetables would be boiled in honey for preservation. Whale, dolphin and porpoise were considered fish, so during [[Lent]], the salted meats of these sea mammals were eaten.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|9\u201312}}\n\nArtificial freshwater ponds (often called ''stews'') held [[carp]], [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[tench]], [[bream]], [[Eel (food)|eel]], and other fish. Poultry was kept in special yards, with pigeon and [[Squab (food)|squab]] being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included [[venison]], [[wild boar]], hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as [[tansy]], [[rue]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], and [[hyssop]], which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time \u2013 they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and [[mace (spice)|mace]]. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are [[cubeb]]s, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), [[grains of paradise]], and [[galangal|galengale]]. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and ''[[verjus]]'' combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial to make use of nutrients.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|13\u201315}}\n\nVisual display was prized. Brilliant colors were obtained by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of [[leek]]s. Yellow came from [[saffron]] or egg yolk, while red came from [[sunflower]], and purple came from ''[[Crozophora tinctoria]]'' or ''[[Heliotropium europaeum]]''. Gold and [[Metal leaf|silver leaf]] were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as ''tourte parmerienne'' which was a pastry dish made to look like a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with [[gold leaf]]. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast [[swan]] or [[peafowl|peacock]] sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being [[gilded]]. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|15\u201316}}\n\nThe most well known French chef of the Middle Ages was [[Guillaume Tirel]], also known as Taillevent. Taillevent worked in numerous royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], then the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] who was son of [[John II of France|John II]]. The Dauphin became King [[Charles V of France]] in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, ''marmites'', on it.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|18\u201321}}\n\n===Ancien R\u00e9gime===\n\nParis was the central hub of culture and economic activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as ''[[Les Halles]]'', ''la M\u00e9gisserie'', those found along ''[[Rue Mouffetard]]'', and similar smaller versions in other cities were very important to the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the [[guild]] system, which developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government as well as by the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|71\u201372}}\n\nThere were two groups of guilds \u2013 first, those that supplied the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers, [[pastry chef|pastry cook]]s, sauce makers, poulterers, and [[caterer]]s. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the ''[[charcuterie|charcutiers]]'' and ''r\u00f4tisseurs'' (purveyors of roasted meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|72\u201373}}  The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed a high level of income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the [[guild]] hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks' guild regulations allowed for this movement.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|73}}\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the [[New World]]. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519\u20131589?) serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|81}}  The dish called [[cassoulet]] has its roots in the New World discovery of [[haricot bean]]s, which are central to the dish's creation, but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|85}}\n\n''Haute cuisine'' ({{IPA-fr|ot k\u0265izin|pron}}, \"high cuisine\") has foundations during the 17th century with a chef named [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne]]. As author of works such as ''Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois'', he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His book includes the earliest known reference to [[roux]] using pork fat. The book contained two sections, one for meat days, and one for [[fasting]]. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers. La Varenne also published a book on pastry in 1667 entitled ''Le Parfait confitvrier'' (republished as ''Le Confiturier fran\u00e7ois'') which similarly updated and codified the emerging ''haute cuisine'' standards for desserts and pastries.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|114\u2013120}}\n\nChef [[Fran\u00e7ois Massialot]] wrote ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' in 1691, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. The book contains menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a [[marinade]] is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|149\u2013154}}\n\nThe successive updates of ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' include important refinements such as adding a glass of wine to [[stock (food)|fish stock]]. Definitions were also added to the 1703 edition. The 1712 edition, retitled ''Le Nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois'', was increased to two volumes, and was written in a more elaborate style with extensive explanations of technique. Additional smaller preparations are included in this edition as well, leading to lighter preparations, and adding a third course to the meal. [[Ragout]], a stew still central to French cookery, makes its first appearance as a single dish in this edition as well; prior to that, it was listed as a garnish.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|155}}\n\n===Late 18th century \u2013  early 19th century===\n\n[[File:Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, reine de France (original copy) by Jean-Marc Nattier.png|thumb|The [[Poland|Polish]] wife of [[Louis XV of France]], Queen [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], influenced French cuisine.]]\n[[File:M-A-Careme.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]]]]\nShortly before the French Revolution, dishes like [[bouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la Reine]] gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine produced by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on [[vol-au-vent]] created under the influence of Queen [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], the Polish-born wife of [[Louis XV]]. This recipe is still popular today, as are other recipes from Queen Marie Leszczy\u0144ska like [[consomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la Reine]] and [[filet d'aloyau brais\u00e9 \u00e0 la royale]]. Queen Marie is also credited with introducing [[lentil]]s to the French diet and [[Polonaise (sauce)|Polonaise garnishing]].\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] was integral to the expansion of French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Bread was a significant food source among peasants and the working class in the late 18th century, with many of the nation's people being dependent on it. In French provinces, bread was often consumed three times a day by the people of France.<ref name=Brace>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1843902|jstor=1843902|title=The Problem of Bread and the French Revolution at Bordeaux|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=51|issue=4|pages=649\u2013667|year=1946|last1=Brace|first1=Richard Munthe}}</ref> According to Brace, bread was referred to as the basic dietary item for the masses, and it was also used as a foundation for soup.  In fact, bread was so important that harvest, interruption of commerce by wars, heavy flour exploration, and prices and supply were all watched and controlled by the French Government. Among the underprivileged, constant fear of famine was always prevalent. From 1725 to 1789, there was fourteen years of bad yields to blame for low grain supply. In Bordeaux, during 1708\u20131789, thirty-three bad harvests occurred.<ref name=Brace/>\n\n[[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] was born in 1784, five years before the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. He spent his younger years working at a ''[[Pastry|p\u00e2tisserie]]'' until he was discovered by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], who would later cook for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Car\u00eame had become known for his ''[[Pi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e|pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es]]'', which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.<ref name=\"Mennell\">{{Cite book | last = Mennell | first = Stephen | title = All Manners of Food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present, 2nd ed. | publisher=University of Illinois Press | year = 1996 | location = Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-06490-6}}</ref>{{rp|144\u2013145}}\n\nMore important to Car\u00eame's career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking was his sauces, which he named [[mother sauce]]s. Often referred to as [[fond]]s, meaning \"foundations\", these base sauces, ''[[espagnole]]'', ''[[velout\u00e9]]'', and ''[[b\u00e9chamel]]'', are still known today. Each of these sauces was made in large quantities in his kitchen, then formed the basis of multiple derivatives. Car\u00eame had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire. In his writings, souffl\u00e9s appear for the first time. Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that existed beforehand. Central to his codification of the cuisine were ''Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais'' (1822), ''Le Cuisinier parisien'' (1828) and ''L'Art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1833\u20135).<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|144\u2013148}}\n\n===Late 19th century \u2013 early 20th century===\n[[File:Auguste Escoffier 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]]]]\n[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]] is commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of ''haute cuisine'' and organizing what would become the national cuisine of France. His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s \u2013 1890s. The [[Savoy Hotel]] managed by [[C\u00e9sar Ritz]] was an early hotel in which Escoffier worked, but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921. He created a system of \"parties\" called the [[brigade system]], which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations.\n\nThese five stations included the \"[[garde manger]]\" that prepared cold dishes; the \"entremettier\" prepared starches and vegetables, the \"r\u00f4tisseur\" prepared roasts, grilled and fried dishes; the \"[[saucier]]\" prepared sauces and soups; and the \"p\u00e2tissier\" prepared all pastry and desserts items. This system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on one's own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish. An example used is \"oeufs au plat Meyerbeer\", the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish, while in the new system, the eggs would be prepared by the entremettier, kidney grilled by the r\u00f4tisseur, truffle sauce made by the saucier and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|157\u2013159}}\n\nEscoffier also simplified and organized the modern menu and structure of the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his ''Livre des menus'' in 1912. This type of service embraced the [[service \u00e0 la russe]] (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which F\u00e9lix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''[[Le Guide Culinaire]]'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Phil\u00e9as Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|159\u2013160}}\n\n''Le Guide Culinaire'' deemphasized the use of heavy sauces and leaned toward lighter [[White stock|fumet]]s, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose function is to add to the flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Car\u00eame, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's ''Viander'', which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of ''haute cuisine''.\n\nExpensive ingredients would replace the common ingredients, making the dishes much less humble. The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself, who invented many new dishes, such as [[p\u00eache Melba]].<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|160\u2013162}}  Escoffier updated ''Le Guide Culinaire'' four times during his lifetime, noting in the foreword to the book's first edition that even with its 5,000 recipes, the book should not be considered an \"exhaustive\" text, and that even if it were at the point when he wrote the book, \"it would no longer be so tomorrow, because progress marches on each day.\"<ref>{{Cite book | last = Escoffier | first = Georges Auguste | title = Escoffier: The Complete Guide to the Art of Modern Cookery | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year = 2002 | location = New York | pages = Foreword | isbn = 978-0-471-29016-2}}</ref>\n\n===Mid-20th century \u2013 late 20th century===\n[[File:Paul Bocuse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Bocuse]]]]\nThe 1960s brought about innovative thought to the French cuisine, especially because of the contribution of Portuguese immigrants who had come to the country fleeing the forced drafting to the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial Wars]] Portugal was fighting in Africa. Many new dishes were introduced, as well as techniques.\n\nThis period is also marked by the appearance of the [[nouvelle cuisine]]. The term \"nouvelle cuisine\" has been used many times in the history of French cuisine which emphasized the freshness, lightness and clarity of flavor and inspired by new movements in world cuisine. In the 1740s, [[Menon (cookbook author)|Menon]] first used the term, but the cooking of [[Vincent La Chapelle]] and Fran\u00e7ois Marin was also considered modern. In the 1960s, [[Henri Gault]] and [[Christian Millau]] revived it to describe the cooking of [[Paul Bocuse]], [[Jean Troisgros|Jean]] and [[Pierre Troisgros]], [[Michel Gu\u00e9rard]], Roger Verg\u00e9 and [[Raymond Oliver]].<ref>''Joyeuse encyclop\u00e9die anecdotique de la gastronomie'', [[Michel Ferracci-Porri]] and Maryline Paoli, Preface by Christian Millau, Ed. Normant 2012, France {{ISBN|978-2-915685-55-8}}</ref> These chefs were working toward rebelling against the \"orthodoxy\" of [[Escoffier]]'s cuisine. Some of the chefs were students of [[Fernand Point]] at the ''[[La Pyramide|Pyramide]]'' in [[Vienne]], and had left to open their own restaurants. Gault and Millau \"discovered the formula\" contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nThe first characteristic was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and p\u00e2t\u00e9s was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as [[espagnole]] and b\u00e9chamel thickened with flour based \"roux\", in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of ''haute cuisine'' dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth and finally, the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nSome have speculated that a contributor to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Hewitt | first = Nicholas | title = The Cambridge Companion to Modern French Culture | publisher=The Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | location = Cambridge | pages = 109\u2013110 | isbn = 978-0-521-79465-7}}</ref> By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the ''haute cuisine'' style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n==National cuisine==\n{{Main article|List of French dishes}}\nThere are many dishes that are considered part of French national cuisine today.\n\nA meal often consists of three courses, ''hors d'\u0153uvre'' or ''entr\u00e9e'' (introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), ''fromage'' (cheese course) or ''dessert'', sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert.\n\n;Hors d'\u0153uvre\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|''Basil salmon [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]''\nFile:Lobster bisque.jpg|''[[Bisque (food)|Bisque]]'' is a smooth and creamy French ''[[potage]]''.\nFile:Foie gras en cocotte.jpg|''[[Foie gras]]'' with mustard seeds and green onions in duck ''[[Au jus|jus]]''\nFile:Croque monsieur.jpg|''[[Croque monsieur]]''\n</gallery>\n\n;Plat principal\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Pot-au-feu2.jpg|''[[Pot-au-feu]]'' is a ''[[cuisine classique]]'' dish.\nFile:Flickr - cyclonebill - B\u00f8f med pommes frites (1).jpg|''[[Steak frites]]'' is a simple and popular dish.\n</gallery>\n\n;P\u00e2tisserie\n\n<gallery perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Lille Meert2.JPG|Typical French ''[[p\u00e2tisserie]]''\nFile:Mille-feuille 20100916.jpg|''[[Mille-feuille]]''\nFile:Arc-en-ciel comestible.jpg|''[[Macaron]]\nFile:Eclairs at Fauchon in Paris.jpg|''[[\u00c9clair]]\n</gallery>\n\n;Dessert\n\n<gallery perrow=\"7\">\nFile:Creme Brulee.jpeg|''[[Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]]''\nFile:Chocolate mousse.jpg|''[[Chocolate mousse|Mousse au chocolat]]''\nFile:Cr\u00eape Suzette au Citron.jpg|''[[Cr\u00eape]]\nFile:Ujuvad saarekesed.jpg|''floating island''\n</gallery>\n\n==Regional cuisine==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements+r\u00e9gions (France).svg|thumb|250px|The 22 [[regions of France|regions]] and 96 [[departments of France|departments]] of [[metropolitan France]] include [[Corsica]] (''Corse'', lower right).

High-quality produce comes from the region's hinterland, especially goat cheese. This region and in the [[Vend\u00e9e]] is grazing ground for ''Parthenaise'' cattle, while poultry is raised in [[Challans]]. The region of [[Poitou-Charentes]] purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. [[Cognac (drink)|Cognac]] is also made in the region along the [[Charente River]]. [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] is home to the [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin cattle]], as well as sheep. The woodlands offer game and mushrooms. The southern area around [[Brive]] draws its cooking influence from [[P\u00e9rigord]] and [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] to produce a robust cuisine.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|237}}\n\n===Bordeaux, P\u00e9rigord, Gascony, and Basque country===\n{{Main article|Basque cuisine}}\n[[Bordeaux]] is known for its wine, with certain areas offering specialty grapes for wine-making. Fishing is popular in the region for the cuisine, sea fishing in the [[Bay of Biscay]], trapping in the [[Garonne]] and stream fishing in the [[Pyrenees]]. The Pyrenees also support lamb, such as the ''\"Agneau de Pauillac\"'', as well as sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the ''[[Blonde d'Aquitaine]]'', ''Boeuf de Chalosse'', ''Boeuf Gras de Bazas'', and ''Garonnaise''. Free-range chicken, turkey, pigeon, [[capon]], goose and duck prevail in the region as well.  [[Gascony]] and [[P\u00e9rigord]] cuisines includes ''pat\u00e9s'', ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s'', ''[[confit]]s'' and ''magrets''. This is one of the regions notable for its production of [[foie gras]] or fattened goose or duck liver. The cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based.  [[Armagnac (drink)|Armagnac]] is also from this region, as are prunes from [[Agen]].<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|259,295}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Confitdecanard.jpg|''[[Confit de canard]]''\nFile:Foie gras with sauternes.jpg|A ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]'' of ''[[foie gras]]'' with a bottle of ''[[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]''\nFile:Truffe coup\u00e9e.jpg|Black P\u00e9rigord ''[[Truffle]]''\nFile:Tourin.jpg|''[[Tourin]]'', a garlic soup from [[Dordogne]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Toulouse, Quercy, and Aveyron===\n[[Gers]], a department of France, is within this region and has poultry, while [[La Montagne Noire]] and [[Lacaune]] area offers hams and dry sausages. White corn is planted heavily in the area both for use in fattening the ducks and geese for foie gras and for the production of ''millas'', a cornmeal porridge.  [[Haricot bean]]s are also grown in this area, which are central to the dish [[cassoulet]]. The finest sausage in France is commonly acknowledged to be the ''saucisse de Toulouse'', which also finds its way into their version of ''cassoulet'' of [[Toulouse]]. The [[Cahors]] area produces a  specialty \"black wine\" as well as [[truffle]]s and mushrooms.\n\nThis region also produces milk-fed lamb. Unpasteurized [[domestic sheep|ewe]]'s milk is used to produce the [[Roquefort]] in [[Aveyron]], while  in [[Laguiole]] is producing unpasteurized cow's milk cheese. The [[Salers]] cattle produce milk for cheese, as well as beef and veal products. The volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|313}} Cab\u00e9cou cheese is from Rocamadour, a medieval settlement erected directly on a cliff, in the rich countryside of Causses du Quercy.  This area is one of the region's oldest milk producers; it has chalky soil, marked by history and human activity, and is favourable for the raising of goats.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bol d'aligot.jpg|''[[Aligot]]''\nFile:Roquefort cheese.jpg|''[[Roquefort]]'' cheese\nFile:Bowl of cassoulet.JPG|''[[Cassoulet]]''\n</gallery>\n\n===Roussillon, Languedoc, and C\u00e9vennes===\nRestaurants are popular in the area known as ''[[Le Midi]]''. Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the restaurants of Bouzigues, Meze, and [[S\u00e8te]]. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of S\u00e8te, ''Bourride'', ''Tielles'' and ''Rouille de seiche''. In the [[Languedoc]]  ''jambon cru'', sometimes known as ''jambon de montagne'' is produced. High quality ''[[Roquefort]]'' comes from the ''brebis'' (sheep) on the [[Larzac]] plateau. The [[C\u00e9vennes|Les C\u00e9vennes]] area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, ''p\u00e2t\u00e9s'' and goat cheeses.  [[Catalan people|Catalan]] influence can be seen in the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a pur\u00e9e of dried [[Cod (food)|cod]] wrapped in [[Chard|mangold]] leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific ''Catalan'' style known as a ''cargolade''. [[Wild boar]] can be found in the more mountainous regions of the ''Midi''.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|349,360}}\n\n===Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur===\n{{See also|Provencal cuisine}}\n\nThe [[Provence]] and [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] region is rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits and herbs; the region is one of the largest suppliers of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. [[Lavender]] is used in many dishes found in ''Haute Provence''. Other important herbs in the cuisine include [[thyme]], [[Common sage|sage]], [[rosemary]], [[basil]], [[Satureja|savory]], [[fennel]], [[marjoram]], [[tarragon]], [[oregano]], and [[bay leaf]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice-cooking.com/la-cuisine-nicoise/|title=Nice Cooking|publisher=La Cuisine Ni\u00e7oise|accessdate=2015-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011041615/http://www.nice-cooking.com/la-cuisine-nicoise/|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in ''Poulet Proven\u00e7al'', which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and [[Pastis]] is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. [[Thirteen desserts]] in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provenceweb.fr/e/mag/terroir/traditions/ukindex.htm |title=Christmas traditions |publisher=Provenceweb.fr |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> e.g. [[quince cheese]], biscuits, almonds, [[nougat]], apple, and [[fougasse (bread)|fougasse]].\n\nRice is grown in the [[Camargue]], which is the northernmost rice growing area in Europe, with [[Camargue red rice]] being a specialty.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|387,403,404,410,416}} Anibal Camous, a Marseillais who lived to be 104, maintained that it was by eating garlic daily that he kept his \"youth\" and brilliance.

Cheeses are also produced, with \"[[brocciu]]\" being the most popular. [[Chestnut]]s, growing in the Castagniccia forest, are used to produce flour, which is used in turn to make bread, cakes and [[polenta]]. The forest provides acorns used to feed the pigs and [[boar]]s that provide much of the protein for the island's cuisine. Fresh fish and seafood are common. The island's pork is used to make fine hams, sausage and other unique items including ''[[capicola|coppa]]'' (dried rib cut), ''lonzu'' (dried pork fillet), ''figatella'', ''salumu'' (a dried sausage) ''salcietta'', ''Panzetta'', bacon, ''figatellu'' (smoked and dried liverwurst) and ''prisuttu'' (farmer's ham).  [[Clementine]]s (which hold an AOC designation), lemons, nectarines and figs are grown there. Candied [[citron]] is used in [[nougat]]s, while and the aforementioned brocciu and chestnuts are also used in desserts. Corsica offers a variety of wines and fruit liqueurs, including [[Cap Corse]], [[Patrimonio]], ''C\u00e9dratine'', ''Bonapartine'', ''liqueur de myrte'', ''vins de fruit'', ''Rappu'', and ''[[eau-de-vie]] de ch\u00e2taigne''.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|435,441,442}}\n\n===French Guiana===\n{{See also|Guianan cuisine|Awara broth}}\n\n'''French Guianan cuisine''' or '''Guianan cuisine''' is a blend of the different cultures that have settled in [[French Guiana]]. Creole and Chinese restaurants are common in major cities such as [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]] and [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]]. Many indigenous animal species such as [[caiman]] and [[tapir]] are used in spiced stews.\n\n==Specialties by season==\nFrench cuisine varies according to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.\n\nWith the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned ''[[hypermarch\u00e9]]'', these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, but they are still observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. [[Crayfish (food)|Crayfish]], for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season.<ref>Imported crayfish are unrestricted, and many arrive from Pakistan.</ref> Moreover, they do not freeze well.\n\n==Foods and ingredients==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown vegetables, such as ''pomme de terre'' (potato), ''bl\u00e9'' ([[wheat]]), ''[[Green bean|haricots verts]]'' (a type of French green bean), ''carotte'' (carrot), ''poireau'' ([[leek]]), ''navet'' ([[turnip]]), ''aubergine'' ([[eggplant]]), ''courgette'' ([[zucchini]]), and ''\u00e9chalotte'' ([[shallot]]).\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown fungi, such as ''truffe'' ([[Tuber (genus)|truffle]]), ''champignon de Paris'' ([[button mushroom]]), ''chanterelle ou girolle'' ([[chanterelle]]), ''pleurote (en hu\u00eetre)'' ([[oyster mushroom]]s), and ''c\u00e8pes'' ([[porcini]]).\n\nCommon fruits include oranges, tomatoes, [[tangerine]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[plum]]s, [[Cherry|cherries]], [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[redcurrant]]s, [[Blackberry|blackberries]], [[grape]]s, [[grapefruit]], and [[blackcurrant]]s.\n\nVarieties of meat consumed include ''poulet'' ([[Chicken (food)|chicken]]), ''pigeon'' ([[Squab (food)|squab]]), ''canard'' ([[Duck (food)|duck]]), ''oie'' ([[goose]], the source of [[foie gras]]), ''b\u0153uf'' ([[beef]]), ''veau'' ([[veal]]), ''porc'' ([[pork]]), ''agneau'' ([[Lamb (food)|lamb]]), ''mouton'' ([[mutton]]), ''caille'' ([[quails in cookery|quail]]), ''cheval'' ([[horse meat|horse]]), ''grenouille'' ([[frog legs|frog]]), and ''[[escargot]]'' (snails). Commonly consumed fish and seafood include [[Cod (food)|cod]], [[canned sardines]], [[sardine (food)|fresh sardines]], canned [[tuna]], fresh tuna, [[Salmon (food)|salmon]], [[trout]], [[mussel]]s, [[Herring (food)|herring]], [[oyster]]s, [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]] and [[calamari]].\n\nEggs are fine quality and often eaten as: [[omelette]]s, hard-boiled with [[mayonnaise]], [[Scrambled eggs|scrambled]] plain, scrambled ''haute cuisine'' preparation, \u0153uf \u00e0 la coque.\n\nHerbs and seasonings vary by region, and include ''[[fleur de sel]]'', ''[[herbes de Provence]]'', [[tarragon]], [[rosemary]], [[marjoram]], [[lavender]], [[thyme]], [[fennel]], and [[Common sage|sage]].\n\nFresh fruit and vegetables, as well as fish and meat, can be purchased either from supermarkets or specialty shops. Street markets are held on certain days in most localities; some towns have a more permanent covered market enclosing food shops, especially meat and fish retailers. These have better shelter than the periodic street markets.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Herbesdeprovence.jpg|''[[Herbes de provence]]''\nFile:Charetveau.jpg|''[[Charolais cattle]]''\nFile:Champignons Agaricus.jpg|''[[Champignon de Paris]]''\nFile:HaricotsVerts2.JPG|''[[Haricot bean|Haricots verts]]''\nFile:France-AOC Piment d'Espelette-2005-08-05.jpg|''[[Espelette pepper|Piments d'Espelette]]''\nFile:Fleur de sel2.jpg|''[[Fleur de sel]] de [[Gu\u00e9rande]]''\nFile:Wine grapes03.jpg|''[[Grape|Grappe de raisin]]''\nFile:Bresseh\u00fchner-1.jpg|''[[Poulet de Bresse]]''\nFile:Wheat close-up.JPG|''Bl\u00e9 ([[Wheat]])''\nFile:Truffe noire du P\u00e9rigord.jpg|''[[Black Truffle|Black P\u00e9rigord truffle]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Structure of meals==\n\n===Breakfast===\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coffee|Caf\u00e9]] with a [[croissant]] for breakfast]]\n\n''Le petit d\u00e9jeuner'' (breakfast) is traditionally a quick meal consisting of ''tartines'' (slices) of French bread with butter and honey or jam (sometimes [[brioche]]), along with caf\u00e9 au lait (also called \"caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me\"), or black coffee, or tea<ref>{{cite book|title=Larousse Gastronomique|year=2009|publisher=Clarkson Potter|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-46491-0|page=780}}</ref> and rarely hot chicory. Children often drink [[hot chocolate]] in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts. ''[[Croissants]]'', ''[[pain aux raisins]]'' or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' (also named ''chocolatine'' in the south of France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. Breakfast of some kind is always served in caf\u00e9s opening early in the day.\n\nThere are also savoury dishes for breakfast. An example is \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner gaulois\" or \"petit d\u00e9jeuner fermier\" with the famous long narrow bread slices with soft white cheese topped or boiled ham, called ''mouillettes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/mouillette/52900|title=D\u00e9finitions : mouillette - Dictionnaire de fran\u00e7ais Larousse|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|website=www.larousse.fr|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> which is dipped in a soft-boiled egg and some fruit juice and hot drink.\n\nAnother variation called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner chasseur\", meant to be very hearty, is served with p\u00e2t\u00e9 and other charcuterie products. A more classy version is called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner du voyageur\", where delicatessens serve gizzard, bacon, salmon, omelet, or croque-monsieur, with or without soft-boiled egg and always with the traditional coffee/tea/chocolate along fruits or fruit juice. When the egg is cooked sunny-side over the croque-monsieur, it is called a croque-madame.\n\nIn ''Germinal'' and other novels, \u00c9mile Zola also reported the ''briquet'': two long bread slices stuffed with butter, cheese and or ham. It can be eaten as a standing/walking breakfast, or meant as a \"second\" one before lunch.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]'', Philippe Abrams ([[Kad Merad]]) and Antoine Bailleul ([[Dany Boon]]) share together countless breakfasts consisting of ''tartines de Maroilles'' (a rather strong cheese) along with their hot chicory.\n\n===Lunch===\n''Le d\u00e9jeuner'' (lunch) is a two-hour mid-day meal or a one-hour lunch break. In some smaller towns and in the south of France, the two-hour lunch may still be customary. Sunday lunches are often longer and are taken with the family.<ref name=\"Steele\"/> Restaurants normally open for lunch at noon and close at 2:30&nbsp;pm.

For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for [[white-collar worker]]s to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and ''[[traiteur (culinary profession)|traiteurs]]''; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three courses of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among [[blue-collar worker]]s, is eating sandwiches followed by a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets at budget prices.\n\n===Dinner===\n''Le d\u00eener'' (dinner) often consists of three [[full course dinner|courses]], ''[[hors d'\u0153uvre]]'' or ''[[entr\u00e9e]]'' (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, [[French wine|wine]] and [[mineral water]]. Most of the time the bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{Cite book | last = Steele | first = Ross | title = The French Way, 2nd ed. | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year = 2001  | location = New York | isbn = }}</ref>{{rp|82}} Restaurants often open at 7:30&nbsp;pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00&nbsp;pm and 11:00&nbsp;pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.<ref name=\"Fodors\" />{{rp|342}}\n\n==Beverages and drinks <span id=\"drinks\"></span>==\nIn French cuisine, beverages that precede a meal are called [[ap\u00e9ritif]]s (literally: ''that opens the appetite''), and can be served with [[amuse-bouche]]s (literally: ''mouth amuser''). Those that end it are called [[digestif]]s.\n\n;Ap\u00e9ritifs\n\nThe ap\u00e9ritif varies from region to region: [[Pastis]] is popular in the south of France, [[Cr\u00e9mant d'Alsace]] in the eastern region. [[Champagne]] can also be served. [[Kir (cocktail)|Kir]], also called ''Blanc-cassis'', is a common and popular ap\u00e9ritif-cocktail made with a measure of [[cr\u00e8me de cassis]] (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with [[white wine]]. The phrase ''Kir Royal'' is used when white wine is replaced with a ''Champagne'' wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as [[Beaujolais nouveau]], can also be presented as an ap\u00e9ritif, accompanied by [[amuse-bouche]]s. Some ap\u00e9ritifs can be [[fortified wine]]s with added herbs, such as [[cinchona]], [[gentian]] and [[vermouth]]. Trade names that sell well include [[Suze (drink)|Suze]] (the classic gentiane), [[Byrrh]], [[Dubonnet]], and [[Noilly Prat]].\n\n;Digestifs\n\nDigestifs are traditionally stronger, and include [[Cognac (brandy)|Cognac]], [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]], [[Calvados (brandy)|Calvados]], [[Eau de vie]] and fruit alcohols.\n\n==Christmas==\nA typical French Christmas dish is turkey with chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and ''foie gras''. The Yule log is a very French tradition during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal in reference to the twelve apostles and Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheznoscousins.com/2014/12/30/10-traditions-noel-francaises/|title=10 traditions de No\u00ebl fran\u00e7aises - Cheznoscousins.com|date=30 December 2014|accessdate=6 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009113740/http://www.cheznoscousins.com/2014/12/30/10-traditions-noel-francaises/|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009134140/http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |archivedate=9 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ambafrance-at.org/Noel-le-Nouvel-An-et-la-Fete-des-Rois ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://referat.clopotel.ro/Les_fetes_de_Noel_en_France-14079.html|title=LES FETES DE NOEL EN FRANCE|website=referat.clopotel.ro|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:B\u00fbche de No\u00ebl chocolat framboise maison.jpg|thumb|Yule log, a French Christmas tradition]]\n\n==Food establishments==\n[[File:Cooks 050918 154402.jpg|thumb|Cooks at work]]\n\n===History{{Anchor|History of restaurants}}===\nThe modern restaurant has its origins in French culture. Prior to the late 18th century, diners who wished to \"dine out\" would visit their local [[guild]] member's kitchen and have their meal prepared for them. However, guild members were limited to producing whatever their guild registry delegated to them.<ref name=\"Spang\">{{Cite book | last = Spang | first = Rebecca L. | title = The Invention of the Restaurant, 2nd Ed. | publisher=Harvard University Press | year = 2001 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-674-00685-0}}</ref>{{rp|8\u201310}} These guild members offered food in their own homes to steady clientele that appeared day-to-day but at set times. The guest would be offered the meal [[table d'h\u00f4te]], which is a meal offered at a set price with very little choice of dishes, sometimes none at all.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\nThe first steps toward the modern restaurant were locations that offered ''restorative'' [[Bouillon (broth)|bouillons]], or ''restaurants'' \u2013 these words being the origin of the name \"restaurant\". This step took place during the 1760s\u20131770s. These locations were open at all times of the day, featuring ornate tableware and reasonable prices. These locations were meant more as meal replacements for those who had \"lost their appetites and suffered from jaded palates and weak chests.\"<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|34\u201335}}\n\nIn 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, [[pastry chef]] to the future [[Louis XVIII]], opened one of the most popular restaurants of the time \u2013 the ''Grande Taverne de Londres'' \u2013 in the arcades of the [[Palais-Royal]]. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing [[Kings of France|monarchy of France]], in the period leading up to the [[French Revolution]]. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and the substantial discretionary income of the [[French Directory]]'s ''[[nouveau riche]]'' helped keep these new restaurants in business.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|140\u2013144}}\n\n[[File:Train bleu 05.jpg|thumb|Restaurant ''Le Train Bleu'', in Paris]]\n[[File:Bouchon leTablier.jpg|thumb|A [[bouchon]], ''Le tablier'' (the apron), in Vieux Lyon]]\n[[File:Caf\u00e9 de Flore.jpg|thumb|''Caf\u00e9 de Flore'', in Paris]]\n[[File:Lille - Estaminet 'T Rijsel - 20190423 (1).jpg|thumb|An estaminet in Lille]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Categories\n!English\n!French\n!Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=2|[[Restaurant]]\n|More than 5,000 in Paris alone, with varying levels of prices and menus.

{"title_page": "Demat account", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{globalize|date=April 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2020}}\n{{Original research|date=February 2020}}\n}}\nA '''Demat account''' (short for Dematerialized account) is an account to hold financial securities (equity or debt) in electronic form. In India Demat accounts are maintained by two depository organisations, National Securities Depository Limited and Central Depository Services Limited. A [[depository participant]], such as a bank, acts as an intermediary between the investor and the depository.\n\nThe Demat account number is quoted for all transactions to enable electronic settlements of trades to take place. Access to the Dematerialized account requires an internet password and a transaction password. Transfers or purchases of [[Security (finance)|securities]] can then be initiated. Purchases and sales of securities on the Dematerialized account are automatically made once transactions are confirmed and completed.\n\n==Motive of Demat system==\n\nIndia adopted the Demat [https://marketknowledgehub.com/format-for-trading-account/ account] for electronic storing, wherein shares and securities are represented and maintained electronically, thus eliminating the troubles associated with paper shares. After the introduction of the depository system by [https://www.sebi.gov.in/acts/act03a.pdf the Depository Act of 1996], the process for sales, purchases and transfers of shares became significantly easier and most of the risks associated with paper certificates were mitigated.\n\nThis became easy for all the retail traders as well, after that all the retail traders can see the immediate reaction from home sitting on their computer screen, this reduces the possibility of any kind of deception in the meantime, ie the trader in the market work or Avenues of complete transparency opened up for investors\n\n==Benefits of Demat system==\n\nDemat account for shares and securities with business purpose\n\nThe benefits of Demat account are as follows:\n* Easy and convenient way to hold securities\n* Safer than paper-shares (earlier risks associated with physical certificates such as bad delivery, fake securities, delays, thefts etc. are mostly eliminated)\n* Reduced paperwork for transfer of securities\n* Reduced transaction cost\n* No \"odd lot\" problem: even one share can be sold\n* Change in address recorded with a [[depository participant]] gets registered with all companies in which investor holds securities eliminating the need to correspond with each of them separately.\n* Transmission of securities is done by the depository participant, eliminating the need for notifying companies.\n* Automatic credit into Demat account for shares arising out of bonus/split, consolidation/merger, etc.\n* A single Demat account can hold investments in both [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and [[debt]] instruments.\n* Traders can work from anywhere (e.g. even from home).\n\n; Benefit to the company:\nThe depository system helps in reducing the cost of new issues due to lower printing and distribution costs. It increases the efficiency of the registrars and transfer agents and the secretarial department of a company. It provides better facilities for communication and timely service to shareholders and investors.\n\n; Benefit to the investor:\nThe depository system reduces risks involved in holding physical certificates, e.g., loss, theft, mutilation, forgery, etc. It ensures transfer settlements and reduces delay in registration of shares. It ensures faster communication to investors. It helps avoid bad delivery problems due to signature differences, etc. It ensures faster payment on sale of shares. No stamp duty is paid on transfer of shares. It provides more acceptability and liquidity of securities.\n\n; Benefits to brokers:\nIt reduces risks of delayed settlement.\nIt ensures greater profit due to increase in volume of trading. It eliminates chances of forgery or bad delivery. It increases overall trading and [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]]. It increases confidence in their investors.\n\n==Depository participant==\n{{Main|Depository participant}}\nA depository is an institution holding a pool of pre-verified shares held in electronic mode that offers efficient settlement of transactions.\n\nIn India, National Securities Depository Limited and Central Depository Services Limited are two designated despositories.\n\nA depository participant is an intermediary between the investor and the depository. A depository participant is typically a financial organization like a bank, broker, financial institution, or custodian acting as an agent of the depository to make its services available to the investors. Each depository participant is assigned a unique identification number As of March 2006, there were a total of 538 depository participants registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]].\n\n==Conversion of Demat==\nConverting physical records of investments into electronic records is called \"dematerialising\" of securities.\nIn order to dematerialise physical securities, investors must fill in a Demat Request Form, which is available with the depository participant and submit the same along with physical certificates. Every security has an [[ISIN|International Securities Identification Number]]. A separate request form must be filled for every identification number.\n\nThe complete process of dematerialisation is outlined below:\n* The investor surrenders the certificates for dematerialisation to the depository participant.\n* Depository participant updates the account of the investor.\n* Demat accounts are maintained by National Securities Depository Limited and Central Depository Services Limited and the banks act as intermediary.\n\n==Demat options==\n\nThere are many hundreds of depository participants offering the Demat account facility in India as of September 2011. A comparison of the fees charged by different depository participants is detailed below.\n\nThere are a few distinct advantages of having a bank as a depository participant. Having a Demat account with a bank depository participant, usually provides quick processing, accessibility, convenience, and online transaction capability to the investor. Generally, banks credit the Demat account with shares in case of purchase, or credit a savings account with the proceeds of a sale, on the third day. Banks are also advantageous because of the number of branches they have. Some banks give the option of opening a Demat account in any branch, while others restrict themselves to a select set of branches. Some private banks also provide online access to the Demat account. Hence, the investors can conveniently check online details of their holdings, transactions and status of requests through their bank's net-banking facility. A broker who acts as a depository participant may not be able to provide these services.\n\n==Fees==\n\nThere are four major charges usually levied on a Demat account: account opening fee, annual maintenance fee, custodian fee and transaction fee. Charges for all fees vary by depository participant.\n\n===Demat account-opening fee===\nThere may not be an opening account fee. Private banks do not have one, but other entities do impose an opening fee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Annual maintenance fee===\nThis is also known as folio maintenance charges, and is generally levied in advance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is charged on annual or monthly basis.\n\n===Transaction fee===\nThe transaction fee is charged for crediting/debiting securities to and from the account on a monthly basis pay the fee to the transaction value, which is subject to a minimum amount. The fee also differs based on the kind of transaction (buying or selling). Some depository participants charge only for debiting the securities, while others charge for both. Some depository participants also charge the investor even if the instruction to buy/sell fails or is rejected. In addition, service tax is also charged by the depository participants.\n\nIn addition to the other fees, the depository participant also charges a fee for converting the shares from the physical to the electronic form or vice versa. This fee varies for both Demat (physical-to-electronic) and Remat (electronic-to-physical) requests. For Demat transactions, some depository participants charge a flat fee per request in addition to the variable fee per certificate, while others charge only the variable fee.\n\nFor instance, Stock Holding Corporation has charged Rs 25 as the request fee and Rs 3 per certificate as the variable fee. However, SBI has charged only the variable fee, as Rs 3 per certificate. Remat requests also have charges akin to that of Demat. However, variable charges for remat are generally higher than Demat.\n\nSome of the additional features (usually offered by banks) are as follows. Some depository participants offer a frequent-trader account, where they charge frequent traders at lower rates than the standard charges. Demat account holders are generally required to pay the depository participant an advance fee for each account that will be adjusted against the various service charges. The account holder needs to raise the balance when it falls below a certain amount prescribed by the depository participant. However, if the holders also hold a savings account with the depository participant, they can provide a debit authorisation to the depository participant for paying this charge. Finally, once choosing a depository participant, it would be prudent to keep all accounts with that depository participant, so that tracking of [[capital gains]] liability is easier. This is because when calculating [[capital gains tax]], the period of holding will be determined by the depository participant, and different depository participants follow different methods. For instance, ICICI Bank uses the [[fIFO and LIFO accounting|first in first out]] method to compute the period of holding. The proof of the cost of acquisition will be the contract note. The computation of capital gains is done account-wise.\n\n'''Indian Banking System'''\nFirst, an investor has to approach a depository participant and fill up an account opening form. The account opening form must be supported by copies of any one of the approved documents to serve as proof of identity and proof of address as specified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. An investor must have his/her [[Permanent Account Number]] card in original at the time of opening of the account (mandate effective from April 1, 2006).\n\nAll applicants should carry original documents for verification by an authorized official of the depository participant, under his signature.\nFurther, the investor has to sign an agreement with the depository participant in a depository prescribed standard format, which details rights and duties of investor and depository participant. The depository participant should provide the investor with a copy of the agreement and schedule of charges for their future reference. The depository participant will open the account in the system and give an account number, which is also called the Beneficiary Owner Identification number.\nThe depository participant may revise the charges by giving 30 days' notice in advance. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has rationalised the cost structure for dematerialisation by removing account-opening charges, transaction charges for credit of securities, and custody charges [[vide (Latin)|vide]] circular dated January 28, 2005.\n\n==Documents required for Demat account==\nTo open a Demat account you have to provide documents which fulfill the requirements of KYC (Know Your Customer) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer?wprov=sfla1]].\nA contract with a stockbroker does not have to be signed.\nGenerally the documents are:\n*Permanent account number (compulsory)\n*Bank statement (last 3 months)\n*Proof of address\n*Income tax return\n*Two colour\n*Bank crossed cheque\n*KYC [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer?wprov=sfla1]]\n*[[Aadhar card]]\n\n==Disadvantages of Demat==\n\n*Trading in securities may become uncontrolled in case of dematerialized securities.\n*It is incumbent upon the capital market regulator to keep a close watch on the trading in dematerialized securities and see to it that trading does not act as a detriment to investors.\n*For dematerialized securities, the role of key market players such as stock-brokers needs to be supervised as they have the capability of manipulating the market.\n*Multiple regulatory frameworks have to be conformed to, including the Depositories Act, Regulations and the various By-Laws[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-law]] of various depositories.\n*Agreements are entered at various levels in the process of dematerialization. These may cause worries to the investor desirous of simplicity.\n*There is no provision to close a Demat account, which is having illiquid shares. The investor cannot close the account and he and his successors have to go on paying the charges to the participant, like annual folio charges, etc.\n*After liquidating the holdings, many Indian investors don't close their depository participant account. They are unaware that depository participants charge even on dormant accounts.\n\n==Transfer of shares between depository participants==\n\nTo transfer shares, an investor has to fill one of two kinds of Depository Instruction Slip.\nThe first check made is whether both Demat accounts are at the same depository. There are two depositories: Central Depository Service and National Securities Depository.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Demat |first1=Guide |title=Depository in India |url=https://www.traderspit.in/demat-account-complete-guide/ |website=Traders Pit}}</ref>\nIf both Demat accounts are not at the same depository, then an Inter Depository Slip has to be filled and submitted.\nFor example:\n* If there is one Demat account with the Central Depository Service and the other Demat account with the National Depository Service, then an Inter Depository Slip is needed. (In case the investor needs an Inter Depository Slip, the investor should check with the broker, since brokers usually issue them).\n* Now that the correct Depository Instruction Slip has been determined, information pertaining to the transfer transaction has to be entered: scrip name, INE number, quantity in words and figures.\n* Finally, the investor should submit that Depository Instruction Slip to the broker with signatures.\n* The transfer broker shall accept that Depository Instruction Slip in duplicate and acknowledge its receipt on duplicate copy.\n\nThe investor should submit the Depository Instruction Slip when the market is open. Accordingly, its dates of submission and execution can be same or a difference of one day is also acceptable. The investor also has to pay the broker some charges for the transfer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.cdslindia.com/ National Securities Depository Limited website]\n* [https://nsdlcas.nsdl.com/ Central Depository Services Limited website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demat Account}}\n[[Category:Securities (finance)]]\n[[Category:Stock market]]\n[[Category:Financial services in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{globalize|date=April 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2020}}\n{{Original research|date=February 2020}}\n}}\nA '''Demat account''' (short for Dematerialized account) is an account to hold financial securities (equity or debt) in electronic form.

A separate request form must be filled for every identification number.\n\nThe complete process of dematerialisation is outlined below:\n* The investor surrenders the certificates for dematerialisation to the depository participant.\n* Depository participant updates the account of the investor.\n* Demat accounts are maintained by National Securities Depository Limited and Central Depository Services Limited and the banks act as intermediary.\n\n==Demat options==\n\nThere are many hundreds of depository participants offering the Demat account facility in India as of September 2011. A comparison of the fees charged by different depository participants is detailed below.\n\nThere are a few distinct advantages of having a bank as a depository participant. Having a Demat account with a bank depository participant, usually provides quick processing, accessibility, convenience, and online transaction capability to the investor. Generally, banks credit the Demat account with shares in case of purchase, or credit a savings account with the proceeds of a sale, on the third day. Banks are also advantageous because of the number of branches they have. Some banks give the option of opening a Demat account in any branch, while others restrict themselves to a select set of branches. Some private banks also provide online access to the Demat account. Hence, the investors can conveniently check online details of their holdings, transactions and status of requests through their bank's net-banking facility. A broker who acts as a depository participant may not be able to provide these services.\n\n==Fees==\n\nThere are four major charges usually levied on a Demat account: account opening fee, annual maintenance fee, custodian fee and transaction fee. Charges for all fees vary by depository participant.\n\n===Demat account-opening fee===\nThere may not be an opening account fee. Private banks do not have one, but other entities do impose an opening fee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Annual maintenance fee===\nThis is also known as folio maintenance charges, and is generally levied in advance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is charged on annual or monthly basis.\n\n===Transaction fee===\nThe transaction fee is charged for crediting/debiting securities to and from the account on a monthly basis pay the fee to the transaction value, which is subject to a minimum amount. The fee also differs based on the kind of transaction (buying or selling). Some depository participants charge only for debiting the securities, while others charge for both. Some depository participants also charge the investor even if the instruction to buy/sell fails or is rejected. In addition, service tax is also charged by the depository participants.\n\nIn addition to the other fees, the depository participant also charges a fee for converting the shares from the physical to the electronic form or vice versa. This fee varies for both Demat (physical-to-electronic) and Remat (electronic-to-physical) requests. For Demat transactions, some depository participants charge a flat fee per request in addition to the variable fee per certificate, while others charge only the variable fee.\n\nFor instance, Stock Holding Corporation has charged Rs 25 as the request fee and Rs 3 per certificate as the variable fee. However, SBI has charged only the variable fee, as Rs 3 per certificate. Remat requests also have charges akin to that of Demat. However, variable charges for remat are generally higher than Demat.\n\nSome of the additional features (usually offered by banks) are as follows. Some depository participants offer a frequent-trader account, where they charge frequent traders at lower rates than the standard charges. Demat account holders are generally required to pay the depository participant an advance fee for each account that will be adjusted against the various service charges. The account holder needs to raise the balance when it falls below a certain amount prescribed by the depository participant. However, if the holders also hold a savings account with the depository participant, they can provide a debit authorisation to the depository participant for paying this charge. Finally, once choosing a depository participant, it would be prudent to keep all accounts with that depository participant, so that tracking of [[capital gains]] liability is easier. This is because when calculating [[capital gains tax]], the period of holding will be determined by the depository participant, and different depository participants follow different methods. For instance, ICICI Bank uses the [[fIFO and LIFO accounting|first in first out]] method to compute the period of holding. The proof of the cost of acquisition will be the contract note. The computation of capital gains is done account-wise.\n\n'''Indian Banking System'''\nFirst, an investor has to approach a depository participant and fill up an account opening form. The account opening form must be supported by copies of any one of the approved documents to serve as proof of identity and proof of address as specified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. An investor must have his/her [[Permanent Account Number]] card in original at the time of opening of the account (mandate effective from April 1, 2006).\n\nAll applicants should carry original documents for verification by an authorized official of the depository participant, under his signature.\nFurther, the investor has to sign an agreement with the depository participant in a depository prescribed standard format, which details rights and duties of investor and depository participant. The depository participant should provide the investor with a copy of the agreement and schedule of charges for their future reference. The depository participant will open the account in the system and give an account number, which is also called the Beneficiary Owner Identification number.\nThe depository participant may revise the charges by giving 30 days' notice in advance. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has rationalised the cost structure for dematerialisation by removing account-opening charges, transaction charges for credit of securities, and custody charges [[vide (Latin)|vide]] circular dated January 28, 2005.\n\n==Documents required for Demat account==\nTo open a Demat account you have to provide documents which fulfill the requirements of KYC (Know Your Customer) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer?wprov=sfla1]].\nA contract with a stockbroker does not have to be signed.\nGenerally the documents are:\n*Permanent account number (compulsory)\n*Bank statement (last 3 months)\n*Proof of address\n*Income tax return\n*Two colour\n*Bank crossed cheque\n*KYC [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer?wprov=sfla1]]\n*[[Aadhar card]]\n\n==Disadvantages of Demat==\n\n*Trading in securities may become uncontrolled in case of dematerialized securities.\n*It is incumbent upon the capital market regulator to keep a close watch on the trading in dematerialized securities and see to it that trading does not act as a detriment to investors.\n*For dematerialized securities, the role of key market players such as stock-brokers needs to be supervised as they have the capability of manipulating the market.\n*Multiple regulatory frameworks have to be conformed to, including the Depositories Act, Regulations and the various By-Laws[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-law]] of various depositories.\n*Agreements are entered at various levels in the process of dematerialization. These may cause worries to the investor desirous of simplicity.\n*There is no provision to close a Demat account, which is having illiquid shares. The investor cannot close the account and he and his successors have to go on paying the charges to the participant, like annual folio charges, etc.\n*After liquidating the holdings, many Indian investors don't close their depository participant account. They are unaware that depository participants charge even on dormant accounts.\n\n==Transfer of shares between depository participants==\n\nTo transfer shares, an investor has to fill one of two kinds of Depository Instruction Slip.\nThe first check made is whether both Demat accounts are at the same depository. There are two depositories: Central Depository Service and National Securities Depository.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Demat |first1=Guide |title=Depository in India |url=https://www.traderspit.in/demat-account-complete-guide/ |website=Traders Pit}}</ref>\nIf both Demat accounts are not at the same depository, then an Inter Depository Slip has to be filled and submitted.\nFor example:\n* If there is one Demat account with the Central Depository Service and the other Demat account with the National Depository Service, then an Inter Depository Slip is needed. (In case the investor needs an Inter Depository Slip, the investor should check with the broker, since brokers usually issue them).\n* Now that the correct Depository Instruction Slip has been determined, information pertaining to the transfer transaction has to be entered: scrip name, INE number, quantity in words and figures.\n* Finally, the investor should submit that Depository Instruction Slip to the broker with signatures.\n* The transfer broker shall accept that Depository Instruction Slip in duplicate and acknowledge its receipt on duplicate copy.\n\nThe investor should submit the Depository Instruction Slip when the market is open. Accordingly, its dates of submission and execution can be same or a difference of one day is also acceptable. The investor also has to pay the broker some charges for the transfer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.cdslindia.com/ National Securities Depository Limited website]\n* [https://nsdlcas.nsdl.com/ Central Depository Services Limited website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demat Account}}\n[[Category:Securities (finance)]]\n[[Category:Stock market]]\n[[Category:Financial services in India]]\n", "name_user": "Parwani karan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMotive of Demat system", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demat_account"}
