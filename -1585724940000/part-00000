At 12, he worked with his father in the [[sugar cane]] fields of [[Guanabacoa]]. When Oliva was 16, his father suggested that he enlist in [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s army. In the absence of a [[birth certificate]], the recruiting officer took the senior Oliva's word that his son was old enough to enlist in the fight against [[communism]].\n\nAfter losing the war to [[Fidel Castro]], Oliva stayed in Cuba and took to hanging out at the beach. There, he met a fellow beachgoer who invited him to the local weightlifting club. After just six months of training Oliva was doing [[clean and jerk]]s with over 300&nbsp;lb and totaling 1000&nbsp;lb in the three major lifts at a bodyweight of 195&nbsp;lb, considered a middle-heavyweight.\n\nIn 1962, the National Weightlifting Championship for [[Cuba]] was won by Alberto Rey Games Hernandez; Sergio Oliva took second place. Because Games received an injury, Oliva was chosen to represent Cuba at the [[1962 Central American and Caribbean Games]] hosted in [[Kingston, Jamaica]].\n\nDuring his stay in [[Jamaica]], Oliva snuck out of his quarters while the guards were distracted. He ran at top speed until he was safely inside the American consulate. Arriving breathlessly, he demanded and received [[Right_of_asylum#Modern_political_asylum|political asylum]]. Soon, 65 other Cuban nationals followed him, including Castro's entire weightlifting team and their security guards. Soon afterward, Oliva was living in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], working as a TV repairman.<ref>{{cite book| last = Wayne| first = Rick| authorlink = Rick Wayne| title = Muscle Wars|publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]]| year = 1985| page =95| ISBN = 0-312-55353-6}}</ref>\n\n==Life in the United States==\nIn 1963 Oliva moved to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. There he worked at a local steel mill and began working out at the Duncan [[YMCA]]. Working 10- to 12-hour days at the steel mill and putting in another 2.5\u20133 hours at the gym gave Oliva very little time for anything else. Soon the bodybuilding grapevine was abuzz with gossip about a Cuban powerhouse who lifted more than any of the local Olympic champs. Oliva won his first bodybuilding competition, the Mr. Chicagoland contest, in 1963. He was successful again at the Mr. Illinois in 1964, but he lost in 1965 at the AAU Mr. America, winning 2nd place even though he won the trophy for \"Most Muscular.\" In 1966, he won the AAU Jr. Mr. America, and lost at the AAU Mr. America again taking 2nd place although once again he claimed the trophy for \"Most Muscular\". He then joined the International Federation of BodyBuilders [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] in which he won both the professional Mr. World and Mr. Universe Contests. In 1967, he won the prestigious Mr. Olympia contest.\n\nOliva then went on to win the [[Mr. Olympia]] title three years in a row, at 5 feet 10 inches and at a contest weight of 225-245lbs. Oliva's 1968 Mr Olympia win was uncontested. In 1969, he won his third consecutive Mr. Olympia by beating a Mr. Europe, a Mr. International, and four-time Mr. Universe winner Arnold Schwarzenegger. In his 1977 autobiography, \"Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder\", Arnold tells of their first encounter: \"Then for the first time, I saw Sergio Oliva in person. I understood why they called him \"the Myth\". It was as jarring as if I'd walked into a wall. He destroyed me. He was so huge, he was so fantastic, there was no way I could even think of beating him. I admitted my defeat and felt some of my pump go away. I tried. But I'd been so taken back by my first sight of Sergio Oliva that I think I settled for 2nd place before we walked out on the stage... I never like to admit defeat, but I thought Sergio was better.

Oliva was banned from competing in the 1971 IFBB Mr. Olympia because he competed in the 1971 NABBA Mr. Universe. This was extremely controversial because Schwarzenegger had competed for this very same contest the year before and without Sergio to challenge Arnold, some felt that the contest was fixed. \"I'd coasted to my second title as Mr.Olympia, in Paris in 1971.

At 12, he worked with his father in the [[sugar cane]] fields of [[Guanabacoa]]. When Oliva was 16, his father suggested that he enlist in [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s army. In the absence of a [[birth certificate]], the recruiting officer took the senior Oliva's word that his son was old enough to enlist in the fight against [[communism]].\n\nAfter losing the war to [[Fidel Castro]], Oliva stayed in Cuba and took to hanging out at the beach. There, he met a fellow beachgoer who invited him to the local weightlifting club. After just six months of training Oliva was doing [[clean and jerk]]s with over 300&nbsp;lb and totaling 1000&nbsp;lb in the three major lifts at a bodyweight of 195&nbsp;lb, considered a middle-heavyweight.\n\nIn 1962, the National Weightlifting Championship for [[Cuba]] was won by Alberto Rey Games Hernandez; Sergio Oliva took second place. Because Games received an injury, Oliva was chosen to represent Cuba at the [[1962 Central American and Caribbean Games]] hosted in [[Kingston, Jamaica]].\n\nDuring his stay in [[Jamaica]], Oliva snuck out of his quarters while the guards were distracted. He ran at top speed until he was safely inside the American consulate. Arriving breathlessly, he demanded and received [[Right_of_asylum#Modern_political_asylum|political asylum]]. Soon, 65 other Cuban nationals followed him, including Castro's entire weightlifting team and their security guards. Soon afterward, Oliva was living in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], working as a TV repairman.<ref>{{cite book| last = Wayne| first = Rick| authorlink = Rick Wayne| title = Muscle Wars|publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]]| year = 1985| page =95| ISBN = 0-312-55353-6}}</ref>\n\n==Life in the United States==\nIn 1963 Oliva moved to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].

Ian Pons Jewell was commissioned by Virgin EMI to create the concept for the video, which focuses on a child's magical journey. Jewell said that others compared the video to the ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' and a local legend of the demon [[El T\u00edo]] and that both legends influenced the concept of the video.<ref name=\"ponscnn\">{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/adorable-kid-Bolivia-naughty-boy-travel-video-588206|title=Adorable kid, exotic Bolivia star in magical 'travel' video|accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref> As of December 2019, the video has received over 1.0 billion views.\n\n===Synopsis of the video===\nThe video starts with the opening of a door marked with the number 1111, a number related to be a sign of change. In the music video,<ref name=\"omv\" /> a young boy is being verbally abused by a man who is presumably his father. Looking out of his apartment window, he sees an unusually dressed man and his dog standing on the pavement outside. This man could be the representation of the \"[[Ekeko]]\", a South American figure representative of good luck and abundance. The boy then puts his fingers in his ears and begins singing 'La la la' in response to his father's outburst. Running out of the apartment, the boy joins the mysterious figure outside and pets his dog. Seeing the boy outside, the father picks up an egg from a bird's nest on the window-sill and throws it down at the boy.\n\nThe boy and dog run away and the scene cuts from evening to daytime. The boy is walking the dog along a city street, in what is inferred to be [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and he goes into a store front and downstairs. In the basement of the building, he finds a gymnasium and a scared-looking man who is covered in dust; this man looks like a disgraced \"[[Ekeko]].\" The man holds a stereo which is providing music for a group of women doing aerobics with one woman who is obviously a leader and abuses both the man and the others since their mascara is running down their cheeks from crying. The boy encourages the man to leave, but he appears reluctant. The boy then mimes the act of putting his fingers in his ears and singing 'La la la', and the man responds by turning off the volume on the stereo. The leader begins yelling at the man, and he puts his fingers in his ears and sings 'La la la' in response to her tirade. The dusty man, boy and dog leave the gymnasium and are followed by the woman who yells after them as they leave.\n\nThe pair then come across an ice cream vendor on the street; a popular figure easy to find on the streets of some South American cities. The boy gives him some coins, and he takes out what appears to be a human heart from a collection in his cart. He holds the heart in the air, the boy looks at him and then slips it inside the jacket pocket of the dusty man. Echoing the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', the man now has a heart. The boy then looks onto the road and sees a traffic policeman dressed in an unusually colored police uniform with an elephant-like mask covering his face. His uniform, as well as his exaggerated nose and ears, are made of [[Herringbone_(cloth)|herringbone]] [[Tweed_(cloth)|tweed]]. The traffic policeman is dancing as he directs traffic, but the cars and pedestrians seem to ignore him. The boy once again mimes plugging his ears to the policeman, who then performs the gestures himself. This figure is reminiscent of artists and clowns who often perform on the streets in South American cities for money. The three leave together with the dog, and the scene cuts to their journey into a mountainous region outside of the city. They walk along disused railway tracks and pass a discarded, unplugged television that still shows images on the screen. Their journey takes them across long plains of [[Salar de Uyuni|salt flats]], with the traffic policeman carrying the sleeping boy and the dusty man walking the dog.\n\nThe scene cuts to nightfall where they have set up a camp fire. The boy sleeps in the arms of the traffic policeman while the dusty man holds and pats the dog. The scene cuts to the next day, where they walk up a hillside towards an abandoned mine. Leaving the dog tied at the entrance, they enter the mine. They discover [[El T\u00edo]] sitting immobile at the end of a tunnel. At the sight of the figure, the boy begins crying and is hugged and comforted by both men. The men then leave, and the boy remains kneeling before the figure and singing 'la la la' with his fingers in his ears. The video ends with the two men and the dog walking away from the mine. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nLewis Corner of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the song a positive review, stating:\n\n{{quote|As the Wizard of Oz reimagining in the accompanying music video suggests, Naughty Boy is at his best when presenting tales of heartbreak with an otherworldly streak. \"Yes our love is running out of time/ I won't count the hours, rather be a coward/ When our words collide,\" newcomer Sam Smith confesses to his beau over rattling beats and bewitching synths.

Ian Pons Jewell was commissioned by Virgin EMI to create the concept for the video, which focuses on a child's magical journey. Jewell said that others compared the video to the ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' and a local legend of the demon [[El T\u00edo]] and that both legends influenced the concept of the video.<ref name=\"ponscnn\">{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/adorable-kid-Bolivia-naughty-boy-travel-video-588206|title=Adorable kid, exotic Bolivia star in magical 'travel' video|accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref> As of December 2019, the video has received over 1.0 billion views.\n\n===Synopsis of the video===\nThe video starts with the opening of a door marked with the number 1111, a number related to be a sign of change. In the music video,<ref name=\"omv\" /> a young boy is being verbally abused by a man who is presumably his father. Looking out of his apartment window, he sees an unusually dressed man and his dog standing on the pavement outside. This man could be the representation of the \"[[Ekeko]]\", a South American figure representative of good luck and abundance. The boy then puts his fingers in his ears and begins singing 'La la la' in response to his father's outburst. Running out of the apartment, the boy joins the mysterious figure outside and pets his dog. Seeing the boy outside, the father picks up an egg from a bird's nest on the window-sill and throws it down at the boy.\n\nThe boy and dog run away and the scene cuts from evening to daytime. The boy is walking the dog along a city street, in what is inferred to be [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and he goes into a store front and downstairs. In the basement of the building, he finds a gymnasium and a scared-looking man who is covered in dust; this man looks like a disgraced \"[[Ekeko]].\" The man holds a stereo which is providing music for a group of women doing aerobics with one woman who is obviously a leader and abuses both the man and the others since their mascara is running down their cheeks from crying. The boy encourages the man to leave, but he appears reluctant. The boy then mimes the act of putting his fingers in his ears and singing 'La la la', and the man responds by turning off the volume on the stereo. The leader begins yelling at the man, and he puts his fingers in his ears and sings 'La la la' in response to her tirade. The dusty man, boy and dog leave the gymnasium and are followed by the woman who yells after them as they leave.\n\nThe pair then come across an ice cream vendor on the street; a popular figure easy to find on the streets of some South American cities. The boy gives him some coins, and he takes out what appears to be a human heart from a collection in his cart. He holds the heart in the air, the boy looks at him and then slips it inside the jacket pocket of the dusty man. Echoing the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', the man now has a heart. The boy then looks onto the road and sees a traffic policeman dressed in an unusually colored police uniform with an elephant-like mask covering his face. His uniform, as well as his exaggerated nose and ears, are made of [[Herringbone_(cloth)|herringbone]] [[Tweed_(cloth)|tweed]]. The traffic policeman is dancing as he directs traffic, but the cars and pedestrians seem to ignore him. The boy once again mimes plugging his ears to the policeman, who then performs the gestures himself. This figure is reminiscent of artists and clowns who often perform on the streets in South American cities for money. The three leave together with the dog, and the scene cuts to their journey into a mountainous region outside of the city. They walk along disused railway tracks and pass a discarded, unplugged television that still shows images on the screen. Their journey takes them across long plains of [[Salar de Uyuni|salt flats]], with the traffic policeman carrying the sleeping boy and the dusty man walking the dog.\n\nThe scene cuts to nightfall where they have set up a camp fire. The boy sleeps in the arms of the traffic policeman while the dusty man holds and pats the dog. The scene cuts to the next day, where they walk up a hillside towards an abandoned mine. Leaving the dog tied at the entrance, they enter the mine. They discover [[El T\u00edo]] sitting immobile at the end of a tunnel. At the sight of the figure, the boy begins crying and is hugged and comforted by both men. The men then leave, and the boy remains kneeling before the figure and singing 'la la la' with his fingers in his ears. The video ends with the two men and the dog walking away from the mine. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nLewis Corner of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the song a positive review, stating:\n\n{{quote|As the Wizard of Oz reimagining in the accompanying music video suggests, Naughty Boy is at his best when presenting tales of heartbreak with an otherworldly streak. \"Yes our love is running out of time/ I won't count the hours, rather be a coward/ When our words collide,\" newcomer Sam Smith confesses to his beau over rattling beats and bewitching synths.

Before the season ended, he scored two more against the likes of Toulouse and Nantes to keep French capital club in the top flight.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, the Parisian club purchased Luyindula on a definite basis. The club endured a horrendous 2007\u201308 campaign, only avoiding relegation on the last day of the season. Luydindula scored just 5 goals during the whole season, and became something of a hate figure among PSG fans.\n\nThe 2008\u201309 season proved to be much more positive for the Kinshasa-born forward. With the arrival of no less than four attacking reinforcements ([[Ludovic Giuly]], [[Guillaume Hoarau]], [[St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon]] and [[Mateja Ke\u017eman]]) in the summer, Luyindula lost his spot in the starting line-up. However, he was often used as a supersub, especially in UEFA Cup games, and appeared to play better without the pressure of being an automatic starter. He scored twice in a 4\u20130 win over Dutch club [[FC Twente]] in December 2008, which qualified the Parisian club for the following round of the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn September 2009, Luyindula signed a two-year extension to his deal with the club, this tied him to the club until 2012. During the 2011\u201312 campaign Luyindula had a falling out with manager [[Antoine Kombouare]] and as a result was relegated to the reserve side. He was reinstated to the first team under new manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] but only appeared in one League Cup match in 2012. During his time with PSG Luyindula played in 180 official matches and scored 37 goals.\n\n===New York Red Bulls===\n[[File:Peguy Luyindula NY2.JPG|thumb|upright|Luyindula training with [[New York Red Bulls]] in 2013]]\n\nIn December 2012 it was reported that Luyindula would be terminating his contract with PSG to sign with [[New York Red Bulls]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Luyindula-vers-new-york/337025 |title=Luyindula vers New York |publisher=www.lequipe.fr |accessdate=18 December 2012|language=fr}}</ref> New York officially announced Luyindula's signing with the club on 19 March 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2013/03/red-bulls-sign-forward-peguy-luyindula|title=Red Bulls sign Peguy Luyindula|publisher=www.newyorkredbulls.com|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref> Luyindula scored his first goal for his new club on 13 July against [[Montreal Impact]].

He was a key player for New York during the MLS playoffs assisting on two goals in the team's come from behind 2\u20131 victory over [[Sporting Kansas City]] in the play-in match, and scoring two goals in New York's series aggregate victory of 3\u20132 over rivals [[D.C.

Before the season ended, he scored two more against the likes of Toulouse and Nantes to keep French capital club in the top flight.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, the Parisian club purchased Luyindula on a definite basis. The club endured a horrendous 2007\u201308 campaign, only avoiding relegation on the last day of the season. Luydindula scored just 5 goals during the whole season, and became something of a hate figure among PSG fans.\n\nThe 2008\u201309 season proved to be much more positive for the Kinshasa-born forward. With the arrival of no less than four attacking reinforcements ([[Ludovic Giuly]], [[Guillaume Hoarau]], [[St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon]] and [[Mateja Ke\u017eman]]) in the summer, Luyindula lost his spot in the starting line-up. However, he was often used as a supersub, especially in UEFA Cup games, and appeared to play better without the pressure of being an automatic starter. He scored twice in a 4\u20130 win over Dutch club [[FC Twente]] in December 2008, which qualified the Parisian club for the following round of the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn September 2009, Luyindula signed a two-year extension to his deal with the club, this tied him to the club until 2012. During the 2011\u201312 campaign Luyindula had a falling out with manager [[Antoine Kombouare]] and as a result was relegated to the reserve side. He was reinstated to the first team under new manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] but only appeared in one League Cup match in 2012. During his time with PSG Luyindula played in 180 official matches and scored 37 goals.\n\n===New York Red Bulls===\n[[File:Peguy Luyindula NY2.JPG|thumb|upright|Luyindula training with [[New York Red Bulls]] in 2013]]\n\nIn December 2012 it was reported that Luyindula would be terminating his contract with PSG to sign with [[New York Red Bulls]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Luyindula-vers-new-york/337025 |title=Luyindula vers New York |publisher=www.lequipe.fr |accessdate=18 December 2012|language=fr}}</ref> New York officially announced Luyindula's signing with the club on 19 March 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2013/03/red-bulls-sign-forward-peguy-luyindula|title=Red Bulls sign Peguy Luyindula|publisher=www.newyorkredbulls.com|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref> Luyindula scored his first goal for his new club on 13 July against [[Montreal Impact]].

He was a key player for New York during the MLS playoffs assisting on two goals in the team's come from behind 2\u20131 victory over [[Sporting Kansas City]] in the play-in match, and scoring two goals in New York's series aggregate victory of 3\u20132 over rivals [[D.C.
