The term ''a cappella'' was originally intended to differentiate between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[polyphony]] and [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] [[concertato]] style. In the 19th century, a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.<ref name=Holmes/> The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for ''[[alla breve]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|1998|p=314}}</ref>\n\n==Religious origins==\nA cappella music was originally used in religious music, especially [[church music]] as well as [[anasheed]] and [[zemirot]]. [[Gregorian chant]] is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. The [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]], up until its development in the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form. Jewish and Early Christian music was largely a cappella, although as noted by the Psalms some songs were accompanied by string instruments<ref>{{Cite book|title=Music in ancient Judaism and early Christianity|last=Smith|first= John Arthur|isbn=978-1409421610|location=Farnham, Surrey|oclc=715159344}}</ref>{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; many Old Testament passages make reference to multiple instruments being used. [By definition, Christianity began with the New Testament.]|date=November 2013}} and this practice has continued in both of these religions as well as in Islam.6c is the best a cappella gruops\n\n<br />\n\n===Christian===\nThe [[polyphony]] of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century AD, with compositions by [[Josquin des Prez]].<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}</ref> The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument<!--Which instrument? A single melody instrument or a polyphonic instrument like a pipe organ?--> would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella [[polyphony]] had further developed, but gradually, the [[cantata]] began to take the place of a cappella forms.<ref name=EB/> 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices.<ref name=EB/> Such is seen in the life of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] becoming a major influence on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], most notably in the ''[[Mass in B Minor]]''.\n\nOther composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were [[Claudio Monteverdi]] and his masterpiece, ''Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata'' (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610,<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=6}}</ref> and [[Andrea Gabrieli]] when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style.<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005|p=780}}</ref> Learning from the preceding two composeres, [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the [[oratorio]] style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]]. Five of Schutz's ''Historien'' were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]], were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a [[plainchant]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====Byzantine Rite====\nIn the Byzantine Rite of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, \"The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.\"<ref name=Ware>{{harvnb|Ware|1997|p=268}}</ref> This a cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, ''Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.''<ref>{{bibleverse||Psalms|150:6}}</ref> In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian ''musika'' which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as ''khorov\u00efye kontsert\u00ef'' (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, ''Grammatika musikiyskaya'' (1675), by [[Nikolai Diletsky]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005b|p=234}}</ref> Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Peter Tchaikovsky]], [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Arkhangelsky (composer)|Alexander Arkhangelsky]], and [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Leontovych)|Mykola Leontovych]] are fine examples of this.\n\n====Opposition to instruments in worship====\nPresent-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include many [[Anabaptist]] communities (such as the [[Amish]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Old Order Mennonites]] and [[Conservative Mennonites]]), some [[Presbyterian]] churches devoted to the [[regulative principle of worship]], [[Old Regular Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptist]]s, [[Plymouth Brethren]], [[Churches of Christ]], Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), the [[Reformed Free Methodist Church|Reformed Free Methodists]],<ref name=\"Jones1974\">{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Charles Edwin |title=A guide to the study of the holiness movement |date=1974 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810807037 |page=[https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 685] |language=English |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 }}</ref> [[Doukhobor]]s, and the [[Byzantine Rite]] of Eastern Christianity. Certain [[high church]] services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times. Many [[Mennonite]]s also conduct some or all of their services without instruments. [[Sacred Harp]], a type of [[folk music]], is an a cappella style of religious singing with [[shape notes]], usually sung at singing conventions.\n\nOpponents of [[musical instruments in the Christian worship]] believe that such opposition is supported by the Christian scriptures and Church history. The scriptures typically referenced are [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:30;%20Acts%2016:25;%20Romans%2015:9;%201%20Corinthians%2014:15;%20Ephesians%205:19;%20Colossians%203:16;%20Hebrews%202:12,%13:15;%20James%205:13;&version=49; Matthew 26:30; Acts 16:25; Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 2:12, 13:15; James 5:13], which show examples and exhortations for Christians to sing.<ref name=kurfees>{{harvnb|Kurfees|1911}}</ref>\n\nThere is no reference to instrumental music in early church worship in the New Testament, or in the worship of churches for the first six centuries.<ref name=McKinnon>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|pp=263, 265}}</ref><ref name=Bales>{{harvnb|Bales|1973|p=351}}</ref> Several reasons have been posited throughout church history for the absence of instrumental music in church worship.{{refn|group=\"nb\"|The absence of instrumental music is rooted in various hermeneutic principles (ways of interpreting the Bible) which determine what is appropriate for worship. Among such principles are the [[regulative principle of worship]] (Ulrich Zwingli), [[Sola scriptura]] (Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli), and the history of [[hymn]] in \"Christianity\". Dispensationalism emphasizes the differences between the old (Law of Moses) and the new (Jesus and the Apostles) covenants, emphasizing that the majority of the practices from the Law of Moses were replaced by the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles. The absence of instrumental music in early church worship is significant given the abundance of Hebrew Bible references and commands to worship God with harp, lyre and cymbal. After several hundred years of Tabernacle worship without references to instrumental music, King David (c. 1500 BC) introduced musical instruments into Temple worship reportedly because of a commandment from God, complete with who was to sing, who was to play, and what instruments were to be used.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25-29}}</ref>}}\n\nChristians who believe in a cappella music today believe that in the Israelite worship assembly during Temple worship only the Priests of Levi sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, whereas in the church era, all Christians are commanded to sing praises to God. They believe that if God wanted instrumental music in New Testament worship, He would have commanded not just singing, but singing and playing like he did in the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nThe first recorded example of a musical instrument in Roman Catholic worship was a [[pipe organ]] introduced by [[Pope Vitalian]] into a cathedral in Rome around 670.<ref>American Encyclopedia, Volume 12, p. 688{{title missing}}</ref>{{refn|group=\"nb\"|McKinnon maintained that the organ was the first instrument to be introduced into worship and the next was the trumpet.

There is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the first century and a half of Christian churches (33\u2013180 AD).<ref name=McKinnon2>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=2}}</ref> The use of instruments for Christian worship during this period is also undocumented.

The Free Methodist Church allowed for local church decision on the use of either an organ or piano in the 1943 Conference before lifting the ban entirely in 1955. The [[Reformed Free Methodist Church]] and [[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]] were formed as a result of a schism with the Free Methodist Church, with the former retaining a cappella worship and the latter retaining the rule limiting the number of instruments in the church to the piano and organ.<ref name=\"Jones1974\"/>\n\n===Jewish===\nWhile worship in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] included musical instruments ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25\u201329:27}}), traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the last destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments<ref>{{harvnb|Price|2005|p=68}}</ref> given the practice of scriptural [[cantillation]].<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=85}}</ref> The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as [[zemirot]] outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During [[the Three Weeks]] musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the [[Counting of the Omer|counting of the omer]] between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.<ref>{{harvnb|Melamed|2013}}</ref> This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as ''sefirah'' music.<ref name=\"Shircago\">{{harvnb|Shircago|2013}}</ref>\n\nThe popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]], born 20 BC.

A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the [[Beelzebubs|Tufts University Beelzebubs]] and the [[Dear Abbeys|Boston University Dear Abbeys]]. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including [[vocal percussion]]/\"[[beatboxing]]\". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as [[the Georgetown Chimes]]' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as [[List of quartet champions by year|International Quartet Champions]] [[Boston Common (quartet)|The Boston Common]] and the contemporary commercial a cappella group [[Rockapella]].

Maize Mirchi, the co-ed a cappella group from the [[University of Michigan]] hosts \"Sa Re Ga Ma Pella\", an annual South Asian a cappella invitational with various groups from the Midwest. Another South Asian group from the Midwest is Chai Town who is based in the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.\n\nJewish-interest groups such as [[Queens College]]'s Tizmoret, [[Tufts University]]'s [[Shir Appeal]], [[University of Chicago]]'s Rhythm and Jews, [[Binghamton University]]'s Kaskeset, [[Ohio State University]]'s Meshuganotes, [[Rutgers University]]'s Kol Halayla, [[New York University]]'s Ani V'Ata and [[Yale University]]'s Magevet are also gaining popularity across the U.S.<ref>{{harvnb|Ginsberg|2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Altshuler|2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|2011}}</ref>\n\nIncreased interest in modern a cappella (particularly collegiate a cappella) can be seen in the growth of awards such as the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (overseen by the [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]]) and competitions such as the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] for college groups and the [[Harmony Sweepstakes]] for all groups. In December 2009, a new television competition series called ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' aired on [[NBC]]. The show featured eight a cappella groups from the United States and Puerto Rico vying for the prize of $100,000 and a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]/[[Sony Music]]. The show was judged by [[Ben Folds]], [[Shawn Stockman]], and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and was won by an all-male group from Puerto Rico called [[Nota (group)|Nota]]. The show returned for a second, third and fourth season, won by [[Committed (group)|Committed]], [[Pentatonix]] and [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] respectively.\n\nEach year, hundreds of Collegiate a cappella groups submit their strongest songs in a competition to be on The Best of College A Cappella (BOCA), an album compilation of tracks from the best college a cappella groups around the world. The album is produced by Varsity Vocals&nbsp;\u2013 which also produces the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella&nbsp;\u2013 and [[Deke Sharon]]. ). According to ethnomusicologist Joshua S. Dunchan, \"BOCA carries considerable cache and respect within the field despite the appearance of other compilations in part, perhaps, because of its longevity and the prestige of the individuals behind it.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dunchan|first=Joshua|date=2012|title=Recordings, Technology, and Discourse in Collegiate A Cappella|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/490098|journal=Journal of American Folklore|volume=125|issue=498|pages=488\u2013502|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.5406/jamerfolk.125.498.0488}}</ref>\n\nCollegiate a cappella groups may also submit their tracks to Voices Only, a two-disc series released at the beginning of each school year. A Voices Only album has been released every year since 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, all women's a cappella groups can send their strongest song tracks to the Women's A Cappella Association (WACA) for its annual best of women's a cappella album. WACA offers another medium for women's voices to receive recognition and has released an album every year since 2014, featuring women's groups from across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Women's A Cappella Association |url=http://www.womensacappella.org/#!recordings/cfpt |website=Women's A Cappella Association |access-date=4 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Emulating instruments==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nIn addition to singing words, some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their [[vocal cords]] and mouth, often pitched using specialised pitch pipes. One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were [[The Mills Brothers]] whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally. More recently, \"[[Twilight Zone (dance song)|Twilight Zone]]\" by [[2 Unlimited]] was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series ''Tompkins Square''. Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' series on [[Fox Family Channel]] (now [[ABC Family]]). Groups such as [[Vocal Sampling]] and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music. Vocal artist [[Bobby McFerrin]] is famous for his instrumental emulation. A cappella group [[Naturally Seven]] recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument.\n\nThe [[Swingle Singers]] used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments. [[Beatboxing]], more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the [[hip-hop]] community, where [[Rapping|rap]] is often performed a cappella also. The advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements.<ref>{{harvnb|Pauley|2012}}</ref> Jazz vocalist [[Petra Haden]] used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album ''[[Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out]]'' in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s \"[[Don't Stop Believin']]\", [[The Beach Boys]]' \"[[God Only Knows]]\" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\".\n\nChristian rock group [[Relient K]] recorded the song \"Plead the Fifth\" a cappella on its album ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]''. The group recorded lead singer [[Matt Thiessen]] making drum noises and played them with an electronic drum machine to record the song.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of a cappella groups]]\n** [[List of professional a cappella groups]]\n** [[List of collegiate a cappella groups|List of collegiate a cappella groups in the United States]]\n** [[List of university a cappella groups in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite web|last=Alleman|first=Annie|url=http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/entertainment/8071132-421/chicago-a-cappella-sings-music-of-high-holidays.html|title=Chicago a cappella sings music of high holidays|year=2011|work=Chicago Sun times|location=Chicago, Illinois|ref=harv|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124121724/http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/entertainment/8071132-421/chicago-a-cappella-sings-music-of-high-holidays.html|archivedate=24 January 2012}}\n* {{cite news |last=Altshuler |first=George |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/67365/singers-find-sure-appeal-of-jewish-a-cappella-groups/ |title=Singers find sure appeal of Jewish a cappella groups |newspaper=[[j.

capella\" from Latin) music is group or solo singing without [[Musical instrument|instrumental]] [[accompaniment]], or a piece intended to be performed in this way. The term ''a cappella'' was originally intended to differentiate between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[polyphony]] and [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] [[concertato]] style. In the 19th century, a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.<ref name=Holmes/> The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for ''[[alla breve]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|1998|p=314}}</ref>\n\n==Religious origins==\nA cappella music was originally used in religious music, especially [[church music]] as well as [[anasheed]] and [[zemirot]]. [[Gregorian chant]] is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. The [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]], up until its development in the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form. Jewish and Early Christian music was largely a cappella, although as noted by the Psalms some songs were accompanied by string instruments<ref>{{Cite book|title=Music in ancient Judaism and early Christianity|last=Smith|first= John Arthur|isbn=978-1409421610|location=Farnham, Surrey|oclc=715159344}}</ref>{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; many Old Testament passages make reference to multiple instruments being used.

A single melody instrument or a polyphonic instrument like a pipe organ?--> would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella [[polyphony]] had further developed, but gradually, the [[cantata]] began to take the place of a cappella forms.<ref name=EB/> 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices.<ref name=EB/> Such is seen in the life of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] becoming a major influence on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], most notably in the ''[[Mass in B Minor]]''.\n\nOther composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were [[Claudio Monteverdi]] and his masterpiece, ''Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata'' (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610,<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=6}}</ref> and [[Andrea Gabrieli]] when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style.<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005|p=780}}</ref> Learning from the preceding two composeres, [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the [[oratorio]] style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]]. Five of Schutz's ''Historien'' were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]], were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a [[plainchant]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====Byzantine Rite====\nIn the Byzantine Rite of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, \"The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.\"<ref name=Ware>{{harvnb|Ware|1997|p=268}}</ref> This a cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, ''Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.''<ref>{{bibleverse||Psalms|150:6}}</ref> In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian ''musika'' which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as ''khorov\u00efye kontsert\u00ef'' (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, ''Grammatika musikiyskaya'' (1675), by [[Nikolai Diletsky]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005b|p=234}}</ref> Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Peter Tchaikovsky]], [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Arkhangelsky (composer)|Alexander Arkhangelsky]], and [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Leontovych)|Mykola Leontovych]] are fine examples of this.\n\n====Opposition to instruments in worship====\nPresent-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include many [[Anabaptist]] communities (such as the [[Amish]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Old Order Mennonites]] and [[Conservative Mennonites]]), some [[Presbyterian]] churches devoted to the [[regulative principle of worship]], [[Old Regular Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptist]]s, [[Plymouth Brethren]], [[Churches of Christ]], Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), the [[Reformed Free Methodist Church|Reformed Free Methodists]],<ref name=\"Jones1974\">{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Charles Edwin |title=A guide to the study of the holiness movement |date=1974 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810807037 |page=[https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 685] |language=English |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetostudyoft00char/page/685 }}</ref> [[Doukhobor]]s, and the [[Byzantine Rite]] of Eastern Christianity. Certain [[high church]] services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times. Many [[Mennonite]]s also conduct some or all of their services without instruments. [[Sacred Harp]], a type of [[folk music]], is an a cappella style of religious singing with [[shape notes]], usually sung at singing conventions.\n\nOpponents of [[musical instruments in the Christian worship]] believe that such opposition is supported by the Christian scriptures and Church history. The scriptures typically referenced are [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:30;%20Acts%2016:25;%20Romans%2015:9;%201%20Corinthians%2014:15;%20Ephesians%205:19;%20Colossians%203:16;%20Hebrews%202:12,%13:15;%20James%205:13;&version=49; Matthew 26:30; Acts 16:25; Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 2:12, 13:15; James 5:13], which show examples and exhortations for Christians to sing.<ref name=kurfees>{{harvnb|Kurfees|1911}}</ref>\n\nThere is no reference to instrumental music in early church worship in the New Testament, or in the worship of churches for the first six centuries.<ref name=McKinnon>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|pp=263, 265}}</ref><ref name=Bales>{{harvnb|Bales|1973|p=351}}</ref> Several reasons have been posited throughout church history for the absence of instrumental music in church worship.{{refn|group=\"nb\"|The absence of instrumental music is rooted in various hermeneutic principles (ways of interpreting the Bible) which determine what is appropriate for worship. Among such principles are the [[regulative principle of worship]] (Ulrich Zwingli), [[Sola scriptura]] (Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli), and the history of [[hymn]] in \"Christianity\". Dispensationalism emphasizes the differences between the old (Law of Moses) and the new (Jesus and the Apostles) covenants, emphasizing that the majority of the practices from the Law of Moses were replaced by the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles. The absence of instrumental music in early church worship is significant given the abundance of Hebrew Bible references and commands to worship God with harp, lyre and cymbal. After several hundred years of Tabernacle worship without references to instrumental music, King David (c. 1500 BC) introduced musical instruments into Temple worship reportedly because of a commandment from God, complete with who was to sing, who was to play, and what instruments were to be used.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25-29}}</ref>}}\n\nChristians who believe in a cappella music today believe that in the Israelite worship assembly during Temple worship only the Priests of Levi sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, whereas in the church era, all Christians are commanded to sing praises to God. They believe that if God wanted instrumental music in New Testament worship, He would have commanded not just singing, but singing and playing like he did in the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nThe first recorded example of a musical instrument in Roman Catholic worship was a [[pipe organ]] introduced by [[Pope Vitalian]] into a cathedral in Rome around 670.<ref>American Encyclopedia, Volume 12, p. 688{{title missing}}</ref>{{refn|group=\"nb\"|McKinnon maintained that the organ was the first instrument to be introduced into worship and the next was the trumpet. He noted accounts of an organ being sent from Byzantium to Pippin in 757, and another to Charlemagne in 812.<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|p=265}}</ref>}}\n\nInstruments have divided Christendom since their introduction into worship. They were considered a Catholic innovation, not widely practiced until the 18th century, and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of [[Protestant Reformers]], including [[Martin Luther]] (1483\u20131546),<ref name=M&S>{{harvnb|M'Clintock|Strong|1894|p=762}}</ref> [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]] (1509\u20131564)<ref name=Calvin>{{harvnb|Calvin|2009}}</ref> and [[John Wesley]] (1703\u20131791).<ref name=Clarke>{{harvnb|Clarke|1844|p=684}}</ref> Alexander Campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship as \"a cow bell in a concert\".<ref name=ferg>{{harvnb|Ferguson|2004|p=414}}</ref> In [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'', the heroine, [[Jeanie Deans]], a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England (bold added):\n:The folk here are civil, and, like the barbarians unto the holy apostle, have shown me much kindness; and there are a sort of chosen people in the land, for they have some '''[[kirk]]s without organs that are like ours''', and are called meeting-houses, where the minister preaches without a gown.<ref name=Scott>{{harvnb|Scott|1818}}</ref>\n\n====Acceptance of instruments in worship====\nThose who do not adhere to the [[regulative principle]] of interpreting Christian scripture, believe that limiting praise to the unaccompanied chant of the early church is not commanded in scripture, and that churches in any age are free to offer their songs with or without musical instruments.\n\nThose who subscribe to this interpretation believe that since the Christian scriptures never counter instrumental language with any negative judgment on instruments, opposition to instruments instead comes from an interpretation of history. There is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the first century and a half of Christian churches (33\u2013180 AD).<ref name=McKinnon2>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=2}}</ref> The use of instruments for Christian worship during this period is also undocumented. Toward the end of the 2nd century, Christians began condemning the instruments themselves.<ref name=McKinnon3>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=72}}</ref> Those who oppose instruments today believe these Church Fathers had a better understanding of God's desire for the church,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but there are significant differences between the teachings of these Church Fathers and Christian opposition to instruments today.\n* Modern Christians typically believe it is acceptable to play instruments or to attend weddings, funerals, banquets, etc., where instruments are heard playing religious music. The Church Fathers made no exceptions.<ref name=McKinnon3/> Since the New Testament never condemns instruments themselves, much less in any of these settings, it is believed that \"the church Fathers go beyond the New Testament in pronouncing a negative judgment on musical instruments.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=74}}</ref>\n* Written opposition to instruments in worship began near the turn of the 5th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=52, 53}}</ref> Modern opponents of instruments typically do not make the same assessment of instruments as these writers,{{refn|group=\"nb\"|Rather than calling the use of instruments \"evil\", modern opposition typically uses terms like \"unspiritual\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=88}}</ref> or an Old Testament \"shadow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|Lewis|West|1984|p=109}}</ref>}} who argued that God had allowed David the \"evil\" of using musical instruments in praise.<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=7}}</ref> While the Old Testament teaches that God specifically asked for musical instruments,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}</ref> modern concern is for worship based on the New Testament.\n\nSince \"a cappella\" singing brought a new polyphony (more than one note at a time) with instrumental accompaniment, it is not surprising that Protestant reformers who opposed the instruments (such as Calvin and Zwingli) also opposed the polyphony.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=107}}</ref> While Zwingli was destroying organs in Switzerland&nbsp;\u2013 Luther called him a fanatic&nbsp;\u2013 the Church of England was burning books of polyphony.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=109}}</ref>\n\nSome [[Holiness Churches]] such as the [[Free Methodist Church]] opposed the use of musical instruments in church worship until the mid-20th century. The Free Methodist Church allowed for local church decision on the use of either an organ or piano in the 1943 Conference before lifting the ban entirely in 1955. The [[Reformed Free Methodist Church]] and [[Evangelical Wesleyan Church]] were formed as a result of a schism with the Free Methodist Church, with the former retaining a cappella worship and the latter retaining the rule limiting the number of instruments in the church to the piano and organ.<ref name=\"Jones1974\"/>\n\n===Jewish===\nWhile worship in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] included musical instruments ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25\u201329:27}}), traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the last destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments<ref>{{harvnb|Price|2005|p=68}}</ref> given the practice of scriptural [[cantillation]].<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=85}}</ref> The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as [[zemirot]] outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During [[the Three Weeks]] musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the [[Counting of the Omer|counting of the omer]] between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.<ref>{{harvnb|Melamed|2013}}</ref> This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as ''sefirah'' music.<ref name=\"Shircago\">{{harvnb|Shircago|2013}}</ref>\n\nThe popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]], born 20 BC. Weaving together Jewish and Greek thought, Philo promoted praise without instruments, and taught that \"silent singing\" (without even vocal chords) was better still.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=39\u201341}}</ref> This view parted with the Jewish scriptures, where Israel offered praise with instruments by God's own command ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}).

Based on democratic principles which continue to this day, [http://www.harmonyinc.org Harmony, Inc.] is smaller than its counterpart, but has an atmosphere of friendship and competition. With about 2,500 members in the United States and Canada, Harmony, Inc. uses the same rules in contest that the Barbershop Harmony Society uses. Harmony, Inc. is registered in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n===Amateur and high school===\nThe popularity of a cappella among high schools and amateurs was revived by television shows and movies such as ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' and ''[[Pitch Perfect (film series)|Pitch Perfect]]''. High school groups may have conductors or student leaders who keep the tempo for the group, or beatboxers/vocal percussionists.\n\n==In other countries==\n{{expand section|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Pakistan===\nThe musical show ''Strepsils Stereo'' is credited for introducing the art of a cappella in [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1178175 |title=Strepsils Stereo brings A Capella to Pakistan for the first time |work=Dawn |date=11 August 2017 |accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nComposer [[Dinesh Subasinghe]] became the first [[Sri Lanka]]n to write a cappella pieces for [[SATB]] choirs.

This movement has been bolstered by organisations such as [[The Voice Festival UK]].\n\n==Collegiate==\n{{main|Collegiate a cappella|List of collegiate a cappella groups|List of collegiate a cappella groups in the UK}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nIt is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://issuu.com/tcdigitalrepository/docs/2014spring |magazine=Trinity Reporter |date=Spring 2014 |page=18|title=Perfect Harmony |via=issu.com |quote=founded in the 19th century |first=Jim H. |last=Smith }}</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=RPI glee club founding year not specified}} However the longest continuously-singing group is probably [[The Whiffenpoofs]] of [[Yale University]],<ref name=Yale>{{harvnb|Anon|1999}}</ref> which was formed in 1909 and once included [[Cole Porter]] as a member.<ref name=Yale /> Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include [[Colgate University]]'s [[The Colgate Thirteen|The Colgate 13]] (1942), [[Dartmouth College]]'s Aires (1946), [[Cornell University]]'s Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the [[University of Maine]] Maine Steiners (1958), the [[Columbia University]] Kingsmen (1949), the [http://www.jabberwocks.com Jabberwocks] of [[Brown University]] (1949), and the [[University of Rochester]] YellowJackets (1956).\n\nAll-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a [[parody]] of the men's groups: the [[Smiffenpoofs]] of [[Smith College]] (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and [[The Chattertocks of Brown University]] (1951). A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the [[Beelzebubs|Tufts University Beelzebubs]] and the [[Dear Abbeys|Boston University Dear Abbeys]]. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including [[vocal percussion]]/\"[[beatboxing]]\". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as [[the Georgetown Chimes]]' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as [[List of quartet champions by year|International Quartet Champions]] [[Boston Common (quartet)|The Boston Common]] and the contemporary commercial a cappella group [[Rockapella]]. Co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists, including [[John Legend]], an alumnus of the Counterparts at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Sara Bareilles]], an alumna of Awaken A Cappella at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. [[Mira Sorvino]] is an alumna of [[the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones]] of [[Harvard College]], where she had the solo on [[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]] by [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz]].\n\nA cappella is gaining popularity among South Asians with the emergence of primarily Hindi-English College groups. The first South Asian a cappella group was [[Penn Masala]], founded in 1996 at the University of Pennsylvania. Co-ed South Asian a cappella groups are also gaining in popularity. The first co-ed south Asian a cappella was Anokha, from the [[University of Maryland]], formed in 2001. Also, Dil se, another co-ed a cappella from UC Berkeley, hosts the \"Anahat\" competition at the University of California, Berkeley annually. Maize Mirchi, the co-ed a cappella group from the [[University of Michigan]] hosts \"Sa Re Ga Ma Pella\", an annual South Asian a cappella invitational with various groups from the Midwest. Another South Asian group from the Midwest is Chai Town who is based in the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.\n\nJewish-interest groups such as [[Queens College]]'s Tizmoret, [[Tufts University]]'s [[Shir Appeal]], [[University of Chicago]]'s Rhythm and Jews, [[Binghamton University]]'s Kaskeset, [[Ohio State University]]'s Meshuganotes, [[Rutgers University]]'s Kol Halayla, [[New York University]]'s Ani V'Ata and [[Yale University]]'s Magevet are also gaining popularity across the U.S.<ref>{{harvnb|Ginsberg|2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Altshuler|2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|2011}}</ref>\n\nIncreased interest in modern a cappella (particularly collegiate a cappella) can be seen in the growth of awards such as the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (overseen by the [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]]) and competitions such as the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] for college groups and the [[Harmony Sweepstakes]] for all groups. In December 2009, a new television competition series called ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' aired on [[NBC]]. The show featured eight a cappella groups from the United States and Puerto Rico vying for the prize of $100,000 and a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]/[[Sony Music]]. The show was judged by [[Ben Folds]], [[Shawn Stockman]], and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and was won by an all-male group from Puerto Rico called [[Nota (group)|Nota]]. The show returned for a second, third and fourth season, won by [[Committed (group)|Committed]], [[Pentatonix]] and [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] respectively.\n\nEach year, hundreds of Collegiate a cappella groups submit their strongest songs in a competition to be on The Best of College A Cappella (BOCA), an album compilation of tracks from the best college a cappella groups around the world. The album is produced by Varsity Vocals&nbsp;\u2013 which also produces the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella&nbsp;\u2013 and [[Deke Sharon]]. ). According to ethnomusicologist Joshua S. Dunchan, \"BOCA carries considerable cache and respect within the field despite the appearance of other compilations in part, perhaps, because of its longevity and the prestige of the individuals behind it.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dunchan|first=Joshua|date=2012|title=Recordings, Technology, and Discourse in Collegiate A Cappella|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/490098|journal=Journal of American Folklore|volume=125|issue=498|pages=488\u2013502|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.5406/jamerfolk.125.498.0488}}</ref>\n\nCollegiate a cappella groups may also submit their tracks to Voices Only, a two-disc series released at the beginning of each school year. A Voices Only album has been released every year since 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, all women's a cappella groups can send their strongest song tracks to the Women's A Cappella Association (WACA) for its annual best of women's a cappella album. WACA offers another medium for women's voices to receive recognition and has released an album every year since 2014, featuring women's groups from across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Women's A Cappella Association |url=http://www.womensacappella.org/#!recordings/cfpt |website=Women's A Cappella Association |access-date=4 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Emulating instruments==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nIn addition to singing words, some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their [[vocal cords]] and mouth, often pitched using specialised pitch pipes. One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were [[The Mills Brothers]] whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally. More recently, \"[[Twilight Zone (dance song)|Twilight Zone]]\" by [[2 Unlimited]] was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series ''Tompkins Square''. Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' series on [[Fox Family Channel]] (now [[ABC Family]]). Groups such as [[Vocal Sampling]] and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music. Vocal artist [[Bobby McFerrin]] is famous for his instrumental emulation. A cappella group [[Naturally Seven]] recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument.\n\nThe [[Swingle Singers]] used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments. [[Beatboxing]], more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the [[hip-hop]] community, where [[Rapping|rap]] is often performed a cappella also. The advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements.<ref>{{harvnb|Pauley|2012}}</ref> Jazz vocalist [[Petra Haden]] used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album ''[[Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out]]'' in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s \"[[Don't Stop Believin']]\", [[The Beach Boys]]' \"[[God Only Knows]]\" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\".\n\nChristian rock group [[Relient K]] recorded the song \"Plead the Fifth\" a cappella on its album ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]''. The group recorded lead singer [[Matt Thiessen]] making drum noises and played them with an electronic drum machine to record the song.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of a cappella groups]]\n** [[List of professional a cappella groups]]\n** [[List of collegiate a cappella groups|List of collegiate a cappella groups in the United States]]\n** [[List of university a cappella groups in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite web|last=Alleman|first=Annie|url=http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/entertainment/8071132-421/chicago-a-cappella-sings-music-of-high-holidays.html|title=Chicago a cappella sings music of high holidays|year=2011|work=Chicago Sun times|location=Chicago, Illinois|ref=harv|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124121724/http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/entertainment/8071132-421/chicago-a-cappella-sings-music-of-high-holidays.html|archivedate=24 January 2012}}\n* {{cite news |last=Altshuler |first=George |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/67365/singers-find-sure-appeal-of-jewish-a-cappella-groups/ |title=Singers find sure appeal of Jewish a cappella groups |newspaper=[[j.

It is located at Farm Road, [[Kau Pui Lung]], [[Kowloon]], [[Hong Kong]].

The spirit of the school is to promote [[Chinese culture]], revive Chinese ethics, and cultivate the \"New Asian quality\" of students.\n\nRecently, the school uses Chinese as the main medium of instruction, offering four classes each from Form 1 to Form 6. In the 1970s, the members of the school board included Prof. [[Tang Chun-i]] and Prof. [[Yu Ying-shih]] etc. The school receives positive evaluation of students' polite behaviour from shop owners as well as the staff working in the vicinity.\n\n==School administration==\nThe founder of the school was Prof. [[Ch'ien Mu]].

She served with the United States Navy from 1963 to 1990.\n\n==Construction and commissioning==\nThe contract to build ''James Monroe'' was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 3 February 1961 and her keel was [[keel laying|laid down]] there on 31 July 1961.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 4 August 1962 sponsored by Mrs. [[Roswell L. Gilpatric]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 7 December 1963, with [[Commander]] [[William H. Sandford]] in command of the Blue Crew and Commander [[Warren R. Cobean, Jr.]], in command of the Gold Crew.\n\n==Operational history==\nFollowing [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] off [[Cape Kennedy, Florida]], ''James Monroe'' spent the early months of 1964 in [[ballistic missile]] tests. She departed for her first deterrent patrol in June 1964. On 17 January 1967, ''James Monroe'' completed her twelfth deterrent patrol, having operated from both [[Holy Loch]], [[Scotland]], and [[Rota, Spain]]. Preparations for the arrival of the submarine squadron went forward with haste throughout the remainder of 1978 and into 1979. Commander [[Submarine Squadron 16]] greeted the submarine tender {{USS|Simon Lake|AS-33|6}}, when she arrived at Kings Bay on 2 July 1979. Four days later, USS ''James Monroe'' entered [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay|Kings Bay]] and moored alongside ''Simon Lake''{{'}}s starboard side to begin a routine refit in preparation for another nuclear weapons deterrence patrol.\n\n==Decommissioning and disposal==\n''James Monroe'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 25 September 1990 and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] the same day.

She departed for her first deterrent patrol in June 1964. On 17 January 1967, ''James Monroe'' completed her twelfth deterrent patrol, having operated from both [[Holy Loch]], [[Scotland]], and [[Rota, Spain]]. Preparations for the arrival of the submarine squadron went forward with haste throughout the remainder of 1978 and into 1979.
