He was admitted to membership of [[Inner Temple]] at an unusually early age and was called to the bar in 1603.{{sfn|Carlyle|1899|p=228}} He was elected MP for [[Tregony (UK Parliament constituency)|Tregony, Cornwall]] in 1601, [[Harwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Harwich]] in 1604 (part year only) and [[Newport (Cornwall) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport, Cornwall]] in 1614.{{sfn|M.R.P.|1981}} In 1619 he was knighted and appointed solicitor to [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]]; the following year, he was a reader of his inn, and he sat as MP for [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]] in the Parliaments of 1621 and 1624\u20135, and for [[East Looe (UK Parliament constituency)|East Looe]] in that of 1625.{{sfn|M.R.P.|1981}}  On the accession of the Prince to throne as Charles I in 1625, Trevor was advanced to the degree of [[serjeant-at-law]], and shortly afterwards was appointed a judge of the [[Exchequer of pleas|Court of Exchequer]]. In that capacity he became a member of the Commission to exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction in 1633.{{sfn|Carlyle|1899|p=228}}\n\nIn 1637, Trevor was one of the twelve judges who collectively gave an opinion that the Crown could legitimately collect [[Ship Money]], and the following year gave judgment in court to the same effect in Hampden's case. As a consequence, in 1641 Parliament began proceedings to [[impeachment#United Kingdom|impeach]] him, together with other judges who had supported ship money. Nevertheless, on the outbreak of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] he was one of the few judges who remained in [[London]] and recognised the authority of Parliament. At the conclusion of the impeachment in 1643, he was found guilty, fined and sentenced to be imprisoned at the pleasure of the House of Lords, but he was released immediately and resumed his seat on the bench. At Michaelmas 1643, when the [[Charles I of England|King]] sent a writ demanding the attendance of him and another judge ([[Edmund Reeve]]) on the court at [[Oxford]], they refused and had the messengers arrested: one was later executed as a spy. Despite this, Trevor was opposed to the King's execution, and refused the commission that was offered to him by the new government. He then retired completely from public life until his death.{{sfn|Carlyle|1899|p=228}}\n\n==Family==\nTrevor was twice married: first, to Prudence, daughter of Henry Boteler; and, secondly, to Frances, daughter and heiress of Daniel Blennerhasset of Norfolk. By the former he had an only son [[Sir Thomas Trevor, 1st Baronet|Thomas]], who was created a baronet in 1641, and died without issue on 26 February 1676, when his estate descended to [[Sir Charles Wheler, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Wheler]], grandson of Trevor's sister Mary.{{sfn|Carlyle|1899|p=228}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv |author=M.R.P. |year=1981 |chapter=Trevor, Thomas (c.1573-1656), of Trevalyn, Denb.; London; Enfield, Mdx. and Leamington Hastings, Warws. |title= The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1558-1603 |editor-first=P.W.|editor-last=Hasler \n|publisher=Boydell and Brewer |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/trevor-thomas-1573-1656}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{DNB |last=Carlyle |first=Edward Irving |wstitle=Trevor, Thomas (1586-1656) |volume=57 |page=228}} Endnotes:\n**{{cite book|first=Edward |last=Foss |title=The Judges of England |volume=6 |location=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts |year=1857 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/judgesenglandwi02fossgoog/page/n375 367]\u2013369, [https://archive.org/details/judgesenglandwi02fossgoog/page/n405 397, ff.]}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal|first=Chris R |last=Kyle |title=Prince Charles in the Parliaments of 1621 and 1624 |journal=The Historical Journal |volume=41 |number=3 |year=1998 |pages=603\u2013624 |doi=10.1017/s0018246x98007936}}\n*{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|page=1}} <!-- needs specific pages added (the template takes care of the google book link)-->\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trevor, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1586 births]]\n[[Category:1656 deaths]]\n[[Category:17th-century English lawyers]]\n[[Category:English lawyers]]\n[[Category:People of the Stuart period]]\n[[Category:Members of the pre-1707 English Parliament for constituencies in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:English judges]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1601]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1604\u20131611]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1614]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1621\u20131622]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1624\u20131625]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other people|Thomas Trevor|Thomas Trevor (disambiguation){{!}}Thomas Trevor}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2017}}\n'''Sir Thomas Trevor''' (6 July 1586 \u2013 21 December 1656) was an English lawyer, judge and [[Member of Parliament]], most notable for having delivered the judgment against [[John Hampden]] in the [[Ship Money]] case.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was the fifth and youngest son of John Trevor of Trevalyn, Denbighshire, and the younger brother of [[Richard Trevor (politician)|Richard Trevor]], [[John Trevor (1563\u20131630)|John Trevor]] and [[Sackville Trevor]].
