Roberts had previously built and owned the [[Kansas City International Raceway]] [[dragstrip]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. \n\nRoberts sold I-70 Speedway to [[Greg Weld]] (of WELD wheels) sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s (?).  Weld turned the track into a dirt track. Late in 1989 Roberts, who had continued holding the note on the track, repossessed I-70 Speedway from Weld. At that time, Roberts, along with sons Dennis and Randy, resurfaced the track with asphalt and got it NASCAR sanctioned. Roberts' third son Dan, a Kansas City area country music DJ on [[KFKF-FM]] and later a long-time announcer at [[Arrowhead Stadium]], got his start in sports broadcasting at I-70 Speedway.\n\nThe track hosted [[NASCAR]] [[Craftsman Truck Series]] races from 1995 to 1999. In 2006, a new 3/8 dirt track was built on the site.  The asphalt track is a long 1/2 mile (0.54&nbsp;mi). The back stretch has a small dog-leg.  It is regarded as one of the fastest and highest banked short tracks in the nation. I-70 Speedway was also one of the first tracks to feature a prototypical [[SAFER barrier]]; during a World Cup race in the early 1990s, huge styrofoam blocks were placed high along the retaining wall in all four turns. All-Pro Series driver, and former NASCAR Rookie of the Year, [[Jody Ridley]] hit one of the blocks which sent him airborne over the wall in turn four upside down. Ridley walked away from the wreck, but this style of barrier was only used in a few more races at I-70.\n\nI-70 was considered the \"home\" track of many NASCAR drivers such as [[Rusty Wallace]], [[Clint Bowyer]], and [[Larry Phillips (racing driver)|Larry Phillips]]. [[James Ince]], who was Larry Phillips crew chief and later a NASCAR Crew Chief of the Year with [[Johnny Benson Jr.]], also started his career at I-70 Speedway. Other notable drivers who had driven there (not all of them on a full-time basis) included [[Mark Martin]], [[Butch Miller (racing driver)|Butch Miller]], [[Bob Senneker]], [[Dick Trickle]], [[Mike Eddy]], [[Johnny Benson Jr.]], [[Jamie McMurray]], [[John O'Neal Jr.]], [[Terry Bivins]], [[Jenny White (racing driver)|Jenny White]], and Jennifer Jo Cobb.  Short track driver [[Joe Shear]] once held the 4 barrel Late Model track record. [[Adam Petty]], grandson of [[Richard Petty]], once won an ASA race there.\n\nFamous actor and race car driver Paul Newman rented the race track in 1990, while he was filming in the Kansas City area, for a private practice session.  He drove some of the local race cars including that of the 1989 Late Model Track Champion, Jay Truelove. \n\nBill Roberts sold the track to Ted Carlson sometime in the mid-1990s.  Carlson later sold the track to Brad McDonald. The track has hosted [[stock car racing]] and [[kart racing]] events. It used to offer a twin-billing Saturday night dirt track and asphalt track show.  The dirt track is directly behind the original asphalt facility. The major asphalt event held at the track was the World Cup.  This event first featured the All-Pro series, but in later years it featured the ASA Late Model Series (formerly known as [[ARTGO]] and NASCAR Midwest Series) North vs. South Showdown. On July 5, 2018 it was announced that both Kansas City International Raceway & I-70 Speedway were bought and would reopen in 2019 with the half mile asphalt oval at I-70 being converted to a dirt track with a drag strip to be included on the property.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/HeartlandMotorsportsPark/posts/10157664208602627</ref> After delays and negotiations with the [[Lafayette County, Missouri]], the opening of the new complex is now projected to be in 2020.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[NASCAR Midwest Series]] (also former known as ARTGO) ran 3 races under NASCAR banner from 1999 to 2001.

For the desert, see [[Cholistan Desert]]''\nIn a tradition of the [[Moriori people|Moriori]] people of the [[Chatham Islands]], '''Rohe''' is the wife of the demi-god [[M\u0101ui (M\u0101ori mythology)|M\u0101ui]]. Beautiful Rohe was a sister of the [[sun]], and her face shone. A quarrel arose after Rohe remarked that M\u0101ui's face was [[Ugliness|ugly]]. M\u0101ui then decided that they should change faces. \n\nAfterwards M\u0101ui used [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to kill Rohe, but her [[spirit]] returned and destroyed M\u0101ui. Thus were [[black magic]] and [[death]] introduced into the world. After her death, Rohe ruled as the goddess of the p\u014d (spirit [[world]]), where she gathered in the spirits of the dead. Evil influences were attributed to her (Best 1982:362-363, Shand 1897:125-126).\n\n==Cook Islands==\nIn Mangaia, the name '''Ro'e''' appears in '''Te Aka-ia-Ro'e''' (the root of all existence) which, according to Tregear, is 'a spirit in the form of a thick stem tapering to a point, and is situated at the bottom of the Universe, sustaining the [[Cosmos]]' (Gill 1976:1, Tregear 1891:421). According to Elsdon Best, the goddess exchanges heads with M\u0101ui (Best 1982:363).\n\n==M\u0101ori==\nThe M\u0101ori knew little of '''Rohe'''. Tregear records the one [[myth]] associated with her, in which she is the wife of [[M\u0101ui (M\u0101ori mythology)|M\u0101ui]]. She was beautiful as he was ugly, and she refused his request to exchange faces. M\u0101ui, however, recited an [[incantation]], and their faces were switched. In anger Rohe left him, and refused to live any longer in the world of [[light]]. She went to the [[underworld]], and became a [[goddess]] of the p\u014d ([[night]] or spirit world). Rohe is said sometimes to beat the spirits of deceased as they pass through her realm. Her home is in that division of the  night world called [[Uranga-o-te-r\u0101|Te Uranga-o-te-r\u0101]]. M\u0101ui and Rohe had a son named Rangihore, the god of rocks and stones (Craig 1989:231, Best 1982:362, Tregear 1891:421). <ref>One source gives 'Koke' as another name for Rohe: this looks suspiciously like a misreading rather than a plausible alternative name.</ref>\n\n==Tahiti==\nIn Tahiti, the 'Father of Famine' is called '''Rohe-upo'o-nui''', (Large-headed Rohe) (Tregear 1891:421).\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* E.

Thus were [[black magic]] and [[death]] introduced into the world. After her death, Rohe ruled as the goddess of the p\u014d (spirit [[world]]), where she gathered in the spirits of the dead. Evil influences were attributed to her (Best 1982:362-363, Shand 1897:125-126).\n\n==Cook Islands==\nIn Mangaia, the name '''Ro'e''' appears in '''Te Aka-ia-Ro'e''' (the root of all existence) which, according to Tregear, is 'a spirit in the form of a thick stem tapering to a point, and is situated at the bottom of the Universe, sustaining the [[Cosmos]]' (Gill 1976:1, Tregear 1891:421). According to Elsdon Best, the goddess exchanges heads with M\u0101ui (Best 1982:363).\n\n==M\u0101ori==\nThe M\u0101ori knew little of '''Rohe'''. Tregear records the one [[myth]] associated with her, in which she is the wife of [[M\u0101ui (M\u0101ori mythology)|M\u0101ui]]. She was beautiful as he was ugly, and she refused his request to exchange faces. M\u0101ui, however, recited an [[incantation]], and their faces were switched. In anger Rohe left him, and refused to live any longer in the world of [[light]]. She went to the [[underworld]], and became a [[goddess]] of the p\u014d ([[night]] or spirit world). Rohe is said sometimes to beat the spirits of deceased as they pass through her realm. Her home is in that division of the  night world called [[Uranga-o-te-r\u0101|Te Uranga-o-te-r\u0101]]. M\u0101ui and Rohe had a son named Rangihore, the god of rocks and stones (Craig 1989:231, Best 1982:362, Tregear 1891:421). <ref>One source gives 'Koke' as another name for Rohe: this looks suspiciously like a misreading rather than a plausible alternative name.</ref>\n\n==Tahiti==\nIn Tahiti, the 'Father of Famine' is called '''Rohe-upo'o-nui''', (Large-headed Rohe) (Tregear 1891:421).\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* E.

He left to study theology at [[Strasbourg]] but returned early due to ill health. After recovering, he finished his studies in [[Rome]], becoming a doctor of theology. He was named archpriest of [[Satu Mare]] and also [[Canon (priest)|canon]] at the [[Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral, Baia Mare|Baia Mare cathedral]].

He lived hidden at the nunciature and in 1950 was consecrated bishop by [[Gerald Patrick O'Hara]].

Released in 1964, he returned to Arini\u015f, where he had been presumed dead, and resumed his duties. Near the end of his life, gravely ill and influenced by others, he consecrated three bishops on his own, without discussion with other bishops or Vatican approval.

The film stars [[Jeffrey Combs]] who portrays John Reilly, an American recovering alcoholic who inherits an Italian castle when a distant relative passes away. John travels to Italy with his estranged wife Susan ([[Barbara Crampton]]) and blind daughter Rebecca ([[Jessica Dollarhide]]). The three plan to stay at the castle, but unbeknownst to them, a freakish monster locked away in the basement of the castle is about to escape and commit a series of murders. The police place John as the prime suspect, leading him to confront his alcoholism, fight the demon and prove himself innocent.\n\n''Castle Freak'' went into production in 1994 after Gordon noticed art for the film in producer [[Charles Band]]'s office. Gordon agreed to develop the film on Band's condition that the film take place in a castle, contain a freak, and would be shot on a very low budget. Gordon obliged as he would be able to cast who he wanted in the film and would get final cut. The film was shot in 1994 in a castle owned by Band in Italy, where Gordon had previously shot ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum (1991 film)|The Pit and the Pendulum]]''. The film was shot during a period when Full Moon Pictures was having financial issues and was released to little press on home video in November 1995.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter inheriting a 12th-century castle which belonged to a famed [[Duchess]], John Reilly and his family, including his wife Susan and their blind teenage daughter Rebecca, travel to Italy to visit. Susan blames John for the death of their five-year-old son in a drunk driving accident which also cost their daughter her [[eyesight]]. On the advice of the estate's executor, the three plan to stay at the [[castle]] until they can liquidate the estate. Unbeknownst to them, the Duchess' son, Giorgio Orsino, who was kept imprisoned and tortured by the Duchess in revenge for her husband leaving her, still lives in the [[dungeon]]s of the castle.\n\nAfter killing and eating a cat, the [[disfigurement|disfigure]]d [[monster|beast]] escapes by means of breaking off his own thumb to get out of the [[manacle]]s which bind him. Giorgio begins to roam the castle, prowling around the bedroom of the terrified Rebecca, who can hear, but not see, him. When she claims that there's someone else in the house, John believes her, but Susan does not. John, still wracked with guilt about the death of his son, turns to drinking alcohol and hires a prostitute who doesn't speak English from the nearby town, angering Susan further for [[infidelity|cheating]]. As she leaves the castle, the prostitute is ambushed and horribly mutilated by Giorgio, and the maid discovers the still-living prostitute before she herself is murdered. Susan plans to leave with Rebecca, but the police order them to stay while they investigate the missing prostitute.\n\nJohn learns that Giorgio is actually his half-brother and that the Duchess was his father's first wife. The Duchess chained Giorgio up and tortured him all of his life because her husband abandoned her and their son for her sister (John's mother) and went to America. However, the police arrest him upon discovering the bodies of the [[maid]] and the prostitute. Susan and Rebecca stay the night in the castle, praying together for forgiveness for John. Giorgio kills two policemen, then abducts Rebecca and chains her up in his cell, but Susan rescues her and stabs Giorgio, making him angry. Determined to save his family, John escapes the police station after a fight with a policeman. He comes to his family's rescue, fighting Giorgio on the roof of the castle and sacrificing his own life to pull Giorgio off the roof and kill him as well. Susan tearfully forgives John and they reaffirm their love as he dies. The son of the prostitute is seen with the policeman (who is the boy's father) at John's funeral.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as John Reilly\n* [[Barbara Crampton]] as Susan Reilly\n* [[Johnathan Fuller]] as Giorgio (the Freak)\n* [[Jessica Dollarhide]] as Rebecca Reilly\n* [[Massimo Sarchielli]] as Giannetti\n* [[Elisabeth Kaza]] as Agnese\n* [[Luca Zingaretti]] as Agent Forte\n* [[Helen Stirling]] as Duchess D'Orsino\n* [[Raffaella Offidani]] as Sylvana\n\n==Production==\nWhile preparing to work on ''[[Space Truckers]]'', director [[Stuart Gordon]]  received the opportunity to develop ''Castle Freak''.<ref name=\"scifi\" /> Gordon was in [[Charles Band]]'s office and noticed a poster entitled ''Castle Freak'', with a [[Quasimodo]]-like man chained to a wall being whipped by a woman.<ref name=\"scifi\">{{Cite book |title=Science Fiction Film Directors, 1895\u20131998 |last=Fischer |first=Dennis |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |isbn=9780786485055 |pages=256}}</ref> When Gordon asked about it, Band replied, \"Well, that's a castle and there's a freak.\"<ref name=\"scifi\" /> Band said he had no script, but if Gordon wanted it, he could do whatever he wanted with the idea as long as he maintained the concepts of a castle and a freak.<ref name=\"scifi\" /> Gordon made the film for about $500,000<ref name=\"scifi\" /> When asked why he was prompted to make another low-budget film, Gordon responded that it would be his first film since ''[[Re-Animator]]'' that he could release without a rating, he would be given final cut on the film, and he had the ability to cast whoever he wanted, stating, \"Even though the budget was tiny, I had complete control. \"<ref name=\"scifi\" /> \n\nSpeaking about the film's influences, [[Daniele Massaccesi]] who was part of the crew, stated that, \"''Castle Freak'' is full of Lovecraftian references [...] although the director may argue this point of view.\"<ref name=\"cf-31\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|title=The Castle Freak Awakens|last=Curci|first=Loris|page=31|issue=148|date=November 1995}}</ref> Gordon stated that both himself and screenwriter [[Dennis Paoli]] took influence from the short story \"[[The Outsider and Others|The Outsider]]\".
