As the band's songs featured [[English language]] lyrics, and as their first releases were released through [[independent record label]]s, the band initially did not manage to break through mainstream media.

Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquire the knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith. At a young age, he moved to [[Nishapur]] to study philosophy under Farid al-Din Damad and mathematics under [[Muhammad Hasib]].<ref name=\"HistMuslimPhil\">Siddiqi, Bakhtyar Husain. \"Nasir al-Din Tusi\".

Beginning in 1259, the [[Maragheh observatory|Rasad Khaneh observatory]] was constructed in [[Azarbaijan]], south of the river [[Aras (river)|Aras]], and to the west of [[Maragheh]], the capital of the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanate Empire]].<ref name=\"Rossabi2014\">{{cite book|author=Morris Rossabi|title=From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia: The Writings of Morris Rossabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXejBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA281&lpg=PA281#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=28 November 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28529-3|pages=281\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBased on the observations in this for the time being most advanced observatory, Tusi made very accurate tables of [[Ephemeris|planetary movements]] as depicted in his book ''[[Zij-i ilkhani]]'' (''Ilkhanic Tables''). This book contains astronomical tables for calculating the positions of the planets and the names of the stars. His model for the planetary system is believed to be the most advanced of his time, and was used extensively until the development of the heliocentric model in the time of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Between [[Ptolemy]] and [[Copernicus]], he is considered by many{{who|date=April 2014}} to be one of the most eminent astronomers of his time. His famous student ''Shams ad-Din Al-Bukhari'' <ref name=\"Shams\"/> was the teacher of [[Byzantine]] scholar ''[[Gregory Choniades]],'' <ref name=\"Chioniadis\">{{MathGenealogy|id=201288}}</ref> who had in turn trained [[astronomer]] ''[[Manuel Bryennios]]'' <ref name=\"Bryennios\">{{MathGenealogy|id=184632}}</ref> about 1300 in [[Constantinople]].\n\nFor his planetary models, he invented a geometrical technique called a [[Tusi-couple]], which generates linear motion from the sum of two circular motions. He used this technique to replace [[Ptolemy]]'s problematic [[equant]]<ref>Craig G.

He defended a version of Aristotle's ''[[scala naturae]]'', in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described \"grasses which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,\"<ref name=\"NEp44\">Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the [[date-palm]] as the most highly developed, since \"it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment.\"<ref name=\"NEp44\" />\n\nThe lowest animals \"are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. earthworms, and certain insects\".<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> The animals \"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating [[natural theology]]. He continued:\n\n{{quote|\"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled horse and the trained falcon. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...]. This is the utmost of the animal degrees, and the first of the degrees of Man in contiguous therewith.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45f.</ref>}}\n\nThus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of [[learning]], recognising [[observational learning]] as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals.\n\nTusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that \"the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species\", and that, by possessing a \"Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among ''other'' animals.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M.

Fulfilling the wish of his father, the young Muhammad took learning and scholarship very seriously and traveled far and wide to attend the lectures of renowned scholars and acquire the knowledge, an exercise highly encouraged in his Islamic faith. At a young age, he moved to [[Nishapur]] to study philosophy under Farid al-Din Damad and mathematics under [[Muhammad Hasib]].<ref name=\"HistMuslimPhil\">Siddiqi, Bakhtyar Husain. \"Nasir al-Din Tusi\".

Beginning in 1259, the [[Maragheh observatory|Rasad Khaneh observatory]] was constructed in [[Azarbaijan]], south of the river [[Aras (river)|Aras]], and to the west of [[Maragheh]], the capital of the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanate Empire]].<ref name=\"Rossabi2014\">{{cite book|author=Morris Rossabi|title=From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia: The Writings of Morris Rossabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXejBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA281&lpg=PA281#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=28 November 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28529-3|pages=281\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBased on the observations in this for the time being most advanced observatory, Tusi made very accurate tables of [[Ephemeris|planetary movements]] as depicted in his book ''[[Zij-i ilkhani]]'' (''Ilkhanic Tables''). This book contains astronomical tables for calculating the positions of the planets and the names of the stars. His model for the planetary system is believed to be the most advanced of his time, and was used extensively until the development of the heliocentric model in the time of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Between [[Ptolemy]] and [[Copernicus]], he is considered by many{{who|date=April 2014}} to be one of the most eminent astronomers of his time. His famous student ''Shams ad-Din Al-Bukhari'' <ref name=\"Shams\"/> was the teacher of [[Byzantine]] scholar ''[[Gregory Choniades]],'' <ref name=\"Chioniadis\">{{MathGenealogy|id=201288}}</ref> who had in turn trained [[astronomer]] ''[[Manuel Bryennios]]'' <ref name=\"Bryennios\">{{MathGenealogy|id=184632}}</ref> about 1300 in [[Constantinople]].\n\nFor his planetary models, he invented a geometrical technique called a [[Tusi-couple]], which generates linear motion from the sum of two circular motions. He used this technique to replace [[Ptolemy]]'s problematic [[equant]]<ref>Craig G.

He defended a version of Aristotle's ''[[scala naturae]]'', in which he placed man above animals, plants, minerals, and the elements. He described \"grasses which grow without sowing or cultivation, by the mere mingling of elements,\"<ref name=\"NEp44\">Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> as closest to minerals. Among plants, he considered the [[date-palm]] as the most highly developed, since \"it only lacks one thing further to reach (the stage of) an animal: to tear itself loose from the soil and to move away in the quest for nourishment.\"<ref name=\"NEp44\" />\n\nThe lowest animals \"are adjacent to the region of plants: such are those animals which propagate like grass, being incapable of mating [...], e.g. earthworms, and certain insects\".<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> The animals \"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating [[natural theology]]. He continued:\n\n{{quote|\"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled horse and the trained falcon. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...]. This is the utmost of the animal degrees, and the first of the degrees of Man in contiguous therewith.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M. Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45f.</ref>}}\n\nThus, in this paragraph, Tusi described different types of [[learning]], recognising [[observational learning]] as the most advanced form, and correctly attributing it to certain animals.\n\nTusi seems to have perceived man as belonging to the animals, since he stated that \"the Animal Soul [comprising the faculties of perception and movement ...] is restricted to individuals of the animal species\", and that, by possessing a \"Human Soul, [...] mankind is distinguished and particularized among ''other'' animals.\"<ref>Nasir ad-Din Tusi (1964) ''The Nasirean Ethics'' (translator: G.M.

Created by [[cartoonist]]s [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d March 1941) from [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a [[American patriotism|patriotic]] [[supersoldier]] who often fought the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]] and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the ''Captain America'' comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.\n\nThe character wears a costume bearing an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], and he utilizes a [[Captain America's shield|nearly indestructible shield]] that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the [[alter ego]] of '''Steve Rogers''', a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the [[United States]] government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in [[Cryopreservation|suspended animation]] until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure in his community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\nCaptain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 [[Serial (film)|movie serial]], ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]''. Since then, the character has been featured in [[Captain America in other media|other films and television series]]. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] is portrayed by [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]].\n\nCaptain America was ranked sixth on [[IGN]]'s \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time\" in 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|date= 2011|website=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173526/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|archivedate= June 30, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate= July 9, 2015}}</ref> second in their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\" in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|date= April 30, 2012 |title= The Top 50 Avengers|website=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151129171205/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|archivedate= November 29, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and second in their \"Top 25 best Marvel superheroes\" list in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.uk.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|title=Top 25 Best Marvel Superheroes|first1= Joshua|last1= Yehl|first2= Jeff|last2= Lake|date= September 10, 2014|website= IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031191046/http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|archivedate= October 31, 2014|url-status=live|accessdate= October 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\n{{further|List of Captain America titles}}\n\n===Creation===\nIn 1940, writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume.<ref>1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program, cover</ref> \"I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page,\" Simon said in his autobiography, and then decided:\n\n{{quote|No, it didn't work.

Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist [[Jack Kirby]], could handle the workload alone:\n\n{{quote|I didn't have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue&nbsp; ... There were two young artists from [[Connecticut]] that had made a strong impression on me. [[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new ''Captain America'' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. \"You're still number one, Jack,\" I assured him. \"It's just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue.\"\n\n\"I'll make the deadline,\" Jack promised. \"I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline.\" I hadn't expected this kind of reaction&nbsp; ... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby ... I wrote the first ''Captain America'' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures.\"<ref name=joesimonp50 />}}\n[[File:1974ComicArtCon book.jpg|thumb|left|1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program featuring Simon's original sketch of Captain America]]\nAl Lieberman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.<ref>Simon, p. 51.</ref>\n\nSimon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in [[World War II]] and felt war was inevitable: \"The opponents to the war were all quite well organized.

To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.\n\nCaptain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the [[Wakanda]] Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.\n\n==Antagonists==\n{{Main|List of Captain America enemies}}\nCaptain America has faced numerous foes in over 70 years of published adventures. Many of his recurring foes embody ideologies contrary to the American values that Captain America is shown to strive for and believes in. Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism ([[Red Skull]], [[Baron Zemo]]), [[neo-Nazism]] ([[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]), technocratic fascism ([[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], [[Arnim Zola]]), Communism ([[Aleksander Lukin]]), amoral capitalism ([[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]), anti-patriotism ([[Flag Smasher]]) and international and domestic terrorism ([[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]]).\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Captain America}}\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America in other media}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{cite web | last=Gladstone | first=Brooke | url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/129271-death-to-america/#transcript | title= Death to America | publisher=Transcript and streaming audio; [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Joe Simon]] interviewed|work=[[On the Media]]|date=March 9, 2007 | accessdate=July 27, 2007}}\n*{{cite web | last=Powell | first=Matt | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003800596.cfm | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | date=March 7, 2007 | title=Captain America Remembered | accessdate=July 27, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309130111/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003800596.cfm|archivedate=March 9, 2007}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140502000500/http://captainamericalibrary.com/ Captain America Library] (fan site).

Created by [[cartoonist]]s [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d March 1941) from [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a [[American patriotism|patriotic]] [[supersoldier]] who often fought the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]] and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the ''Captain America'' comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.\n\nThe character wears a costume bearing an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], and he utilizes a [[Captain America's shield|nearly indestructible shield]] that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the [[alter ego]] of '''Steve Rogers''', a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the [[United States]] government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in [[Cryopreservation|suspended animation]] until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure in his community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\nCaptain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 [[Serial (film)|movie serial]], ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]''. Since then, the character has been featured in [[Captain America in other media|other films and television series]]. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] is portrayed by [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]].\n\nCaptain America was ranked sixth on [[IGN]]'s \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time\" in 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|date= 2011|website=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173526/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|archivedate= June 30, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate= July 9, 2015}}</ref> second in their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\" in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|date= April 30, 2012 |title= The Top 50 Avengers|website=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151129171205/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|archivedate= November 29, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and second in their \"Top 25 best Marvel superheroes\" list in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.uk.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|title=Top 25 Best Marvel Superheroes|first1= Joshua|last1= Yehl|first2= Jeff|last2= Lake|date= September 10, 2014|website= IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031191046/http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|archivedate= October 31, 2014|url-status=live|accessdate= October 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\n{{further|List of Captain America titles}}\n\n===Creation===\nIn 1940, writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume.<ref>1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program, cover</ref> \"I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page,\" Simon said in his autobiography, and then decided:\n\n{{quote|No, it didn't work.

Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist [[Jack Kirby]], could handle the workload alone:\n\n{{quote|I didn't have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue&nbsp; ... There were two young artists from [[Connecticut]] that had made a strong impression on me. [[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new ''Captain America'' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. \"You're still number one, Jack,\" I assured him. \"It's just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue.\"\n\n\"I'll make the deadline,\" Jack promised. \"I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline.\" I hadn't expected this kind of reaction&nbsp; ... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby ... I wrote the first ''Captain America'' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures.\"<ref name=joesimonp50 />}}\n[[File:1974ComicArtCon book.jpg|thumb|left|1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program featuring Simon's original sketch of Captain America]]\nAl Lieberman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.<ref>Simon, p. 51.</ref>\n\nSimon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in [[World War II]] and felt war was inevitable: \"The opponents to the war were all quite well organized.

He is an expert in combat strategy, survival, acrobatics, [[parkour]], military strategy, piloting, and demolitions.

To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.\n\nCaptain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the [[Wakanda]] Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.\n\n==Antagonists==\n{{Main|List of Captain America enemies}}\nCaptain America has faced numerous foes in over 70 years of published adventures. Many of his recurring foes embody ideologies contrary to the American values that Captain America is shown to strive for and believes in. Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism ([[Red Skull]], [[Baron Zemo]]), [[neo-Nazism]] ([[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]), technocratic fascism ([[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], [[Arnim Zola]]), Communism ([[Aleksander Lukin]]), amoral capitalism ([[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]), anti-patriotism ([[Flag Smasher]]) and international and domestic terrorism ([[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]]).\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Captain America}}\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America in other media}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{cite web | last=Gladstone | first=Brooke | url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/129271-death-to-america/#transcript | title= Death to America | publisher=Transcript and streaming audio; [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Joe Simon]] interviewed|work=[[On the Media]]|date=March 9, 2007 | accessdate=July 27, 2007}}\n*{{cite web | last=Powell | first=Matt | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003800596.cfm | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | date=March 7, 2007 | title=Captain America Remembered | accessdate=July 27, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309130111/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003800596.cfm|archivedate=March 9, 2007}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140502000500/http://captainamericalibrary.com/ Captain America Library] (fan site).

Rainforest [[bushfood]] were a regular part of the traditional Bundjalung diet, including staples like [[Castanospermum|Black Bean, ''Castanospermum australe'']], which is detoxified before eating.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/gnp/interns-2002/castanospermum-australe.html | title = Castanospermum australe, Black Bean, Moreton Bay Chestnut | publisher = [[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] | access-date = 2016-02-19 | quote = The Black Bean has also proved valuable as a timber species, its seeds have been utilized - following extensive preparation as a food by Aborigines and it contains alkaloids which have been shown to have anti-HIV and anti -cancer properties.}}</ref>\n\nThe Big Scrub was dominated by White Booyong (''[[Heritiera trifiolata]]'') and [[Australian Red Cedar]] (''Toona australis''). The latter was eagerly sought by the 'cedar getters' for its fine quality timber. The cedar getters were the first non-indigenous people to exploit the Big Scrub area.\n\nLater, the [[Government of New South Wales]] gave allotments to potential farmers on the basis that they cleared it of rainforest. Hence, most of the Big Scrub was cleared, and the surviving Bundjalung were placed into reservations.\n\nIn the 20th century, interest in rainforest and conservation resulted in a greater effort to conserve the few remaining remnants of the Big Scrub. The major remnants are: the [[Booyong Flora Reserve]], [[Victoria Park Nature Reserve]], [[Davis Scrub Nature Reserve]], Boatharbour, and [[Hayters Hill Nature Reserve]]. These remnants have been subject to ecological restoration projects which involves the removal of invasive non-native weeds.\n\nBig Scrub remnants have become a source of native foods for cropping, especially in recent years. These include the [[macadamia]] nut, [[riberry]] and [[Finger Lime]].\nMacadamia nut is now grown commercially over much of the former Big Scrub area, but the main species used in cropping, ''Macadamia integrifolia'', did not naturally occur in the Big Scrub.\n\n==Remnant trees of the Big Scrub==\n<gallery>\nImage:Gmelina 30 metres - DavisScrub.jpg|[[White Beech]] in a remnant of the Big Scrub - [[Alstonville]], [[NSW]]\nImage:White Booyong - Booyong Reserve.jpg|Twin White Booyong growing in a remnant of the Big Scrub - Booyong Reserve, [[NSW]]\nImage:Ficus macrophylla - Alstonville.jpg|Emergent [[Moreton Bay Fig]] growing in a remnant of the Big Scrub, [[Davis Scrub Nature Reserve|Davis Scrub]] near [[Alstonville]]\nImage:Syzygium francisii - Booyong Reserve - edited.jpg|[[Syzygium francisii]] - Booyong Reserve, near [[Lismore, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|environment}}}}\n* [[Andrew Johnston Big Scrub Nature Reserve]]\n* [[Booyong Flora Reserve]]\n* [[Davis Scrub Nature Reserve]]\n* [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia]]\n* [[Hayters Hill]]\n* [[Victoria Park Nature Reserve]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.bigscrubrainforest.org.au/|work=Big Scrub Rainforest Landcare Group|title=Homepage|year=2014 }}\n*{{cite web|url=http://nrgeology.blogspot.com.au/2016/05/geology-of-big-scrub-rainforest-part-1.html|work=Northern Rivers Geology|title=Northern Rivers Geology - Geology of the Bigscrub Part 1|year=2016}}\n\n{{coord missing|New South Wales}}\n\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Forests of New South Wales]]\n\n\n{{NewSouthWales-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toAlstonville(link changed toAlstonville, New South Wales; link changed toAlstonville, New South Wales) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Scrub"}

Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva, its name a deliberate misspelling of a small [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Yorkshire]] hamlet called [[Ruston Parva]]. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group re-formed as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university. Parva's career went beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]] closed the [[Mantra Recordings|Mantra]] label, Parva were dropped and left desolate and without any direction after the release of an album (''[[22 (album)|22]]'') and three singles (\"Heavy\", \"Good Bad Right Wrong\" and \"Hessles\").\n\nAccording to manager James Sandom in an interview with [[HitQuarters]], as a dropped band they had become damaged goods, \"No one would touch them because they had a history.

For the album the band reunited with [[Ben H. Allen]], the producer who worked on the band's 2014 album ''[[Education, Education, Education & War]]''. The album was preceded by a UK tour in January and February, including concerts at London's [[O2 Academy Brixton]] and [[O2 Academy Birmingham]], where several new songs from the album were premiered. The band also played a homecoming show at Elland Road in Leeds on 8 June 2019. Duck was later toured around arenas in the UK and Europe in early 2020.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Record Collection\", was released on 23 May 2019, with \"People Know How To Love One Another\" released as a second single on 6 June 2019. \"Golden Oldies\" was released as the third single in October 2019. All failed to chart.\n\nThe name sparked interest with fans which was the opposite of what the band wanted. According to Wilson, they had always had trouble naming records so went with a random title suggested by White.\n\nDuck debuted at number three in the UK charts<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/15414/kaiser-chiefs/|website=Official Charts|accessdate=28 March 2020]]</ref>, a position higher than 2016's Stay Together\n\n==Other appearances==\nIn July 2005 they were chosen to open Bob Geldof's [[Live 8]] festival in [[Philadelphia]]; their performance was broadcast by satellite to every Live 8 venue around the world, giving the band massive worldwide exposure.\n\nIn August 2006, the band released a book entitled ''A Record of Employment'', which along with photos by Peter Hill, documented the band's rise from being unsigned to their triumph at the Brit Awards that year, where the band won awards for 'Best British Band','Best Rock Act' and 'Best New Artist'. Later a DVD entitled ''Enjoyment'', which documented concerts from the first album era was released, this showed members of the band hypothetically interviewed when 'jaded rock stars'.\n\nIn October 2008, they also appeared on MTV Day, in Greece, along with bands like the (Greek) C-Real, REM and the singer [[Gabriella Cilmi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvgreece.gr/article.php?id=2399&category_id=28 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110721083554/http://www.mtvgreece.gr/article.php?id=2399&category_id=28 |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 July 2011 |title=R.E.M, Kaiser Chiefs, C:Real & Gabriella Cilmi |publisher=MTVGreece.gr |accessdate=21 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDuring an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, David Letterman spoke to Nick Hodgson about buying the Kaiser Chiefs drum set after a brief discussion between the pair an undisclosed price was agreed.

Simon Rix stated, \"In our 13 years on the UK touring scene we've never had the chance to play the legendary, Hull Adelphi. It's a massive hole in an illustrious career.
