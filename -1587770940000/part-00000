The [[President of the Republic of China|president]] is the head of state. The government consists of Presidency and five branches (Yuan): the [[Executive Yuan]], [[Legislative Yuan]], [[Judicial Yuan]], [[Examination Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]].\n\nOriginally established in 1912 in [[Nanking]], the Government of the Republic of China relocated several times before [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|finally moving]] to [[Taipei]] in 1949 because of its military losses in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The government has historically been dominated by the Kuomintang, but the situation has changed as Taiwan evolved into a multi-party democracy.\n\n== Organizational structure ==\nThe government formally consists of the presidency and five branches of government, modeled on Sun Yat-sen's political philosophy of [[Three Principles of the People]].\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart| | | OP  |-|-|-| POT |-|-|-| NSC |POT=[[President of the Republic of China|President]]<br />[[File:Commander-in-Chief_Flag_of_the_Republic_of_China.svg|60px]]|OP={{nowrap|[[Office of the President (Taiwan)|Office of the President]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Office of the President Emblem.svg|50px]]|NSC={{nowrap|[[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]]}}<br />[[File:ROC National Security Council Logo.gif|50px]]}}\n{{chart| |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{chart| EY  | | LY  | | JY  | | XY  | | CY  |EY={{nowrap|[[Executive Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Executive Yuan Logo.svg|100px]]|LY={{nowrap|[[Legislative Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Legislative Yuan Seal.svg|50px]]|JY={{nowrap|[[Judicial Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Judicial Yuan Logo.svg|50px]]|XY={{nowrap|[[Examination Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Examination Yuan Seal.jpg|50px]]|CY={{nowrap|[[Control Yuan]]}}<br />[[File:ROC Control Yuan Logo.gif|50px]]}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nIn practice, the system resembles a [[semi-presidential system]] with a uniquely strong presidency, as the President may appoint the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], the [[head of government]], without the consent of the legislature. The President, however, shares limitations found in other semi-presidential systems, including the lack of a strong [[veto]] and no direct control of most administrative policy.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Category!!Name!![[Traditional Chinese character|Chinese]]!!Role\n|-\n|rowspan=4|'''Presidency'''\n|[[President of the Republic of China|President]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u7e3d\u7d71}}}}||[[Head of state]]\n|-\n|[[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u526f\u7e3d\u7d71}}}}||\n|-\n|[[Office of the President (Taiwan)|Office of the President]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u7e3d\u7d71\u5e9c}}}}|| rowspan=\"2\" |Advisory and administrative<br />agencies to the President\n|-\n|[[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u570b\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u6703\u8b70}}}}\n|-\n|rowspan=5|'''Five Yuans'''\n|[[Executive Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u884c\u653f\u9662}}}}||[[Executive (government)|Executive]], [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]\n|-\n|[[Legislative Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u7acb\u6cd5\u9662}}}}||[[Legislature]], [[Parliament]]\n|-\n|[[Judicial Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u53f8\u6cd5\u9662}}}}||[[Judiciary]], [[Constitutional court]]\n|-\n|[[Examination Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u8003\u8a66\u9662}}}}||[[Civil service commission]]\n|-\n|[[Control Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u76e3\u5bdf\u9662}}}}||[[Government performance auditing|Auditory]]\n|}\n\n=== Presidency ===\n[[File:Taipei Taiwan Presidential-Office-Building-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Presidential Office Building]]]]\nThe leadership of the country consists of the two top officials that is directly and jointly elected by the [[Taiwanese people]].\n* [[President of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Vice President of the Republic of China]]\n\nUnder the President, two advisory and administrative agencies are established to supports the work of the President.\n* [[Office of the President (Taiwan)|Office of the President (Presidential Office)]]\n** [[Secretary-General to the President, Republic of China|Secretary-General of the Office of the President]]\n* [[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]]\n** Secretary-General of the National Security Council\n\n=== Executive Yuan ===\n[[File:Executive Yuan 20050703.jpg|thumb|right|Executive Yuan]]\n{{Main|Executive Yuan}}\n\nThe Executive Yuan is in charge of the Premier. However, the ROC's political system does not fit traditional models. The Premier is selected by the President without the need for approval from the Legislature, but the Legislature can pass laws without regard for the President, as neither the President nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the President and the Legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. During the tenure of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian the continued control of the Legislative Yuan by the pan-Blue majority caused legislation to repeatedly stall, as the two sides were deadlocked. There is another curiosity of the ROC system; because the ROC was previously dominated by strongman one-party politics, real power in the system shifted from one position to another, depending on what position was currently occupied by the leader of the state (Chiang Kai-shek and later his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]). This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the President rather than the Premier.\n\n=== Legislative Yuan ===\n[[File:Legislative Yuan (0212).JPG|thumb|right|Legislative Yuan]]\n{{Main|Legislative Yuan}}\n\nThe main [[Legislature|legislative body]] is the [[unicameral]] Legislative Yuan with one hundred and thirteen seats. Seventy-three are elected in single member districts; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties, and six seats are reserved to represent aboriginal groups. Members serve four-year terms. Although sometimes referred to as a \"[[parliament]]\", the Legislative Yuan, under Sun's political theory, is a branch of government, while only the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]], which is now abolished, with the power to amend the constitution and formerly to elect the President and Vice President, could be considered a parliament.  However, after constitutional amendments effectively transferring almost all of the National Assembly's powers to the Legislative Yuan in the late 1990s, it has become more common for newspapers in Taiwan to refer to the Legislative Yuan as the nation's \"parliament\" (\u570b\u6703, ''gu\u00f3hu\u00ec'').\n\n=== Judicial Yuan ===\n[[File:Judicial Yuan Building 20060521.jpg|thumb|right|Judicial Yuan]]\n{{Main|Judicial Yuan}}\n\nThe Judicial Yuan is the ROC's highest [[judiciary]]. The President and Vice-President of the Judicial Yuan and fifteen Justices form the [[Council of Grand Justices]]. They are nominated and appointed by the President of the Republic, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]], consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each of which is formed by a presiding Judge and four Associate Judges, all appointed for life. In 1993, a separate [[constitutional court]] was established to resolve constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process. There is no [[trial by jury]] but the right to a [[fair trial|fair]] and [[public trial]] is protected by law and respected in practice; many cases are presided over by multiple judges.\n\n[[Capital punishment]] is legal. Efforts have been made by the government to reduce the number of executions, although they have not been able to completely abolish the punishment. As of 2006, about 80% of Taiwanese want to keep the death penalty.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/01/02/2003287050 |title = Nation keeps death penalty, but reduces executions |last = Chang |first = Rich |date = 2006-01-02 |publisher=Taipei Times |accessdate = 2009-11-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Examination Yuan ===\n[[File:Examination Yuan main gate 20110603.jpg|thumb|right|Examination Yuan]]\n{{Main|Examination Yuan}}\n\nThe Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants in the Republic of China. As a special branch of government under the [[Three Principles of the People]]. The concept of the Examination Yuan is based on the old [[Imperial examination]] system used in Imperial China.\n\n=== Control Yuan ===\n[[File:Control Yuan.JPG|thumb|right|Control Yuan]]\n{{Main|Control Yuan}}\n\nBased on the traditional Chinese [[censorate]], the Control Yuan is an investigatory agency that monitors the other branches of government. It may be compared to the [[Court of Auditors]] of the European Union, the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the United States, a political [[ombudsman]], or a standing [[Government agency|commission]] for administrative inquiry.\n\n== History ==\nThe Government of the Republic of China was formally established in 1912 in [[Nanking]], with [[Sun Yat-sen]] as President of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] under the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]]. This government moved to [[Beijing]] in the same year with [[Yuan Shikai]] as President, and continued under his successors as the internationally recognized government of [[China]] until 1928. In the [[history of the Republic of China|Republican period]], there were a series of governments, sometimes in rivalry with each other. The [[Nationalist Government|Nationalist government]], led by the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]], was originally formed as a rival military government under Sun Yat-sen in [[Guangzhou]] in 1917. After Sun's death in 1925, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] led the [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] (1926\u20131928) to unify the country and established the capital in Nanjing. This government gained diplomatic recognition but did not control all the territory of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The essentially one-party rule functioned under Sun's [[Three Principles of the People]], which provided for a transitional period of \"tutelage\", but drew more political parties, including the [[Communist Party of China]] into a [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937-1945). The Tutelage Constitution of 1931 was replaced by the  [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] in 1947.<ref>Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng (Qian Duansheng)''The Government and Politics of China, 1912-1949.'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1950).</ref>\n\n=== 1912\u20131928 ===\n{{Main|Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Beiyang Government}}\n<!--Please add new information to the relevant series of articles-->\n[[File:Nanjinglinshizhengfu.jpg|thumb|Cabinet meeting of the Nanjing Provisional Government led by Sun Yat-sen]]\n\nThe first Chinese national government was established on 1 January 1912, in Nanjing, with Sun Yat-sen as the provisional president. Provincial delegates were sent to confirm the authority of the national government, and they later also formed the first parliament. The power of this national government was limited and short-lived, with generals controlling both central and northern [[Provinces of the Republic of China|provinces of China]]. The limited acts passed by this government included the formal abdication of the Qing dynasty and some economic initiatives. The parliament's authority became nominal; violations of the Constitution by [[Yuan Shikai]], who became president in March 1912, were met with half-hearted motions of censure, and Kuomintang members of the parliament who gave up their membership in the KMT were offered 1,000 [[British pounds]]. Yuan maintained power locally by sending military generals to be provincial governors or by obtaining the allegiance of those already in power.\n\nWhen Yuan died, the parliament of 1913 was reconvened to give legitimacy to a new government.  However, the real power of the time passed to military leaders, forming the warlord period. The impotent government still had its use; when [[World War I]] began, several Western powers and Japan wanted China to declare war on [[German Empire|Germany]], in order to liquidate German holdings.\n\nThere were also several warlord governments and puppet states sharing the same name.

The first stage was military unification, which was carried out with the Northern Expedition. The second was \"political tutelage\" which was a provisional government led by the KMT to educate people about their political and civil rights, and the third stage was constitutional government. The KMT considered themselves to be at the second stage in 1928. Although the Nanjing decade was far more stable and progressive as compared to the Warlord period which preceded it, it was still marred with widespread violence, official corruption and the ongoing civil war with the [[Communist Party of China|communists]].\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the invading [[Imperial Japanese Army]] managed to capture Nanjing on 13 December 1937. The Japanese then proceeded to sack the city, and [[Nanjing Massacre|massacred]] hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians. With the fall of Nanjing, the government was forced to move first to [[Wuhan]], until the city fell on 27 October 1938. It retreated further inland to [[Chongqing]], which was the wartime capital until 1945. Although Chongqing was located in the inland western province of [[Sichuan]], it was nevertheless heavily bombed by Japanese warplanes many times during the course of the war.\n\nWith the end of the war, the National Government moved back to Nanjing. The Kuomintang then proceeded with the drafting of a new constitution for China, which were boycotted by the communists. The [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] was adopted by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] on 25 December 1946 and went into force a year later. The constitution was seen as the third and final step in Sun Yat-sen's \"Three Stages of Revolution\" - constitutional government. From then on, the government was known simply as the '''Government of the Republic of China''' ({{zh |t = \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u653f\u5e9c |s = \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c |p = Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3 Zh\u00e8ngf\u01d4 |first = t}}). Chiang Kai-shek was also [[1948 Republic of China presidential elections|elected]] as the [[List of Presidents of the Republic of China|1st President of the Republic of China]] under the constitution by the National Assembly in 1948, with [[Li Zongren]] being elected as Vice-President.\n\nHowever, in 1946, the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] with the communists led by [[Mao Zedong]] resumed despite mediation by the [[United States]]. Stretched and exhausted due to the long war with the Japanese, the Kuomintang-led government faced a disciplined and ever growing communist Red Army, which numbers grew in strength and was renamed as the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) in 1946. Although [[National Revolutionary Army|government forces]] were numerically superior and were equipped with modern weapons, they eventually lost due to low morale, defections, poor discipline as well as popular discontent with the ROC government due to skyrocketing inflation, corruption and administrative incompetence. The constitution was also superseded by the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]], which were a series of temporary constitutional provisions mainly to increase the powers of the President and suspended the two-term limit. The temporary provisions were passed by the National Assembly on 10 May 1948. Under intense pressure to take responsibility for the government's bleak outlook during the course of the civil war, Chiang resigned as President on 21 January 1949. The presidency was passed on to Vice-President Li Zongren, who was however unable to govern effectively due to Chiang pulling the strings behind government as Director-General of the Kuomintang.\n\nWith the fall of Nanjing to the PLA on April 1949, the ROC government moved south to [[Guangzhou]], and then to its wartime capital of Chongqing, and finally to [[Chengdu]]. Sensing that he would eventually lose the mainland to the communists, Chiang secretly started preparations to move the government to the island of Taiwan, which was placed under the ROC's control  on 25 October 1945. Taiwan was seen as a safe haven for Chiang due to it being separated from the mainland by the {{convert|180|km|abbr=on|disp=or}}-wide [[Taiwan Strait]]. During that period, more than two million civilians, military personnel and government officials left the mainland for Taiwan. Chiang then declared Taipei as the provisional capital of the Republic of China on 7 December 1949, and left Chengdu for Taipei by air three days later when the city fell to the communists.\n\n=== Since 1949 ===\n[[File:Presidential-Palace-(Taipei).png|thumb|Since 1950, the Presidential Office Building in Taipei has been home to the Office of the President of the Republic of China]]\n{{Main|Politics of the Republic of China}}\n\nBased on the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], the [[head of state]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|President]], who is elected by popular vote for a four-year term on the same ticket as the Vice-President. The President has authority over the five administrative branches (''Yuan''): the [[Control Yuan|Control]], [[Examination Yuan|Examination]], [[Executive Yuan|Executive]], [[Judicial Yuan|Judicial]], and [[Legislative Yuan]]s. The President appoints the members of the Executive Yuan as the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], including a [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], who is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible for policy and administration.\n\nOriginally, the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]] was elected in mainland China in 1947 to officially carry out the duties of choosing the president, to amend the constitution, and to exercise the sovereignty of the citizens, but in fact, the Assembly's role in Taipei seemed to reconfirm the executive powers of President Chiang Kai-shek. The National Assembly was re-established on Taiwan when the government moved. Because it was impossible to hold subsequent elections to represent constituencies in mainland China, representatives elected in 1947-48 held these seats \"indefinitely.\" In June 1990, however, the Council of Grand Justices mandated the retirement, effective December 1991, of all remaining \"indefinitely\" elected members of the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and other bodies. In 2005, the National Assembly permanently abolished itself by ratifying a constitution amendment passed by the Legislative Yuan.\n\nAmending the ROC constitution now requires the approval of three-fourths of the quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan. This quorum requires at least three-fourths of all members of the Legislature. After passing by the legislature, the amendment needs ratification in a [[referendum]] from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC regardless of voter turnout.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Government of the Republic of China}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-before|before=[[Nationalist government]] of<br>the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]|rows=3}}\n{{s-ttl |title = Government ruling [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]|years=1947&ndash;present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Government ruling [[mainland China]]|years=1947&ndash;1949}}\n{{s-after|after=[[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (1949\u201354)|Central People's Government of<br>the People's Republic of China]]<br>{{nobold|1949&ndash;1954}}}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Representative for [[China and the United Nations|China]] in the [[United Nations]]|years=1947&ndash;1971}}\n{{s-after|after=[[Government of China|Government of the<br>People's Republic of China]]<br>{{nobold|1971&ndash;present}}}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Government of|title=Governments of Asia}}\n{{Taiwan topics}}\n\n[[Category:Government of the Republic of China| ]]\n[[Category:Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the government of the Republic of China since 1948|the government of the People's Republic of China since 1949|Government of China|the government of the Republic of China from 1912 to 1928|Beiyang government|the government of the Republic of China from 1928 to 1948|Nationalist government}}\n{{other uses|Government of China (disambiguation)}}\n{{Short description|ROC government since 1948}}{{More citations needed|date=March 2009}}\n{{Infobox Chinese\n| title   = Government of the<br>Republic of China\n| t       = \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u653f\u5e9c \n| s       = \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\n| p       = Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3 Zh\u00e8ngf\u01d4\n| poj     = Tiong-h\u00f4a B\u00een-kok Ch\u00e8ng-h\u00fa\n| tl      = Tiong-hu\u00e2 B\u00een-kok Ts\u00ecng-h\u00fa\n| phfs    = Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0 M\u00ecn-koet Ch\u1e73n-f\u00fa\n| buc     = D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0 M\u00ecng-gu\u00f3k C\u00e9ng-h\u016b\n| altname = Government of Taiwan\n| t2      = \u81fa\u7063\u653f\u5e9c \n| s2      = \u53f0\u6e7e\u653f\u5e9c\n| p2      = T\u00e1iw\u0101n Zh\u00e8ngf\u01d4\n| poj2    = T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n Ch\u00e8ng-h\u00fa\n| tl2     = T\u00e2i-u\u00e2n Ts\u00ecng-h\u00fa\n| phfs2   = Th\u00f2i-v\u00e2n Ch\u1e73n-f\u00fa\n| buc2    = D\u00e0i-u\u0103ng C\u00e9ng-h\u016b\n}}\n{{Politics of Taiwan}}\n\nThe '''Government of the Republic of China''', commonly known as the '''Government of Taiwan''', is the democratic, constitutional government that exercises control over [[Taiwan]] and [[List of islands of Taiwan|other islands]] in the [[Free area of the Republic of China|free area]].

The President, however, shares limitations found in other semi-presidential systems, including the lack of a strong [[veto]] and no direct control of most administrative policy.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Category!!Name!![[Traditional Chinese character|Chinese]]!!Role\n|-\n|rowspan=4|'''Presidency'''\n|[[President of the Republic of China|President]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u7e3d\u7d71}}}}||[[Head of state]]\n|-\n|[[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u526f\u7e3d\u7d71}}}}||\n|-\n|[[Office of the President (Taiwan)|Office of the President]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u7e3d\u7d71\u5e9c}}}}|| rowspan=\"2\" |Advisory and administrative<br />agencies to the President\n|-\n|[[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u570b\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u6703\u8b70}}}}\n|-\n|rowspan=5|'''Five Yuans'''\n|[[Executive Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u884c\u653f\u9662}}}}||[[Executive (government)|Executive]], [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]\n|-\n|[[Legislative Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u7acb\u6cd5\u9662}}}}||[[Legislature]], [[Parliament]]\n|-\n|[[Judicial Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u53f8\u6cd5\u9662}}}}||[[Judiciary]], [[Constitutional court]]\n|-\n|[[Examination Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u8003\u8a66\u9662}}}}||[[Civil service commission]]\n|-\n|[[Control Yuan]]||align=center|{{large|{{lang|zh-tw|\u76e3\u5bdf\u9662}}}}||[[Government performance auditing|Auditory]]\n|}\n\n=== Presidency ===\n[[File:Taipei Taiwan Presidential-Office-Building-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Presidential Office Building]]]]\nThe leadership of the country consists of the two top officials that is directly and jointly elected by the [[Taiwanese people]].\n* [[President of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Vice President of the Republic of China]]\n\nUnder the President, two advisory and administrative agencies are established to supports the work of the President.\n* [[Office of the President (Taiwan)|Office of the President (Presidential Office)]]\n** [[Secretary-General to the President, Republic of China|Secretary-General of the Office of the President]]\n* [[National Security Council (Taiwan)|National Security Council]]\n** Secretary-General of the National Security Council\n\n=== Executive Yuan ===\n[[File:Executive Yuan 20050703.jpg|thumb|right|Executive Yuan]]\n{{Main|Executive Yuan}}\n\nThe Executive Yuan is in charge of the Premier. However, the ROC's political system does not fit traditional models. The Premier is selected by the President without the need for approval from the Legislature, but the Legislature can pass laws without regard for the President, as neither the President nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the President and the Legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. During the tenure of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian the continued control of the Legislative Yuan by the pan-Blue majority caused legislation to repeatedly stall, as the two sides were deadlocked. There is another curiosity of the ROC system; because the ROC was previously dominated by strongman one-party politics, real power in the system shifted from one position to another, depending on what position was currently occupied by the leader of the state (Chiang Kai-shek and later his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]). This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the President rather than the Premier.\n\n=== Legislative Yuan ===\n[[File:Legislative Yuan (0212).JPG|thumb|right|Legislative Yuan]]\n{{Main|Legislative Yuan}}\n\nThe main [[Legislature|legislative body]] is the [[unicameral]] Legislative Yuan with one hundred and thirteen seats. Seventy-three are elected in single member districts; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties, and six seats are reserved to represent aboriginal groups. Members serve four-year terms. Although sometimes referred to as a \"[[parliament]]\", the Legislative Yuan, under Sun's political theory, is a branch of government, while only the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]], which is now abolished, with the power to amend the constitution and formerly to elect the President and Vice President, could be considered a parliament.  However, after constitutional amendments effectively transferring almost all of the National Assembly's powers to the Legislative Yuan in the late 1990s, it has become more common for newspapers in Taiwan to refer to the Legislative Yuan as the nation's \"parliament\" (\u570b\u6703, ''gu\u00f3hu\u00ec'').\n\n=== Judicial Yuan ===\n[[File:Judicial Yuan Building 20060521.jpg|thumb|right|Judicial Yuan]]\n{{Main|Judicial Yuan}}\n\nThe Judicial Yuan is the ROC's highest [[judiciary]]. The President and Vice-President of the Judicial Yuan and fifteen Justices form the [[Council of Grand Justices]]. They are nominated and appointed by the President of the Republic, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]], consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each of which is formed by a presiding Judge and four Associate Judges, all appointed for life. In 1993, a separate [[constitutional court]] was established to resolve constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process. There is no [[trial by jury]] but the right to a [[fair trial|fair]] and [[public trial]] is protected by law and respected in practice; many cases are presided over by multiple judges.\n\n[[Capital punishment]] is legal. Efforts have been made by the government to reduce the number of executions, although they have not been able to completely abolish the punishment. As of 2006, about 80% of Taiwanese want to keep the death penalty.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/01/02/2003287050 |title = Nation keeps death penalty, but reduces executions |last = Chang |first = Rich |date = 2006-01-02 |publisher=Taipei Times |accessdate = 2009-11-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Examination Yuan ===\n[[File:Examination Yuan main gate 20110603.jpg|thumb|right|Examination Yuan]]\n{{Main|Examination Yuan}}\n\nThe Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants in the Republic of China. As a special branch of government under the [[Three Principles of the People]]. The concept of the Examination Yuan is based on the old [[Imperial examination]] system used in Imperial China.\n\n=== Control Yuan ===\n[[File:Control Yuan.JPG|thumb|right|Control Yuan]]\n{{Main|Control Yuan}}\n\nBased on the traditional Chinese [[censorate]], the Control Yuan is an investigatory agency that monitors the other branches of government. It may be compared to the [[Court of Auditors]] of the European Union, the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the United States, a political [[ombudsman]], or a standing [[Government agency|commission]] for administrative inquiry.\n\n== History ==\nThe Government of the Republic of China was formally established in 1912 in [[Nanking]], with [[Sun Yat-sen]] as President of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] under the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]]. This government moved to [[Beijing]] in the same year with [[Yuan Shikai]] as President, and continued under his successors as the internationally recognized government of [[China]] until 1928. In the [[history of the Republic of China|Republican period]], there were a series of governments, sometimes in rivalry with each other. The [[Nationalist Government|Nationalist government]], led by the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]], was originally formed as a rival military government under Sun Yat-sen in [[Guangzhou]] in 1917. After Sun's death in 1925, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] led the [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] (1926\u20131928) to unify the country and established the capital in Nanjing. This government gained diplomatic recognition but did not control all the territory of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The essentially one-party rule functioned under Sun's [[Three Principles of the People]], which provided for a transitional period of \"tutelage\", but drew more political parties, including the [[Communist Party of China]] into a [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937-1945). The Tutelage Constitution of 1931 was replaced by the  [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] in 1947.<ref>Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng (Qian Duansheng)''The Government and Politics of China, 1912-1949.'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1950).</ref>\n\n=== 1912\u20131928 ===\n{{Main|Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Beiyang Government}}\n<!--Please add new information to the relevant series of articles-->\n[[File:Nanjinglinshizhengfu.jpg|thumb|Cabinet meeting of the Nanjing Provisional Government led by Sun Yat-sen]]\n\nThe first Chinese national government was established on 1 January 1912, in Nanjing, with Sun Yat-sen as the provisional president. Provincial delegates were sent to confirm the authority of the national government, and they later also formed the first parliament. The power of this national government was limited and short-lived, with generals controlling both central and northern [[Provinces of the Republic of China|provinces of China]]. The limited acts passed by this government included the formal abdication of the Qing dynasty and some economic initiatives. The parliament's authority became nominal; violations of the Constitution by [[Yuan Shikai]], who became president in March 1912, were met with half-hearted motions of censure, and Kuomintang members of the parliament who gave up their membership in the KMT were offered 1,000 [[British pounds]]. Yuan maintained power locally by sending military generals to be provincial governors or by obtaining the allegiance of those already in power.\n\nWhen Yuan died, the parliament of 1913 was reconvened to give legitimacy to a new government.  However, the real power of the time passed to military leaders, forming the warlord period. The impotent government still had its use; when [[World War I]] began, several Western powers and Japan wanted China to declare war on [[German Empire|Germany]], in order to liquidate German holdings.\n\nThere were also several warlord governments and puppet states sharing the same name.

The first stage was military unification, which was carried out with the Northern Expedition. The second was \"political tutelage\" which was a provisional government led by the KMT to educate people about their political and civil rights, and the third stage was constitutional government. The KMT considered themselves to be at the second stage in 1928. Although the Nanjing decade was far more stable and progressive as compared to the Warlord period which preceded it, it was still marred with widespread violence, official corruption and the ongoing civil war with the [[Communist Party of China|communists]].\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the invading [[Imperial Japanese Army]] managed to capture Nanjing on 13 December 1937. The Japanese then proceeded to sack the city, and [[Nanjing Massacre|massacred]] hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians. With the fall of Nanjing, the government was forced to move first to [[Wuhan]], until the city fell on 27 October 1938. It retreated further inland to [[Chongqing]], which was the wartime capital until 1945. Although Chongqing was located in the inland western province of [[Sichuan]], it was nevertheless heavily bombed by Japanese warplanes many times during the course of the war.\n\nWith the end of the war, the National Government moved back to Nanjing. The Kuomintang then proceeded with the drafting of a new constitution for China, which were boycotted by the communists. The [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] was adopted by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] on 25 December 1946 and went into force a year later. The constitution was seen as the third and final step in Sun Yat-sen's \"Three Stages of Revolution\" - constitutional government. From then on, the government was known simply as the '''Government of the Republic of China''' ({{zh |t = \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u653f\u5e9c |s = \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c |p = Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3 Zh\u00e8ngf\u01d4 |first = t}}). Chiang Kai-shek was also [[1948 Republic of China presidential elections|elected]] as the [[List of Presidents of the Republic of China|1st President of the Republic of China]] under the constitution by the National Assembly in 1948, with [[Li Zongren]] being elected as Vice-President.\n\nHowever, in 1946, the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] with the communists led by [[Mao Zedong]] resumed despite mediation by the [[United States]]. Stretched and exhausted due to the long war with the Japanese, the Kuomintang-led government faced a disciplined and ever growing communist Red Army, which numbers grew in strength and was renamed as the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) in 1946. Although [[National Revolutionary Army|government forces]] were numerically superior and were equipped with modern weapons, they eventually lost due to low morale, defections, poor discipline as well as popular discontent with the ROC government due to skyrocketing inflation, corruption and administrative incompetence. The constitution was also superseded by the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]], which were a series of temporary constitutional provisions mainly to increase the powers of the President and suspended the two-term limit. The temporary provisions were passed by the National Assembly on 10 May 1948. Under intense pressure to take responsibility for the government's bleak outlook during the course of the civil war, Chiang resigned as President on 21 January 1949. The presidency was passed on to Vice-President Li Zongren, who was however unable to govern effectively due to Chiang pulling the strings behind government as Director-General of the Kuomintang.\n\nWith the fall of Nanjing to the PLA on April 1949, the ROC government moved south to [[Guangzhou]], and then to its wartime capital of Chongqing, and finally to [[Chengdu]]. Sensing that he would eventually lose the mainland to the communists, Chiang secretly started preparations to move the government to the island of Taiwan, which was placed under the ROC's control  on 25 October 1945. Taiwan was seen as a safe haven for Chiang due to it being separated from the mainland by the {{convert|180|km|abbr=on|disp=or}}-wide [[Taiwan Strait]]. During that period, more than two million civilians, military personnel and government officials left the mainland for Taiwan. Chiang then declared Taipei as the provisional capital of the Republic of China on 7 December 1949, and left Chengdu for Taipei by air three days later when the city fell to the communists.\n\n=== Since 1949 ===\n[[File:Presidential-Palace-(Taipei).png|thumb|Since 1950, the Presidential Office Building in Taipei has been home to the Office of the President of the Republic of China]]\n{{Main|Politics of the Republic of China}}\n\nBased on the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], the [[head of state]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|President]], who is elected by popular vote for a four-year term on the same ticket as the Vice-President. The President has authority over the five administrative branches (''Yuan''): the [[Control Yuan|Control]], [[Examination Yuan|Examination]], [[Executive Yuan|Executive]], [[Judicial Yuan|Judicial]], and [[Legislative Yuan]]s. The President appoints the members of the Executive Yuan as the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], including a [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], who is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible for policy and administration.\n\nOriginally, the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]] was elected in mainland China in 1947 to officially carry out the duties of choosing the president, to amend the constitution, and to exercise the sovereignty of the citizens, but in fact, the Assembly's role in Taipei seemed to reconfirm the executive powers of President Chiang Kai-shek. The National Assembly was re-established on Taiwan when the government moved. Because it was impossible to hold subsequent elections to represent constituencies in mainland China, representatives elected in 1947-48 held these seats \"indefinitely.\" In June 1990, however, the Council of Grand Justices mandated the retirement, effective December 1991, of all remaining \"indefinitely\" elected members of the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and other bodies. In 2005, the National Assembly permanently abolished itself by ratifying a constitution amendment passed by the Legislative Yuan.\n\nAmending the ROC constitution now requires the approval of three-fourths of the quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan. This quorum requires at least three-fourths of all members of the Legislature. After passing by the legislature, the amendment needs ratification in a [[referendum]] from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC regardless of voter turnout.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Government of the Republic of China}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-before|before=[[Nationalist government]] of<br>the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]|rows=3}}\n{{s-ttl |title = Government ruling [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]|years=1947&ndash;present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Government ruling [[mainland China]]|years=1947&ndash;1949}}\n{{s-after|after=[[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (1949\u201354)|Central People's Government of<br>the People's Republic of China]]<br>{{nobold|1949&ndash;1954}}}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Representative for [[China and the United Nations|China]] in the [[United Nations]]|years=1947&ndash;1971}}\n{{s-after|after=[[Government of China|Government of the<br>People's Republic of China]]<br>{{nobold|1971&ndash;present}}}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Government of|title=Governments of Asia}}\n{{Taiwan topics}}\n\n[[Category:Government of the Republic of China| ]]\n[[Category:Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]]\n", "name_user": "ChromeGames923", "label": "safe", "comment": "Ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Republic_of_China"}

Curry was critical of \"groupthink\", and was engaging actively with the climate change denial community, because she believes that some of them brought up valid points, and that lumping the good with the bad could lead to missed opportunities to improve the science. \n\nCurry is critical of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), a United Nations\u2013sponsored body who reports the consensus on climate science.

Curry was critical of \"groupthink\", and was engaging actively with the climate change denial community, because she believes that some of them brought up valid points, and that lumping the good with the bad could lead to missed opportunities to improve the science. \n\nCurry is critical of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), a United Nations\u2013sponsored body who reports the consensus on climate science. She does not have confidence in their process.<ref name=\"Lemonick\"/>\n\nCurry also asserts that other scientists have not adequately dealt with the uncertainty in their work. IPCC estimates have a reported uncertainty of a few percent for the [[radiative forcing]] of {{CO2}}, and the consensus of other climate scientists who have discussed the matter is that this is not enough to significantly impact the projections.\n<ref name=\"Lemonick\"/>\n\nBetween 2014 and February 2019, Curry testified before at least six Republican-led House committees, expressing the idea that the dangers of global warming are overstated and difficult to predict. These testimonies include statements criticizing President Obama's climate plan, the UN climate action plan, and other policy proposals aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In her testimony before the Natural Resources Committee on February 6, 2019, Curry stated that, \"Man-made climate change is not an existential threat in the 21st century....

He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools.

constituency)|Blackburn]] from [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]] to [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. He held two of the traditional [[Great Offices of State]], as [[Home Secretary]] from 1997 to 2001 and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. \n\nFrom 2007 to 2010 he served as [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]] and the [[Secretary of State for Justice]] throughout the [[Brown ministry]]. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously during the Labour governments from 1997 to 2010, the others being Brown and [[Alistair Darling]].\n\nAfter the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost power in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|May 2010]], Straw briefly served as [[Deputy Prime Minister|Shadow Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Shadow Justice Secretary]], with the intention to stand down from the frontbench after the subsequent [[Shadow Cabinet|2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election]].\n\n==Early life==\nJack Straw was born in [[Buckhurst Hill]] in Essex, the son of (Walter) Arthur Whitaker Straw, an insurance clerk and salesman and former industrial chemist born at [[Worsbrough]] near [[Barnsley]], and raised at [[Woodford Green]], and Joan Sylvia Gilbey, a teacher at the independent [[Loughton#Independent_schools|Oaklands School]], daughter of a [[Loughton]] bus mechanic and [[shop steward]], and distantly related to the [[Walter Gilbey|gin-making family]].<ref name = who>Who's Who 2008, A & C Black, 2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007</ref><ref name=\"books.google.com\">''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7szDhMKFRxcC&pg=PT26 Last Man Standing: Memoirs of a Political Survivor]'', Jack Straw, 2012</ref><ref>General Register Office Birth Index 1946 Q3 Epping 5a 178</ref> After his father (with whom, by the time of his death, Straw and his siblings were reconciled) left the family, Straw was brought up by his mother on a [[council housing|council estate]] in [[Loughton]].<ref name=observer-20120930>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/30/jack-straw-memoirs-interview |title=Jack Straw: 'I didn't have a nervous breakdown, but I was close to one' |author=Rachel Cooke |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |date=30 September 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2013 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024151314/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/30/jack-straw-memoirs-interview |archive-date=24 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]], one of the leaders of the [[Peasants' Revolt of 1381]].<ref name=guardian-profile/> Straw is of 1/8th Jewish descent (his maternal grandfather's mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family).

He is a member of [[Inner Temple|The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple]] and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the [[Inner London Education Authority]], and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to [[Barbara Castle]] at the [[Department of Social Security]] from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to [[Peter Shore]] at the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department for the Environment]] from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the [[Granada TV]] series, ''[[World in Action]]''.\n\nStraw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative [[Tonbridge and Malling (UK Parliament constituency)|Tonbridge and Malling]] constituency in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 election]]. He was later selected to stand for Labour in its safe [[Blackburn]] seat at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 General Election]].\n\n==Member of Parliament from 1979 to 2015==\nStraw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of [[Blackburn]] in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there.

In this role, he called on [[local education authority|local education authorities]] to give private Muslim and [[Orthodox Jewish]] schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nStraw briefly served as [[Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment]]  under [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When [[Tony Blair]] became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as [[Shadow Home Secretary]]. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \"soft on crime\" and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Home Secretary [[Michael Howard]]. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\" and calling for a curfew on children.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/straw-sets-agenda-for-reclaiming-the-streets-1599506.html | work=The Independent | title=Straw sets agenda for reclaiming the streets | date=5 September 1995 | accessdate=17 June 2012 | location=London | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305014939/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/straw-sets-agenda-for-reclaiming-the-streets-1599506.html | archive-date=5 March 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Home Secretary (1997\u20132001)===\nAppointed as [[Home Secretary]] after the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], he brought forward the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]], increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/527721.stm | work=BBC News | title=Straw on trial over jury reform | date=19 November 1999 | accessdate=5 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505153424/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/527721.stm | archive-date=5 May 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref> These policies won praise from [[Margaret Thatcher]] who once declared \"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement.

Directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], the film is a dramatization of the story of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] from his birth and ministry to his [[crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], with much [[dramatic license]].\n\nIn November 1958, the idea for ''King of Kings'' began as a proposed film project based on the life of Jesus between [[Samuel Bronston]] and [[John Farrow]] following their collaboration on ''[[John Paul Jones (film)|John Paul Jones]]'' (1959). However, by the next year, Farrow left the project due to creative differences, and Nicholas Ray was shortly after hired as director. Ray then hired screenwriter [[Philip Yordan]] to write a new script. Prominent actors were considered to portray multiple roles. Filming commenced in April 1960, and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in October 1960. Financing of the film was initially provided by [[du Pont family|Pierre S. du Pont III]], but Bronston appealed for more funding from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who was interested in the film following their success with ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959). With MGM involved, mandatory rewrites and additional scenes were added to the film. Reshoots were shot in December 1960 and again in May 1961. \n\nThe film premiered at [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on October 11, 1961. It received mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. \n\n==Plot==\nIn 63 BC, [[Pompey]] conquered [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|city was sacked]]. He entered [[Temple in Jerusalem|the Temple]] to seize the treasure of [[Solomon]] and massacred the priests there. He discovered that the treasure is only a collection of scrolls of the [[Torah]]. These Pompey held over a fire until an old priest reached for them imploringly. Pompey relented and handed them to the old man and left to carry out massacres of enemy villages and towns.\n\nMany years later, a series of rebellions break out against the authority of Rome, so the Romans [[Crucifixion|crucify]] many of the leaders and place [[Herod the Great]] on [[Judea]]'s throne.\n\nA carpenter named [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and his wife [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], who is about to give birth, arrive in [[Bethlehem]] for the [[census]]. Not having found accommodation for the night, they take refuge in a stable, where the child, Jesus, is born. The shepherds, who have followed [[Biblical Magi|the Magi]] from the East, gather to worship him. However, Herod, informed of the birth of a child-king, orders the centurion Lucius to take his men to Bethlehem and kill all the newborn male children.\n\nMary and Joseph flee to [[Egypt]] with the child. The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] occurs, Herod dies, killed in his death throes by his son [[Herod Antipas]], who then takes power. In [[Nazareth]], Jesus, who is now twelve years old, is working with Joseph when soldiers arrive under the command of Lucius, who realizes that Jesus escaped the [[Massacre of the Innocents|massacre of the infants]]. But Lucius does nothing and only asks that Mary and Joseph register their son's birth before the year's end.\n\nYears pass and Jewish rebels led by [[Barabbas]] and [[Judas Iscariot]] prepare to attack a caravan carrying the next [[List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers#The Administration of Judaea .28AD 6.E2.80.93135.29|governor of Judea]], [[Pontius Pilate]] and his wife [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Claudia]]. The ambush fails, partly due to the diligence of Lucius, and Barabbas and Judas flee for their lives.\n\nPilate and Herod Antipas meet on the banks of the [[River Jordan]], where [[John the Baptist]] preaches to the crowds. Jesus arrives here, now 30 years of age. He is [[baptism|baptized]] by John, who recognizes that he is the [[Messiah]]. Jesus goes into the desert, where he is [[temptations of Christ|tempted]] by [[Satan]]. After forty days, Jesus travels to [[Galilee]], where he recruits his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]s.\n\nIn [[Jerusalem]], Herod Antipas arrests John the Baptist, who is visited by Jesus in prison. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] leaves the rebel [[Barabbas]] and joins the Apostles. Jesus begins to preach and gather crowds, among which are Claudia, Pilate's wife, and Lucius. Herod reluctantly beheads John on a whim of his stepdaughter, [[Salome]], who despises him.\n\nHerod, Pilate and the High Priest [[Caiaphas]] are terrorized by the works and miracles of Jesus. Barabbas plots a revolt in Jerusalem during [[Passover]], during which time Jesus enters the holy city in triumph and goes to the Temple to preach. The rebels storm the [[Antonia Fortress]], but the [[Roman legion|legions]] of Pilate, having learned of the plot, ambush and crush the revolt, massacring the rebels. Barabbas ends up arrested.\n\nJesus meets the disciples on the evening of Thursday, having [[Last Supper|supper]] one last time with them and afterwards goes to pray at [[Gethsemane]]. In the meantime, Judas wants Jesus to free [[Judea]] from the Romans, and, to force his hand, Judas delivers him to the Jewish authorities. Jesus is brought before [[Caiaphas]] and then brought before   Pilate. Pilate starts the trial, but sensing that the issue is one of Jewish sensibilities, sends him to Herod Antipas, who, in turn, sends him back.\n\nPilate is infuriated by Antipas' returning of Jesus and commands his soldiers to scourge Jesus. The people demand the release of [[Barabbas]], and Pilate bows to their pressure and sentences Jesus to be [[crucifixion|crucified]]. Jesus, wearing a [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]] on his head, carries his cross to [[Golgotha]] where he is crucified with two thieves, one of them being the [[penitent thief]] [[Dismas]].\n\nDesperate because he has betrayed Jesus to his death, Judas hangs himself and his body is found by Barabbas. Jesus dies in front of his mother, the apostle [[John the Apostle|John]], a few soldiers, Claudia (Pilate's wife), and Lucius (who utters the fateful words: \"He is truly the Christ\"). His body is taken down from the cross and is carried to a rock tomb. Two days later, [[Mary Magdalene]] finds the tomb empty, and encounters the Risen Jesus.\n\nThe film ends on the shores of [[Lake Tiberias]] when Jesus appears to the Apostles for \"a final time\" according to the narration, and tells them to bring his message to the ends of the world. Only his shadow is visible, forming the shape of a cross where it falls on the stretched-out fishing nets. The apostles then leave, and, as the shadow of Jesus falls across the screen, it could be assumed that he is ascending to [[Heaven]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Siobh\u00e1n McKenna]] as  [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]\n* [[Robert Ryan]]  as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Ron Randell]] as Lucius\n* [[Hurd Hatfield]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Viveca Lindfors]] as Claudia\n* [[Rita Gam]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Frank Thring]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Royal Dano]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n* [[Rip Torn]]  as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Harry Guardino]] as [[Barabbas]]\n* [[Carmen Sevilla]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Brigid Bazlen]] as [[Salome|Salom\u00e9]]\n* [[Guy Rolfe]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Gr\u00e9goire Aslan]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Tichy]] as [[Joseph]]\n* [[Luis Prendes]] as the [[Penitent thief]]\n* Barry Keegan as [[Gestas]], the [[Impenitent thief]]\n* [[Orson Welles]] (uncredited) as the [[Narrator]]\n* [[Ray Milland]] (uncredited) as [[Satan]] (voice) \n{{div col end}}\nWith the death of Rip Torn on July 9, 2019, [[Carmen Sevilla]] is the last surviving primary cast member.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn November 1958, it was reported that [[Samuel Bronston]] and [[John Farrow]] were collaborating on a film project based on the life of Jesus, with Farrow's script being titled ''Son of Man''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pryor|first=Thomas M.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/11/04/archives/film-to-be-made-on-life-of-christ-son-of-man-is-planned-by-farrow.html|title=Film To Be Made on Life of Christ|newspaper=The New York Times|page=30|date=November 4, 1958|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/details/variety212-1958-11/page/n93/mode/2up/|title=New York Sound Track|magazine=Variety|page=6|date=November 12, 1958|accessdate=March 3, 2020|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> In May 1959, it was reported that [[Sonya Levien]] was hired to do a script polish.<ref>{{cite news|title=Of Local Origins|newspaper=The New York Times|page=24|date=May 15, 1959}}</ref> However, by October 1959, Farrow had left the project over creative differences.

Ray also explained, \"I asked for him and made concessions to have him. They had asked me to write it. I didn't feel up to the responsibility; I am as impatient with the other writer on my own screenplay as with others.\"<ref>Scheuer, Philip K (December 21, 1960). \"[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/381206640/ Ray Tells Directing of 'King of Kings']\".

Terrible title, and someone had taken chapters of the Bible and sort of tried to make it play.\" He then recommended re-titling the script to ''King of Kings''.{{sfn|Eisenschitz|1993|p=362}} Yordan wrote a new script in six weeks which Bronston liked so much that he encouraged him to stay in Madrid, in which Yordan later went to co-write the script for ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961). Throughout the writing process, Yordan felt he did not find writing the movie to be difficult, in which he argued that \"Christ was a loner. He's not much different than my usual character.

Directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], the film is a dramatization of the story of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] from his birth and ministry to his [[crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], with much [[dramatic license]].\n\nIn November 1958, the idea for ''King of Kings'' began as a proposed film project based on the life of Jesus between [[Samuel Bronston]] and [[John Farrow]] following their collaboration on ''[[John Paul Jones (film)|John Paul Jones]]'' (1959). However, by the next year, Farrow left the project due to creative differences, and Nicholas Ray was shortly after hired as director. Ray then hired screenwriter [[Philip Yordan]] to write a new script. Prominent actors were considered to portray multiple roles. Filming commenced in April 1960, and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in October 1960. Financing of the film was initially provided by [[du Pont family|Pierre S. du Pont III]], but Bronston appealed for more funding from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who was interested in the film following their success with ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959). With MGM involved, mandatory rewrites and additional scenes were added to the film. Reshoots were shot in December 1960 and again in May 1961. \n\nThe film premiered at [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on October 11, 1961. It received mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. \n\n==Plot==\nIn 63 BC, [[Pompey]] conquered [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|city was sacked]]. He entered [[Temple in Jerusalem|the Temple]] to seize the treasure of [[Solomon]] and massacred the priests there. He discovered that the treasure is only a collection of scrolls of the [[Torah]]. These Pompey held over a fire until an old priest reached for them imploringly. Pompey relented and handed them to the old man and left to carry out massacres of enemy villages and towns.\n\nMany years later, a series of rebellions break out against the authority of Rome, so the Romans [[Crucifixion|crucify]] many of the leaders and place [[Herod the Great]] on [[Judea]]'s throne.\n\nA carpenter named [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and his wife [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], who is about to give birth, arrive in [[Bethlehem]] for the [[census]]. Not having found accommodation for the night, they take refuge in a stable, where the child, Jesus, is born. The shepherds, who have followed [[Biblical Magi|the Magi]] from the East, gather to worship him. However, Herod, informed of the birth of a child-king, orders the centurion Lucius to take his men to Bethlehem and kill all the newborn male children.\n\nMary and Joseph flee to [[Egypt]] with the child. The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] occurs, Herod dies, killed in his death throes by his son [[Herod Antipas]], who then takes power. In [[Nazareth]], Jesus, who is now twelve years old, is working with Joseph when soldiers arrive under the command of Lucius, who realizes that Jesus escaped the [[Massacre of the Innocents|massacre of the infants]]. But Lucius does nothing and only asks that Mary and Joseph register their son's birth before the year's end.\n\nYears pass and Jewish rebels led by [[Barabbas]] and [[Judas Iscariot]] prepare to attack a caravan carrying the next [[List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers#The Administration of Judaea .28AD 6.E2.80.93135.29|governor of Judea]], [[Pontius Pilate]] and his wife [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Claudia]]. The ambush fails, partly due to the diligence of Lucius, and Barabbas and Judas flee for their lives.\n\nPilate and Herod Antipas meet on the banks of the [[River Jordan]], where [[John the Baptist]] preaches to the crowds. Jesus arrives here, now 30 years of age. He is [[baptism|baptized]] by John, who recognizes that he is the [[Messiah]]. Jesus goes into the desert, where he is [[temptations of Christ|tempted]] by [[Satan]]. After forty days, Jesus travels to [[Galilee]], where he recruits his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]s.\n\nIn [[Jerusalem]], Herod Antipas arrests John the Baptist, who is visited by Jesus in prison. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] leaves the rebel [[Barabbas]] and joins the Apostles. Jesus begins to preach and gather crowds, among which are Claudia, Pilate's wife, and Lucius. Herod reluctantly beheads John on a whim of his stepdaughter, [[Salome]], who despises him.\n\nHerod, Pilate and the High Priest [[Caiaphas]] are terrorized by the works and miracles of Jesus. Barabbas plots a revolt in Jerusalem during [[Passover]], during which time Jesus enters the holy city in triumph and goes to the Temple to preach. The rebels storm the [[Antonia Fortress]], but the [[Roman legion|legions]] of Pilate, having learned of the plot, ambush and crush the revolt, massacring the rebels. Barabbas ends up arrested.\n\nJesus meets the disciples on the evening of Thursday, having [[Last Supper|supper]] one last time with them and afterwards goes to pray at [[Gethsemane]]. In the meantime, Judas wants Jesus to free [[Judea]] from the Romans, and, to force his hand, Judas delivers him to the Jewish authorities. Jesus is brought before [[Caiaphas]] and then brought before   Pilate. Pilate starts the trial, but sensing that the issue is one of Jewish sensibilities, sends him to Herod Antipas, who, in turn, sends him back.\n\nPilate is infuriated by Antipas' returning of Jesus and commands his soldiers to scourge Jesus. The people demand the release of [[Barabbas]], and Pilate bows to their pressure and sentences Jesus to be [[crucifixion|crucified]]. Jesus, wearing a [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]] on his head, carries his cross to [[Golgotha]] where he is crucified with two thieves, one of them being the [[penitent thief]] [[Dismas]].\n\nDesperate because he has betrayed Jesus to his death, Judas hangs himself and his body is found by Barabbas. Jesus dies in front of his mother, the apostle [[John the Apostle|John]], a few soldiers, Claudia (Pilate's wife), and Lucius (who utters the fateful words: \"He is truly the Christ\"). His body is taken down from the cross and is carried to a rock tomb. Two days later, [[Mary Magdalene]] finds the tomb empty, and encounters the Risen Jesus.\n\nThe film ends on the shores of [[Lake Tiberias]] when Jesus appears to the Apostles for \"a final time\" according to the narration, and tells them to bring his message to the ends of the world. Only his shadow is visible, forming the shape of a cross where it falls on the stretched-out fishing nets. The apostles then leave, and, as the shadow of Jesus falls across the screen, it could be assumed that he is ascending to [[Heaven]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Siobh\u00e1n McKenna]] as  [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]\n* [[Robert Ryan]]  as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Ron Randell]] as Lucius\n* [[Hurd Hatfield]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Viveca Lindfors]] as Claudia\n* [[Rita Gam]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Frank Thring]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Royal Dano]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n* [[Rip Torn]]  as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Harry Guardino]] as [[Barabbas]]\n* [[Carmen Sevilla]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Brigid Bazlen]] as [[Salome|Salom\u00e9]]\n* [[Guy Rolfe]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Gr\u00e9goire Aslan]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Tichy]] as [[Joseph]]\n* [[Luis Prendes]] as the [[Penitent thief]]\n* Barry Keegan as [[Gestas]], the [[Impenitent thief]]\n* [[Orson Welles]] (uncredited) as the [[Narrator]]\n* [[Ray Milland]] (uncredited) as [[Satan]] (voice) \n{{div col end}}\nWith the death of Rip Torn on July 9, 2019, [[Carmen Sevilla]] is the last surviving primary cast member.\n\n==Development==\nIn November 1958, it was reported that [[Samuel Bronston]] and [[John Farrow]] were collaborating on a film project based on the life of Jesus, with Farrow's script being titled ''Son of Man''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pryor|first=Thomas M.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/11/04/archives/film-to-be-made-on-life-of-christ-son-of-man-is-planned-by-farrow.html|title=Film To Be Made on Life of Christ|newspaper=The New York Times|page=30|date=November 4, 1958|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/details/variety212-1958-11/page/n93/mode/2up/|title=New York Sound Track|magazine=Variety|page=6|date=November 12, 1958|accessdate=March 3, 2020|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> In May 1959, it was reported that [[Sonya Levien]] was hired to do a script polish.<ref>{{cite news|title=Of Local Origins|newspaper=The New York Times|page=24|date=May 15, 1959}}</ref> However, by October 1959, Farrow had left the project over creative differences.

Ray also explained, \"I asked for him and made concessions to have him. They had asked me to write it.

Throughout the writing process, Yordan felt he did not find writing the movie to be difficult, in which he argued that \"Christ was a loner. He's not much different than my usual character.

competition consists of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of a single round within a six-minute limit. The wrestler who scores more points is the winner.\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[Time in Brazil|Bras\u00edlia Standard Time]] ([[UTC\u221203:00]])</small>\n{|class = \"wikitable\"
