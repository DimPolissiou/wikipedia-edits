Trained in classical Western theater, Saddiki also embraced traditional Moroccan theatrical styles, fusing the two into a path-breaking combination of Western and traditional Moroccan theater. Known for staging spectacles played to large crowds in big arenas, Saddiki developed a style of festive theater that became a popular in the arab world.\nHe is a pioneer of Arab theater and an actor and a film director, but also an award winning author writing in both Arabic and French.<ref>Ghassan Maleh, Don Rubin, ''The Arab World'', ed.

iconic and prominent arab artists, and he is considered among the foremost arab dramatists of the twentieth century. Trained in classical Western theater, Saddiki also embraced traditional Moroccan theatrical styles, fusing the two into a path-breaking combination of Western and traditional Moroccan theater. Known for staging spectacles played to large crowds in big arenas, Saddiki developed a style of festive theater that became a popular in the arab world.\nHe is a pioneer of Arab theater and an actor and a film director, but also an award winning author writing in both Arabic and French.<ref>Ghassan Maleh, Don Rubin, ''The Arab World'', ed. Taylor & Francis, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-415-05932-9}} , p. 172</ref> From a family of scholars, he was born in [[Essaouira]] and grew up in [[Casablanca]]. After training courses with [[Andr\u00e9 Voisin]], at the age of 17 he went abroad to France to study theater at Com\u00e9die de l'Ouest - CDO, directed by Hubert Gignoux. Back in [[Morocco]], together with the Union Marocaine du Travail (UMT) he founded a Workers' theater / Al Masrah Al Oummali (1957). After that, he returned to France to further study theater tecnics at the TNP -the National Popular Theater in Paris-, under the direction of [[Jean Vilar]].\nAt 23 he became artistic director of the Mohamed V theater (th\u00e9\u00e2tre national Mohammed-V). After that he worked as director of the municipal theater of Casablanca (th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Casablanca) from 1964 to 1977.<ref>http://arabstages.org/2016/04/tayeb-saddiki-and-the-re-invention-of-tradition-in-contemporary-moroccan-theatre-an-obituary/</ref> \nHe founded several theatre companies, Firqat Saddiki / Saddiki's troup, Al Masrah Al Jawal / Traveling theater, Masrah Ennas / People's Theater and also his own cultural center at [[Casablanca]], Espace Tayeb Saddiki (Tayeb Saddiki's center) at the boulevard Gandhi in [[Casablanca]].\n(Source : [[Tayeb Saddiki Foundation]])\n\n==Biography<ref>https://www.tayebsaddiki.com/</ref>==\n* 1953 - Stage of Dramatic Art at Ma\u00e2mora (Morocco), Interpretation Award / Direction [[Andr\u00e9 Voisin]] and Charles Nugue\n* 1954 - First contract with Moroccan theater troupe / la troupe du th\u00e9\u00e2tre marocain, the first professional troupe in Morocco\n* 1956 - Workshop at Centre Dramatique de l\u2019Ouest \u2013 C.D.O, [[Rennes]] - Direction Hubert Gignoux\n* 1957 - Works at the National Popular Theater ([[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire]]) - T.N.P in Paris, Direction [[Jean Vilar]]\n* 1957-1958 - Founder of the Workers' theater (Al Masrah Al Oummali), Morocco\n* 1959 - Training course at the Center Dramatique de l'Est - D.E, Direction Hubert Gignoux\n* 1960 - Study Tour [[Berliner Ensemble]] - Germany, Direction H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Weigel - [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s theatre company\n* 1960 - Founder of The troupe of the Municipal Theater / (La troupe du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal), [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]\n* 1963 - Founder of Firqat Saddiki / Saddiki's troup, Morocco\n* 1964 - Artistic director of the Mohamed V theater (th\u00e9\u00e2tre national Mohammed-V), [[Rabat]]\n* 1967-1969 - Member of the executive committee of Institut International du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, I.T.I \u2013 [[UNESCO]]\n* 1964-1977 - Director of the municipal theater of Casablanca (th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Casablanca), [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]\n* 1970-1977 - Founder of [[Caf\u00e9-th\u00e9\u00e2tre]], Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal de Casablanca, [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]\n* 1970 - Founder of Masrah Ennas / [[People's Theater (Morocco)|People's Theater]], [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]\n* 1974 - Founder of Al Masrah Al Jawal / Traveling theater, [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]\n* 1980 - Founder of Essaouira Festival Music first / la musique d'abord\n* 1980 - 1982 - Responsible at the Ministry of Tourism, [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]\n* 1984-1986 - Television is moving (Attalfaza Tataharrak), S.N.R.T, program to revamp Moroccan television programs, [[Morocco]]\n* 1997 - Founder of the Espace Tayeb Saddiki (Mogador Theater), [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]\n\n<gallery>\nSM Mohamed 6 & TS (2004).jpg|Tayeb Saddiki awarded by His Majesty the king [[Mohammed VI]]- 2005\n</gallery>\n\n==Distinctions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

As with the title, the album heralds the end of the 'Nightmare' concept. This overarching theme the group has been promoting in their past title songs since their debut single 'Chase Me' has finally ended and culminated in their new single - 'PIRI', a song showcasing Dreamcatcher's signature rock acoustics and incorporation of music from its [[Piri|namesake musical instrument]]. On the same day, Dreamcatcher's agency, HappyFace Entertainment, also announced that they will henceforth be renamed as DreamCatcher Company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=108&aid=0002761004|title=\ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0 \uc9c0\uc720 \"\uc18c\uc18d\uc0ac \uc774\ub984, \ud574\ud53c\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\u2192\ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0 \ucef4\ud37c\ub2c8\ub85c \ubcc0\uacbd\"|website=entertain.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter promotions of the new song 'PIRI', Dreamcatcher went on their Asia Tour 'Invitation from Nightmare City', which was announced to be held in several cities - Jakarta, Manila, Singapore, Seoul itself, as well as Japanese cities Tokyo and Kobe - from March to May 2019. However, due to undisclosed reasons, the concert stop in Jakarta was later canceled - instead, Dreamcatcher only stopped by in the city for a short fan-meeting.\n\nSubsequently, in July, 3 more stops were announced as part of the 'Invitation From Nightmare City' tour - Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney, together with Kuala Lumpur city in Malaysia. Concerts at these 3 locations took place from late August to early September. Unfortunately, due to a fire occurring at 170 Russell theater on August 31, Dreamcatcher was forced to cancel their Melbourne stop one day before the concert was to be held.\n\nOn August 31, Dreamcatcher announced the official 1st generation membership for their fanclub 'INSOMNIA', which will confer fans various benefits and limited edition goods. Both Korean and Japanese fanclub applications started on September 2, and lasted for a month.\n\nOn September 2, a series of pictures titled 'Mystery Code #01' were posted onto Instagram, possibly teasing a new release. The next day, a new 'Mystery Code #02' was posted onto their Instagram, containing 2 photos and a video.

Originally, the gang was set up to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other gangs in the Los Angeles area. Over time, the gang grew into a more traditional criminal organization. MS-13 is defined by its cruelty, and its rivalry with the [[18th Street Gang]].\n\nMany MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992, or upon being arrested, facilitating the spread of the gang to Central America. The gang is currently active in many parts of the continental United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Most members are [[Central America]]n, Salvadorans in particular.\n\nAs an international gang, its history is closely tied to [[United States\u2013El Salvador relations]]. In 2018, the gang's US membership of up to 10,000 accounted for less than 1% of the 1.4 million gang members in the United States, and a similar share of gang murders. The gang is often referenced by the United States' [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to advocate for [[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigrant policies]].\n\n== Description ==\n=== Etymology ===\nThere is some dispute about the etymology of the name. Some sources state the gang is named for La Mara, a street in [[San Salvador]], and the Salvatrucha guerrillas who fought in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/APFN/MS-13.HTM|title=America's Most Dangerous Gang|author=Domash, Shelly Feuer|publisher=apfn.org}}</ref> Additionally, the word ''mara'' means gang in [[Central American Spanish|Caliche slang]] and is taken from ''[[Army ant|marabunta]]'', the name of a fierce type of ant. \"Salvatrucha\" may be a combination of the words ''Salvadoran'' and ''trucha'', a Caliche word for being alert. The term \"Salvatruchas\" has been explained as a reference to Salvadorian peasants trained to become guerrilla fighters, referred to as the \"[[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|title=MS-13: Gangs infiltrating the suburbs of Washington, DC|website=dcspotlight.com|publisher=DC Spotlight Newspaper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614063408/https://dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_MS13.jpg|thumb|An MS [[Gang signal|gang sign]] and tattoos]]\nCentral Americans are the primary targets of violence and threats of violence by MS-13.<ref name=\"Rose\" /> Many of the victims are minors.<ref name=\"Demick\" /> Minors also make up the majority of suspects arrested for killings attributed to MS-13.

As such, Salvadorans began to immigrate without documents in increasing numbers. They mostly settled in cities with large undocumented populations, like Los Angeles. Salvadoran asylum claims were neglected until the 1991 case [[American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) Settlement Agreement|American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh]]. The case's settlement agreement required Guatemalan and Salvadoran asylum claims to be reevaluated, as long as they had entered the U.S. by 1990. By this point, the Civil War was already drawing to a close after more than a decade of fighting. Before ABC v. Thornburg and even after, Salvadoran immigrants were left highly vulnerable to exploitation. In the very beginning, MS-13 was a group of young, delinquent, heavy metal fans who lived in Los Angeles. However, the undocumented community in Los Angeles was subject to severe racial prejudices and persecution. Under these conditions, MS-13 began to mutate into a gang. Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from the other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans, Asians, and African-Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/06/28/in-nva-gang-a-brutal-sense-of-belonging/3d85a511-9afb-4780-9368-12437e807394/|title=In N.Va.

Deras was a former member of Salvadoran special forces, [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|trained in Panama by United States Green Berets]]. On gaining leadership of an MS-13 clique in 1990, he used his military training to discipline the gang and improve its logistical operations. It was after this point that the gang began to grow in power. MS-13's rivalry with the [[18th Street gang|18th Street Gang]] also began in this period. MS-13 and 18th Street were initially friendly, since they were some of the only gangs to allow Salvadorans to join. What exactly caused their alliance to fall apart is uncertain. Most versions point to a fight over a girl in 1989. In the incident, an MS-13 gangster was killed, which led to a cycle of vengeance that has escalated into an intense and generalized animosity between the two gangs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salanegra.elfaro.net/es/201208/cronicas/9301/I-El-origen-del-odio.htm|title=I.

Large-scale deportations began shortly after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992. As a part of the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], the post-war Salvadoran government was required to stop using the standing army as a police force and form a new national police service. However, the ruling political party, [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]], was a descendant of the wartime military government. To favor military allies, it delayed the formation of the [[National Civil Police of El Salvador|Polic\u00eda Nacional Civil]]. When the PNC was finally organized 1993, parts of the police force were created by integrating the armed forces. Some of the members of the nascent police force were known war criminals. The lack of a proper police force meant that deported gangsters faced little opposition when establishing MS-13 in El Salvador. To compound the issue, the post-war period was marked by a large number of uncontrolled arms left over from the conflict, which allowed MS-13 to become a significant arms trafficker. This remains one of its primary revenue sources today, alongside other crimes like extortion and assassination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Captured Peace Elites and Peacebuilding in El Salvador|author=Wade, Christine J.|date=2016|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780896802988|oclc=1020654434}}</ref> In addition, the economic struggles of the post-war period, alongside neoliberal trade reforms likely contributed to the growth of MS-13.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultura y contra-cultura en la posmodernidad : el lenguaje en las maras centroamericanas|author=Maria Eugenia Rojas Rodriguez|date=2008|publisher=Alma Mater|oclc=912767426}}</ref>\n\n=== Opposition ===\nGang violence in El Salvador peaked in the 1990s, then declined in the early 2000s. Even so, they became a key part of political discourse. ARENA presidencies implemented the [[La Mano Dura|Mano Dura and Super Mano Dura]] policies to combat gangs. External observers and gangsters themselves believe these policies increased the power of gangs in El Salvador.\n\nThe Mano Dura policies were followed by a truce between MS-13 and their perpetual rivals, the 18th Street Gang. Under the direction of the president [[Mauricio Funes]], the first Salvadoran President representing the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party, government and gang representatives negotiated unofficially.  The terms required gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for transfers to lower security prisons.  In addition, gangs would receive benefits from the government for every firearm they surrendered. While homicides fell during the truce, gangs no longer had to worry as much about turf wars. Instead, they focused on recruitment, organization, and extortion. The truce did not protect most Salvadorans from extortion. This, along with reports of government leniency towards imprisoned gangsters, led to the truce being highly unpopular and controversial.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFunes's successor as the FMLN presidential candidate, [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]], campaigned on returning to a tough approach on gangs. After S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n took the Presidency in 2014, the truce was understood to be over. Since the gang truce ended, the number of extrajudicial killings by police forces has grown dramatically.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-violence-idUSKBN1FQ0E1|title=U.N. finds possible extrajudicial killings in El Salvador gang...|date=2018-02-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en}}</ref>  Throughout the truce, Salvadoran gangs were able to focus on expansion and internal regulation instead of inter-gang conflict.  When the truce ended, the gangs had built up their forces significantly. As such, the truce breakdown saw a return to record levels of violence, with the gangs being much stronger and better organized than before. In 2015, El Salvador had the highest national homicide rate per capita in the world, largely due to escalating violence between MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang. Participants in the original truce negotiations have since been prosecuted. The trials revealed significant corruption, such as government negotiators encouraging gangs to increase the homicide rate to keep everyone at the negotiating table.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/08/26/traducing-el-salvadors-truce|title=Traducing El Salvador's truce|date=2017-08-26|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-12-06|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to MS-13 in the U.S. has taken varied forms.

Torres tipped authorities to the plan after he and four MS-13 members were stopped by [[NYPD]] detectives for hassling passersby on Northern Boulevard in [[Queens, New York|Queens]], New York. He told police he had information to pass on; he was debriefed on October 22 at [[Rikers Island]], where he was being held on a warrant issued in Virginia, according to court papers. Torres said \"the order for the murder came from gang leadership in El Salvador\", ICE agent Sean Sweeney wrote in an affidavit for a new warrant charging Torres with conspiracy. Torres, who belonged to an MS-13 \"clique\" in Virginia, said he was put in charge, and traveled to New York in August \"for the specific purpose of participating in the planning and execution of the murder plot\", Sweeney wrote. Gang members were trying to obtain a high-powered rifle to penetrate the agent's bulletproof vest. Another MS-13 informant told authorities the agent was marked for death because the gang was \"exceedingly angry\" at him for arresting many members in the past three years, the affidavit states. The murder was supposed to be carried out by the Flushing clique, according to the informant. Federal prosecutors have indicted numerous MS-13 gang members on racketeering, extortion, prostitution, kidnapping, illegal immigration, money laundering, murder, people smuggling, arms trafficking, human trafficking and drug trafficking charges; the targeted special agent was the lead federal investigator on many of the federal cases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/11/04/2009-11-04_ms13_gang_puts_out_hit_on_fbi_agent_assigned_to_crackdown.html|title=MS-13 gang leaders puts out hit on ICE agent assigned to crackdown|last1=Marzulli|first1=John|date=November 4, 2009|work=Daily News|accessdate=June 9, 2012|publisher=NYDailyNews.com}}</ref>\n[[File:Sinaloa Cartel Hierarchy.JPG|thumb|Sinaloa Cartel hierarchy in early 2008]]\n\nIn August 2011, six San Francisco MS-13 members were convicted of racketeering and conspiracy, including three murders, in what was the city's largest-scope gang trial in many years.

Originally, the gang was set up to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other gangs in the Los Angeles area. Over time, the gang grew into a more traditional criminal organization. MS-13 is defined by its cruelty, and its rivalry with the [[18th Street Gang]].\n\nMany MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992, or upon being arrested, facilitating the spread of the gang to Central America. The gang is currently active in many parts of the continental United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Most members are [[Central America]]n, Salvadorans in particular.\n\nAs an international gang, its history is closely tied to [[United States\u2013El Salvador relations]]. In 2018, the gang accounted for less than 1% (10,000) of total gang members in the United States (1.4&nbsp;million), and a similar share of gang murders. The gang is often referenced by the United States' [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to advocate for [[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigrant policies]].\n\n== Description ==\n=== Etymology ===\nThere is some dispute about the etymology of the name. Some sources state the gang is named for La Mara, a street in [[San Salvador]], and the Salvatrucha guerrillas who fought in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/APFN/MS-13.HTM|title=America's Most Dangerous Gang|author=Domash, Shelly Feuer|publisher=apfn.org}}</ref> Additionally, the word ''mara'' means gang in [[Central American Spanish|Caliche slang]] and is taken from ''[[Army ant|marabunta]]'', the name of a fierce type of ant. \"Salvatrucha\" may be a combination of the words ''Salvadoran'' and ''trucha'', a Caliche word for being alert. The term \"Salvatruchas\" has been explained as a reference to Salvadorian peasants trained to become guerrilla fighters, referred to as the \"[[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|title=MS-13: Gangs infiltrating the suburbs of Washington, DC|website=dcspotlight.com|publisher=DC Spotlight Newspaper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614063408/https://dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_MS13.jpg|thumb|An MS [[Gang signal|gang sign]] and tattoos]]\nCentral Americans are the primary targets of violence and threats of violence by MS-13.<ref name=\"Rose\" /> Many of the victims are minors.<ref name=\"Demick\" /> Minors also make up the majority of suspects arrested for killings attributed to MS-13.

As such, Salvadorans began to immigrate without documents in increasing numbers. They mostly settled in cities with large undocumented populations, like Los Angeles. Salvadoran asylum claims were neglected until the 1991 case [[American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) Settlement Agreement|American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh]]. The case's settlement agreement required Guatemalan and Salvadoran asylum claims to be reevaluated, as long as they had entered the U.S. by 1990. By this point, the Civil War was already drawing to a close after more than a decade of fighting. Before ABC v. Thornburg and even after, Salvadoran immigrants were left highly vulnerable to exploitation. In the very beginning, MS-13 was a group of young, delinquent, heavy metal fans who lived in Los Angeles. However, the undocumented community in Los Angeles was subject to severe racial prejudices and persecution. Under these conditions, MS-13 began to mutate into a gang. Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from the other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans, Asians, and African-Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/06/28/in-nva-gang-a-brutal-sense-of-belonging/3d85a511-9afb-4780-9368-12437e807394/|title=In N.Va.

Deras was a former member of Salvadoran special forces, [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|trained in Panama by United States Green Berets]]. On gaining leadership of an MS-13 clique in 1990, he used his military training to discipline the gang and improve its logistical operations. It was after this point that the gang began to grow in power. MS-13's rivalry with the [[18th Street gang|18th Street Gang]] also began in this period. MS-13 and 18th Street were initially friendly, since they were some of the only gangs to allow Salvadorans to join. What exactly caused their alliance to fall apart is uncertain. Most versions point to a fight over a girl in 1989. In the incident, an MS-13 gangster was killed, which led to a cycle of vengeance that has escalated into an intense and generalized animosity between the two gangs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salanegra.elfaro.net/es/201208/cronicas/9301/I-El-origen-del-odio.htm|title=I.

Large-scale deportations began shortly after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992. As a part of the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], the post-war Salvadoran government was required to stop using the standing army as a police force and form a new national police service. However, the ruling political party, [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]], was a descendant of the wartime military government. To favor military allies, it delayed the formation of the [[National Civil Police of El Salvador|Polic\u00eda Nacional Civil]]. When the PNC was finally organized 1993, parts of the police force were created by integrating the armed forces. Some of the members of the nascent police force were known war criminals. The lack of a proper police force meant that deported gangsters faced little opposition when establishing MS-13 in El Salvador. To compound the issue, the post-war period was marked by a large number of uncontrolled arms left over from the conflict, which allowed MS-13 to become a significant arms trafficker. This remains one of its primary revenue sources today, alongside other crimes like extortion and assassination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Captured Peace Elites and Peacebuilding in El Salvador|author=Wade, Christine J.|date=2016|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780896802988|oclc=1020654434}}</ref> In addition, the economic struggles of the post-war period, alongside neoliberal trade reforms likely contributed to the growth of MS-13.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultura y contra-cultura en la posmodernidad : el lenguaje en las maras centroamericanas|author=Maria Eugenia Rojas Rodriguez|date=2008|publisher=Alma Mater|oclc=912767426}}</ref>\n\n=== Opposition ===\nGang violence in El Salvador peaked in the 1990s, then declined in the early 2000s. Even so, they became a key part of political discourse. ARENA presidencies implemented the [[La Mano Dura|Mano Dura and Super Mano Dura]] policies to combat gangs. External observers and gangsters themselves believe these policies increased the power of gangs in El Salvador.\n\nThe Mano Dura policies were followed by a truce between MS-13 and their perpetual rivals, the 18th Street Gang. Under the direction of the president [[Mauricio Funes]], the first Salvadoran President representing the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party, government and gang representatives negotiated unofficially.  The terms required gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for transfers to lower security prisons.  In addition, gangs would receive benefits from the government for every firearm they surrendered. While homicides fell during the truce, gangs no longer had to worry as much about turf wars. Instead, they focused on recruitment, organization, and extortion. The truce did not protect most Salvadorans from extortion. This, along with reports of government leniency towards imprisoned gangsters, led to the truce being highly unpopular and controversial.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFunes's successor as the FMLN presidential candidate, [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]], campaigned on returning to a tough approach on gangs. After S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n took the Presidency in 2014, the truce was understood to be over. Since the gang truce ended, the number of extrajudicial killings by police forces has grown dramatically.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-violence-idUSKBN1FQ0E1|title=U.N. finds possible extrajudicial killings in El Salvador gang...|date=2018-02-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en}}</ref>  Throughout the truce, Salvadoran gangs were able to focus on expansion and internal regulation instead of inter-gang conflict.  When the truce ended, the gangs had built up their forces significantly. As such, the truce breakdown saw a return to record levels of violence, with the gangs being much stronger and better organized than before. In 2015, El Salvador had the highest national homicide rate per capita in the world, largely due to escalating violence between MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang. Participants in the original truce negotiations have since been prosecuted. The trials revealed significant corruption, such as government negotiators encouraging gangs to increase the homicide rate to keep everyone at the negotiating table.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/08/26/traducing-el-salvadors-truce|title=Traducing El Salvador's truce|date=2017-08-26|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-12-06|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to MS-13 in the U.S. has taken varied forms.

It was a rarity for a nationally televised regular season game to not be aired on [[cable television|cable]] since the end of the ''[[Monday Night Baseball|Monday]]''/''[[Thursday Night Baseball]]'' era on [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] in 1989.\n\nDuring Fox's broadcast of the [[2002 World Series]], Buck paid implicit tribute to his father, who had died a few months earlier (he had read the eulogy at his father's funeral) by calling the final out of Game 6 (which tied the series at 3\u20133, and thus ensured there would be a Game 7 broadcast the next night) with the phrase, \"We'll see you tomorrow night.\" This was the same phrase with which Jack Buck had famously called [[Kirby Puckett]]'s home run off [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] [[pitcher]] [[Charlie Leibrandt]] which ended Game 6 of the [[1991 World Series]]. Since then, Joe has continued to use this phrase at appropriate times, including Game 4 of the [[2004 American League Championship Series|2004 ALCS]], in which the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] famously rallied off [[2004 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] closer [[Mariano Rivera]] in the 9th inning to avoid elimination. When [[David Ortiz]]'s walk-off home run finally won it for the Red Sox in the 12th inning, Buck uttered, \"We'll see you later tonight,\" alluding to the fact that the game had extended into the early morning. He also used the phrase at the end of Game 6 of the [[2011 World Series]] when the [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]]' [[David Freese]] hit a walk-off home run in the 11th inning against the [[2011 Texas Rangers season|Rangers]] to send the series to a seventh game (it was actually 20 years and a day since Kirby Puckett's home run).<ref>{{cite web |last1=von Horn |first1=Steve |title=Remaking World Series History: Joe Buck's Game 6 Call Of Freese HR Is Historic In Its Own Right |url=https://stlouis.sbnation.com/st-louis-cardinals/2011/10/28/2520595/world-series-history-joe-buck-jack-buck-game-6-david-freese |website=SBNation.com |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=September 26, 2018}}</ref> The similarity of both the call and the game situation resulted in mentions on national news broadcasts.\n\nAnother notable Red Sox game in the ALCS was in [[2013 American League Championship Series|2013]], Game 2 against the [[Detroit Tigers]] at Fenway Park. The Red Sox were trailing 5\u20131 in the bottom of the eighth inning, with the bases loaded with David Ortiz at-bat. Ortiz hit a game-tying [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] off Tigers' closer [[Joaqu\u00edn Benoit]]. His call: \"Hard hit into right, back at the wall,\" and then he calls, \"TIE GAME!\" as the ball flies over [[Torii Hunter]], who flipped over the outfield wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/10/14/boston-sports-comebacks|title=Big comeback for Boston sports|publisher=WBUR.org|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBuck currently calls a limited selection of regular-season games each year (typically featuring big-market teams such as the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]], [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]], and/or [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]), as well as the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], one of the [[League Championship Series]], and the [[World Series]]. Since 2016, he has been paired with color analyst [[John Smoltz]] and field reporter [[Ken Rosenthal]]. Besides working with [[Tim McCarver]] for 18 seasons (1996\u20132013), Buck also worked with former MLB player and current MLB Network/Fox Sports analyst [[Harold Reynolds]] and baseball writer/insider [[Tom Verducci]] for 2 seasons (2014\u20132015). About a month or two after the 2015 World Series, Reynolds and Verducci were demoted to the #2 team and John Smoltz moved up from the #2 team (with [[Matt Vasgersian]]) in order to take Reynolds and Verducci's places.\n\nThrough 2019, Buck has called 21 [[World Series]] and 20 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] for Fox, the most of any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\n====''NFL on Fox'' (1994\u2013present)====\nSoon after arriving at Fox, Buck became the play-by-play man on the network's #4 [[NFL on Fox|NFL]] broadcast team, with [[Tim Green]] as his color commentator. After three years, he stopped doing NFL games to concentrate on his baseball duties full-time. During the 2001 season, Buck occasionally filled in for [[Curt Menefee]] as the network's number-six play-by-play man.\n\nBuck became Fox's top play-by-play man in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], replacing [[Pat Summerall]]. He is currently teamed with [[Troy Aikman]] as [[color commentator]] and [[Erin Andrews]] as the [[sideline reporter]]. (Buck also worked with Cris Collinsworth from 2002 to 2004, before the latter's move to Showtime, NFL Network, and NBC.) Buck is only the third announcer to handle a television network's lead MLB and NFL coverage in the same year (following [[NBC]]'s [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Al Michaels]]). By 2002, his Fox duties forced him to cut his local Cardinals schedule to 25 games.

American [[sportscaster]] and the son of sportscaster [[Jack Buck]]. He has won numerous [[Sports Emmy Awards]] for his work with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], including his roles as lead [[play-by-play]] announcer for the network's [[NFL on Fox|National Football League]] and [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Major League Baseball]] coverage, and is a three-time recipient of the [[National Sports Media Association#National Sportscaster of the Year|National Sportscaster of the Year]] award.<ref>{{cite web | title=NSMA National Awards  | work=National Sports Media Association | url=https://nationalsportsmedia.org/awards/national-awards | accessdate=April 30, 2017 }}</ref> Since 1996, he has served as the play-by-play announcer for the [[World Series]], each year, with the exceptions of [[1997 World Series|1997]] and [[1999 World Series|1999]]. He was the former host of ''Undeniable with Joe Buck'' on [[Audience Network]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nBuck was born in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] (where the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], for whom his father broadcast, then conducted their [[spring training]]) and raised in the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] area, where he attended [[St. Louis Country Day School]]. He began his broadcasting career in 1989 while he was an undergraduate at [[Indiana University Bloomington]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100625233301/http://journalism.indiana.edu/notices/fox-sports-joe-buck-wraps-up-speaker-series/ Fox Sports\u2019 Joe Buck wraps up Speaker Series] ''[[Indiana University Bloomington]]''</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Before Fox===\nBuck called play-by-play for the then-[[Memphis Redbirds|Louisville Redbirds]], a [[minor league baseball|minor league]] affiliate of the Cardinals, and was a reporter for [[ESPN]]'s coverage of the [[Triple-A All-Star Game]]. In 1991, he did reporting for St Louis' CBS affiliate [[KMOV]]. Also, in [[1991 St. Louis Cardinals season|1991]] Buck began broadcasting for the Cardinals on local television and [[KMOX (AM)|KMOX]] Radio, filling in while his father was working on [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]] telecasts. In the 1992\u201393 season, he was the play-by-play voice for [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|University of Missouri basketball]] broadcasts.\n\nBuck continued to call Cardinals games after being hired by Fox Sports, initially with his father on KMOX and later on [[FSN Midwest]] television. As his network duties increased, however, his local workload shrank, and prior to the [[2008 St. Louis Cardinals season|2008]] season it was announced that he would no longer be calling Cardinals telecasts for FSN Midwest. This marked the first time since [[1960 St. Louis Cardinals season|1960]] that a member of the Buck family was not part of the team's broadcasting crew.<ref>{{cite news|title=Run of Bucks broadcasting Cardinals comes to an end |first=Dan|last=Caesar |newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=March 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Fox Sports===\n\n====Hiring at Fox====\nIn [[1994 NFL season|1994]], Buck was hired by Fox, and at the age of 25 became the youngest man ever to announce a regular slate of [[NFL on Fox|National Football League]] games on network television.<ref>{{cite web |title=Joe Buck {{!}} Fox Sports PressPass |url= http://www.foxsports.com/presspass/bios/on-air/joe-buck |website= FoxSports.com |accessdate= September 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====''Major League Baseball on Fox'' (1996\u2013present)====\n[[File:Buck McCarver Obama All-Star Game 2009.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Joe Buck (''right'') with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] and [[Tim McCarver]] (''left'') during the [[2009 MLB All-Star Game]] in St. Louis]]\nIn 1996, he was named Fox's lead play-by-play voice for [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Major League Baseball]], teaming with [[Tim McCarver]], who had previously worked with his father on CBS. That year, he became the youngest man to do a national broadcast (for all nine innings and games, as a network employee as opposed to simply being a representative of one of the participating teams) for a [[1996 World Series|World Series]], surpassing [[Sean McDonough]], who called the [[1992 World Series]] for [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]] at the age of 30. McDonough had replaced Jack Buck as CBS' lead baseball play-by-play man after he was fired in late 1991.\n\nOn September 8, 1998 Buck called [[Mark McGwire]]'s 62nd [[home run]] that broke [[Roger Maris]]' single-season record.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kent |first1=Milton |title=Buck\u2019s Fox call lives up to magic moment, Baseball: McGwire Passes Maris |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-09/sports/1998252048_1_joe-buck-mark-mcgwire-moment |website=BaltimoreSun.com |publisher=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=September 26, 2011}}</ref> The game was nationally televised live in [[prime time]] on Fox. It was a rarity for a nationally televised regular season game to not be aired on [[cable television|cable]] since the end of the ''[[Monday Night Baseball|Monday]]''/''[[Thursday Night Baseball]]'' era on [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] in 1989.\n\nDuring Fox's broadcast of the [[2002 World Series]], Buck paid implicit tribute to his father, who had died a few months earlier (he had read the eulogy at his father's funeral) by calling the final out of Game 6 (which tied the series at 3\u20133, and thus ensured there would be a Game 7 broadcast the next night) with the phrase, \"We'll see you tomorrow night.\" This was the same phrase with which Jack Buck had famously called [[Kirby Puckett]]'s home run off [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] [[pitcher]] [[Charlie Leibrandt]] which ended Game 6 of the [[1991 World Series]]. Since then, Joe has continued to use this phrase at appropriate times, including Game 4 of the [[2004 American League Championship Series|2004 ALCS]], in which the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] famously rallied off [[2004 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] closer [[Mariano Rivera]] in the 9th inning to avoid elimination. When [[David Ortiz]]'s walk-off home run finally won it for the Red Sox in the 12th inning, Buck uttered, \"We'll see you later tonight,\" alluding to the fact that the game had extended into the early morning. He also used the phrase at the end of Game 6 of the [[2011 World Series]] when the [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]]' [[David Freese]] hit a walk-off home run in the 11th inning against the [[2011 Texas Rangers season|Rangers]] to send the series to a seventh game (it was actually 20 years and a day since Kirby Puckett's home run).<ref>{{cite web |last1=von Horn |first1=Steve |title=Remaking World Series History: Joe Buck's Game 6 Call Of Freese HR Is Historic In Its Own Right |url=https://stlouis.sbnation.com/st-louis-cardinals/2011/10/28/2520595/world-series-history-joe-buck-jack-buck-game-6-david-freese |website=SBNation.com |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=September 26, 2018}}</ref> The similarity of both the call and the game situation resulted in mentions on national news broadcasts.\n\nAnother notable Red Sox game in the ALCS was in [[2013 American League Championship Series|2013]], Game 2 against the [[Detroit Tigers]] at Fenway Park. The Red Sox were trailing 5\u20131 in the bottom of the eighth inning, with the bases loaded with David Ortiz at-bat. Ortiz hit a game-tying [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] off Tigers' closer [[Joaqu\u00edn Benoit]]. His call: \"Hard hit into right, back at the wall,\" and then he calls, \"TIE GAME!\" as the ball flies over [[Torii Hunter]], who flipped over the outfield wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/10/14/boston-sports-comebacks|title=Big comeback for Boston sports|publisher=WBUR.org|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBuck currently calls a limited selection of regular-season games each year (typically featuring big-market teams such as the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]], [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]], and/or [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]), as well as the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], one of the [[League Championship Series]], and the [[World Series]]. Since 2016, he has been paired with color analyst [[John Smoltz]] and field reporter [[Ken Rosenthal]]. Besides working with [[Tim McCarver]] for 18 seasons (1996\u20132013), Buck also worked with former MLB player and current MLB Network/Fox Sports analyst [[Harold Reynolds]] and baseball writer/insider [[Tom Verducci]] for 2 seasons (2014\u20132015). About a month or two after the 2015 World Series, Reynolds and Verducci were demoted to the #2 team and John Smoltz moved up from the #2 team (with [[Matt Vasgersian]]) in order to take Reynolds and Verducci's places.\n\nThrough 2019, Buck has called 21 [[World Series]] and 20 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] for Fox, the most of any play-by-play announcer on network television.\n\n====''NFL on Fox'' (1994\u2013present)====\nSoon after arriving at Fox, Buck became the play-by-play man on the network's #4 [[NFL on Fox|NFL]] broadcast team, with [[Tim Green]] as his color commentator. After three years, he stopped doing NFL games to concentrate on his baseball duties full-time. During the 2001 season, Buck occasionally filled in for [[Curt Menefee]] as the network's number-six play-by-play man.\n\nBuck became Fox's top play-by-play man in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], replacing [[Pat Summerall]]. He is currently teamed with [[Troy Aikman]] as [[color commentator]] and [[Erin Andrews]] as the [[sideline reporter]]. (Buck also worked with Cris Collinsworth from 2002 to 2004, before the latter's move to Showtime, NFL Network, and NBC.) Buck is only the third announcer to handle a television network's lead MLB and NFL coverage in the same year (following [[NBC]]'s [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Al Michaels]]). By 2002, his Fox duties forced him to cut his local Cardinals schedule to 25 games. (Eventually, Buck left the Cardinals altogether to join Fox Sports \"full-time\" in 2008.)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Caesar |first1=Dan |title=Run of Bucks Broadcasting Cardinals Games Comes to an End |url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/joebuckleavescards.html |website=Americansportscastersonline.com |publisher=St. Louis Dispatch |accessdate=September 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=====''Fox NFL Sunday'' (2006)=====\nOn August 14, 2006, Buck was named the host of Fox's pregame NFL show, ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]'' and postgame doubleheader show.

However, Buck chose to concentrate on baseball, citing traffic concerns in [[Los Angeles]] and already being busy calling the NFL and MLB simultaneously.

Buck called about five minutes of the second period, including a goal from the [[Los Angeles Kings]] to make it 3-1. While in the booth, Buck talked about his father calling Blues hockey along with Kelly's father [[Dan Kelly (sportscaster)|Dan]] in the late 1960s, and talked about how fast-paced and exciting the game of hockey was. After the [[Los Angeles Kings]] made it 3-1, Buck shortly thanked the other two guys in the booth and headed out.\n\n===Other notable appearances===\nIn the late 1990s, Buck hosted a weekly sports-news show, ''Goin' Deep'', for [[Fox Sports Net]] cable. He also called [[horse racing]] and professional [[bass fishing]] events early in his Fox career, as well as the network's first [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] telecast in [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1999]].\n\nSince 2001, Buck has hosted the \"Joe Buck Classic\", a celebrity pro-am [[golf tournament]] that is played each May to raise money for [[St. Louis Children's Hospital]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stlouischildrens.org/content/JoeBuckClassic/default.htm |title=Joe Buck Classic |access-date=December 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228053004/http://www.stlouischildrens.org/content/JoeBuckClassic/default.htm |archive-date=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Buck filmed a pilot episode for a prospective late-night talk and comedy program with former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' writer and director [[Matt Piedmont]].

Valentine Starbuck, however, remains the first known person to have set foot on the island. In 1819, a merchant captain named James Henderson of the [[East India Company]] ship ''Hercules,'' sailing from South America to Calcutta, India, had sighted it. Soon after his arrival a local newspaper would publish Henderson's report of three islands recently discovered by Henderson, but the periodical (or Henderson himself) unfortunately failed to state the exact date for his sighting of modern Starbuck Island. [[Henry Evans Maude]]'s educated guess what that this may have been in early February, 1819. The next captain known to have seen it was Valentine Starbuck's first cousin, [[Obed Starbuck]], captain of the whaler ''Hero'' of Nantucket. This was on September 5, 1823, thus three months and one week before Valentine would see it. Obed Starbuck had made one attempt to land on Starbuck Island but failed. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Dehner|first=Steve|title=The Armchair Navigator II: Supplements to Post-Spanish Discoveries|publisher=Bad Tattoo Inc.|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=2-5}}</ref> It was charted in 1825 by [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[George Anson Byron|The 7th Lord Byron]] (a cousin of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|the famous poet]]). Lord Byron, commanding the British warship {{HMS|Blonde|1819|6}}, was returning to [[London]] from a special mission to Honolulu to repatriate the remains of the Hawaiian royal couple,  [[King Kamehameha II]] and [[Queen Kam\u0101malu]]  who had died of [[measles]]\nwhile trying to visit [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]. Lord Byron discovered and charted [[Malden Island]], which he named after his surveying officer, [[Mauke]], and Starbuck Island.<ref name=\"Dunmore46\">Dunmore, p 46</ref>\n\nIt was claimed by the [[United States]] under the 1856 [[Guano Act]], but controlled by Britain after 1866, when possession was taken by Commodore Swinburn of {{HMS|Mutine|1859|6}}. Starbuck Island was mined for [[phosphate]] between 1870 and 1893. Because of its low profile (at its highest point, the island rises to about 5 meters) and the dangerous surrounding reefs, a number of ships were wrecked at Starbuck Island in the late 19th century, including the French transport ''Euryale'' on March 10, 1870. The captain of this ship, the future contre-admiral Albert Des Portes, who stayed 35 days with his crew on the atoll before being rescued and coming back to France with all the members, finally found the right geographical location of the island. On August 7, 1896 the Norwegian ship \"Seladon\" was wrecked against the barrier. The crew went into the lifeboats and drifted for 30 days until they landed on the island of [[Niulakita]], Tuvalu.

Valentine Starbuck, however, remains the first known person to have set foot on the island. In 1819, a merchant captain named James Henderson of the [[East India Company]] ship ''Hercules,'' sailing from South America to Calcutta, India, had sighted it. Soon after his arrival a local newspaper would publish Henderson's report of three islands recently discovered by Henderson, but the periodical (or Henderson himself) unfortunately failed to state the exact date for his sighting of modern Starbuck Island. [[Henry Evans Maude]]'s educated guess what that this may have been in early February, 1819. The next captain known to have seen it was Valentine Starbuck's first cousin, [[Obed Starbuck]], captain of the whaler ''Hero'' of Nantucket, thus three months and one week before Valentine would. Obed Starbuck had made an attempt to land on Starbuck Island on September 5, 1823, but failed. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Dehner|first=Steve|title=The Armchair Navigator II: Supplements to Post-Spanish Discoveries|publisher=Bad Tattoo Inc.|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=2-5}}</ref> It was charted in 1825 by [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[George Anson Byron|The 7th Lord Byron]] (a cousin of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|the famous poet]]).

Starbuck Island was mined for [[phosphate]] between 1870 and 1893. Because of its low profile (at its highest point, the island rises to about 5 meters) and the dangerous surrounding reefs, a number of ships were wrecked at Starbuck Island in the late 19th century, including the French transport ''Euryale'' on March 10, 1870. The captain of this ship, the future contre-admiral Albert Des Portes, who stayed 35 days with his crew on the atoll before being rescued and coming back to France with all the members, finally found the right geographical location of the island. On August 7, 1896 the Norwegian ship \"Seladon\" was wrecked against the barrier. The crew went into the lifeboats and drifted for 30 days until they landed on the island of [[Niulakita]], Tuvalu.

He struggled to score his first international goal, having several apparent goals waved off for offside infractions. He finally scored against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] in a World Cup qualifier on October 12, 2005. He improved his chances for a spot on the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] team in a friendly against Norway on January 29, 2006. In the game, he scored the ninth [[hat trick]] in U.S. national team history, but was ultimately left off the World Cup roster by coach [[Bruce Arena]].\n\nTwellman was selected by new U.S. coach [[Bob Bradley]] as a member of the U.S. squad for the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], scoring in a group stage win over El Salvador.

The region is currently populated mostly by [[Armenians]] and the primary spoken language is [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Artsakh controls most of the territory of the former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] and [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|some of the surrounding area]], giving it a border with [[Armenia]] to the west and [[Iran]] to the south. Its capital is [[Stepanakert]].\n\nThe predominantly Armenian-populated region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] was claimed by both the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] and the [[First Republic of Armenia]] when both countries became independent in 1918 after the fall of the [[Russian Empire]], and a [[History of Nagorno-Karabakh|brief war over Nagorno-Karabakh broke out]] in 1920. The dispute was largely shelved after the [[Soviet Union]] established control over the area and created the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) within the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]] in 1923. During the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], the region re-emerged as a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 1991, a [[1991 Nagorno-Karabakh independence referendum|referendum]] held in the NKAO and the neighbouring [[Shahumian]] region resulted in a [[declaration of independence]] based on its right of [[self-determination]]. A large-scale ethnic conflict led to the 1991\u20131994 [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], which ended with a ceasefire.\n\nArtsakh is a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[democracy]] (in the middle of transforming from a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential democracy]] after a [[2017 Nagorno-Karabakh constitutional referendum|2017 referendum]]) with a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh|legislature]]. Some have said that its reliance on Armenia means that, in many ways, it functions de facto as part of Armenia.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"cornell\"/>\n\nThe country is very mountainous, averaging {{convert|3600|ft|m|-1|order=flip}} [[metres above sea level|above sea level]]. The population is overwhelmingly Christian, most being affiliated with the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. Several historical monasteries are popular with tourists, mostly from the [[Armenian diaspora]], as most travel can take place only between Armenia and Artsakh.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to Armenian and Western specialists, inscriptions dating to the [[Urartian]] period mention the region under a variety of names: \"Ardakh\", \"Urdekhe\", and \"Atakhuni\".<ref>Chorbajian, Levon; Donabedian Patrick; Mutafian, Claude.

It may have been inhabited by [[Caspians|Caspian tribes]] and/or by [[Scythians]].\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\n==== Kingdom of Armenia ====\nAfter decades of raids by the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], and the [[Medes]], Urartu finally collapsed with the rise of the [[Medes|Median Empire]], and shortly after, the geopolitical region previously ruled as Urartu re-emerged as [[Satrapy of Armenia|Armenia]]. By the 5th century BC, Artsakh was part of Armenia under the [[Orontid Dynasty]]. It would continue to be part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] under the [[Artaxiad dynasty|Artaxiad Dynasty]], under which Armenia became one of the largest realms in [[Western Asia]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Great King]] of Armenia, [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes II]], built several cities named after himself in regions he considered particularly important, one of which was the [[Tigranakert of Artsakh|city]] he built in [[Artsakh (historic province)|Artsakh]].\n\n==== Persian Empire and the Satrapy of Arran ====\nFollowing wars with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], Armenia was partitioned between the two empires. Artsakh was removed from [[Sasanian Armenia|Persian Armenia]] and included into the neighbouring [[satrap]]y of [[Albania (satrapy)|Arran]]. At this time, the population of Artsakh consisted of [[Armenians]] and ''Armenicized'' aborigines, though many of the latter were still cited as distinct ethnic entities.<ref name=\"Hewsen\">[[Robert H.

Under the Arabs, most of the [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]] and the [[Armenian Highlands]], including [[Principality of Iberia|Iberia]] and Arran, would be unified into an [[emirate]] called ''[[Arminiya]]'', under which Artsakh would continue to remain as part of Arran.\n\nDespite being under Persian and Arab rule, many of the Armenian territories, including Artsakh, were governed by Armenian nobility. Arran would gradually disappear as a geopolitical entity, and its population would be assimilated by neighbouring ethnic groups with whom they shared a common culture and religion. Many Christians from Arran would [[Ethnogenesis|form part of the ethnic composition]] of the Armenians living in modern-day Artsakh.<ref>Ronald G. Suny: ''What Happened in Soviet Armenia?'' Middle East Report, No. 153, Islam and the State. (Jul. - Aug., 1988), pp. 37-40.</ref>\n\n==== Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia and the Kingdom of Artsakh ====\nFragmentation of Arab authority provided the opportunity for the resurgence of an Armenian state in the Armenian Highlands. One particular noble dynasty, the [[Bagratid dynasty of Armenia|Bagratids]], began annexing territories from other Armenian nobles, which, in the later half of the 9th century gave rise to a new [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenian kingdom]] which included Artsakh.\n\nThe new Kingdom wouldn't stay united for long, however, due to internal conflicts, civil wars, and external pressures, Armenia would often find itself fragmented between other noble Armenian houses, most notably the [[Mamikonian]] and [[Siunia dynasty|Siunia]] families, the latter of which would produce a [[cadet branch]] known as the House of Khachen, named after their stronghold in Artsakh. The House of Khachen ruled the [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] in the 11th century as an independent kingdom under the protectorate of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. Under the House of Khachen, the region historically called Artsakh would become synonymous with the name \"Khachen\".\n\n==== Turko-Mongol rule, the Principality of Khachen, and the Melikdoms of Karabakh ====\nFollowing wars with the [[Byzantine Empire]], and with the arrival of [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] in the later half of the 11th century, the Kingdom of Armenia collapsed, and Artsakh became the autonomous [[Principality of Khachen]], ruled by the [[House of Hasan-Jalalyan]], within the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] for a short time until the [[Ilkhanate|Mongols]] would acquire the region. Although the Armenians of Artsakh would not rule the lands as fully sovereign entities, the mountainous geography of the location would allow them to maintain a semi-independent or autonomous status within other realms, such as the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]], [[Kara Koyunlu]], and [[Aq Qoyunlu|Ak Koyunlu]] realms.\n\nDuring this time, the lands to the west of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura river]] up to the eastern slopes of the [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur mountain range]] would become known as ''[[Karabakh]]'', with the lands of the Principality of Khachen corresponding to the highlands. During the period of Mongol domination, a great number of Armenians left the lowlands of Karabakh and sought refuge in the mountainous heights of the region.<ref>[[George Bournoutian|Bournoutian, George A]]. \"Review of ''The Azerbaijani Turks: Power and Identity Under Russian Rule'', by Audrey L. Altstadt,\" ''[[Armenian Review]]'' 45/2 (Autumn 1992), pp. 63-69.</ref>\n\nThe Principality of Khachen was eventually divided amongst five Armenian princes, known as meliks, who collectively became known as the [[Melikdoms of Karabakh|Five Melikdoms of Karabakh]] (literally \"five principalities of Karabakh\"; also referred to as ''Khamsa'', meaning \"five\" in Arabic).\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nIn the 16th century, Karabakh came under Iranian rule for the first time in almost a millennium with the rise of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Empire]], within which the territory of modern-day Artsakh became part of the [[Province of Karabakh]]. The Armenian princes continued to rule autonomously over the highlands of Karabakh during this time.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, the whole of Karabakh became a semi-independent [[Khanates of the Caucasus|khanate]] called the [[Karabakh Khanate]] which lasted for about 75 years. The [[Russian Empire]] advanced into the region in 1805, declared Artsakh a Russian protectorate and formally annexed it from Iran in 1813 according to the G\u00fclistan/Northern Karabakh Treaty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze f\u00fcr Berg-Karabach/Arzach|last=Luchterbach|first=Otto|publisher=Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2010|isbn=9783832955885|editor-last=Soghomonyan|editor-first=Vahram|location=Badan.Badan|pages=15}}</ref> The Armenian princes lost their status as princes (''meliks'') in 1822.\n\n=== Late modern era ===\n\n==== War in Transcaucasia ====\n{{Main|First Republic of Armenia|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic}}\nFollowing the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I, [[Transcaucasia]] became the stage of wars between every political entity that emerged in the region ([[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]], and [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia]]) and their neighbors ([[Ottoman Empire]]). The newly formed [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] (declared on 28 May 1918) claimed most of the highlands of [[Karabakh]], which was also claimed by the newly formed [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. Assistance from the Republic of Armenia to Karabakh was limited as it found itself fighting enemies on all fronts, but the Armenian irregulars in Zangezur and the territories formerly known as Khachen (Artsakh) managed to maintain their control over the lands, consistently fighting off offensives from Azerbaijan and quelling Muslim uprisings from within. Azerbaijan maintained control of the lowlands of Karabakh and some regions between Zangezur and Artsakh.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the [[British Empire]] established itself in Azerbaijan, and advocated that all of Karabakh (including Zangezur and Artsakh) should be part of Azerbaijan until the boundaries can be decided upon peacefully at the upcoming [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], but the battles did not cease until the [[Red Army]] from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] began reclaiming the former territories of the Russian Empire and created [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]] out of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1920. The Armenians of Zangezur and Artsakh had consistently maintained control of the region and intended to unite with Armenia during the entirety of the two years of chaos, with Azerbaijan only temporarily occupying parts of the regions at certain times. The fall of Azerbaijan gave Armenia the opportunity to properly unite with the Armenian irregulars in Zangezur and Artsakh, but they were taken by the Red Army on 26 May 1920. The rest of Armenia fell to the Red Army shortly after.\n\n==== Soviet Union ====\nThe [[Bolsheviks]] tried to end the centuries-long rivalry between Russia and Turkey, and in 1921, [[Joseph Stalin]] formally transferred the Armenian-populated highlands of Karabakh to [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]] to try to placate Turkey,<ref>[[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], ''Stalin: a Biography'' (Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-674-02258-0}}), p. 204</ref> though the majority of Zangezur remained within [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In December 1920 under Soviet pressure central authorities issued a statement that Karabakh, Zangezur and Nakhjivan were all transferred to Armenian control.

The inclusion of Artsakh within Soviet Azerbaijan caused an uproar amongst Armenians, which led to the creation of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] within Soviet Azerbaijan on 7 July 1923 (implemented in November 1924). Although the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to desire reunification with Armenia, the conflict was largely dormant during the Soviet era.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==== Nagorno-Karabakh War ====\n[[File:Nkr.gif|thumb|Armenian expansion in NKR, 1989-1994]]\nDuring the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was revitalized.

These videos are posted to sites such as YouTube, where they often generate conflicting nationalist Armenian and Azerbaijani comments.\n\n===Publications===\n''[[Azat Artsakh]]'' is the official newspaper of the Republic of Artsakh.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Stepenakert view no.2, cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Stepanakert Republican Stadium]]]]\nSports in the Republic of Artsakh are organised by the Artsakh Ministry of Culture and Youth. Due to the non-recognition of Artsakh, sports teams from the country cannot compete in most international tournaments.\n\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Artsakh. [[Stepanakert]] has a well-built football stadium. Since the mid-1990s, football teams from Artsakh started taking part in some domestic competitions in the Republic of Armenia. [[Lernayin Artsakh FC]] represents the city of [[Stepanakert]]. In Artsakh, domestic football clubs play in the [[Artsakh Football League]]. The Artsakh football league was launched in 2009. The [[Artsakh national football team]] was formed in 2012 and played their first competitive match against the [[Abkhazia national football team]] in [[Sokhumi]], a match that ended with a result of 1\u20131 draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tert.am/am/news/2012/09/25/arcaxabxazia/|title=\u0531\u0562\u056d\u0561\u0566\u056b\u0561\u0575\u056b \u0578\u0582 \u0531\u0580\u0581\u0561\u056d\u056b \u0570\u0561\u057e\u0561\u0584\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576\u0576\u0565\u0580\u0568 \u0562\u0561\u056a\u0561\u0576\u057e\u0565\u0581\u056b\u0576 \u056d\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0572\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0561\u0574\u0562\u055d 1:1|website=Tert.am|accessdate=18 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108010119/http://www.tert.am/am/news/2012/09/25/arcaxabxazia/|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sport.news.am/eng/news/11346/armenia%E2%80%99s-newly-formed-second-national-football-team-to-face-abkhazia.html |title=Armenia's newly formed second national football team to face Abkhazia &#124; NEWS.am Sport \u2013 All about sports |website=Sport.news.am |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017195007/https://sport.news.am/eng/news/11346/armenia%E2%80%99s-newly-formed-second-national-football-team-to-face-abkhazia.html |archivedate=17 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The return match between the unrecognized teams took place at the [[Stepanakert]] Stadium, on 21 October 2012, when the team from Artsakh defeated the Abkhazian team 3\u20130.\n\nThere is also interest in other sports, including basketball and volleyball.

The region is currently populated mostly by [[Armenians]] and the primary spoken language is [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Artsakh controls most of the territory of the former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] and [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|some of the surrounding area]], giving it a border with [[Armenia]] to the west and [[Iran]] to the south. Its capital is [[Stepanakert]].\n\nThe predominantly Armenian-populated region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] was claimed by both the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] and the [[First Republic of Armenia]] when both countries became independent in 1918 after the fall of the [[Russian Empire]], and a [[History of Nagorno-Karabakh|brief war over Nagorno-Karabakh broke out]] in 1920. The dispute was largely shelved after the [[Soviet Union]] established control over the area and created the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) within the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]] in 1923. During the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], the region re-emerged as a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 1991, a [[1991 Nagorno-Karabakh independence referendum|referendum]] held in the NKAO and the neighbouring [[Shahumian]] region resulted in a [[declaration of independence]] based on its right of [[self-determination]]. A large-scale ethnic conflict led to the 1991\u20131994 [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], which ended with a ceasefire.\n\nArtsakh is a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[democracy]] (in the middle of transforming from a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential democracy]] after a [[2017 Nagorno-Karabakh constitutional referendum|2017 referendum]]) with a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh|legislature]]. Some have said that its reliance on Armenia means that, in many ways, it functions de facto as part of Armenia.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"cornell\"/>\n\nThe country is very mountainous, averaging {{convert|3600|ft|m|-1|order=flip}} [[metres above sea level|above sea level]]. The population is overwhelmingly Christian, most being affiliated with the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. Several historical monasteries are popular with tourists, mostly from the [[Armenian diaspora]], as most travel can take place only between Armenia and Artsakh.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to Armenian and Western specialists, inscriptions dating to the [[Urartian]] period mention the region under a variety of names: \"Ardakh\", \"Urdekhe\", and \"Atakhuni\".<ref>Chorbajian, Levon; Donabedian Patrick; Mutafian, Claude.

It may have been inhabited by [[Caspians|Caspian tribes]] and/or by [[Scythians]].\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\n==== Kingdom of Armenia ====\nAfter decades of raids by the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], and the [[Medes]], Urartu finally collapsed with the rise of the [[Medes|Median Empire]], and shortly after, the geopolitical region previously ruled as Urartu re-emerged as [[Satrapy of Armenia|Armenia]]. By the 5th century BC, Artsakh was part of Armenia under the [[Orontid Dynasty]]. It would continue to be part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] under the [[Artaxiad dynasty|Artaxiad Dynasty]], under which Armenia became one of the largest realms in [[Western Asia]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Great King]] of Armenia, [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes II]], built several cities named after himself in regions he considered particularly important, one of which was the [[Tigranakert of Artsakh|city]] he built in [[Artsakh (historic province)|Artsakh]].\n\n==== Persian Empire and the Satrapy of Arran ====\nFollowing wars with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], Armenia was partitioned between the two empires. Artsakh was removed from [[Sasanian Armenia|Persian Armenia]] and included into the neighbouring [[satrap]]y of [[Albania (satrapy)|Arran]]. At this time, the population of Artsakh consisted of [[Armenians]] and ''Armenicized'' aborigines, though many of the latter were still cited as distinct ethnic entities.<ref name=\"Hewsen\">[[Robert H.

Under the Arabs, most of the [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]] and the [[Armenian Highlands]], including [[Principality of Iberia|Iberia]] and Arran, would be unified into an [[emirate]] called ''[[Arminiya]]'', under which Artsakh would continue to remain as part of Arran.\n\nDespite being under Persian and Arab rule, many of the Armenian territories, including Artsakh, were governed by Armenian nobility. Arran would gradually disappear as a geopolitical entity, and its population would be assimilated by neighbouring ethnic groups with whom they shared a common culture and religion. Many Christians from Arran would [[Ethnogenesis|form part of the ethnic composition]] of the Armenians living in modern-day Artsakh.<ref>Ronald G. Suny: ''What Happened in Soviet Armenia?'' Middle East Report, No. 153, Islam and the State. (Jul. - Aug., 1988), pp. 37-40.</ref>\n\n==== Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia and the Kingdom of Artsakh ====\nFragmentation of Arab authority provided the opportunity for the resurgence of an Armenian state in the Armenian Highlands. One particular noble dynasty, the [[Bagratid dynasty of Armenia|Bagratids]], began annexing territories from other Armenian nobles, which, in the later half of the 9th century gave rise to a new [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenian kingdom]] which included Artsakh.\n\nThe new Kingdom wouldn't stay united for long, however, due to internal conflicts, civil wars, and external pressures, Armenia would often find itself fragmented between other noble Armenian houses, most notably the [[Mamikonian]] and [[Siunia dynasty|Siunia]] families, the latter of which would produce a [[cadet branch]] known as the House of Khachen, named after their stronghold in Artsakh. The House of Khachen ruled the [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] in the 11th century as an independent kingdom under the protectorate of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. Under the House of Khachen, the region historically called Artsakh would become synonymous with the name \"Khachen\".\n\n==== Turko-Mongol rule, the Principality of Khachen, and the Melikdoms of Karabakh ====\nFollowing wars with the [[Byzantine Empire]], and with the arrival of [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] in the later half of the 11th century, the Kingdom of Armenia collapsed, and Artsakh became the autonomous [[Principality of Khachen]], ruled by the [[House of Hasan-Jalalyan]], within the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] for a short time until the [[Ilkhanate|Mongols]] would acquire the region. Although the Armenians of Artsakh would not rule the lands as fully sovereign entities, the mountainous geography of the location would allow them to maintain a semi-independent or autonomous status within other realms, such as the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]], [[Kara Koyunlu]], and [[Aq Qoyunlu|Ak Koyunlu]] realms.\n\nDuring this time, the lands to the west of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura river]] up to the eastern slopes of the [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur mountain range]] would become known as ''[[Karabakh]]'', with the lands of the Principality of Khachen corresponding to the highlands. During the period of Mongol domination, a great number of Armenians left the lowlands of Karabakh and sought refuge in the mountainous heights of the region.<ref>[[George Bournoutian|Bournoutian, George A]]. \"Review of ''The Azerbaijani Turks: Power and Identity Under Russian Rule'', by Audrey L. Altstadt,\" ''[[Armenian Review]]'' 45/2 (Autumn 1992), pp. 63-69.</ref>\n\nThe Principality of Khachen was eventually divided amongst five Armenian princes, known as meliks, who collectively became known as the [[Melikdoms of Karabakh|Five Melikdoms of Karabakh]] (literally \"five principalities of Karabakh\"; also referred to as ''Khamsa'', meaning \"five\" in Arabic).\n\n=== Early modern era ===\nIn the 16th century, Karabakh came under Iranian rule for the first time in almost a millennium with the rise of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Empire]], within which the territory of modern-day Artsakh became part of the [[Province of Karabakh]]. The Armenian princes continued to rule autonomously over the highlands of Karabakh during this time.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, the whole of Karabakh became a semi-independent [[Khanates of the Caucasus|khanate]] called the [[Karabakh Khanate]] which lasted for about 75 years. The [[Russian Empire]] advanced into the region in 1805, declared Artsakh a Russian protectorate and formally annexed it from Iran in 1813 according to the G\u00fclistan/Northern Karabakh Treaty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze f\u00fcr Berg-Karabach/Arzach|last=Luchterbach|first=Otto|publisher=Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2010|isbn=9783832955885|editor-last=Soghomonyan|editor-first=Vahram|location=Badan.Badan|pages=15}}</ref> The Armenian princes lost their status as princes (''meliks'') in 1822.\n\n=== Late modern era ===\n\n==== War in Transcaucasia ====\n{{Main|First Republic of Armenia|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic}}\nFollowing the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I, [[Transcaucasia]] became the stage of wars between every political entity that emerged in the region ([[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]], and [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia]]) and their neighbors ([[Ottoman Empire]]). The newly formed [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] (declared on 28 May 1918) claimed most of the highlands of [[Karabakh]], which was also claimed by the newly formed [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. Assistance from the Republic of Armenia to Karabakh was limited as it found itself fighting enemies on all fronts, but the Armenian irregulars in Zangezur and the territories formerly known as Khachen (Artsakh) managed to maintain their control over the lands, consistently fighting off offensives from Azerbaijan and quelling Muslim uprisings from within. Azerbaijan maintained control of the lowlands of Karabakh and some regions between Zangezur and Artsakh.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the [[British Empire]] established itself in Azerbaijan, and advocated that all of Karabakh (including Zangezur and Artsakh) should be part of Azerbaijan until the boundaries can be decided upon peacefully at the upcoming [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], but the battles did not cease until the [[Red Army]] from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] began reclaiming the former territories of the Russian Empire and created [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]] out of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1920. The Armenians of Zangezur and Artsakh had consistently maintained control of the region and intended to unite with Armenia during the entirety of the two years of chaos, with Azerbaijan only temporarily occupying parts of the regions at certain times. The fall of Azerbaijan gave Armenia the opportunity to properly unite with the Armenian irregulars in Zangezur and Artsakh, but they were taken by the Red Army on 26 May 1920. The rest of Armenia fell to the Red Army shortly after.\n\n==== Soviet Union ====\nThe [[Bolsheviks]] tried to end the centuries-long rivalry between Russia and Turkey, and in 1921, [[Joseph Stalin]] formally transferred the Armenian-populated highlands of Karabakh to [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]] to try to placate Turkey,<ref>[[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], ''Stalin: a Biography'' (Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-674-02258-0}}), p. 204</ref> though the majority of Zangezur remained within [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In December 1920 under Soviet pressure central authorities issued a statement that Karabakh, Zangezur and Nakhjivan were all transferred to Armenian control.

The inclusion of Artsakh within Soviet Azerbaijan caused an uproar amongst Armenians, which led to the creation of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] within Soviet Azerbaijan on 7 July 1923 (implemented in November 1924). Although the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to desire reunification with Armenia, the conflict was largely dormant during the Soviet era.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==== Nagorno-Karabakh War ====\n[[File:Nkr.gif|thumb|Armenian expansion in NKR, 1989-1994]]\nDuring the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was revitalized.

The Bulldogs would go on to win the 1916, 1917 and 1919 Ohio League championships. They were the [[NFL championships#1920\u20131932: The early years|NFL champions]] in [[1922 NFL season|1922]] and [[1923 NFL season|1923]]. In 1921\u20131923, the Bulldogs played 25 straight games without a defeat (including 3 ties), which as of 2019 remains an NFL record. As a result of the Bulldogs' early success along with the league being founded in the city, the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] is located in Canton.

Until about 1902, this team competed with the [[Akron East Ends]] for the Ohio Independent Championship. When the [[Massillon Tigers]] arrived on the scene and went professional, Canton, as an amateur team, was no longer competitive.<ref>Carroll (n.d.), p. 4</ref> The Canton Bulldogs were officially established on November 15, 1904 as the '''Canton Athletic Club''', a club designed to operate [[baseball]] and football teams. The statement stated that the football team was to be a \"professional organization,\" complete with a \"professional coach.\"\n\n=== Blondy Wallace era ===\n[[File:1906 canton bulldogs team.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The 1906 Canton Bulldogs team.]]\n\nThe team was given the goal of beating the rival [[Massillon Tigers]], who had won the Ohio League championship in 1903 and 1904. To do this, Canton \nwent out and offered money to the best players on all the other Ohio League teams. [[Bill Laub]], a player, team captain and coach of the [[Akron East Ends]], was hired as the team's first-ever coach.\n\nThe team began its [[1905 Canton Bulldogs season|1905 season]], with a 7\u20130 record. The Bulldogs then traveled to [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]] to play the [[Latrobe Athletic Association]], led by [[quarterback]] [[John Brallier]]. Latrobe was not only the current [[Pennsylvania]] champions, but had gone undefeated for the last three seasons. Latrobe was also considered the only pro team capable of competing with Canton and Massillon. Canton would go on to lose its 1905 game to Latrobe, 6\u20130. However, the worst part of the loss came when coach Bill Laub became injured and was unable to finish the season. [[Blondy Wallace]], a former [[All-American]] for the [[Penn Quakers]], was then named as Laub's successor and team captain. Two weeks later, the team would lose the Ohio League championship game to the Massillon Tigers, 14\u20134.<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.a), p. 6</ref>\n\n[[File:1906 Canton-Massillion Scandal Cartoon.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Massillon Tiger vs. Canton Bulldog]]\nSometime during the 1906 season, the Canton team became known as the \"Bulldogs\" although no one is quite sure how it came to be affixed to the Canton team. It wasn't called that in 1905, nor through most of the 1906 season. As late as November 4, R.C. Johnson, an editorial cartoonist with the ''[[Canton Repository]]'', was only able to picture the Canton team as only a man with a club lying in wait for the Massillon Tiger. Most references to the team called it \"Canton A.C.,\" \"C.A.C.,\" \"Canton eleven.\" \"the Red and White\" or \"Wallace's Men.\" Suddenly, almost overnight, the team became the \"Bulldogs\", with a November 14, 1906 cartoon showing the Canton Bulldog facing off against the Massillon Tiger.\n\n{{details|Canton Bulldogs\u2013Massillon Tigers betting scandal}}\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Massillon-canton game 2.jpg\n|height  = 250\n|alt     = \n|caption = Canton Bulldogs vs. [[Massillon Tigers]] playing on grid field on November 24, 1906, during the [[Canton Bulldogs\u2013Massillon Tigers betting scandal|betting scandal]].\n}}\n\nBlondy Wallace began the 1906 season by signing [[Jack Lang (American football)|Jack Lang]], [[Jack Hayden (baseball)|Jack Hayden]], [[Herman Kerchoff]], and [[Clark Schrontz]] away from the Tigers and improving Canton's chances for 1906 championship. Due to the money that was being spent by Canton and Massillon on professional players, both teams ended up with a spending deficit that had to be shouldered by local businessmen.\n\nThat year the Bulldogs won their first game against the Tigers, at Canton, but lost the second game at Massillon. Due to rules of the championship series, the win in the second game allowed Massillon to claim the Ohio championship. Shortly after that second game, a Massillon newspaper charged Canton coach Blondy Wallace with throwing the 1906 championship game. Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to ruin the club's reputation before their final game with Latrobe. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had thrown the game, the accusation so tarnished Canton's name that virtually no one attended the Latrobe game. The scandal ruined professional football in Ohio until the mid 1910s. Other sports pundits argue that the expense of placing all-star teams on the field each week hampered on the sport. The Canton Morning News put a $20,000 price tag on the Massillon Tigers 1906 team, while many speculate that the Bulldogs probably cost even more. Still others contend that the games involving top teams like Canton and Massilon were too one-sided and lacked excitement.\n\nWhile Massillon was still able to field a local team in 1907 and still win the Ohio League championship, the Canton team folded. Blondy Wallace may have lost more than money. His libel suit never came to trial. The reason was probably that he settled out of court, rather than that Massillon had some sort of secret evidence. This leaves the scandal still disputed by historians and football fans alike. Because Wallace settled out of court, we have only charges and countercharges instead of a real end to the fix scandal.<ref>Braunwart & Carroll (1984), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== Harry Turner era ===\nIn 1911, Canton finally fielded a new team called the Canton Professionals. The team was made up entirely of local players and the pay was undoubtedly small. In their comeback season, the Pros finished in second place in the standing behind [[Peggy Parratt]] and the [[Shelby Blues]].<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.b), p. 2</ref> In 1914, the Pros challenged Parratt, this time with the [[Akron Indians]], for the Ohio League title. In a game that served as a precursor to the championship, Canton defeated Parratt, however Canton captain [[Harry Turner (American football)|Harry Turner]], was severely injured during the game while attempting to tackle Akron's [[Joe Collins (American football)|Joe Collins]]. He later died of a fracture to his [[spinal cord]]. According to Canton manager [[Jack Cusack]], who was at Turner's bedside when he died, his last words were \"I know I must go,\" he said, \"but I'm satisfied, for we beat Peggy Parratt.\" Canton won the game 6\u20130. The death of Turner was taken hard by the team. It was the first fatal accident involving a major professional football team in Ohio. The Professionals easily lost a rematch to the Indians a few days later.<ref>Roberts (1979), p. 4</ref>\n\n=== Jim Thorpe era ===\n[[File:Jim Thorpe football.png|right|thumb|[[Jim Thorpe]] during his tenure with the Bulldogs.]]\nIn 1915, Massillon and Canton began hiring several players away from the [[Akron Pros]]. Jack Cusack, who had become manager of the Canton team, restored the old Bulldog name.<ref name=\"Ohio History\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2109 | title=Canton Bulldogs | work=Ohio History Central | publisher=[[Ohio Historical Society]] | date=July 1, 2005 | accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> As the first of two Canton-Massillon games approached, Cusack signed [[Jim Thorpe]] for $250 a game. Thorpe did not play much in the Bulldogs' first game, at Massillon, which the Tigers won 16\u20130. In the second game, Thorpe took over as the team's coach and played the entire game. He kicked two field goals in a 6\u20130 Canton win.<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.d), p. 4</ref>\n\nIn 1916, the Bulldogs went undefeated, beat Massillon 24\u20130, and were generally recognized as the professional champions, not only of Ohio, but also of the country. The average attendance for a game prior to Thorpe's signing was 1,500. That soon rose to 6,000 and eventually reached 8,000 spectators, which was the capacity of Canton's League Park. Thorpe would remain the chief attendance draw in professional football until [[Red Grange]] entered the game in 1925.<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.c), p. ?</ref> Because Thorpe was able to draw big crowds to Canton for games, Cusack was able to put together a financially stable squad that included several former All-Americans, including [[Cub Buck]], who also coached at [[Carleton Knights football|Carleton College]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.packers.com/history/hall-of-famers/buck-howard-cub.html |title= Howard \u201cCub\u201d Buck |publisher= Green Bay Packers |access-date= 2017-12-21 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014410/http://www.packers.com/history/hall-of-famers/buck-howard-cub.html |archive-date= 2017-11-07 |url-status= dead }}</ref> \n\nIn 1917, the Bulldogs won their first eight games to claim the league championship.<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.e), pp. 4\u20135</ref> Neither Canton nor Massillon played during the 1918 season because of the [[Great War]] and the [[1918 flu pandemic|flu pandemic]].<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.f), p. 1</ref> Cusack left the team that year to start up an oil business in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Ralph Hay]], a successful auto dealer, took over managing the team.

These teams, who were trying to compete with the Bulldogs, were spending more money than they could afford and were stealing players from one another, which drove salaries even higher. In 1920 at Hay's auto showroom, known for [[Hupmobile]]s, the [[American Professional Football Association]] was organized. As the best-known personality in football, Thorpe was named the APFA's first permanent president. After scheduling a showcase game between Canton and the [[Buffalo All-Americans]] in [[New York City]] in December 1920, Thorpe left the Bulldogs at the end of the 1920 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Associating in Obscurity|work=Pro Football Researchers Association|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Associating_In_Obscurity.pdf|accessdate=February 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218174314/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Associating_In_Obscurity.pdf|archivedate=December 18, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Canton bulldogs 1923.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Canton Bulldogs in 1923, NFL champions.]]\nIn the APFA, the Bulldogs found the competition somewhat tougher than expected. Canton had a respectable 9\u20135\u20134 record over the next two seasons. The APFA became the [[National Football League]] in 1922 and Hay hired [[Guy Chamberlin]] as Canton's [[player-coach]]. Chamberlin rebuilt the Bulldogs into a championship team. He kept just five players from the 1921 squad. As a player Chamberlin led his team past the [[Chicago Cardinals]] in 1922 by blocking a punt that set up a [[touchdown]], and running back two [[interception]]s for touchdowns to beat the Cards' 20\u20133.<ref>{{cite news|title=Birth and Rebirth |work=Pro Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Birth_And_Rebirth.pdf |accessdate=February 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218173538/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Birth_And_Rebirth.pdf |archivedate=December 18, 2010 }}</ref> The Bulldogs went on to win back-to-back NFL championships in 1922 and 1923.\n\nHowever, Canton suffered several setbacks in 1923. First Hay announced that he was stepping down as the team's manager. His asking price for the team was $1,500, which was decided to be about $500 more than the 1922 champions were worth. Things were still up in the air when Hay and Chamberlin left for Chicago to represent the Bulldogs at the league's summer meeting. When Ralph Hay returned to Canton, he sold the Bulldogs on a group of local businessmen who formed the Canton Athletic Company to run the team. Chamberlin stayed on as coach, assuring the team of success on the field. Success at the gate was not nearly so likely.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ditto|work=Pro Football Researchers Association|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Ditto.pdf|accessdate=February 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226105821/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Ditto.pdf|archivedate=February 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Cleveland Bulldogs ===\nAs the payroll for Canton players became too expensive, the team lost about $13,000 in 1923 and the Canton Athletic Company sold the franchise in August for $2,500 to Cleveland promoter [[Samuel Deutsch]], owner of the NFL's [[Cleveland Bulldogs|Cleveland Indians]].<ref name=\"Hello\">{{cite news|title=Goodbye, Bulldogs, Hello |work=Pro Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Goodbye_Bulldogs_Hello.pdf |accessdate=February 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218173751/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Goodbye_Bulldogs_Hello.pdf |archivedate=December 18, 2010 }}</ref> He added seven players from Canton, renamed his team the [[Cleveland Bulldogs]], and they won the 1924 NFL championship.<ref name=\"Ohio History\"/> Chamberlin also served as a player-coach of the Cleveland Bulldogs.

First, the NFL was organized in a Canton automobile showroom on September 17, 1920. Secondly, the Canton Bulldogs were one of the early powers of pro football both before and after 1920. An NFL charter member, the Bulldogs became the new league\u2019s first two-time champions with undefeated seasons in 1922 and 1923. Finally Jim Thorpe, the first big-name athlete to play pro football, began his pro tenure with the 1915 Canton Bulldogs.\n\nIn late 1959, the citizens of Canton responded enthusiastically to a Canton Repository editorial that pointed out why a Hall of Fame should be located in their city. The city's foundations and individuals banded together to first win site designation from the NFL and then raise $378,026 to actually build a hall of fame on wooded parkland donated by the city. Ground-breaking was held in August, 1962, and the Hall was opened on September 7, 1963.<ref>Smith (1984), p. 1</ref>\n\n== Pro Football Hall of Famers ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:maroon; color:white;\"|Canton Bulldogs Hall of Famers\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:maroon; color:white;\"|Players\n|-\n!

They played in the [[Ohio League]] from 1903 to 1906 and 1911 to 1919, and the American Professional Football Association (later renamed the [[National Football League]] (NFL) in 1922), from 1920 to 1923 and again from 1925 to 1926. The Bulldogs would go on to win the 1916, 1917 and 1919 Ohio League championships. They were the [[NFL championships#1920\u20131932: The early years|NFL champions]] in [[1922 NFL season|1922]] and [[1923 NFL season|1923]]. In 1921\u20131923, the Bulldogs played 25 straight games without a defeat (including 3 ties), which as of 2019 remains an NFL record. As a result of the Bulldogs' early success along with the league being founded in the city, the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] is located in Canton. [[Jim Thorpe]], the Olympian and renowned all-around athlete, was Canton's most-recognized player in the pre-NFL era.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hall/release.jsp?release_id=932 | title=The Pro Football Hall of Fame: Then and Now | publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] | date=January 1, 2005 | accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, [[Sam Deutsch]], the owner of the NFL's [[Cleveland Tigers (NFL)|Cleveland Indians]], bought the Canton Bulldogs and took the Bulldogs name and its players to [[Cleveland]] and named his franchise the [[Cleveland Bulldogs]]. He then offered to sell the Canton franchise back to the city of Canton to play in the 1924 season, however there were no buyers interested in the team, so he \"mothballed\" the Canton club. The Canton Bulldogs were however re-established in 1925, and the NFL considers the 1925 to 1926 Canton Bulldogs to be the same team as the 1920 to 1923 incarnation.\n\nAn unrelated \"Canton Bulldogs\" team played in the [[United Football League (1961\u201364)|United Football League]] in 1964; the team's name was somewhat coincidental, as it had moved from Cleveland and kept its original nickname; that team moved to [[Philadelphia]] and became the \"Philadelphia Bulldogs.\"<ref>{{Cite web | first=Dennis | last=Kuno | url=http://pittsburghsportsdailybulletin.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/dennis-kuno-on-the-history-of-the-continental-football-league-1965-1969/ | title=History of the Continental Football League (1965\u20131969) | publisher=Pittsburgh Sports Bulletin | date=January 13, 2012 | accessdate=March 30, 2012}}{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2012}}</ref> All in all, this version of the Cleveland-Canton-Philadelphia Bulldogs played from 1961 to 1966, its last two years in Philadelphia as a member of the [[Continental Football League]].<ref>Kennedy (1988), p. 2</ref> Another \"Canton Bulldogs\" team was slated to begin play in the [[Stars Football League]] in 2012, although that team never materialized.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://starsfootballleague.com/team-info/canton-bulldogs/ | title=Team Info \u2013 Canton BullDogs | publisher=[[Stars Football League]] | accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> The Bulldogs name is also in use at [[Canton McKinley High School]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origin ===\nPrior to the debut of professional football in the city, an amateur team from Canton was mentioned as being a superior team in [[Stark County, Ohio]]. Until about 1902, this team competed with the [[Akron East Ends]] for the Ohio Independent Championship. When the [[Massillon Tigers]] arrived on the scene and went professional, Canton, as an amateur team, was no longer competitive.<ref>Carroll (n.d.), p. 4</ref> The Canton Bulldogs were officially established on November 15, 1904 as the '''Canton Athletic Club''', a club designed to operate [[baseball]] and football teams. The statement stated that the football team was to be a \"professional organization,\" complete with a \"professional coach.\"\n\n=== Blondy Wallace era ===\n[[File:1906 canton bulldogs team.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The 1906 Canton Bulldogs team.]]\n\nThe team was given the goal of beating the rival [[Massillon Tigers]], who had won the Ohio League championship in 1903 and 1904. To do this, Canton \nwent out and offered money to the best players on all the other Ohio League teams. [[Bill Laub]], a player, team captain and coach of the [[Akron East Ends]], was hired as the team's first-ever coach.\n\nThe team began its [[1905 Canton Bulldogs season|1905 season]], with a 7\u20130 record. The Bulldogs then traveled to [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]] to play the [[Latrobe Athletic Association]], led by [[quarterback]] [[John Brallier]]. Latrobe was not only the current [[Pennsylvania]] champions, but had gone undefeated for the last three seasons. Latrobe was also considered the only pro team capable of competing with Canton and Massillon. Canton would go on to lose its 1905 game to Latrobe, 6\u20130. However, the worst part of the loss came when coach Bill Laub became injured and was unable to finish the season. [[Blondy Wallace]], a former [[All-American]] for the [[Penn Quakers]], was then named as Laub's successor and team captain. Two weeks later, the team would lose the Ohio League championship game to the Massillon Tigers, 14\u20134.<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.a), p. 6</ref>\n\n[[File:1906 Canton-Massillion Scandal Cartoon.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Massillon Tiger vs. Canton Bulldog]]\nSometime during the 1906 season, the Canton team became known as the \"Bulldogs\" although no one is quite sure how it came to be affixed to the Canton team. It wasn't called that in 1905, nor through most of the 1906 season. As late as November 4, R.C. Johnson, an editorial cartoonist with the ''[[Canton Repository]]'', was only able to picture the Canton team as only a man with a club lying in wait for the Massillon Tiger. Most references to the team called it \"Canton A.C.,\" \"C.A.C.,\" \"Canton eleven.\" \"the Red and White\" or \"Wallace's Men.\" Suddenly, almost overnight, the team became the \"Bulldogs\", with a November 14, 1906 cartoon showing the Canton Bulldog facing off against the Massillon Tiger.\n\n{{details|Canton Bulldogs\u2013Massillon Tigers betting scandal}}\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Massillon-canton game 2.jpg\n|height  = 250\n|alt     = \n|caption = Canton Bulldogs vs. [[Massillon Tigers]] playing on grid field on November 24, 1906, during the [[Canton Bulldogs\u2013Massillon Tigers betting scandal|betting scandal]].\n}}\n\nBlondy Wallace began the 1906 season by signing [[Jack Lang (American football)|Jack Lang]], [[Jack Hayden (baseball)|Jack Hayden]], [[Herman Kerchoff]], and [[Clark Schrontz]] away from the Tigers and improving Canton's chances for 1906 championship. Due to the money that was being spent by Canton and Massillon on professional players, both teams ended up with a spending deficit that had to be shouldered by local businessmen.\n\nThat year the Bulldogs won their first game against the Tigers, at Canton, but lost the second game at Massillon. Due to rules of the championship series, the win in the second game allowed Massillon to claim the Ohio championship. Shortly after that second game, a Massillon newspaper charged Canton coach Blondy Wallace with throwing the 1906 championship game. Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to ruin the club's reputation before their final game with Latrobe. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had thrown the game, the accusation so tarnished Canton's name that virtually no one attended the Latrobe game. The scandal ruined professional football in Ohio until the mid 1910s. Other sports pundits argue that the expense of placing all-star teams on the field each week hampered on the sport. The Canton Morning News put a $20,000 price tag on the Massillon Tigers 1906 team, while many speculate that the Bulldogs probably cost even more. Still others contend that the games involving top teams like Canton and Massilon were too one-sided and lacked excitement.\n\nWhile Massillon was still able to field a local team in 1907 and still win the Ohio League championship, the Canton team folded. Blondy Wallace may have lost more than money. His libel suit never came to trial. The reason was probably that he settled out of court, rather than that Massillon had some sort of secret evidence. This leaves the scandal still disputed by historians and football fans alike. Because Wallace settled out of court, we have only charges and countercharges instead of a real end to the fix scandal.<ref>Braunwart & Carroll (1984), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== Harry Turner era ===\nIn 1911, Canton finally fielded a new team called the Canton Professionals. The team was made up entirely of local players and the pay was undoubtedly small. In their comeback season, the Pros finished in second place in the standing behind [[Peggy Parratt]] and the [[Shelby Blues]].<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.b), p. 2</ref> In 1914, the Pros challenged Parratt, this time with the [[Akron Indians]], for the Ohio League title. In a game that served as a precursor to the championship, Canton defeated Parratt, however Canton captain [[Harry Turner (American football)|Harry Turner]], was severely injured during the game while attempting to tackle Akron's [[Joe Collins (American football)|Joe Collins]]. He later died of a fracture to his [[spinal cord]]. According to Canton manager [[Jack Cusack]], who was at Turner's bedside when he died, his last words were \"I know I must go,\" he said, \"but I'm satisfied, for we beat Peggy Parratt.\" Canton won the game 6\u20130. The death of Turner was taken hard by the team. It was the first fatal accident involving a major professional football team in Ohio. The Professionals easily lost a rematch to the Indians a few days later.<ref>Roberts (1979), p. 4</ref>\n\n=== Jim Thorpe era ===\n[[File:Jim Thorpe football.png|right|thumb|[[Jim Thorpe]] during his tenure with the Bulldogs.]]\nIn 1915, Massillon and Canton began hiring several players away from the [[Akron Pros]]. Jack Cusack, who had become manager of the Canton team, restored the old Bulldog name.<ref name=\"Ohio History\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2109 | title=Canton Bulldogs | work=Ohio History Central | publisher=[[Ohio Historical Society]] | date=July 1, 2005 | accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> As the first of two Canton-Massillon games approached, Cusack signed [[Jim Thorpe]] for $250 a game. Thorpe did not play much in the Bulldogs' first game, at Massillon, which the Tigers won 16\u20130. In the second game, Thorpe took over as the team's coach and played the entire game. He kicked two field goals in a 6\u20130 Canton win.<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.d), p. 4</ref>\n\nIn 1916, the Bulldogs went undefeated, beat Massillon 24\u20130, and were generally recognized as the professional champions, not only of Ohio, but also of the country. The average attendance for a game prior to Thorpe's signing was 1,500. That soon rose to 6,000 and eventually reached 8,000 spectators, which was the capacity of Canton's League Park. Thorpe would remain the chief attendance draw in professional football until [[Red Grange]] entered the game in 1925.<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.c), p. ?</ref> Because Thorpe was able to draw big crowds to Canton for games, Cusack was able to put together a financially stable squad that included several former All-Americans, including [[Cub Buck]], who also coached at [[Carleton Knights football|Carleton College]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.packers.com/history/hall-of-famers/buck-howard-cub.html |title= Howard \u201cCub\u201d Buck |publisher= Green Bay Packers |access-date= 2017-12-21 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014410/http://www.packers.com/history/hall-of-famers/buck-howard-cub.html |archive-date= 2017-11-07 |url-status= dead }}</ref> \n\nIn 1917, the Bulldogs won their first eight games to claim the league championship.<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.e), pp. 4\u20135</ref> Neither Canton nor Massillon played during the 1918 season because of the [[Great War]] and the [[1918 flu pandemic|flu pandemic]].<ref>PFRA Research (n.d.f), p. 1</ref> Cusack left the team that year to start up an oil business in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Ralph Hay]], a successful auto dealer, took over managing the team.

These teams, who were trying to compete with the Bulldogs, were spending more money than they could afford and were stealing players from one another, which drove salaries even higher. In 1920 at Hay's auto showroom, known for [[Hupmobile]]s, the [[American Professional Football Association]] was organized. As the best-known personality in football, Thorpe was named the APFA's first permanent president. After scheduling a showcase game between Canton and the [[Buffalo All-Americans]] in [[New York City]] in December 1920, Thorpe left the Bulldogs at the end of the 1920 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Associating in Obscurity|work=Pro Football Researchers Association|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Associating_In_Obscurity.pdf|accessdate=February 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218174314/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Associating_In_Obscurity.pdf|archivedate=December 18, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Canton bulldogs 1923.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Canton Bulldogs in 1923, NFL champions.]]\nIn the APFA, the Bulldogs found the competition somewhat tougher than expected. Canton had a respectable 9\u20135\u20134 record over the next two seasons. The APFA became the [[National Football League]] in 1922 and Hay hired [[Guy Chamberlin]] as Canton's [[player-coach]]. Chamberlin rebuilt the Bulldogs into a championship team. He kept just five players from the 1921 squad. As a player Chamberlin led his team past the [[Chicago Cardinals]] in 1922 by blocking a punt that set up a [[touchdown]], and running back two [[interception]]s for touchdowns to beat the Cards' 20\u20133.<ref>{{cite news|title=Birth and Rebirth |work=Pro Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Birth_And_Rebirth.pdf |accessdate=February 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218173538/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Birth_And_Rebirth.pdf |archivedate=December 18, 2010 }}</ref> The Bulldogs went on to win back-to-back NFL championships in 1922 and 1923.\n\nHowever, Canton suffered several setbacks in 1923. First Hay announced that he was stepping down as the team's manager. His asking price for the team was $1,500, which was decided to be about $500 more than the 1922 champions were worth. Things were still up in the air when Hay and Chamberlin left for Chicago to represent the Bulldogs at the league's summer meeting. When Ralph Hay returned to Canton, he sold the Bulldogs on a group of local businessmen who formed the Canton Athletic Company to run the team. Chamberlin stayed on as coach, assuring the team of success on the field. Success at the gate was not nearly so likely.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ditto|work=Pro Football Researchers Association|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Ditto.pdf|accessdate=February 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226105821/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Ditto.pdf|archivedate=February 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Cleveland Bulldogs ===\nAs the payroll for Canton players became too expensive, the team lost about $13,000 in 1923 and the Canton Athletic Company sold the franchise in August for $2,500 to Cleveland promoter [[Samuel Deutsch]], owner of the NFL's [[Cleveland Bulldogs|Cleveland Indians]].<ref name=\"Hello\">{{cite news|title=Goodbye, Bulldogs, Hello |work=Pro Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Goodbye_Bulldogs_Hello.pdf |accessdate=February 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218173751/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Goodbye_Bulldogs_Hello.pdf |archivedate=December 18, 2010 }}</ref> He added seven players from Canton, renamed his team the [[Cleveland Bulldogs]], and they won the 1924 NFL championship.<ref name=\"Ohio History\"/> Chamberlin also served as a player-coach of the Cleveland Bulldogs.

First, the NFL was organized in a Canton automobile showroom on September 17, 1920. Secondly, the Canton Bulldogs were one of the early powers of pro football both before and after 1920. An NFL charter member, the Bulldogs became the new league\u2019s first two-time champions with undefeated seasons in 1922 and 1923. Finally Jim Thorpe, the first big-name athlete to play pro football, began his pro tenure with the 1915 Canton Bulldogs.\n\nIn late 1959, the citizens of Canton responded enthusiastically to a Canton Repository editorial that pointed out why a Hall of Fame should be located in their city. The city's foundations and individuals banded together to first win site designation from the NFL and then raise $378,026 to actually build a hall of fame on wooded parkland donated by the city. Ground-breaking was held in August, 1962, and the Hall was opened on September 7, 1963.<ref>Smith (1984), p. 1</ref>\n\n== Pro Football Hall of Famers ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:maroon; color:white;\"|Canton Bulldogs Hall of Famers\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:maroon; color:white;\"|Players\n|-\n!
