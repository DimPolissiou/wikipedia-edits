This led to people referring to the settlement as \"Fenn's Mill\" which became the name associated with the post office there. Some early documents pluralized \"Mill\" to render \"Fenn's Mills.\" The first road through what was to be Fennville was built by Harrison Hutchins and James McCormick in 1837.\n\nA fire (possibly related to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] or [[Great Michigan Fire]]) destroyed the village in October 1871. About that time, the paperwork (timetables and such) for the recently completed [[Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad]] arrived which identified the community's station as \"Fennville.\" This was thought by some at the time (including Hutchins) to have been the result of clerical error. However, Fenn himself recorded that the change in name had been suggested by and mutually agreed upon among certain leaders of the community in conjunction with the establishment of the new railroad station.

This led to people referring to the settlement as \"Fenn's Mill\" which became the name associated with the post office there. Some early documents pluralized \"Mill\" to render \"Fenn's Mills.\" The first road through what was to be Fennville was built by Harrison Hutchins and James McCormick in 1837.\n\nA fire (possibly related to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] or [[Great Michigan Fire]]) destroyed the village in October 1871. About that time, the paperwork (timetables and such) for the recently completed [[Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad]] arrived which identified the community's station as \"Fennville.\" This was thought by some at the time (including Hutchins) to have been the result of clerical error. However, Fenn himself recorded that the change in name had been suggested by and mutually agreed upon among certain leaders of the community in conjunction with the establishment of the new railroad station. The post office name was then changed to \"Fennville\" to match the station's name. The community was officially incorporated as the village of Fennville on February 20, 1889.\n\nA United States atlas from 1895 indicates the town name was in some cases broken into two words, as in \"Fenn Ville.\" Yet another documented variation was \"Fennsville\" as found in a plat book from 1873.

She said, \"I lived in a small second-floor apartment at the corner, and I could look first on one side and then the other. There was my material.\"<ref name=nytobit />\n\nBy 1941, Brooks was taking part in poetry workshops. A particularly influential one was organized by [[Inez Cunningham Stark]], an affluent white woman with a strong literary background. Stark offered writing workshops at the new [[South Side Community Art Center]], which Brooks attended.<ref name=Kent /> It was here she gained momentum in finding her voice and a deeper knowledge of the techniques of her predecessors. Renowned poet [[Langston Hughes]] stopped by the workshop and heard her read \"The Ballad of Pearl May Lee.\"<ref name=Kent /> In 1944, she achieved a goal she had been pursuing through continued unsolicited submissions since she was 14 years old: two of her poems were published in ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine's November issue. In the autobiographical information she provided to the magazine, she described her occupation as a \"housewife\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Share, Don |title=Introduction: June 2017, Gwendolyn Brooks speaks to us more vividly than ever. |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/articles/detail/141967|publisher=Poetry|edition=June 2017}}</ref>\n\nBrooks' published her first book of poetry, ''A Street in Bronzeville'' (1945), with [[Harper & Brothers]], after a strong show of support to the publisher from author [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright.]] He said to the editors who solicited his opinion on Brooks' work:\n\n<blockquote>There is no self-pity here, not a striving for effects.

Brooks later said it was a glowing review by [[Paul Engle]] in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that \"initiated My Reputation.\"<ref name=Kent /> Engle stated that Brooks' poems were no more \"Negro poetry\" than [[Robert Frost|Robert Frost's]] work was \"white poetry\". Brooks received her first [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1946 and was included as one of the \"Ten Young Women of the Year\" in ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' magazine.<ref name=Miller/>\n\nBrooks' second book of poetry, ''[[Annie Allen]]'' (1949), focused on the life and experiences of a young Black girl growing into womanhood in the [[Bronzeville, Chicago|Bronzeville]] neighborhood of Chicago. The book was awarded the 1950 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry, and was also awarded [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'']] magazine's Eunice Tietjens Prize.<ref name=Watkins2/>\n\nIn 1953, Brooks published her first and only narrative book, a novella titled ''[[Maud Martha]],'' which in a series of 34 vignettes follows the life of a black woman named Maud Martha Brown as she moves about life from childhood to adulthood. It tells the story of \"a woman with doubts about herself and where and how she fits into the world. Maud's concern is not so much that she is inferior but that she is perceived as being ugly,\" states author Harry B. Shaw in his book ''Gwendolyn Brooks.''<ref name=\"PF\">{{cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/gwendolyn-brooks |title=Gwendolyn Brooks |publisher=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> Maud suffers prejudice and discrimination not only from white individuals but also from black individuals who have lighter skin tones than hers, something that is a direct reference to Brooks' personal experience. Eventually, Maud stands up for herself by turning her back on a patronizing and racist store clerk. \"The book is ... about the triumph of the lowly,\" Shaw comments.<ref name=\"PF\"/> In contrast, literary scholar [[Mary Helen Washington]] emphasizes Brooks's critique of racism and sexism, calling ''Maud Martha'' \"a novel about bitterness, rage, self-hatred, and the silence that results from suppressed anger.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Invented Lives: Narratives of Black Women 1860-1960|last=Washington|first=Mary Helen|publisher=Virago|year=1989|isbn=|location=London|pages=387}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, the year of Langston Hughes's death, Brooks attended the Second Black Writers' Conference at [[Nashville]]'s [[Fisk University]]. Here, according to one version of events, she met activists and artists such as [[Imamu Amiri Baraka]], [[Don L. Lee]] and others who exposed her to new black cultural nationalism. Recent studies argue that she had been involved in leftist politics in Chicago for many years and, under the pressures of McCarthyism, adopted a black nationalist posture as a means of distancing herself from her prior political connections.<ref>See Mary Helen Washington, ''The Other Blacklist'', Columbia University Press, 2014, chapter 4, \"When Gwendolyn Brooks Wore Red\".</ref>  Brooks's experience at the conference inspired many of her subsequent literary activities. She taught creative writing to some of Chicago's [[Blackstone Rangers]], otherwise a violent criminal gang. In 1968, she published one of her most famous works, ''In the Mecca'', a long poem about a mother's search for her lost child in a Chicago apartment building.

Maud's concern is not so much that she is inferior but that she is perceived as being ugly,\" states author Harry B. Shaw in his book ''Gwendolyn Brooks.''<ref name=\"PF\">{{cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/gwendolyn-brooks |title=Gwendolyn Brooks |publisher=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> Maud suffers prejudice and discrimination not only from white individuals but also from black individuals who have lighter skin tones than hers, something that is a direct reference to Brooks' personal experience. Eventually, Maud stands up for herself by turning her back on a patronizing and racist store clerk. \"The book is ... about the triumph of the lowly,\" Shaw comments.<ref name=\"PF\"/> In contrast, literary scholar [[Mary Helen Washington]] emphasizes Brooks's critique of racism and sexism, calling ''Maud Martha'' \"a novel about bitterness, rage, self-hatred, and the silence that results from suppressed anger.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Invented Lives: Narratives of Black Women 1860-1960|last=Washington|first=Mary Helen|publisher=Virago|year=1989|isbn=|location=London|pages=387}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, the year of Langston Hughes's death, Brooks attended the Second Black Writers' Conference at [[Nashville]]'s [[Fisk University]]. Here, according to one version of events, she met activists and artists such as [[Imamu Amiri Baraka]], [[Don L. Lee]] and others who exposed her to new black cultural nationalism. Recent studies argue that she had been involved in leftist politics in Chicago for many years and, under the pressures of McCarthyism, adopted a black nationalist posture as a means of distancing herself from her prior political connections.<ref>See Mary Helen Washington, ''The Other Blacklist'', Columbia University Press, 2014, chapter 4, \"When Gwendolyn Brooks Wore Red\".</ref>  Brooks's experience at the conference inspired many of her subsequent literary activities. She taught creative writing to some of Chicago's [[Blackstone Rangers]], otherwise a violent criminal gang. In 1968, she published one of her most famous works, ''In the Mecca'', a long poem about a mother's search for her lost child in a Chicago apartment building. The poem was nominated for the [[National Book Award]] for poetry.<ref name=Miller>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2009 |title=Brooks, Gwendolyn |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African American History: 1896 to the Present |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |last=Miller |first=Jason |editor-last=Finkleman  |editor-first=Paul |volume=1 |page=288}}</ref>\n\nHer autobiographical ''Report From Part One'', including reminiscences, interviews, photographs and vignettes, came out in 1972, and ''Report From Part Two'' was published in 1995, when she was almost 80.<ref name=Busby />\n\n=== Teaching===\nBrooks said her first teaching experience was at the [[University of Chicago]] when she was invited by author Frank London Brown to teach a course in American literature.
