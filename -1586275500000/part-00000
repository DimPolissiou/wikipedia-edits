It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref>\n\nRupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that Rupert's attacking Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester offered Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur. On 7 August Charles was persuaded by communications with the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], that the city would be surrendered quickly and without bloodshed if the King made a show of force. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201357</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nOn 10 August, the Royalist army arrived at Gloucester and promptly demanded that Colonel [[Edward Massey]] surrender. Massey refused and Royalist forces began digging in and setting up artillery batteries around the south and east gates of the city and severed or diverted water pipes. The defenders burned houses and other obstacles outside the city walls. The bombardment of the city began.\n\nHowever, over the next days, the defenders made several sallies from the gates, attacking and disabling Royalist artillery, taking prisoners and tools. Breaches in the wall were filled with cannon baskets and wool sacks. The Royalists made attempts to drain the city moat and fill it in at places.\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

Part of the reason for this sudden reassignment appears to have arisen from the rise of \"[[Averroism]]\" or \"radical [[Aristotelianism]]\" in the universities. In response to these perceived errors, Thomas wrote two works, one of them being ''De unitate intellectus, contra Averroistas'' (''On the Unity of Intellect, against the Averroists'') in which he reprimands Averroism as incompatible with Christian doctrine.{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=10\u201311}} During his second regency, he finished the second part of the ''Summa'' and wrote ''De virtutibus'' and ''De aeternitate mundi, contra murmurantes'' (''On the Eternity of the World, against Grumblers''),{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=5}} the latter of which dealt with controversial Averroist and Aristotelian ''beginninglessness'' of the world.{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nDisputes with some important [[Franciscans]] conspired to make his second regency much more difficult and troubled than the first. A year before Thomas re-assumed the regency at the 1266\u201367 Paris disputations, Franciscan master William of Baglione accused Thomas of encouraging Averroists, most likely counting him as one of the \"blind leaders of the blind\". [[Eleonore Stump]] says, \"It has also been persuasively argued that Aquinas's ''De aeternitate mundi'' was directed in particular against his Franciscan colleague in theology, [[John Pecham]].\"{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nIn reality, Thomas was deeply disturbed by the spread of Averroism and was angered when he discovered [[Siger of Brabant]] teaching Averroistic interpretations of Aristotle to Parisian students.<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Reader| pages= 9\u201311}}</ref> On 10 December 1270, the Bishop of Paris, [[\u00c9tienne Tempier]], issued an edict condemning thirteen Aristotelian and Averroistic propositions as heretical and excommunicating anyone who continued to support them.<ref>McInerney, ''Against the Averroists'', p. 10.</ref> Many in the ecclesiastical community, the so-called Augustinians, were fearful that this introduction of Aristotelianism and the more extreme Averroism might somehow contaminate the purity of the Christian faith. In what appears to be an attempt to counteract the growing fear of Aristotelian thought, Thomas conducted a series of disputations between 1270 and 1272: ''De virtutibus in communi'' (''On Virtues in General''), ''De virtutibus cardinalibus'' (''On Cardinal Virtues''), ''De spe'' (''On Hope'').<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Reader| page= 11}}</ref>\n\n===Final days and \"straw\" (1272\u20131274)===\n[[File:Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Icon of the crucifixion speaking to Thomas Aquinas is depicted on this stained glass window in [[Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio)]]]]\n\nIn 1272 Thomas took leave from the University of Paris when the Dominicans from his home province called upon him to establish a ''studium generale'' wherever he liked and staff it as he pleased.

Much of his work bears upon philosophical topics, and in this sense may be characterized as philosophical. Thomas's philosophical thought has exerted enormous influence on subsequent Christian theology, especially that of the Catholic Church, extending to Western philosophy in general.

Thomas also describes the virtues as imperfect (incomplete) and perfect (complete) virtues. A perfect virtue is any virtue with charity, charity completes a cardinal virtue. A non-Christian can display courage, but it would be courage with temperance. A Christian would display courage with charity. These are somewhat supernatural and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God:\n\n{{quote|Now the object of the theological virtues is God Himself, Who is the last end of all, as surpassing the knowledge of our reason.

Moreover, according to Thomas, [[oligarchy]] degenerates more easily into [[tyranny]] than monarchy. To prevent a king from becoming a tyrant, his political powers must be curbed. Unless an agreement of all persons involved can be reached, a tyrant must be tolerated, as otherwise the political situation could deteriorate into [[anarchy]], which would be even worse than tyranny.\n\nAccording to Thomas, monarchs are God's representatives in their territories, but the Church, represented by the popes, is above the kings in matters of doctrine and morality. As a consequence, worldly rulers are obliged to adapt their laws to the Catholic Church's doctrines and determinations.\n\nFollowing Aristotle's concept of [[slavery]], Thomas justifies this institution on the grounds of [[natural law]].<ref>Heinz-Dietrich Wendland (1962): ''Sklaverei und Christentum''. In: ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Third Edition, T\u00fcbingen (Germany), Vol. VI, col. 103</ref> However, Thomas also distinguished between 'natural slavery', which is for the benefit of both master and slave, and 'servile slavery', which removes all autonomy from the slave and is, according to Thomas, worse than death.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ldysinger.stjohnsem.edu/@texts2/1271_aquinas/08_aq_slavery-ST3.htm |title=Aquinas on Slavery |website= stjohnsem.edu |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===Psychology===\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2011}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=September 2013}}\n{{Expert needed|Philosophy|section|talk=\"Psychology|reason=statements are not attributed or contextualised|date=September 2013}}\n}}\n\nThomas Aquinas maintains that a human is a single material substance. He understands the soul as the form of the body, which makes a human being the composite of the two. Thus, only living, form-matter composites can truly be called human; dead bodies are \"human\" only analogously. One actually existing substance comes from body and soul. A human is a single material substance, but still should be understood as having an immaterial soul, which continues after bodily death.\n\nIn his ''Summa theologiae'' Thomas clearly states his position on the nature of the soul; defining it as \"the first principle of life\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |year=1920 |edition=Second and Revised |translator-last=The Fathers of the English Dominican Province |chapter=Question 75, Article 1}}</ref> The soul is not corporeal, or a body; it is the act of a body. Because the intellect is incorporeal, it does not use the bodily organs, as \"the operation of anything follows the mode of its being.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |year=1920 |edition=Second and Revised |translator-last=The Fathers of the English Dominican Province |chapter=Question 75, Article 3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luis mu\u00f1oz-santo tom\u00e1s de aquino.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Thomas Aquinas by Luis Mu\u00f1oz Lafuente]] \nAccording to Thomas the soul is not matter, not even incorporeal or spiritual matter. If it were, it would not be able to understand universals, which are immaterial. A receiver receives things according to the receiver's own nature, so for soul (receiver) to understand (receive) universals, it must have the same nature as universals. Yet, any substance that understands universals may not be a matter-form composite. So, humans have rational souls, which are abstract forms independent of the body. But a human being is one existing, single material substance that comes from body and soul: that is what Thomas means when he writes that \"something one in nature can be formed from an intellectual substance and a body\", and \"a thing one in nature does not result from two permanent entities unless one has the character of substantial form and the other of matter.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Contra Gentiles |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=U. of Notre Dame Press |year=1975 |location=Notre Dame, Ind. |translator-last=Anton C. Pegis |chapter=5 volumes. |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe soul is a \"[[substantial form]]\"; it is a part of a substance, but it is not a substance by itself. Nevertheless, the soul exists separately from the body, and continues, after death, in many of the capacities we think of as human. Substantial form is what makes a thing a member of the species to which it belongs, and substantial form is also the structure or configuration that provides the object with the abilities that make the object what it is. For humans, those abilities are those of the rational animal.\n\nThese distinctions can be better understood in the light of Thomas's understanding of matter and form, a [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] (\"matter/form\") theory derived from [[Aristotle]]. In any given substance, matter and form are necessarily united, and each is a necessary aspect of that substance. However, they are conceptually separable. Matter represents what is changeable about the substance\u2014what is potentially something else. For example, bronze matter is potentially a statue, or also potentially a cymbal. Matter must be understood as the matter ''of'' something. In contrast, form is what determines some particular chunk of matter to be a specific substance and no other. When Thomas says that the human body is only partly composed of matter, he means the material body is only potentially a human being. The soul is what actualizes that potential into an existing human being. Consequently, the fact that a human body is live human tissue entails that a human soul is wholly present in each part of the human.\n\n===Economics===\nAquinas addressed most economic questions within the framework of justice, which he contended was the highest of virtues. He says that justice is \"a habit whereby man renders to each his due by a constant and perpetual will.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q58, A1}}</ref> He argued that this concept of justice has its roots in natural law. Joseph Schumpeter, in his ''History of Economic Analysis'', concluded that \"All the economic questions put together matters less to him than did the smallest point of theological or philosophical doctrine, and it is only where economic phenomena raise questions of moral theology that he touches upon them at all.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of Economic Analysis |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1954 |location=New York |pages=90}}</ref>\n\nAquinas was careful to distinguish the [[Just price|just]], or natural, price of a good from that price which manipulates another party. He determines the just price from a number of things. First, the just price must be relative to the worth of the good. Aquinas holds that the price of a good measures its quality: \"the quality of a thing that comes into human use is measured by the price given for it.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q77, A1}}</ref> He goes on to say that the price of a good, measured by its worth, is determined by its usefulness to man. This worth is subjective because each good has a different level of usefulness to every man. Aquinas argues, then, that the price should reflect the current value of a good according to its usefulness to man. He continues: \"Gold and silver are costly not only on account of the usefulness of the vessels and other like things made from them, but also on account of the excellence and purity of their substance.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q77, A2}}</ref>\n\nAquinas also wrote extensively on [[usury]], that is, the lending of money with interest. He condemned its practice: \"to take usury for money lent is unjust in itself, because this is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently leads to inequality which is contrary to justice.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q78, A1}}</ref> Money, and other similar goods, are consumed only when they are used. Charging a premium for money lent is a charge for ''more'' than the use of the good. Thus, Aquinas concluded that the lender is charging for something not his own, in other words, not rendering to each his due.\n\n==Theology==\n{{See also|Works by Thomas Aquinas}}\n[[File:Thomas von Aquin 17th century sculpture.jpeg|thumb|17th-century sculpture of Thomas Aquinas]]\n\nThomas Aquinas viewed [[theology]], or the ''[[sacred]] [[doctrine]]'', as a science,<ref name=Stanford/> the raw material data of which consists of written [[Sacred Tradition|scripture]] and the tradition of the Catholic Church. These sources of data were produced by the self-revelation of God to individuals and groups of people throughout history. Faith and reason, while distinct but related, are the two primary tools for processing the data of theology. Thomas believed both were necessary\u2014or, rather, that the ''confluence'' of both was necessary\u2014for one to obtain true knowledge of God. Thomas blended Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine by suggesting that rational thinking and the study of nature, like revelation, were valid ways to understand truths pertaining to God. According to Thomas, God reveals himself through nature, so to study nature is to study God. The ultimate goals of theology, in Thomas's mind, are to use reason to grasp the truth about God and to experience salvation through that truth. The central thought is [[Gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit]]. [[Divine grace|Grace]] does not destroy nature, but perfects it.\n\n===Revelation===\nThomas believed that truth is known through reason, rationality ([[natural revelation]]) and faith ([[supernatural revelation]]). ''Supernatural'' revelation has its origin in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and is made available through the teaching of the prophets, summed up in Holy Scripture, and transmitted by the [[Magisterium]], the sum of which is called \"Tradition\". ''Natural'' revelation is the truth available to all people through their human nature and powers of reason. For example, he felt this applied to rational ways to know the existence of God.\n\nThough one may deduce the existence of God and his Attributes (Unity, Truth, Goodness, Power, Knowledge) through reason, certain specifics may be known only through the special revelation of God through [[Jesus Christ]]. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], and charity are revealed in the teachings of the Church and the [[Scripture]]s and may not otherwise be deduced.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion |last=Hankey |first=Wayne |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-78295-1 |edition=Second |location=CSU East Bay |pages=134\u201335}}</ref>\n\n====Preserving nature within grace====\nRevealed knowledge does not negate the truth and the completeness of human science as human, it further establishes them. First, it grants that the same things can be treated from two different perspectives without one canceling the other; thus there can be two sciences of God. Second, it provides the basis for the two sciences: one functions through the power of the light of natural reason, the other through the light of divine revelation. Moreover, they can, at least to some extent, keep out of each other's way because they differ \"according to genus\". Sacred doctrine is a fundamentally different kind of thing from theology, which is part of philosophy (ST I. 1.1 ad 2).\n\nFaith and reason complement rather than contradict each other, each giving different views of the same truth.\n\n===Creation===\n[[File:Tommaso - Super libros de generatione et corruptione - 4733257 00007.tif|thumb|''Super libros de generatione et corruptione'']]\n\nAs a Catholic Thomas believed that God is the \"maker of heaven and earth, of all that is visible and invisible.\" Like Aristotle, Thomas posited that life could form from non-living material or plant life, a theory of ongoing [[abiogenesis]] known as [[spontaneous generation]]:\n\n{{quote|Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another, it was not incompatible with the first formation of things, that from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should be generated.

Thomas reasoned that these species were generated through [[mutation]]s in animal [[sperm]], and argued that they were not unintended by [[nature]]; rather, such species were simply not intended for perpetual existence. That discussion is found in his commentary on ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Physics]]'':\n\n{{quote|The same thing is true of those substances Empedocles said were produced at the beginning of the world, such as the 'ox-progeny', i.e., half ox and half man. For if such things were not able to arrive at some end and final state of nature so that they would be preserved in existence, this was not because nature did not intend this [a final state], but because they were not capable of being preserved. For they were not generated according to nature, but by the corruption of some natural principle, as it now also happens that some monstrous offspring are generated because of the corruption of seed.<ref>Saint Thomas Aquinas, [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Physics2.htm#14 Physica], ''Book 2, Lecture 14'', Fathers of the English Dominican Province</ref>}}\n\n===Just war===\n{{See also|Just War}}\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] agreed strongly with the conventional wisdom of his time, that Christians should be pacifists philosophically, but that they should use defense as a means of preserving peace in the long run. For example, he routinely argued that pacifism did not prevent the defence of innocents. In essence, the pursuit of peace might require fighting to preserve it in the long-term.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |title=St. Augustine of Hippo |website=Crusades-Encyclopedia |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |archive-date=28 July 2012}}</ref> Such a war must not be preemptive, but defensive, to restore peace.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jknirp.com/mattox.htm |title=Saint Augustine and the Theory of Just War| website= jknirp.com| publisher= | date= | access-date= }}</ref>\n\nClearly, some special characteristics sets apart \"war\" from \"schism\", \"brawling\", and \"sedition\". While it would be contradictory to speak of a \"just schism\", a \"just brawling\" or a \"just sedition\" (the three terms denote sin and sin only) \"war\" alone permits sub classification into good and bad kinds.

Given that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind, the adherents of the School reasoned that it ought to be resorted to only when it was necessary to prevent an even ''greater'' evil. A diplomatic agreement is preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started. <!-- the point being that obviously the weaker party would be happier with a diplomatic solution, while the stronger might need a bit more encouragement to accept a diplomatic solution --> Examples of \"[[The Just War tradition|just war]]\" are:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* In self-defense, as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success. If failure is a foregone conclusion, then it is just a wasteful spilling of blood.\n* Preventive war against a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who is about to attack.\n* War to punish a guilty enemy.\n\nA war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* The response must be commensurate with the evil; more violence than is strictly necessary would be unjust.\n* Governing authorities ''declare'' war, but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war. If the ''people'' oppose a war, then it is illegitimate. The people have a right to depose a government that is waging, or is about to wage, an unjust war.\n* Once war has begun, there remain moral limits to action. For example, one may not attack innocents or kill hostages.\n* The belligerents must exhaust all options for dialogue and negotiation before undertaking a war; war is legitimate only as a last resort.\n\nUnder this doctrine, expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert [[infidel]]s or [[paganism|pagans]], and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.\n\n===Nature of God===\nThomas believed that the [[existence of God]] is self-evident in itself, but not to us. \"Therefore I say that this proposition, \"God exists\", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject{{nbsp}}... Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature\u2014namely, by effects.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article1 |author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= | chapter= The Existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |via= newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\nThomas believed that the existence of God can be demonstrated. Briefly in the ''Summa theologiae'' and more extensively in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).\n\n{{Hatnote|For detailed analysis of the five proofs, see [[Existence of God]]}}\n{{Hatnote|For the original text of the five proofs, see [[Quinque viae]]}}\n\n# Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since, as Thomas believed, there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a [[Unmoved mover|First Mover]] not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.\n# \n# Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a [[Prima causa|First Cause]], called God.\n# \n# Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.\n# \n# Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. {{H:title|Note that Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself.|This then, we call God}}\n# \n# Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws. Anything without awareness tends to a goal under the guidance of one who is aware. {{H:title|Note that even when we guide objects, in Thomas's view the source of all our knowledge comes from God as well.|This we call God}}<ref>Summa of Theology I, q.2, The Five Ways Philosophers Have Proven God's Existence</ref>\n\nConcerning the nature of God, Thomas felt the best approach, commonly called the ''[[negative theology|via negativa]]'', is to consider what God is not. This led him to propose five statements about the divine qualities:\n# [[divine simplicity|God is simple]], without composition of parts, such as body and soul, or matter and form.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|pp=74\u201377}}\n# God is perfect, lacking nothing. That is, God is distinguished from other beings on account of God's complete actuality.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|pp=86\u201387}} Thomas defined God as the '''Ipse [http://aquinasactusessendi.blogspot.com Actus Essendi] subsistens'',' subsisting act of being.<ref>See ''[[Actus Essendi]]''.

Natural law is an instance or instantiation of eternal law. Because natural law is what human beings determine according to their own nature (as rational beings), disobeying reason is disobeying natural law and eternal law. Thus eternal law is logically prior to reception of either \"natural law\" (that determined by reason) or \"divine law\" (that found in the Old and New Testaments). In other words, God's will extends to both reason and revelation. Sin is abrogating either one's own reason, on the one hand, or revelation on the other, and is synonymous with \"evil\" ([[privation]] of good, or ''[[privatio boni]]''<ref>{{cite book| chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2075.htm#article1 | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= II-I | chapter= Question 75, Article 1| quote= For evil is the absence of the good, which is natural and due to a thing.}}</ref>). Thomas, like all Scholastics, generally argued that the findings of reason and data of revelation cannot conflict, so both are a guide to God's will for human beings.\n\n===Nature of the Trinity===\nThomas argued that God, while perfectly united, also is perfectly described by [[Trinity|Three Interrelated Persons]]. These three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) are constituted by their relations within the essence of God. Thomas wrote that the term \"Trinity\" \"does not mean the relations themselves of the Persons, but rather the number of persons related to each other; and hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to another.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1031.htm#article3 | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= | chapter= The unity or plurality in God (Prima Pars, Q. 31) |via= newadvent.org}}</ref> The Father generates the Son (or the Word) by the relation of self-awareness. This eternal generation then produces an eternal Spirit \"who enjoys the divine nature as the Love of God, the Love of the Father for the Word.\"\n\nThis Trinity exists independently from the world. It transcends the created world, but the Trinity also decided to give grace to human beings. This takes place through the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the Word in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] and through the indwelling of the [[Holy Spirit]] within those who have experienced [[salvation]] by God; according to Aidan Nichols.{{sfn|Nichols|2002|pp=173\u201374}}\n\n===''Prima causa'' (first cause)===\nThomas's five proofs for the existence of God take some of Aristotle's assertions concerning principles of being.

The purpose of Christ's Incarnation was to restore human nature by removing ''the contamination of sin'', which humans cannot do by themselves. \"Divine Wisdom judged it fitting that God should become man, so that thus one and the same person would be able both to restore man and to offer satisfaction.\"<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 228\u201329.</ref> Thomas argued in favor of the [[atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view of atonement]]; that is, that [[Christian views of Jesus|Jesus Christ]] [[death of Jesus|died]] \"to satisfy for the whole human race, which was sentenced to die on account of sin.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4050.htm#article1 |author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= III | chapter= Question 50, Article 1 |via= newadvent.org |access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Thomas Aquinas'' by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]], 1650]]\nThomas argued against several specific contemporary and historical theologians who held differing views about Christ. In response to [[Photinus]], Thomas stated that Jesus was truly divine and not simply a human being. Against [[Nestorius]], who suggested that Son of God was merely conjoined to the man Christ, Thomas argued that the fullness of God was an integral part of Christ's existence. However, countering [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinaris]]' views, Thomas held that Christ had a truly human (rational) [[soul]], as well. This produced a duality of natures in Christ. Thomas argued against [[Eutyches]] that this duality persisted after the Incarnation. Thomas stated that these two natures existed simultaneously yet distinguishably in one real human body, unlike the teachings of [[Manichaeus]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]].<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 231\u201339.</ref>\n\nWith respect to [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s assertion that Christ, \"though he was in the form of God{{nbsp}}... emptied himself\" ([[Philippians]] 2:6\u20137) in becoming human, Thomas offered an articulation of divine [[kenosis]] that has informed much subsequent Catholic [[Christology]]. Following the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], as well as the assertions of Scripture, Thomas held the doctrine of divine immutability.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum01.htm |title=First Council of Nicaea \u2013 325 AD |date=20 May 325| via= papalencyclicals.net}}</ref><ref>Augustine, Sermo VII, 7.</ref><ref>For instance, Malachi 3:6 and James 1:17</ref> Hence, in becoming human, there could be no change in the divine person of Christ. For Thomas, \"the mystery of Incarnation was not completed through God being changed in any way from the state in which He had been from eternity, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new way, or rather through having united it to Himself.\"<ref>ST III.1.1.</ref> Similarly, Thomas explained that Christ \"emptied Himself, not by putting off His divine nature, but by assuming a human nature.\"<ref name=\"dhspriory.org\">{{Cite web |url= http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/SSPhilippians.htm |title=Commentary on Saint Paul's Letter to the Philippians, available at \u00a72\u20132.}}</ref> For Thomas, \"the divine nature is sufficiently full, because every perfection of goodness is there. But human nature and the soul are not full, but capable of fulness, because it was made as a slate not written upon. Therefore, human nature is empty.\"<ref name=\"dhspriory.org\" /> Thus, when Paul indicates that Christ \"emptied himself\" this is to be understood in light of his assumption of a human nature.\n\nIn short \"Christ had a ''real body'' of the same nature of ours, a ''true rational soul'', and, together with these, ''perfect Deity''\". Thus, there is both unity (in his one ''[[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]'') and composition (in his two natures, human and Divine) in Christ.<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 241, 245\u201349. Emphasis is the author's.</ref>\n\n{{quote|I answer that, The Person or hypostasis of Christ may be viewed in two ways.

This goal is achieved through the [[beatific vision]], in which a person experiences perfect, unending happiness by seeing the essence of God. The vision occurs after death as a gift from God to those who in life experienced salvation and redemption through Christ.\n\nThe goal of union with God has implications for the individual's life on earth. Thomas stated that an individual's [[Free Will|will]] must be ordered toward right things, such as charity, peace, and [[Sacred|holiness]]. He saw this orientation as also the way to happiness. Indeed, Thomas ordered his treatment of the moral life around the idea of happiness. The relationship between will and goal is antecedent in nature \"because rectitude of the will consists in being duly ordered to the last end [that is, the beatific vision].\" Those who truly seek to understand and see God will necessarily love what God loves. Such love requires morality and bears fruit in everyday human choices.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|p=383}}\n\n===Treatment of heretics===\nThomas Aquinas belonged to the Dominican Order (formally ''[[Ordo Praedicatorum]]'', the Order of Preachers) who began as an order dedicated to the conversion of the [[Albigensians]] and other heterodox factions, at first by peaceful means; later the Albigensians were dealt with by means of the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. In the ''Summa theologiae'', he wrote: \n<blockquote>With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith that quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death.\n\nOn the part of the Church, however, there is mercy, which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but \"after the first and second admonition\", as [[Paul of Tarsus|the Apostle]] directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death.{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article3 |volume= II\u2013II| chapter= Question 11, Article 3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHeresy was a capital offense against the secular law of most European countries of the 13th century. Kings and emperors, even those at war with the papacy, listed heresy first among the crimes against the state. Kings claimed power from God according to the Christian faith. Often enough, especially in that age of papal claims to universal worldly power, the rulers' power was tangibly and visibly legitimated directly through coronation by the pope.\n\nSimple theft, forgery, fraud, and other such crimes were also capital offenses; Thomas's point seems to be that the gravity of this offense, which touches not only the material goods but also the spiritual goods of others, is at least the same as forgery. Thomas's suggestion specifically demands that heretics be handed to a \"secular tribunal\" rather than [[magisterium|magisterial]] authority. That Thomas specifically says that heretics \"deserve{{nbsp}}... death\" is related to his theology, according to which all sinners have no intrinsic right to life (\"For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:23&version=ASV |title=Romans 6:23, ASV | work= The Bible| via= biblegateway.com |access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>). Although the life of a heretic who repents should be spared, the former heretic should be executed if he relapses into heresy. Thomas elaborates on his opinion regarding heresy in the next article, when he says:<blockquote>In God's tribunal, those who return are always received, because God is a searcher of hearts, and knows those who return in sincerity. But the Church cannot imitate God in this, for she presumes that those who relapse after being once received, are not sincere in their return; hence she does not debar them from the way of salvation, but neither does she protect them from the sentence of death.\n\nFor this reason the Church not only admits to Penance those who return from heresy for the first time, but also safeguards their lives, and sometimes by dispensation, restores them to the ecclesiastical dignities which they may have had before, should their conversion appear to be sincere: we read of this as having frequently been done for the good of peace. But when they fall again, after having been received, this seems to prove them to be inconstant in faith, wherefore when they return again, they are admitted to Penance, but are not delivered from the pain of death.([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article4 ''Summa'', op. cit., art.4.])</blockquote>\n\nFor [[Jews]], Thomas argues for toleration of both their persons and their religious rites.<ref>Novak, Michael (December 1995), [http://www.firstthings.com/article/1995/12/003-aquinas-and-the-heretics \"Aquinas and the Heretics\"], ''First Things''.</ref>\n\n===Magic and its practitioners===\nRegarding magic, Aquinas wrote that:\n\n* only God can perform miracles, create and transform<ref>''[[Summa contra gentiles]]'' 102</ref>\n* angels and demons (\"spiritual substances\") may do wonderful things, but they are not miracles and merely use natural things as instruments<ref>''Summa contra gentiles'' 103</ref>\n* any efficacy of magicians does not come from the power of particular words, or celestial bodies, or special figures, or sympathetic magic, but by bidding (ibid.,105), \n* \"demons\" are intellective substances who were created good and have chosen to be bad, it is these who are bid.<ref>''Summa contra gentiles'' 106\u2013108</ref> \n* if there is some transformation that could not occur in nature it is either the demon working on human imagination or arranging a fake<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= I | chapter= Question 114, Article 4}}</ref>\n\nA mention of witchcraft appears in the ''Summa theologicae''<ref>{{cite book| title= Summa theologica Supplement| chapter= Question 38, Article 2 |quote= Whether a spell can be in impediment to marriage.}} Note this Supplement was written or compiled by others after Aquinas' death.</ref> and concludes that the Church does not treat temporary or permanent impotence attributed to a spell any differently to that of natural causes, as far as an impediment to marriage.\n\nUnder the ''[[canon Episcopi]]'', church doctrine held that witchcraft was not possible and any practitioners of sorcery were deluded and their acts an illusion.

Thomas, following Church doctrine, accepts that the soul continues to exist after the death of the body. Because he accepts that the soul is the form of the body, then he also must believe that the human being, like all material things, is form-matter composite. Substantial form (the human soul) configures prime matter (the physical body) and is the form by which a material composite belongs to that species it does; in the case of human beings, that species is rational animal.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=194}} So, a human being is a matter-form composite that is organized to be a rational animal. Matter cannot exist without being configured by form, but form can exist without matter\u2014which allows for the separation of soul from body. Thomas says that the soul shares in the material and spiritual worlds, and so has some features of matter and other, immaterial, features (such as access to universals). The human soul is different from other material and spiritual things; it is created by God, but also comes into existence only in the material body.\n\nHuman beings are material, but the human person can survive the death of the body through continued existence of the soul, which persists. The human soul straddles the spiritual and material worlds, and is both a configured subsistent form as well as a configurer of matter into that of a living, bodily human.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=200}} Because it is spiritual, the human soul does not depend on matter and may exist separately. Because the human being is a soul-matter composite, the body has a part in what it is to be human. Perfected human nature consists in the human dual nature, embodied and intellecting.\n\nResurrection appears to require dualism, which Thomas rejects. Yet Thomas believes the soul persists after the death and corruption of the body, and is capable of existence, separated from the body between the time of death and the resurrection. Thomas believes in a different sort of dualism, one guided by Christian scripture. Thomas knows that human beings are essentially physical, but physicality has a spirit capable of returning to God after life.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=192}} For Thomas, the rewards and punishment of the afterlife are not ''only'' spiritual. Because of this, resurrection is an important part of his philosophy on the soul. The human is fulfilled and complete in the body, so the hereafter must take place with souls enmattered in resurrected bodies. In addition to spiritual reward, humans can expect to enjoy material and physical blessings. Because Thomas's soul requires a body for its actions, during the afterlife, the soul will also be punished or rewarded in corporeal existence.\n\nThomas states clearly his stance on resurrection, and uses it to back up his philosophy of justice; that is, the promise of resurrection compensates Christians who suffered in this world through a heavenly union with the divine. He says, \"If there is no resurrection of the dead, it follows that there is no good for human beings other than in this life.\"{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=461, 473}} Resurrection provides the impetus for people on earth to give up pleasures in this life. Aquinas believes the human who prepared for the afterlife both morally and intellectually will be rewarded more greatly; however, all reward is through the grace of God. Thomas insists beatitude will be conferred according to merit, and will render the person better able to conceive the divine. Thomas accordingly believes punishment is directly related to earthly, living preparation and activity as well. Thomas's account of the soul focuses on epistemology and metaphysics, and because of this he believes it gives a clear account of the immaterial nature of the soul. Thomas conservatively guards Christian doctrine, and thus maintains physical and spiritual reward and punishment after death. By accepting the essentiality of both body and soul, he allows for a heaven and hell described in scripture and church dogma.\n\n==Modern influence==\n[[File:Saint Joseph's Catholic Church (Central City, Kentucky) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright|A stained glass window of Thomas Aquinas in St. Joseph's Catholic Church ([[Central City, Kentucky]])]]\n\nMany modern ethicists both within and outside the Catholic Church (notably [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]) have recently commented on the possible use of Thomas's [[virtue ethics]] as a way of avoiding [[utilitarianism]] or Kantian \"sense of duty\" (called [[deontology]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Through the work of twentieth-century philosophers such as [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]] (especially in her book ''Intention''), Thomas's [[principle of double effect]] specifically and his theory of intentional activity generally have been influential.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn recent years the cognitive neuroscientist [[Walter J. Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]] proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with [[neurodynamics]], in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' titled \"Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas\".\n\n[[Henry Adams]]'s ''[[Mont Saint Michel and Chartres]]'' ends with a culminating chapter on Thomas, in which Adams calls Thomas an \"artist\" and constructs an extensive analogy between the design of Thomas's \"Church Intellectual\" and that of the gothic cathedrals of that period. [[Erwin Panofsky]] later would echo these views in ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'' (1951).\n\nThomas's aesthetic theories, especially the concept of ''claritas'', deeply influenced the literary practice of modernist writer [[James Joyce]], who used to extol Thomas as being second only to Aristotle among Western philosophers. Joyce refers to Thomas's doctrines in ''Elementa philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae Aquinatis doctoris angelici'' (1898) of Girolamo Maria Mancini, professor of theology at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpYvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA570#v=onepage&q&f=false The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol V, Year 32, No. 378, June, 1899, p. 570] Accessed 3-7-2013</ref> For example, Mancini's ''Elementa'' is referred to in Joyce's ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00jame |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00jame/page/221 221] |title=A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man |last=Joyce |first= James |date=4 December 1992 |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |via=Internet Archive|isbn=9781853260063 }}</ref>\n\nThe influence of Thomas's aesthetics also can be found in the works of the Italian [[semiotics|semiotician]] [[Umberto Eco]], who wrote an essay on aesthetic ideas in Thomas (published in 1956 and republished in 1988 in a revised edition).{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Criticisms==\nTwentieth century philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] criticized Thomas's philosophy stating that,\n\n<blockquote>He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead. He is not engaged in an inquiry, the result of which it is impossible to know in advance. Before he begins to philosophize, he already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith. If he can find apparently rational arguments for some parts of the faith, so much the better; if he cannot, he need only fall back on revelation. The finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not philosophy, but special pleading. I cannot, therefore, feel that he deserves to be put on a level with the best philosophers either of Greece or of modern times.<ref>{{harv|Russell|1967|p=463}} ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', Ch. 34, \"St. Thomas Aquinas\", Allen & Unwin, London; Simon & Schuster, New York 1946, pp. 484\u2013.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis criticism is illustrated with the following example: According to Russell, Thomas advocates the indissolubility of marriage \"on the ground that the father is useful in the education of the children, (a) because he is more rational than the mother, (b) because, being stronger, he is better able to inflict physical punishment.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\">{{harv|Russell|1967|p=462}}</ref> Even though modern approaches to education do not support these views, \"No follower of Saint Thomas would, on that account, cease to believe in lifelong monogamy, because the real grounds of belief are not those which are alleged.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\" /> It may be countered that the treatment of matrimony in the ''Summa Theologica'' is in the Supplements volume, which was not written by Thomas.<ref>{{Cite book |url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica Supplementum Tertiae Partis |via= newadvent.org}}</ref> Moreover, as noted above,<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas#Condemnation of 1277]]</ref> Thomas's introduction of arguments and concepts from the theistic non-Christian [[Aristotle]] and Muslim [[Averroes]] was controversial within the Catholic Church of his day.\n\n===Response to Russell's criticism===\n\n[[Anthony Kenny]] suggests that Russell is failing to reflect on what philosophers, himself included, actually do:\n\n<blockquote>It is extraordinary that that accusation should be made by Russell, who in the book ''Principia Mathematica'' takes hundreds of pages to prove that two and two make four, which is something he had believed all his life.<ref>''Aquinas on Mind'', New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-04415-4}}, 11)</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of works by Thomas Aquinas}}\n\nThe first edition of Thomas's [[The Complete Works|opera omnia]], the so-called ''editio Piana'' (from [[Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who commissioned it), was produced in 1570 at the ''studium'' of the Roman convent at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8qt63uOg6IC&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=In This Light Which Gives Light: A History of the College of St. Albert the Great (1930\u20131980) |last=Renz |first=Christopher J. |date=4 September 2009 |publisher=Dominican School |via=Google Books|isbn=9781883734183 }}</ref>\n\nThe critical edition of Thomas's works is the ongoing edition commissioned by [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1882\u20131903), the so-called [[Leonine Edition]].

Part of the reason for this sudden reassignment appears to have arisen from the rise of \"[[Averroism]]\" or \"radical [[Aristotelianism]]\" in the universities. In response to these perceived errors, Thomas wrote two works, one of them being ''De unitate intellectus, contra Averroistas'' (''On the Unity of Intellect, against the Averroists'') in which he reprimands Averroism as incompatible with Christian doctrine.{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=10\u201311}} During his second regency, he finished the second part of the ''Summa'' and wrote ''De virtutibus'' and ''De aeternitate mundi, contra murmurantes'' (''On the Eternity of the World, against Grumblers''),{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=5}} the latter of which dealt with controversial Averroist and Aristotelian ''beginninglessness'' of the world.{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nDisputes with some important [[Franciscans]] conspired to make his second regency much more difficult and troubled than the first. A year before Thomas re-assumed the regency at the 1266\u201367 Paris disputations, Franciscan master William of Baglione accused Thomas of encouraging Averroists, most likely counting him as one of the \"blind leaders of the blind\". [[Eleonore Stump]] says, \"It has also been persuasively argued that Aquinas's ''De aeternitate mundi'' was directed in particular against his Franciscan colleague in theology, [[John Pecham]].\"{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nIn reality, Thomas was deeply disturbed by the spread of Averroism and was angered when he discovered [[Siger of Brabant]] teaching Averroistic interpretations of Aristotle to Parisian students.<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Reader| pages= 9\u201311}}</ref> On 10 December 1270, the Bishop of Paris, [[\u00c9tienne Tempier]], issued an edict condemning thirteen Aristotelian and Averroistic propositions as heretical and excommunicating anyone who continued to support them.<ref>McInerney, ''Against the Averroists'', p. 10.</ref> Many in the ecclesiastical community, the so-called Augustinians, were fearful that this introduction of Aristotelianism and the more extreme Averroism might somehow contaminate the purity of the Christian faith. In what appears to be an attempt to counteract the growing fear of Aristotelian thought, Thomas conducted a series of disputations between 1270 and 1272: ''De virtutibus in communi'' (''On Virtues in General''), ''De virtutibus cardinalibus'' (''On Cardinal Virtues''), ''De spe'' (''On Hope'').<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Reader| page= 11}}</ref>\n\n===Final days and \"straw\" (1272\u20131274)===\n[[File:Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Icon of the crucifixion speaking to Thomas Aquinas is depicted on this stained glass window in [[Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio)]]]]\n\nIn 1272 Thomas took leave from the University of Paris when the Dominicans from his home province called upon him to establish a ''studium generale'' wherever he liked and staff it as he pleased.

Much of his work bears upon philosophical topics, and in this sense may be characterized as philosophical. Thomas's philosophical thought has exerted enormous influence on subsequent Christian theology, especially that of the Catholic Church, extending to Western philosophy in general. Thomas stands as a vehicle and modifier of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. It is said that Thomas modified both Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism by way of heavy reliance on the [[Pseudo-Dionysius]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Commentaries on Aristotle===\nThomas Aquinas wrote several important commentaries on [[Aristotle]]'s works, including ''[[On the Soul]]'', ''On Interpretation'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.

Thomas also describes the virtues as imperfect (incomplete) and perfect (complete) virtues. A perfect virtue is any virtue with charity, charity completes a cardinal virtue. A non-Christian can display courage, but it would be courage with temperance. A Christian would display courage with charity. These are somewhat supernatural and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God:\n\n{{quote|Now the object of the theological virtues is God Himself, Who is the last end of all, as surpassing the knowledge of our reason.

Moreover, according to Thomas, [[oligarchy]] degenerates more easily into [[tyranny]] than monarchy. To prevent a king from becoming a tyrant, his political powers must be curbed. Unless an agreement of all persons involved can be reached, a tyrant must be tolerated, as otherwise the political situation could deteriorate into [[anarchy]], which would be even worse than tyranny.\n\nAccording to Thomas, monarchs are God's representatives in their territories, but the Church, represented by the popes, is above the kings in matters of doctrine and morality. As a consequence, worldly rulers are obliged to adapt their laws to the Catholic Church's doctrines and determinations.\n\nFollowing Aristotle's concept of [[slavery]], Thomas justifies this institution on the grounds of [[natural law]].<ref>Heinz-Dietrich Wendland (1962): ''Sklaverei und Christentum''. In: ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Third Edition, T\u00fcbingen (Germany), Vol. VI, col. 103</ref> However, Thomas also distinguished between 'natural slavery', which is for the benefit of both master and slave, and 'servile slavery', which removes all autonomy from the slave and is, according to Thomas, worse than death.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ldysinger.stjohnsem.edu/@texts2/1271_aquinas/08_aq_slavery-ST3.htm |title=Aquinas on Slavery |website= stjohnsem.edu |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===Psychology===\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2011}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=September 2013}}\n{{Expert needed|Philosophy|section|talk=\"Psychology|reason=statements are not attributed or contextualised|date=September 2013}}\n}}\n\nThomas Aquinas maintains that a human is a single material substance. He understands the soul as the form of the body, which makes a human being the composite of the two. Thus, only living, form-matter composites can truly be called human; dead bodies are \"human\" only analogously. One actually existing substance comes from body and soul. A human is a single material substance, but still should be understood as having an immaterial soul, which continues after bodily death.\n\nIn his ''Summa theologiae'' Thomas clearly states his position on the nature of the soul; defining it as \"the first principle of life\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |year=1920 |edition=Second and Revised |translator-last=The Fathers of the English Dominican Province |chapter=Question 75, Article 1}}</ref> The soul is not corporeal, or a body; it is the act of a body. Because the intellect is incorporeal, it does not use the bodily organs, as \"the operation of anything follows the mode of its being.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |year=1920 |edition=Second and Revised |translator-last=The Fathers of the English Dominican Province |chapter=Question 75, Article 3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luis mu\u00f1oz-santo tom\u00e1s de aquino.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Thomas Aquinas by Luis Mu\u00f1oz Lafuente]] \nAccording to Thomas the soul is not matter, not even incorporeal or spiritual matter. If it were, it would not be able to understand universals, which are immaterial. A receiver receives things according to the receiver's own nature, so for soul (receiver) to understand (receive) universals, it must have the same nature as universals. Yet, any substance that understands universals may not be a matter-form composite. So, humans have rational souls, which are abstract forms independent of the body. But a human being is one existing, single material substance that comes from body and soul: that is what Thomas means when he writes that \"something one in nature can be formed from an intellectual substance and a body\", and \"a thing one in nature does not result from two permanent entities unless one has the character of substantial form and the other of matter.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Contra Gentiles |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=U. of Notre Dame Press |year=1975 |location=Notre Dame, Ind. |translator-last=Anton C. Pegis |chapter=5 volumes. |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe soul is a \"[[substantial form]]\"; it is a part of a substance, but it is not a substance by itself. Nevertheless, the soul exists separately from the body, and continues, after death, in many of the capacities we think of as human. Substantial form is what makes a thing a member of the species to which it belongs, and substantial form is also the structure or configuration that provides the object with the abilities that make the object what it is. For humans, those abilities are those of the rational animal.\n\nThese distinctions can be better understood in the light of Thomas's understanding of matter and form, a [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] (\"matter/form\") theory derived from [[Aristotle]]. In any given substance, matter and form are necessarily united, and each is a necessary aspect of that substance. However, they are conceptually separable. Matter represents what is changeable about the substance\u2014what is potentially something else. For example, bronze matter is potentially a statue, or also potentially a cymbal. Matter must be understood as the matter ''of'' something. In contrast, form is what determines some particular chunk of matter to be a specific substance and no other. When Thomas says that the human body is only partly composed of matter, he means the material body is only potentially a human being. The soul is what actualizes that potential into an existing human being. Consequently, the fact that a human body is live human tissue entails that a human soul is wholly present in each part of the human.\n\n===Economics===\nAquinas addressed most economic questions within the framework of justice, which he contended was the highest of virtues. He says that justice is \"a habit whereby man renders to each his due by a constant and perpetual will.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q58, A1}}</ref> He argued that this concept of justice has its roots in natural law. Joseph Schumpeter, in his ''History of Economic Analysis'', concluded that \"All the economic questions put together matters less to him than did the smallest point of theological or philosophical doctrine, and it is only where economic phenomena raise questions of moral theology that he touches upon them at all.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of Economic Analysis |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1954 |location=New York |pages=90}}</ref>\n\nAquinas was careful to distinguish the [[Just price|just]], or natural, price of a good from that price which manipulates another party. He determines the just price from a number of things. First, the just price must be relative to the worth of the good. Aquinas holds that the price of a good measures its quality: \"the quality of a thing that comes into human use is measured by the price given for it.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q77, A1}}</ref> He goes on to say that the price of a good, measured by its worth, is determined by its usefulness to man. This worth is subjective because each good has a different level of usefulness to every man. Aquinas argues, then, that the price should reflect the current value of a good according to its usefulness to man. He continues: \"Gold and silver are costly not only on account of the usefulness of the vessels and other like things made from them, but also on account of the excellence and purity of their substance.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q77, A2}}</ref>\n\nAquinas also wrote extensively on [[usury]], that is, the lending of money with interest. He condemned its practice: \"to take usury for money lent is unjust in itself, because this is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently leads to inequality which is contrary to justice.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q78, A1}}</ref> Money, and other similar goods, are consumed only when they are used. Charging a premium for money lent is a charge for ''more'' than the use of the good. Thus, Aquinas concluded that the lender is charging for something not his own, in other words, not rendering to each his due.\n\n==Theology==\n{{See also|Works by Thomas Aquinas}}\n[[File:Thomas von Aquin 17th century sculpture.jpeg|thumb|17th-century sculpture of Thomas Aquinas]]\n\nThomas Aquinas viewed [[theology]], or the ''[[sacred]] [[doctrine]]'', as a science,<ref name=Stanford/> the raw material data of which consists of written [[Sacred Tradition|scripture]] and the tradition of the Catholic Church. These sources of data were produced by the self-revelation of God to individuals and groups of people throughout history. Faith and reason, while distinct but related, are the two primary tools for processing the data of theology. Thomas believed both were necessary\u2014or, rather, that the ''confluence'' of both was necessary\u2014for one to obtain true knowledge of God. Thomas blended Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine by suggesting that rational thinking and the study of nature, like revelation, were valid ways to understand truths pertaining to God. According to Thomas, God reveals himself through nature, so to study nature is to study God. The ultimate goals of theology, in Thomas's mind, are to use reason to grasp the truth about God and to experience salvation through that truth. The central thought is [[Gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit]]. [[Divine grace|Grace]] does not destroy nature, but perfects it.\n\n===Revelation===\nThomas believed that truth is known through reason, rationality ([[natural revelation]]) and faith ([[supernatural revelation]]). ''Supernatural'' revelation has its origin in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and is made available through the teaching of the prophets, summed up in Holy Scripture, and transmitted by the [[Magisterium]], the sum of which is called \"Tradition\". ''Natural'' revelation is the truth available to all people through their human nature and powers of reason. For example, he felt this applied to rational ways to know the existence of God.\n\nThough one may deduce the existence of God and his Attributes (Unity, Truth, Goodness, Power, Knowledge) through reason, certain specifics may be known only through the special revelation of God through [[Jesus Christ]]. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], and charity are revealed in the teachings of the Church and the [[Scripture]]s and may not otherwise be deduced.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion |last=Hankey |first=Wayne |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-78295-1 |edition=Second |location=CSU East Bay |pages=134\u201335}}</ref>\n\n====Preserving nature within grace====\nRevealed knowledge does not negate the truth and the completeness of human science as human, it further establishes them. First, it grants that the same things can be treated from two different perspectives without one canceling the other; thus there can be two sciences of God. Second, it provides the basis for the two sciences: one functions through the power of the light of natural reason, the other through the light of divine revelation. Moreover, they can, at least to some extent, keep out of each other's way because they differ \"according to genus\". Sacred doctrine is a fundamentally different kind of thing from theology, which is part of philosophy (ST I. 1.1 ad 2).\n\nFaith and reason complement rather than contradict each other, each giving different views of the same truth.\n\n===Creation===\n[[File:Tommaso - Super libros de generatione et corruptione - 4733257 00007.tif|thumb|''Super libros de generatione et corruptione'']]\n\nAs a Catholic Thomas believed that God is the \"maker of heaven and earth, of all that is visible and invisible.\" Like Aristotle, Thomas posited that life could form from non-living material or plant life, a theory of ongoing [[abiogenesis]] known as [[spontaneous generation]]:\n\n{{quote|Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another, it was not incompatible with the first formation of things, that from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should be generated.

Thomas reasoned that these species were generated through [[mutation]]s in animal [[sperm]], and argued that they were not unintended by [[nature]]; rather, such species were simply not intended for perpetual existence. That discussion is found in his commentary on ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Physics]]'':\n\n{{quote|The same thing is true of those substances Empedocles said were produced at the beginning of the world, such as the 'ox-progeny', i.e., half ox and half man. For if such things were not able to arrive at some end and final state of nature so that they would be preserved in existence, this was not because nature did not intend this [a final state], but because they were not capable of being preserved.

Given that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind, the adherents of the School reasoned that it ought to be resorted to only when it was necessary to prevent an even ''greater'' evil. A diplomatic agreement is preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started. <!-- the point being that obviously the weaker party would be happier with a diplomatic solution, while the stronger might need a bit more encouragement to accept a diplomatic solution --> Examples of \"[[The Just War tradition|just war]]\" are:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* In self-defense, as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success. If failure is a foregone conclusion, then it is just a wasteful spilling of blood.\n* Preventive war against a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who is about to attack.\n* War to punish a guilty enemy.\n\nA war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* The response must be commensurate with the evil; more violence than is strictly necessary would be unjust.\n* Governing authorities ''declare'' war, but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war. If the ''people'' oppose a war, then it is illegitimate. The people have a right to depose a government that is waging, or is about to wage, an unjust war.\n* Once war has begun, there remain moral limits to action. For example, one may not attack innocents or kill hostages.\n* The belligerents must exhaust all options for dialogue and negotiation before undertaking a war; war is legitimate only as a last resort.\n\nUnder this doctrine, expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert [[infidel]]s or [[paganism|pagans]], and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.\n\n===Nature of God===\nThomas believed that the [[existence of God]] is self-evident in itself, but not to us. \"Therefore I say that this proposition, \"God exists\", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject{{nbsp}}... Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature\u2014namely, by effects.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article1 |author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= | chapter= The Existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |via= newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\nThomas believed that the existence of God can be demonstrated. Briefly in the ''Summa theologiae'' and more extensively in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).\n\n{{Hatnote|For detailed analysis of the five proofs, see [[Existence of God]]}}\n{{Hatnote|For the original text of the five proofs, see [[Quinque viae]]}}\n\n# Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since, as Thomas believed, there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a [[Unmoved mover|First Mover]] not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.\n# \n# Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a [[Prima causa|First Cause]], called God.\n# \n# Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.\n# \n# Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. {{H:title|Note that Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself.|This then, we call God}}\n# \n# Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws.

This led him to propose five statements about the divine qualities:\n# [[divine simplicity|God is simple]], without composition of parts, such as body and soul, or matter and form.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|pp=74\u201377}}\n# God is perfect, lacking nothing. That is, God is distinguished from other beings on account of God's complete actuality.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|pp=86\u201387}} Thomas defined God as the '''Ipse [http://aquinasactusessendi.blogspot.com Actus Essendi] subsistens'',' subsisting act of being.<ref>See ''[[Actus Essendi]]''.

Natural law is an instance or instantiation of eternal law. Because natural law is what human beings determine according to their own nature (as rational beings), disobeying reason is disobeying natural law and eternal law. Thus eternal law is logically prior to reception of either \"natural law\" (that determined by reason) or \"divine law\" (that found in the Old and New Testaments). In other words, God's will extends to both reason and revelation. Sin is abrogating either one's own reason, on the one hand, or revelation on the other, and is synonymous with \"evil\" ([[privation]] of good, or ''[[privatio boni]]''<ref>{{cite book| chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2075.htm#article1 | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= II-I | chapter= Question 75, Article 1| quote= For evil is the absence of the good, which is natural and due to a thing.}}</ref>). Thomas, like all Scholastics, generally argued that the findings of reason and data of revelation cannot conflict, so both are a guide to God's will for human beings.\n\n===Nature of the Trinity===\nThomas argued that God, while perfectly united, also is perfectly described by [[Trinity|Three Interrelated Persons]]. These three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) are constituted by their relations within the essence of God. Thomas wrote that the term \"Trinity\" \"does not mean the relations themselves of the Persons, but rather the number of persons related to each other; and hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to another.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1031.htm#article3 | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= | chapter= The unity or plurality in God (Prima Pars, Q. 31) |via= newadvent.org}}</ref> The Father generates the Son (or the Word) by the relation of self-awareness. This eternal generation then produces an eternal Spirit \"who enjoys the divine nature as the Love of God, the Love of the Father for the Word.\"\n\nThis Trinity exists independently from the world. It transcends the created world, but the Trinity also decided to give grace to human beings. This takes place through the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the Word in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] and through the indwelling of the [[Holy Spirit]] within those who have experienced [[salvation]] by God; according to Aidan Nichols.{{sfn|Nichols|2002|pp=173\u201374}}\n\n===''Prima causa'' (first cause)===\nThomas's five proofs for the existence of God take some of Aristotle's assertions concerning principles of being. For God as ''[[prima causa]]'' (\"first cause\") comes from Aristotle's concept of the [[unmoved mover]] and asserts that God is the ultimate cause of all things.{{sfn|Nichols|2002|pp=80\u201382}}\n\n===Nature of Jesus Christ===\n\nIn the ''Summa Theologica'' Thomas begins his discussion of Jesus Christ by recounting the biblical story of [[Adam and Eve]] and by describing the negative effects of [[original sin]]. The purpose of Christ's Incarnation was to restore human nature by removing ''the contamination of sin'', which humans cannot do by themselves. \"Divine Wisdom judged it fitting that God should become man, so that thus one and the same person would be able both to restore man and to offer satisfaction.\"<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 228\u201329.</ref> Thomas argued in favor of the [[atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view of atonement]]; that is, that [[Christian views of Jesus|Jesus Christ]] [[death of Jesus|died]] \"to satisfy for the whole human race, which was sentenced to die on account of sin.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4050.htm#article1 |author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= III | chapter= Question 50, Article 1 |via= newadvent.org |access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Thomas Aquinas'' by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]], 1650]]\nThomas argued against several specific contemporary and historical theologians who held differing views about Christ. In response to [[Photinus]], Thomas stated that Jesus was truly divine and not simply a human being. Against [[Nestorius]], who suggested that Son of God was merely conjoined to the man Christ, Thomas argued that the fullness of God was an integral part of Christ's existence. However, countering [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinaris]]' views, Thomas held that Christ had a truly human (rational) [[soul]], as well. This produced a duality of natures in Christ. Thomas argued against [[Eutyches]] that this duality persisted after the Incarnation. Thomas stated that these two natures existed simultaneously yet distinguishably in one real human body, unlike the teachings of [[Manichaeus]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]].<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 231\u201339.</ref>\n\nWith respect to [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s assertion that Christ, \"though he was in the form of God{{nbsp}}... emptied himself\" ([[Philippians]] 2:6\u20137) in becoming human, Thomas offered an articulation of divine [[kenosis]] that has informed much subsequent Catholic [[Christology]]. Following the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], as well as the assertions of Scripture, Thomas held the doctrine of divine immutability.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum01.htm |title=First Council of Nicaea \u2013 325 AD |date=20 May 325| via= papalencyclicals.net}}</ref><ref>Augustine, Sermo VII, 7.</ref><ref>For instance, Malachi 3:6 and James 1:17</ref> Hence, in becoming human, there could be no change in the divine person of Christ. For Thomas, \"the mystery of Incarnation was not completed through God being changed in any way from the state in which He had been from eternity, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new way, or rather through having united it to Himself.\"<ref>ST III.1.1.</ref> Similarly, Thomas explained that Christ \"emptied Himself, not by putting off His divine nature, but by assuming a human nature.\"<ref name=\"dhspriory.org\">{{Cite web |url= http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/SSPhilippians.htm |title=Commentary on Saint Paul's Letter to the Philippians, available at \u00a72\u20132.}}</ref> For Thomas, \"the divine nature is sufficiently full, because every perfection of goodness is there. But human nature and the soul are not full, but capable of fulness, because it was made as a slate not written upon. Therefore, human nature is empty.\"<ref name=\"dhspriory.org\" /> Thus, when Paul indicates that Christ \"emptied himself\" this is to be understood in light of his assumption of a human nature.\n\nIn short \"Christ had a ''real body'' of the same nature of ours, a ''true rational soul'', and, together with these, ''perfect Deity''\". Thus, there is both unity (in his one ''[[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]'') and composition (in his two natures, human and Divine) in Christ.<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 241, 245\u201349.

This goal is achieved through the [[beatific vision]], in which a person experiences perfect, unending happiness by seeing the essence of God. The vision occurs after death as a gift from God to those who in life experienced salvation and redemption through Christ.\n\nThe goal of union with God has implications for the individual's life on earth. Thomas stated that an individual's [[Free Will|will]] must be ordered toward right things, such as charity, peace, and [[Sacred|holiness]]. He saw this orientation as also the way to happiness. Indeed, Thomas ordered his treatment of the moral life around the idea of happiness. The relationship between will and goal is antecedent in nature \"because rectitude of the will consists in being duly ordered to the last end [that is, the beatific vision].\" Those who truly seek to understand and see God will necessarily love what God loves. Such love requires morality and bears fruit in everyday human choices.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|p=383}}\n\n===Treatment of heretics===\nThomas Aquinas belonged to the Dominican Order (formally ''[[Ordo Praedicatorum]]'', the Order of Preachers) who began as an order dedicated to the conversion of the [[Albigensians]] and other heterodox factions, at first by peaceful means; later the Albigensians were dealt with by means of the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. In the ''Summa theologiae'', he wrote: \n<blockquote>With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith that quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death.\n\nOn the part of the Church, however, there is mercy, which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but \"after the first and second admonition\", as [[Paul of Tarsus|the Apostle]] directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death.{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article3 |volume= II\u2013II| chapter= Question 11, Article 3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHeresy was a capital offense against the secular law of most European countries of the 13th century. Kings and emperors, even those at war with the papacy, listed heresy first among the crimes against the state. Kings claimed power from God according to the Christian faith. Often enough, especially in that age of papal claims to universal worldly power, the rulers' power was tangibly and visibly legitimated directly through coronation by the pope.\n\nSimple theft, forgery, fraud, and other such crimes were also capital offenses; Thomas's point seems to be that the gravity of this offense, which touches not only the material goods but also the spiritual goods of others, is at least the same as forgery. Thomas's suggestion specifically demands that heretics be handed to a \"secular tribunal\" rather than [[magisterium|magisterial]] authority. That Thomas specifically says that heretics \"deserve{{nbsp}}... death\" is related to his theology, according to which all sinners have no intrinsic right to life (\"For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:23&version=ASV |title=Romans 6:23, ASV | work= The Bible| via= biblegateway.com |access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>). Although the life of a heretic who repents should be spared, the former heretic should be executed if he relapses into heresy. Thomas elaborates on his opinion regarding heresy in the next article, when he says:<blockquote>In God's tribunal, those who return are always received, because God is a searcher of hearts, and knows those who return in sincerity. But the Church cannot imitate God in this, for she presumes that those who relapse after being once received, are not sincere in their return; hence she does not debar them from the way of salvation, but neither does she protect them from the sentence of death.\n\nFor this reason the Church not only admits to Penance those who return from heresy for the first time, but also safeguards their lives, and sometimes by dispensation, restores them to the ecclesiastical dignities which they may have had before, should their conversion appear to be sincere: we read of this as having frequently been done for the good of peace. But when they fall again, after having been received, this seems to prove them to be inconstant in faith, wherefore when they return again, they are admitted to Penance, but are not delivered from the pain of death.([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article4 ''Summa'', op. cit., art.4.])</blockquote>\n\nFor [[Jews]], Thomas argues for toleration of both their persons and their religious rites.<ref>Novak, Michael (December 1995), [http://www.firstthings.com/article/1995/12/003-aquinas-and-the-heretics \"Aquinas and the Heretics\"], ''First Things''.</ref>\n\n===Magic and its practitioners===\nRegarding magic, Aquinas wrote that:\n\n* only God can perform miracles, create and transform<ref>''[[Summa contra gentiles]]'' 102</ref>\n* angels and demons (\"spiritual substances\") may do wonderful things, but they are not miracles and merely use natural things as instruments<ref>''Summa contra gentiles'' 103</ref>\n* any efficacy of magicians does not come from the power of particular words, or celestial bodies, or special figures, or sympathetic magic, but by bidding (ibid.,105), \n* \"demons\" are intellective substances who were created good and have chosen to be bad, it is these who are bid.<ref>''Summa contra gentiles'' 106\u2013108</ref> \n* if there is some transformation that could not occur in nature it is either the demon working on human imagination or arranging a fake<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= I | chapter= Question 114, Article 4}}</ref>\n\nA mention of witchcraft appears in the ''Summa theologicae''<ref>{{cite book| title= Summa theologica Supplement| chapter= Question 38, Article 2 |quote= Whether a spell can be in impediment to marriage.}} Note this Supplement was written or compiled by others after Aquinas' death.</ref> and concludes that the Church does not treat temporary or permanent impotence attributed to a spell any differently to that of natural causes, as far as an impediment to marriage.\n\nUnder the ''[[canon Episcopi]]'', church doctrine held that witchcraft was not possible and any practitioners of sorcery were deluded and their acts an illusion.

Thomas, following Church doctrine, accepts that the soul continues to exist after the death of the body. Because he accepts that the soul is the form of the body, then he also must believe that the human being, like all material things, is form-matter composite. Substantial form (the human soul) configures prime matter (the physical body) and is the form by which a material composite belongs to that species it does; in the case of human beings, that species is rational animal.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=194}} So, a human being is a matter-form composite that is organized to be a rational animal. Matter cannot exist without being configured by form, but form can exist without matter\u2014which allows for the separation of soul from body. Thomas says that the soul shares in the material and spiritual worlds, and so has some features of matter and other, immaterial, features (such as access to universals). The human soul is different from other material and spiritual things; it is created by God, but also comes into existence only in the material body.\n\nHuman beings are material, but the human person can survive the death of the body through continued existence of the soul, which persists. The human soul straddles the spiritual and material worlds, and is both a configured subsistent form as well as a configurer of matter into that of a living, bodily human.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=200}} Because it is spiritual, the human soul does not depend on matter and may exist separately. Because the human being is a soul-matter composite, the body has a part in what it is to be human. Perfected human nature consists in the human dual nature, embodied and intellecting.\n\nResurrection appears to require dualism, which Thomas rejects. Yet Thomas believes the soul persists after the death and corruption of the body, and is capable of existence, separated from the body between the time of death and the resurrection. Thomas believes in a different sort of dualism, one guided by Christian scripture. Thomas knows that human beings are essentially physical, but physicality has a spirit capable of returning to God after life.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=192}} For Thomas, the rewards and punishment of the afterlife are not ''only'' spiritual. Because of this, resurrection is an important part of his philosophy on the soul. The human is fulfilled and complete in the body, so the hereafter must take place with souls enmattered in resurrected bodies. In addition to spiritual reward, humans can expect to enjoy material and physical blessings. Because Thomas's soul requires a body for its actions, during the afterlife, the soul will also be punished or rewarded in corporeal existence.\n\nThomas states clearly his stance on resurrection, and uses it to back up his philosophy of justice; that is, the promise of resurrection compensates Christians who suffered in this world through a heavenly union with the divine. He says, \"If there is no resurrection of the dead, it follows that there is no good for human beings other than in this life.\"{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=461, 473}} Resurrection provides the impetus for people on earth to give up pleasures in this life. Aquinas believes the human who prepared for the afterlife both morally and intellectually will be rewarded more greatly; however, all reward is through the grace of God. Thomas insists beatitude will be conferred according to merit, and will render the person better able to conceive the divine. Thomas accordingly believes punishment is directly related to earthly, living preparation and activity as well. Thomas's account of the soul focuses on epistemology and metaphysics, and because of this he believes it gives a clear account of the immaterial nature of the soul. Thomas conservatively guards Christian doctrine, and thus maintains physical and spiritual reward and punishment after death. By accepting the essentiality of both body and soul, he allows for a heaven and hell described in scripture and church dogma.\n\n==Modern influence==\n[[File:Saint Joseph's Catholic Church (Central City, Kentucky) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright|A stained glass window of Thomas Aquinas in St. Joseph's Catholic Church ([[Central City, Kentucky]])]]\n\nMany modern ethicists both within and outside the Catholic Church (notably [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]) have recently commented on the possible use of Thomas's [[virtue ethics]] as a way of avoiding [[utilitarianism]] or Kantian \"sense of duty\" (called [[deontology]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Through the work of twentieth-century philosophers such as [[G.

Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]] proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with [[neurodynamics]], in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' titled \"Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas\".\n\n[[Henry Adams]]'s ''[[Mont Saint Michel and Chartres]]'' ends with a culminating chapter on Thomas, in which Adams calls Thomas an \"artist\" and constructs an extensive analogy between the design of Thomas's \"Church Intellectual\" and that of the gothic cathedrals of that period. [[Erwin Panofsky]] later would echo these views in ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'' (1951).\n\nThomas's aesthetic theories, especially the concept of ''claritas'', deeply influenced the literary practice of modernist writer [[James Joyce]], who used to extol Thomas as being second only to Aristotle among Western philosophers. Joyce refers to Thomas's doctrines in ''Elementa philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae Aquinatis doctoris angelici'' (1898) of Girolamo Maria Mancini, professor of theology at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpYvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA570#v=onepage&q&f=false The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol V, Year 32, No. 378, June, 1899, p. 570] Accessed 3-7-2013</ref> For example, Mancini's ''Elementa'' is referred to in Joyce's ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00jame |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00jame/page/221 221] |title=A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man |last=Joyce |first= James |date=4 December 1992 |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |via=Internet Archive|isbn=9781853260063 }}</ref>\n\nThe influence of Thomas's aesthetics also can be found in the works of the Italian [[semiotics|semiotician]] [[Umberto Eco]], who wrote an essay on aesthetic ideas in Thomas (published in 1956 and republished in 1988 in a revised edition).{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Criticisms==\nTwentieth century philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] criticized Thomas's philosophy stating that,\n\n<blockquote>He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead. He is not engaged in an inquiry, the result of which it is impossible to know in advance. Before he begins to philosophize, he already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith. If he can find apparently rational arguments for some parts of the faith, so much the better; if he cannot, he need only fall back on revelation. The finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not philosophy, but special pleading. I cannot, therefore, feel that he deserves to be put on a level with the best philosophers either of Greece or of modern times.<ref>{{harv|Russell|1967|p=463}} ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', Ch. 34, \"St. Thomas Aquinas\", Allen & Unwin, London; Simon & Schuster, New York 1946, pp. 484\u2013.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis criticism is illustrated with the following example: According to Russell, Thomas advocates the indissolubility of marriage \"on the ground that the father is useful in the education of the children, (a) because he is more rational than the mother, (b) because, being stronger, he is better able to inflict physical punishment.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\">{{harv|Russell|1967|p=462}}</ref> Even though modern approaches to education do not support these views, \"No follower of Saint Thomas would, on that account, cease to believe in lifelong monogamy, because the real grounds of belief are not those which are alleged.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\" /> It may be countered that the treatment of matrimony in the ''Summa Theologica'' is in the Supplements volume, which was not written by Thomas.<ref>{{Cite book |url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica Supplementum Tertiae Partis |via= newadvent.org}}</ref> Moreover, as noted above,<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas#Condemnation of 1277]]</ref> Thomas's introduction of arguments and concepts from the theistic non-Christian [[Aristotle]] and Muslim [[Averroes]] was controversial within the Catholic Church of his day.\n\n===Response to Russell's criticism===\n\n[[Anthony Kenny]] suggests that Russell is failing to reflect on what philosophers, himself included, actually do:\n\n<blockquote>It is extraordinary that that accusation should be made by Russell, who in the book ''Principia Mathematica'' takes hundreds of pages to prove that two and two make four, which is something he had believed all his life.<ref>''Aquinas on Mind'', New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-04415-4}}, 11)</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of works by Thomas Aquinas}}\n\nThe first edition of Thomas's [[The Complete Works|opera omnia]], the so-called ''editio Piana'' (from [[Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who commissioned it), was produced in 1570 at the ''studium'' of the Roman convent at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8qt63uOg6IC&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=In This Light Which Gives Light: A History of the College of St. Albert the Great (1930\u20131980) |last=Renz |first=Christopher J. |date=4 September 2009 |publisher=Dominican School |via=Google Books|isbn=9781883734183 }}</ref>\n\nThe critical edition of Thomas's works is the ongoing edition commissioned by [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1882\u20131903), the so-called [[Leonine Edition]].

The character was introduced after DC Comics created Earth-Two, a [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] that was [[retcon|retroactively]] established as the home of characters whose adventures had been published in the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. This allowed creators to publish Superman comic books taking place in current [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] while being able to disregard Golden Age stories, solving an incongruity, as Superman had been published as a single ongoing incarnation since inception. The character first appeared in ''Justice League of America'' vol. 1 #73 (August 1969).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWhen the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] came to a close in the 1950s, most of DC Comics' superhero comic books ceased publication. At the start of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], characters such as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern]] were revamped for more modern times, ignoring or abandoning established [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] and thus making a clean break between the two eras. It was later established that the Golden Age and Silver Age heroes lived on Earth-Two and Earth-One respectively, these being separate parallel Earths in a single [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]].\n\nSuperman was one of the few exceptions; his stories had been published without interruption since his 1938 debut in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]]. This caused a continuity problem, in that Superman was simultaneously a member of the [[Justice Society of America]] on Earth-Two and also member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] on Earth-One. It was eventually resolved that there were two Supermen.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #73 (1969)</ref> The Silver Age Superman was [[Kal-El (Earth-One)|Kal-El]] from Earth-One, and the Golden Age Superman was Kal-L from Earth-Two.\n\nSeveral differences between the two Supermen were established to clarify the distinction. The Earth-One names \"Kal-El,\" \"[[Jor-El]],\" and \"[[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]]\" became \"Kal-L,\" \"Jor-L,\" and \"John and Mary Kent\" on Earth-Two, as in the original Golden Age stories. Kal-L's costume was largely adapted from the 1940s drawing style, retaining the famous sweatshirt wrist-cuffs, while his S-shield symbol was originally very different from the main Superman S-symbol, adapting the 1940s six-sided version with the tail endings and hard-left tilt of the S-edges. [[George P\u00e9rez]] famously redesigned Kal-L's 1940s S-shield (starting in ''JLA'' (Vol 1) #197) to be mostly the main S-symbol with five sides, and to merely reflect the tilt connecting the upper edge to the side of shield. Some artists such as [[Alex Ross]] and others, including ''Justice Society'' series artist [[Dale Eaglesham]], continued to use the specific six-sided 1940s S-shield after Perez's change for Kal-L.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Stories featuring both Supermen also indicated that Kal-L was the older of the two, being depicted as late-middle-aged, with grey or solid-white hair at the base hairline and face wrinkles, while his Earth-One counterpart was a youthful man of modern times.\n\nThese choices not only helped DC Comics to restore continuity to some of the character's Golden Age stories, but also led them to experiment with a Superman other than the mainstream one. Several differences between Kal-L and the better-known Kal-El were introduced. Kal-L was written to be different from the original Golden Age Superman, most famously by revealing his dual identities of Clark Kent and Superman to the woman he loved in the late 1940s, [[Lois Lane#Earth-Two version|the Earth-Two version of Lois Lane]], and eventually marrying her in 1950.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #484, 1978</ref> Their early marital life was depicted in the feature \"Mr. & Mrs. Superman\" in DC's ''[[Superman Family]]'' series, which was very different from the original published Superman stories of the 1940s and 1950s, in which Kent kept his secret from Lane and never married her.\n\n===Allies===\nAs Superman, Kal-L was considered the first public superhero in the history of [[Earth-Two]], being the first individual to appear regularly in a colorful costume and display superhuman abilities, in contrast to earlier part-time super-powered heroes such as [[Dr. Occult]].\n\nIn a contended{{vague|date=July 2016}} story, Kal-L received some brief training in his teen years from his [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Earth-One counterpart]], after Superboy was accidentally hurled into Earth-Two (and back in time several decades to the early 1930s).<ref>''New Adventures of Superboy'' #15\u201316 (March\u2013April 1981)</ref> In this story Kal-L briefly attains flight by hovering, an account that is refuted in all other stories specific to Kal-L, as he is stated only to be able to superleap until adulthood. This suggests that the story relates to another Kal-L counterpart in the pre-''Crisis'' infinite [[DC multiverse|multiverse]], rather than to the actual Earth-Two Superman. However, in ''Superman Family'' #207 (May/June 1981), Kal-L tells Lois about having met Superboy, suggesting the above story did occur as written.\n\nKal-L began fighting evil on a local level in his base of operations, the American city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Later in his career he would consider first the entire United States and then the whole world under his protection. In November 1940 Superman became a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref>''DC Special'' #29 (1977)</ref> Like [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Batman]], he was referred to as an \"honorary member\" during the original meeting of the Justice Society. He subsequently appeared with it in two published adventures during the 1940s, aiding them on several other occasions retroactively{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} as a member of the World War II [[All-Star Squadron]]. He built a secret citadel in the mountains outside Metropolis as his headquarters, as shown in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', and eventually built a [[Fortress of Solitude]] comparable to that of his Earth-One counterpart.\n\nIn later years, Kal-L was considered an elder statesman of Earth-Two's superhero community, the one that later generations of superheroes looked to as an example and role model.<ref>''All Star Comics'' #69 (November/December 1977)</ref> In his secret identity as Clark Kent, Superman also enjoyed success at the ''[[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]]'', of which he was appointed editor-in-chief in the 1950s, replacing [[George Taylor (DC Comics)|George Taylor]].\n\n===Fellow Kryptonians===\nIn 1950 Superman encountered three other surviving Kryptonians, U-Ban, Kizo and Mala. All three brothers were members of the ruling scientific council exiled from Krypton after they attempted to conquer the planet. Imprisoned in suspended animation in tube vessels, they were later freed.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #65 (July/August 1950)</ref> Superman's lookalike Mala later created a counterfeit Earth.<ref>''Action Comics'' #194 (July 1954)</ref> These Golden Age stories and characters were never referred to in later Earth-Two stories.\n\nAt some time during the Silver Age, Superman's cousin Kara arrived on Earth after a lengthy journey from Krypton. When her father Zor-L discovered that Krypton was about to explode, he placed her in a spacecraft directed towards Earth. Although this occurs at the same time as Kal-L's ship is launched, Kara's ship travels more slowly, and she arrives on Earth decades after her cousin has landed. Kara's Symbioship is designed to keep her in stasis during the journey and provide her with life experiences and education in the form of a [[virtual reality]]. By the time she arrives on Earth, Kara is in her later teens to early twenties.\n\nThe Symbioship provided virtual copies of Zor-L, Alura and fellow Kryptonians from within her home city of Kandor. Once removed from the ship, this virtual reality ceased to exist. Only Kara \u2013 [[Power Girl]], as she would later be known \u2013 was known to interact with this virtual Kryptonian reality.\n\n===''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}\n\nKal-L was one of the heroes from various Earths who fought to save the Multiverse from destruction during the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and was present at the battle at the Dawn of Time, in which the five remaining Earths were merged into a single universe. As a result, Kal-L still existed and still remembered the history of his home reality, even though no one in the new reality remembered he had ever existed.\n\nAfter grieving over the loss of his wife Lois and his friends from Earth-Two, Kal-L joins the remaining heroes for a final battle with the [[Anti-Monitor]] in the [[Qward|Anti-Matter Universe]], where the Anti-Monitor has absorbed all life. After the small army of heroes manage to weaken the Anti-Monitor, Kal-L chooses to stay behind and sacrifice himself to save the new universe while the other heroes leave, not wanting to live on in a world that no longer remembers him. After a prolonged battle, Kal-L strikes the final blow that kills the Anti-Monitor.\n\n[[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of [[Earth-Three]] then reveals to Kal-L that he saved the Lois Lane Kent of Earth-Two from the collapse of the Multiverse. He then transports Kal-L, Lois Lane, [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] of [[Earth-Prime]] and himself into a paradise dimension, sealing themselves off from the universe.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 (1986)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Adventures of Superman 649 coverart.jpg|thumb|Promotional art for ''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #649 (April 2006).

Kal-L's roles as the most respected member of the Justice Society of America and the person who found his cousin Power Girl were given to the Golden Age Green Lantern [[Alan Scott]] and to Kal-El respectively. Lee Travis (the first [[Crimson Avenger]]) became the first costumed hero of the post-''Crisis'' universe after being shown a vision of Kal-El's future heroism before the start of his career (keeping Superman as the inspiration for Earth's superheroes in the new universe as well).<ref>''Golden Age Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (2001)</ref>\n\nKal-L later felt that the paradise was more a prison than a refuge, and eventually discovered a doorway that would allow him to leave the paradise dimension without causing the destruction of the universe.<ref>''The Kingdom'' #4 (1999)</ref>\n\n===''Infinite Crisis''===\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\n[[Image:Crisis5p3.png|Kal-L fighting Kal-El from ''Infinite Crisis''#5, art by Jerry Ordway.|left|thumb]]\nKal was content to stay in the paradise dimension until Lois began to fall ill, when he created a replica of Metropolis and the ''Daily Star'' office building in an attempt to help. After the attempt failed, Kal-L began to believe Alexander's claims that the paradise dimension was eating away at their souls. Alexander and Superboy used Kal-L's distraction over Lois' health to break out of the paradise dimension and start their plan to recreate the Multiverse.<ref>''Infinite Crisis Secret Files'' (2006)</ref>\n\nAppalled by the rapidly deteriorating state of affairs in the world, Kal-L and his three companions emerge from their self-imposed exile to help. Kal-L batters an exit through the crystalline barrier which has separated them from the rest of reality.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1 (December 2005)</ref> He then meets up with Power Girl, explains her true origins and the events of the previous Crisis, and enlists her help.\n\nThe touch of the Earth-Two Lois restores Power Girl's memories, and Kal-L then reveals to her that his plan is to bring back Earth-Two.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #2 (January 2006)</ref> He then tries to enlist [[Batman]]'s aid by claiming that Batman's distrust of the heroes has been caused by Earth-One's darker nature, and promises always to stand by him when the \"right\" Earth returns. Batman, however, asks Kal-L if the [[Dick Grayson]] of this Earth is a corrupted version of the one that Kal-L knew, and attempts to use the [[Kryptonite]] ring against him. Kal-L destroys the ring and departs.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #3 (February 2006)</ref>\n\nPower Girl is knocked out and captured by Superboy-Prime after discovering Alexander Luthor Jr.'s tuning fork, which he plans to use to restore the Multiverse in order to search for the perfect Earth.

Kal-El hears Kal-L's screams of sorrow from the current Earth and investigates. A griefstricken Kal-L angrily attacks Kal-El upon his arrival, blaming him for corrupting Earth-Two as he did his own Earth.

Superboy-Prime is then imprisoned by several Green Lanterns. Having witnessed his other self's nobility and courage, Kal-L dies in Power Girl's arms, affirming that Clark is the true Superman, and telling Kara that he will always be with her.

The city is covered in a dome, which suppresses the powers of those within it and its sent to Telos alongside many other cities from other doomed timelines. Kal-L and Lois are in Metropolis when it happens. During the next year, Kal-L eventually reveals his secret identity as Superman to the public and works as a journalist to help keep the city's peace. When the dome is opened and Kal-L and the other heroes recover their powers, Telos, an entity which claims to be the planet itself, announces that they need to fight against other domed cities for their survival, otherwise their own cities and people would be destroyed.<ref>''Convergence: Action Comics'' #1 (April 2015)</ref> Refusing to participate in Telos' game, Kal-L stops the battle between Power Girl and [[Superman: Red Son|Earth-30]]'s Wonder Woman and leaves alongside Power Girl in an attempt to put an end to the entire battle.<ref>''Convergence: Action Comics'' #2 (May 2015)</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the ''Convergence'', all parallel universes and alternate timelines are restored and composed as the new multiverse, including the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two and thus Kal-L remains in existence as the result.<ref>''Convergence'' #8 (May 2015)</ref> However, what exactly happened to Kal-L and other inhabitants of the old Earth-Two in the new timeline is not directly shown.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Earth-Two Superman has super-strength, the power of flight, super-speed, super-breath, arctic breath, super-hearing, super-vision (including X-ray, heat, microscopic and telescopic visions), and invulnerability to most forces other than magic, [[psionics]], and Kryptonite. He is at least as strong as Superman of the Silver Age from the Pre-Crisis continuity, and was capable of landing the killing blow against Anti-Monitor (who had been weakened prior), reducing him to a skull with a punch \"that could shatter stars.\"\n\nAn additional ability that actual Golden Age Superman possessed, which his modern counterpart does not, is an ability to \"mold\" his face and body to disguise himself, as chronicled in several Golden Age tales.<ref>'In 1947's \"Superman\" #44, written by Bill Finger and penciled by Ira Yarbrough, Superman needed to impersonate a famous stuntman who worried he would be recognized. That's when Superman used his \"super-muscular control\" to change his face to perfectly copy the stuntman. However, in \"Superman\" #45, he topped himself by molding his entire body to look like an inter-dimensional warrior and escape from a cage.

Most accounts of the Kal-L's origin state that his powers came from his Kryptonian heritage, not from the energy of a yellow sun (''Secret Origins'' #1 [1986]).

The ring appears to have given Kal-L's body all the abilities he would have had as a Kryptonian under a yellow sun, as well as the ability to recall certain aspects of his former life.

The character was introduced after DC Comics created Earth-Two, a [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] that was [[retcon|retroactively]] established as the home of characters whose adventures had been published in the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. This allowed creators to publish Superman comic books taking place in current [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] while being able to disregard Golden Age stories, solving an incongruity, as Superman had been published as a single ongoing incarnation since inception. The character first appeared in ''Justice League of America'' vol. 1 #73 (August 1969).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWhen the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] came to a close in the 1950s, most of DC Comics' superhero comic books ceased publication. At the start of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], characters such as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern]] were revamped for more modern times, ignoring or abandoning established [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] and thus making a clean break between the two eras. It was later established that the Golden Age and Silver Age heroes lived on Earth-Two and Earth-One respectively, these being separate parallel Earths in a single [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]].\n\nSuperman was one of the few exceptions; his stories had been published without interruption since his 1938 debut in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]]. This caused a continuity problem, in that Superman was simultaneously a member of the [[Justice Society of America]] on Earth-Two and also member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] on Earth-One. It was eventually resolved that there were two Supermen.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #73 (1969)</ref> The Silver Age Superman was [[Kal-El (Earth-One)|Kal-El]] from Earth-One, and the Golden Age Superman was Kal-L from Earth-Two.\n\nSeveral differences between the two Supermen were established to clarify the distinction. The Earth-One names \"Kal-El,\" \"[[Jor-El]],\" and \"[[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]]\" became \"Kal-L,\" \"Jor-L,\" and \"John and Mary Kent\" on Earth-Two, as in the original Golden Age stories. Kal-L's costume was largely adapted from the 1940s drawing style, retaining the famous sweatshirt wrist-cuffs, while his S-shield symbol was originally very different from the main Superman S-symbol, adapting the 1940s six-sided version with the tail endings and hard-left tilt of the S-edges. [[George P\u00e9rez]] famously redesigned Kal-L's 1940s S-shield (starting in ''JLA'' (Vol 1) #197) to be mostly the main S-symbol with five sides, and to merely reflect the tilt connecting the upper edge to the side of shield. Some artists such as [[Alex Ross]] and others, including ''Justice Society'' series artist [[Dale Eaglesham]], continued to use the specific six-sided 1940s S-shield after Perez's change for Kal-L.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Stories featuring both Supermen also indicated that Kal-L was the older of the two, being depicted as late-middle-aged, with grey or solid-white hair at the base hairline and face wrinkles, while his Earth-One counterpart was a youthful man of modern times.\n\nThese choices not only helped DC Comics to restore continuity to some of the character's Golden Age stories, but also led them to experiment with a Superman other than the mainstream one. Several differences between Kal-L and the better-known Kal-El were introduced. Kal-L was written to be different from the original Golden Age Superman, most famously by revealing his dual identities of Clark Kent and Superman to the woman he loved in the late 1940s, [[Lois Lane#Earth-Two version|the Earth-Two version of Lois Lane]], and eventually marrying her in 1950.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #484, 1978</ref> Their early marital life was depicted in the feature \"Mr. & Mrs. Superman\" in DC's ''[[Superman Family]]'' series, which was very different from the original published Superman stories of the 1940s and 1950s, in which Kent kept his secret from Lane and never married her.\n\n===Allies===\nAs Superman, Kal-L was considered the first public superhero in the history of [[Earth-Two]], being the first individual to appear regularly in a colorful costume and display superhuman abilities, in contrast to earlier part-time super-powered heroes such as [[Dr. Occult]].\n\nIn a contended{{vague|date=July 2016}} story, Kal-L received some brief training in his teen years from his [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Earth-One counterpart]], after Superboy was accidentally hurled into Earth-Two (and back in time several decades to the early 1930s).<ref>''New Adventures of Superboy'' #15\u201316 (March\u2013April 1981)</ref> In this story Kal-L briefly attains flight by hovering, an account that is refuted in all other stories specific to Kal-L, as he is stated only to be able to superleap until adulthood. This suggests that the story relates to another Kal-L counterpart in the pre-''Crisis'' infinite [[DC multiverse|multiverse]], rather than to the actual Earth-Two Superman. However, in ''Superman Family'' #207 (May/June 1981), Kal-L tells Lois about having met Superboy, suggesting the above story did occur as written.\n\nKal-L began fighting evil on a local level in his base of operations, the American city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Later in his career he would consider first the entire United States and then the whole world under his protection. In November 1940 Superman became a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]].<ref>''DC Special'' #29 (1977)</ref> Like [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Batman]], he was referred to as an \"honorary member\" during the original meeting of the Justice Society. He subsequently appeared with it in two published adventures during the 1940s, aiding them on several other occasions retroactively{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} as a member of the World War II [[All-Star Squadron]]. He built a secret citadel in the mountains outside Metropolis as his headquarters, as shown in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', and eventually built a [[Fortress of Solitude]] comparable to that of his Earth-One counterpart.\n\nIn later years, Kal-L was considered an elder statesman of Earth-Two's superhero community, the one that later generations of superheroes looked to as an example and role model.<ref>''All Star Comics'' #69 (November/December 1977)</ref> In his secret identity as Clark Kent, Superman also enjoyed success at the ''[[Daily Star (DC Comics)|Daily Star]]'', of which he was appointed editor-in-chief in the 1950s, replacing [[George Taylor (DC Comics)|George Taylor]].\n\n===Fellow Kryptonians===\nIn 1950 Superman encountered three other surviving Kryptonians, U-Ban, Kizo and Mala. All three brothers were members of the ruling scientific council exiled from Krypton after they attempted to conquer the planet. Imprisoned in suspended animation in tube vessels, they were later freed.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #65 (July/August 1950)</ref> Superman's lookalike Mala later created a counterfeit Earth.<ref>''Action Comics'' #194 (July 1954)</ref> These Golden Age stories and characters were never referred to in later Earth-Two stories.\n\nAt some time during the Silver Age, Superman's cousin Kara arrived on Earth after a lengthy journey from Krypton. When her father Zor-L discovered that Krypton was about to explode, he placed her in a spacecraft directed towards Earth. Although this occurs at the same time as Kal-L's ship is launched, Kara's ship travels more slowly, and she arrives on Earth decades after her cousin has landed. Kara\u2019s Symbioship is designed to keep her in stasis during the journey and provide her with life experiences and education in the form of a [[virtual reality]]. By the time she arrives on Earth, Kara is in her later teens to early twenties.\n\nThe Symbioship provided virtual copies of Zor-L, Alura and fellow Kryptonians from within her home city of Kandor. Once removed from the ship, this virtual reality ceased to exist. Only Kara \u2013 [[Power Girl]], as she would later be known \u2013 was known to interact with this virtual Kryptonian reality.\n\n===''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}\n\nKal-L was one of the heroes from various Earths who fought to save the Multiverse from destruction during the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and was present at the battle at the Dawn of Time, in which the five remaining Earths were merged into a single universe. As a result, Kal-L still existed and still remembered the history of his home reality, even though no one in the new reality remembered he had ever existed.\n\nAfter grieving over the loss of his wife Lois and his friends from Earth-Two, Kal-L joins the remaining heroes for a final battle with the [[Anti-Monitor]] in the [[Qward|Anti-Matter Universe]], where the Anti-Monitor has absorbed all life. After the small army of heroes manage to weaken the Anti-Monitor, Kal-L chooses to stay behind and sacrifice himself to save the new universe while the other heroes leave, not wanting to live on in a world that no longer remembers him. After a prolonged battle, Kal-L strikes the final blow that kills the Anti-Monitor.\n\n[[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of [[Earth-Three]] then reveals to Kal-L that he saved the Lois Lane Kent of Earth-Two from the collapse of the Multiverse. He then transports Kal-L, Lois Lane, [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] of [[Earth-Prime]] and himself into a paradise dimension, sealing themselves off from the universe.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 (1986)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Adventures of Superman 649 coverart.jpg|thumb|Promotional art for ''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #649 (April 2006).

Kal-L's roles as the most respected member of the Justice Society of America and the person who found his cousin Power Girl were given to the Golden Age Green Lantern [[Alan Scott]] and to Kal-El respectively. Lee Travis (the first [[Crimson Avenger]]) became the first costumed hero of the post-''Crisis'' universe after being shown a vision of Kal-El's future heroism before the start of his career (keeping Superman as the inspiration for Earth's superheroes in the new universe as well).<ref>''Golden Age Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (2001)</ref>\n\nKal-L later felt that the paradise was more a prison than a refuge, and eventually discovered a doorway that would allow him to leave the paradise dimension without causing the destruction of the universe.<ref>''The Kingdom'' #4 (1999)</ref>\n\n===''Infinite Crisis''===\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\n[[Image:Crisis5p3.png|Kal-L fighting Kal-El from ''Infinite Crisis''#5, art by Jerry Ordway.|left|thumb]]\nKal was content to stay in the paradise dimension until Lois began to fall ill, when he created a replica of Metropolis and the ''Daily Star'' office building in an attempt to help. After the attempt failed, Kal-L began to believe Alexander's claims that the paradise dimension was eating away at their souls. Alexander and Superboy used Kal-L's distraction over Lois' health to break out of the paradise dimension and start their plan to recreate the Multiverse.<ref>''Infinite Crisis Secret Files'' (2006)</ref>\n\nAppalled by the rapidly deteriorating state of affairs in the world, Kal-L and his three companions emerge from their self-imposed exile to help. Kal-L batters an exit through the crystalline barrier which has separated them from the rest of reality.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1 (December 2005)</ref> He then meets up with Power Girl, explains her true origins and the events of the previous Crisis, and enlists her help.\n\nThe touch of the Earth-Two Lois restores Power Girl's memories, and Kal-L then reveals to her that his plan is to bring back Earth-Two.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #2 (January 2006)</ref> He then tries to enlist [[Batman]]'s aid by claiming that Batman's distrust of the heroes has been caused by Earth-One\u2019s darker nature, and promises always to stand by him when the \"right\" Earth returns. Batman, however, asks Kal-L if the [[Dick Grayson]] of this Earth is a corrupted version of the one that Kal-L knew, and attempts to use the [[Kryptonite]] ring against him. Kal-L destroys the ring and departs.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #3 (February 2006)</ref>\n\nPower Girl is knocked out and captured by Superboy-Prime after discovering Alexander Luthor Jr.'s tuning fork, which he plans to use to restore the Multiverse in order to search for the perfect Earth. Alexander succeeds in recreating Earth-Two, causing Kal-L, the Earth-Two Lois and the heroes who originated on Earth-Two to be sent there.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #4 (March 2006)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kaldeath.PNG|thumb|The death of Kal-L from ''Infinite Crisis'' #7.

Kal-El hears Kal-L's screams of sorrow from the current Earth and investigates. A griefstricken Kal-L angrily attacks Kal-El upon his arrival, blaming him for corrupting Earth-Two as he did his own Earth. During the fight, both Supermen experience lucid visions of the other's life and try to change things on the other's Earth for the better. However, they both fail.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #5 (April 2006)</ref><ref>''Superman: Infinite Crisis'' trade paperback <!--publication date needed--></ref>\n\nAfter the fight, Kal-L realizes that a perfect Earth does not need a Superman and that Alexander is using him for his own purposes. Kal-L survives the collapse of the alternate Earths into New Earth and witnesses the death of [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]], making him realize he condemned the wrong Superboy.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #6 (May 2006)</ref>\n\nKal-L and Kal-El then join forces to defeat [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] and [[Bizarro]] during the Secret Society\u2019s assault on Metropolis. The two Supermen then team up to overcome Superboy-Prime by dragging him into space through Krypton\u2019s red sun Rao, causing all three to lose their powers and crash land on [[Mogo]], a planet of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. Kal-L and Kal-El, without powers, fight Superboy-Prime on Mogo\u2019s surface, where Superboy-Prime savagely beats Kal-L to death.\n\nKal-El then intervenes and overpowers Superboy-Prime, and defeats him before succumbing to the Kryptonite. Superboy-Prime is then imprisoned by several Green Lanterns. Having witnessed his other self's nobility and courage, Kal-L dies in Power Girl\u2019s arms, affirming that Clark is the true Superman, and telling Kara that he will always be with her.

The city is covered in a dome, which suppresses the powers of those within it and its sent to Telos alongside many other cities from other doomed timelines. Kal-L and Lois are in Metropolis when it happens. During the next year, Kal-L eventually reveals his secret identity as Superman to the public and works as a journalist to help keep the city's peace. When the dome is opened and Kal-L and the other heroes recover their powers, Telos, an entity which claims to be the planet itself, announces that they need to fight against other domed cities for their survival, otherwise their own cities and people would be destroyed.<ref>''Convergence: Action Comics'' #1 (April 2015)</ref> Refusing to participate in Telos' game, Kal-L stops the battle between Power Girl and [[Superman: Red Son|Earth-30]]'s Wonder Woman and leaves alongside Power Girl in an attempt to put an end to the entire battle.<ref>''Convergence: Action Comics'' #2 (May 2015)</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the ''Convergence'', all parallel universes and alternate timelines are restored and composed as the new multiverse, including the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Two and thus Kal-L remains in existence as the result.<ref>''Convergence'' #8 (May 2015)</ref> However, what exactly happened to Kal-L and other inhabitants of the old Earth-Two in the new timeline is not directly shown.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Earth-Two Superman has super-strength, the power of flight, super-speed, super-breath, arctic breath, super-hearing, super-vision (including X-ray, heat, microscopic and telescopic visions), and invulnerability to most forces other than magic, [[psionics]], and Kryptonite. He is at least as strong as Superman of the Silver Age from the Pre-Crisis continuity, and was capable of landing the killing blow against Anti-Monitor (who had been weakened prior), reducing him to a skull with a punch \"that could shatter stars.\"\n\nAn additional ability that actual Golden Age Superman possessed, which his modern counterpart does not, is an ability to \"mold\" his face and body to disguise himself, as chronicled in several Golden Age tales.<ref>'In 1947's \"Superman\" #44, written by Bill Finger and penciled by Ira Yarbrough, Superman needed to impersonate a famous stuntman who worried he would be recognized. That's when Superman used his \"super-muscular control\" to change his face to perfectly copy the stuntman. However, in \"Superman\" #45, he topped himself by molding his entire body to look like an inter-dimensional warrior and escape from a cage.

Most accounts of the Kal-L's origin state that his powers came from his Kryptonian heritage, not from the energy of a yellow sun (''Secret Origins'' #1 [1986]). A later conflicting reinterpretation stated that his powers fluctuated when under a red sun, as noted in ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''All-Star Comics''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Black Lantern===\n{{Main|Power ring (DC Comics)#Black}}\nAs a Black Lantern, Kal-L's [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power ring]] needs to be charged by feeding on the hearts of living beings within the emotional spectrum. The ring appears to have given Kal-L's body all the abilities he would have had as a Kryptonian under a yellow sun, as well as the ability to recall certain aspects of his former life. Wearing the ring, however, places Kal-L under the influences of [[Nekron]] and his disciples [[Scar (comics)|Scar]] and [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]].\n\n==Other versions==\n{{See also|Alternative versions of Superman}}\n\n===Post Crisis Earth-2 \"missing\" Superman and wife===\nIn the final issue of the weekly comic book ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities.
