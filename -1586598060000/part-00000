According to him, several other authors adventured themselves to discover be it some parts of this extinct language.\n\nDue to the historical presence in Northwest Africa of Classical Latin, modern Romance languages, as well as the influence of the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]] (that has Romance vocabulary) makes it very difficult to differentiate the precise origin of words in [[Berber languages]] and in the varieties of [[Maghrebi Arabic]].\n\nGenerally speaking, words originally from African Romance are:\n* The words ending with ''-u'' (for example, the Berber ''abekkadu'' \"sin\", from ''peccatum'') and not ''-us'' (as in the Berber ''asnus'' \"(young) donkey\");\n* The words having a phonological or morphological aspect different from that of Italian, French or Spanish (for instance the Berber word ''agursel'' \"mushroom\", supposing the base *AGARICELLUS).{{Clarify|reason=Which Berber language(s) are the example words taken from? And what about *agursel* makes it clearly African Romance as opposed, e.g., to Spanish?|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe studies concerning the African Romance are difficult and often highly conjectural. Another difficulty comes from that, considering the immensity of the North-African territory, it is highly probable that not one but several varieties of African Romance existed, much like the wide variety of Romance languages in Europe.<ref>Franco Fanciullo, ''Un capitolo della Romania submersa: il latino africano'', pp. 162-187.</ref>\n\nBecause there are [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] of Northwest African Romance words, in many cases one can assume that they come from different Romance languages or that they originate from different periods.

According to him, several other authors adventured themselves to discover be it some parts of this extinct language.\n\nDue to the historical presence in Northwest Africa of Classical Latin, modern Romance languages, as well as the influence of the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]] (that has Romance vocabulary) makes it very difficult to differentiate the precise origin of words in [[Berber languages]] and in the varieties of [[Maghrebi Arabic]].\n\nGenerally speaking, words originally from African Romance are:\n* The words ending with ''-u'' (for example, the Berber ''abekkadu'' \"sin\", from ''peccatum'') and not ''-us'' (as in the Berber ''asnus'' \"(young) donkey\");\n* The words having a phonological or morphological aspect different from that of Italian, French or Spanish (for instance the Berber word ''agursel'' \"mushroom\", supposing the base *AGARICELLUS).{{Clarify|reason=Which Berber language(s) are the example words taken from? And what about *agursel* makes it clearly African Romance as opposed, e.g., to Spanish?|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe studies concerning the African Romance are difficult and often highly conjectural. Another difficulty comes from that, considering the immensity of the North-African territory, it is highly probable that not one but several varieties of African Romance existed, much like the wide variety of Romance languages in Europe.<ref>Franco Fanciullo, ''Un capitolo della Romania submersa: il latino africano'', pp. 162-187.</ref>\n\nBecause there are [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] of Northwest African Romance words, in many cases one can assume that they come from different Romance languages or that they originate from different periods.

At the same time, smaller [[municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 271 before 1 January 2006, when [[\u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality]] was created, to 98. The Capital Region has 29 municipalities. The regional council consists of 41 [[2017 Danish local elections|elected]] politicians. The chairman as of 1 January 2014 is [[Sophie H\u00e6storp Andersen]]. She is a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats political party]]. The reform was implemented on January 1, 2007. The main task for the Danish regions are hospitals and healthcare. It is not to be confused with the [[Copenhagen metropolitan area|Copenhagen Metropolitan Area]] nor with the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. Unlike the counties (1970-2006) (Danish ''{{ill|Amtskommune|da|vertical-align=sup}}'' literally ''county municipality'') the regions are not municipalities and are thus not allowed to have [[coat of arms]], but only [[logotype]]s, and cannot \"shuffle money around\" from one area of expenditure to another area of expenditure, that is, use money for any other purpose than has been stated specifically, but must pay money not used back rather like departments or agencies of the central government. The regions do not levy any taxes but are financed only through [[block grant]]s.\n\nFor population growth, see [[Regions of Denmark#Population growth|Regions of Denmark]].\n\nFor information about the reform, see [[Municipalities of Denmark]].\n\nMunicipalities of the regions can be accessed from the Municipalities of Denmark template at the bottom of the page.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Capital Region of Denmark is one of five regions in [[Denmark]] and consists of the municipalities of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg]], the former counties of [[Copenhagen County|Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksborg County|Frederiksborg]], and the regional municipality of [[Bornholm]]. In Danish the name is Region Hovedstaden. It borders [[Region Zealand|Zealand]] and [[Sweden]]'s [[Sk\u00e5ne County]] via the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]].\n\nDenmark's largest lake (Danish ''s\u00f8''), [[Arres\u00f8]], lies 43 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of Copenhagen. There are several other lakes, the deepest in Denmark being [[Fures\u00f8 (lake)|Fures\u00f8]], 14.5&nbsp;km (9 miles) [[Frederiksdal House|northwest]] of Copenhagen, which is the namesake of [[Fures\u00f8 Municipality]]. Among several forests the region also has [[Gribskov]],<ref>[http://naturstyrelsen.dk/drift-og-pleje/arealoversigt/nordsjaelland/  401 Gribskov] Retrieved 20 January 2018</ref> namesake of [[Gribskov Municipality]]. The forest park [[Dyrehaven]] is just north of Copenhagen (and east of Fures\u00f8) in [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]] and [[Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k Municipality|Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k]].\n\n[[Geology|Geologically]] the region lies in the northern part of [[Denmark]] which is rising because of [[post-glacial rebound]], making lakes out of former inlets and bays, of which Arres\u00f8 is one example, having extended in a northwesterly direction as a part of [[Br\u00f8demose Sund]] into [[Kattegat]].<ref>[[Den Store Danske Encyklop\u00e6di]], article:Danmark, volume 4, page 542, illustration ''Landskabets dannelse''</ref> (The land is rising by [[Metre|9 millimeters]] every year in {{ill|Furu\u00f6grund|sv|Furu\u00f6grund#Landh\u00f6jningen|vertical-align=sup}}, the northeastern part of [[Skellefte\u00e5 Municipality]], north of [[Kvarken]].) Because of the mobility of the [[Inland dune|sand dunes]], forests have been planted along the coast of [[Kattegat]] in the municipalities of [[Helsing\u00f8r Municipality|Helsing\u00f8r]], [[Gribskov Municipality|Gribskov]], and [[Halsn\u00e6s Municipality|Halsn\u00e6s]].\n\nWithout the remote island municipality Bornholm, located {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Copenhagen and {{convert|135|km|mi|abbr=on}} directly east of [[Vordingborg Municipality]] ([[M\u00f8n]]) (across the [[Baltic Sea]]), and regarding only the land area of the 28 municipalities in and around Copenhagen, between 1,800 and 1,850 sq km (between 700 and 715 sq. mi.), 1,000 inhabitants per sq km will be reached in 2019 with a population as of 1 April 2019 at 1,800,076 persons, and 39,582 persons living on Bornholm.\n\nFor the purpose of the road and rail connection to [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] land has been added to [[Amager]], which has a tunnel connecting it with the artificial island [[Peberholm]] just south of [[Saltholm]]. The land area of east Denmark (east of the [[Great Belt]] [[strait]]) is approximately 9,622 sq km (year?) (3,715 sq mi), possibly slightly more with new land added because of housing projects in the north of [[Copenhagen Municipality]] and the bridge and tunnels including the [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link]] and other traffic infrastructure projects. A new [[Copenhagen-Ringsted Line]] came into operation 1 June 2019 to increase transport capacity and relieve congestion in [[Roskilde]] and the narrow 9-9.5 mile [[isthmus]] between [[Roskilde Fjord]] and [[K\u00f8ge Bugt]] by moving international and national train traffic to the new train line and only keeping local and regional traffic.\n\nBefore 2007, a [[Danish Capital Region]] ({{lang-da|Hovedstadsregionen}}) did exist, but it did not cover exactly the same area and did not have the same legal functions.\n\nThe primary function and largest expenditure, around 90% of the budget, of the Capital Region, as with all the regions of Denmark, is to own and operate the hospital and health service of the region.\n\nIn the east of Denmark there is one traffic region covered by [[Movia (transit agency)|Movia]], which is owned by the Capital Region of Denmark and [[Region Zealand]] and 45 of the 46 municipalities. Because of its remote location Bornholm has its own traffic company, [[BAT (transit agency)|BAT]], formerly, when Bornholm was a county, ''Bornholms Amts Trafikselskab''.\n\nLikewise, in the east of Denmark the two regions and 45 of the 46 municipalities make up one employment region, and Bornholm is its own employment region. Bornholm also performs other tasks normally performed by the regions in the rest of Denmark. The municipality of Bornholm is therefore called ''Bornholm Regional Municipality''.

2007 as part of the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform, which abolished the traditional [[counties of Denmark|counties]] (Danish plural: ''amter'', singular: ''amt'') and set up five regions. At the same time, smaller [[municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 271 before 1 January 2006, when [[\u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality]] was created, to 98. The Capital Region has 29 municipalities. The regional council consists of 41 [[2017 Danish local elections|elected]] politicians. The chairman as of 1 January 2014 is [[Sophie H\u00e6storp Andersen]]. She is a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats political party]]. The reform was implemented on January 1, 2007. The main task for the Danish regions are hospitals and healthcare. It is not to be confused with the [[Copenhagen metropolitan area|Copenhagen Metropolitan Area]] nor with the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. Unlike the counties (1970-2006) (Danish ''{{ill|Amtskommune|da|vertical-align=sup}}'' literally ''county municipality'') the regions are not municipalities and are thus not allowed to have [[coat of arms]], but only [[logotype]]s, and cannot \"shuffle money around\" from one area of expenditure to another area of expenditure, that is, use money for any other purpose than has been stated specifically, but must pay money not used back rather like departments or agencies of the central government. The regions do not levy any taxes but are financed only through [[block grant]]s.\n\nFor population growth, see [[Regions of Denmark#Population growth|Regions of Denmark]].\n\nFor information about the reform, see [[Municipalities of Denmark]].\n\nMunicipalities of the regions can be accessed from the Municipalities of Denmark template at the bottom of the page.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Capital Region of Denmark is one of five regions in [[Denmark]] and consists of the municipalities of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg]], the former counties of [[Copenhagen County|Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksborg County|Frederiksborg]], and the regional municipality of [[Bornholm]]. In Danish the name is Region Hovedstaden. It borders [[Region Zealand|Zealand]] and [[Sweden]]'s [[Sk\u00e5ne County]] via the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]].\n\nDenmark's largest lake (Danish ''s\u00f8''), [[Arres\u00f8]], lies 43 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of Copenhagen. There are several other lakes, the deepest in Denmark being [[Fures\u00f8 (lake)|Fures\u00f8]], 14.5&nbsp;km (9 miles) [[Frederiksdal House|northwest]] of Copenhagen, which is the namesake of [[Fures\u00f8 Municipality]]. Among several forests the region also has [[Gribskov]],<ref>[http://naturstyrelsen.dk/drift-og-pleje/arealoversigt/nordsjaelland/  401 Gribskov] Retrieved 20 January 2018</ref> namesake of [[Gribskov Municipality]]. The forest park [[Dyrehaven]] is just north of Copenhagen (and east of Fures\u00f8) in [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]] and [[Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k Municipality|Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k]].\n\n[[Geology|Geologically]] the region lies in the northern part of [[Denmark]] which is rising because of [[post-glacial rebound]], making lakes out of former inlets and bays, of which Arres\u00f8 is one example, having extended in a northwesterly direction as a part of [[Br\u00f8demose Sund]] into [[Kattegat]].<ref>[[Den Store Danske Encyklop\u00e6di]], article:Danmark, volume 4, page 542, illustration ''Landskabets dannelse''</ref>(The land is rising by [[Metre|9 millimeters]] every year in Furu\u00f6grund (Swedish Wikipedia {{ill|Furu\u00f6grund|sv|Furu\u00f6grund#Landh\u00f6jningen|vertical-align=sup}}), the northeastern part of [[Skellefte\u00e5 Municipality]], north of [[Kvarken]].) Because of the mobility of the [[Inland dune|sand dunes]], forests have been planted along the coast of [[Kattegat]] in the municipalities of [[Helsing\u00f8r Municipality|Helsing\u00f8r]], [[Gribskov Municipality|Gribskov]], and [[Halsn\u00e6s Municipality|Halsn\u00e6s]].\n\nWithout the remote island municipality Bornholm, located {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Copenhagen and {{convert|135|km|mi|abbr=on}} directly east of [[Vordingborg Municipality]] ([[M\u00f8n]]) (across the [[Baltic Sea]]), and regarding only the land area of the 28 municipalities in and around Copenhagen, between 1,800 and 1,850 sq km (between 700 and 715 sq. mi.), 1,000 inhabitants per sq km will be reached in 2019 with a population as of 1 April 2019 at 1,800,076 persons, and 39,582 persons living on Bornholm.\n\nFor the purpose of the road and rail connection to [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] land has been added to [[Amager]], which has a tunnel connecting it with the artificial island [[Peberholm]] just south of [[Saltholm]]. The land area of east Denmark (east of the [[Great Belt]] [[strait]]) is approximately 9,622 sq km (year?) (3,715 sq mi), possibly slightly more with new land added because of housing projects in the north of [[Copenhagen Municipality]] and the bridge and tunnels including the [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link]] and other traffic infrastructure projects. A new [[Copenhagen-Ringsted Line]] came into operation 1 June 2019 to increase transport capacity and relieve congestion in [[Roskilde]] and the narrow 9-9.5 mile [[isthmus]] between [[Roskilde Fjord]] and [[K\u00f8ge Bugt]] by moving international and national train traffic to the new train line and only keeping local and regional traffic.\n\nBefore 2007, a [[Danish Capital Region]] ({{lang-da|Hovedstadsregionen}}) did exist, but it did not cover exactly the same area and did not have the same legal functions.\n\nThe primary function and largest expenditure, around 90% of the budget, of the Capital Region, as with all the regions of Denmark, is to own and operate the hospital and health service of the region.\n\nIn the east of Denmark there is one traffic region covered by [[Movia (transit agency)|Movia]], which is owned by the Capital Region of Denmark and [[Region Zealand]] and 45 of the 46 municipalities. Because of its remote location Bornholm has its own traffic company, [[BAT (transit agency)|BAT]], formerly, when Bornholm was a county, ''Bornholms Amts Trafikselskab''.\n\nLikewise, in the east of Denmark the two regions and 45 of the 46 municipalities make up one employment region, and Bornholm is its own employment region. Bornholm also performs other tasks normally performed by the regions in the rest of Denmark. The municipality of Bornholm is therefore called ''Bornholm Regional Municipality''. In some respects the island forms a region of its own.\n\nAs Denmark is a [[unitary state]], its \"capital region\" is not a [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]], but merely one among several [[regions of Denmark]], that happens to contain the national capital.\n\nThe region does not include the [[Ertholmene]] [[archipelago]] which is situated to the northeast of Bornholm.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 122.2 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 40.6% of Denmarks economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 50,000 \u20ac or 166% of the EU27 average in the same year. GDP per person employed was 130% of the EU27 average.

These include the [[haiku]], [[Waka (poetry)|tanka]], and [[I Novel]], although modern writers generally avoid these writing styles. Historically, many works have sought to capture or codify traditional Japanese cultural values and aesthetics. Some of the most famous of these include [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (1021), about [[Heian period|Heian]] court culture; [[Miyamoto Musashi]]'s ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'' (1645), concerning military strategy; [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]]'s ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (1691), a [[Travel literature|travelogue]]; and [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]]'s essay \"[[In Praise of Shadows]]\" (1933), which contrasts Eastern and Western cultures.\n\nFollowing the [[Black Ships|opening of Japan]] to the West in 1854, some works of this style were written in English by natives of Japan; they include ''[[Bushido: The Soul of Japan]]'' by [[Nitobe Inaz\u014d]] (1900), concerning ''[[samurai]]'' ethics, and ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' by [[Okakura Kakuz\u014d]] (1906), which deals with the philosophical implications of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. Western observers have often attempted to evaluate Japanese society as well, to varying degrees of success; one of the most well-known and controversial works resulting from this is [[Ruth Benedict]]'s ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' (1946).\n\nTwentieth-century Japanese writers recorded changes in Japanese society through their works. Some of the most notable authors included [[Natsume S\u014dseki]], [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]], [[Osamu Dazai]], [[Fumiko Enchi]], [[Akiko Yosano]], [[Yukio Mishima]], and [[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba]]. Popular contemporary authors such as [[Ry\u016b Murakami]], [[Haruki Murakami]], and [[Banana Yoshimoto]] have been translated into many languages and enjoy international followings, and [[Yasunari Kawabata]] and [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\n==Arts==\n{{Main|Japanese art|Japanese architecture}}\n[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|The print ''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning|Red Fuji]]'' from [[Hokusai|Katsushika Hokusai]]'s series, ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'']]\nDecorative arts in Japan date back to prehistoric times. [[J\u014dmon pottery]] includes examples with elaborate ornamentation. In the [[Yayoi period]], artisans produced mirrors, spears, and ceremonial bells known as ''[[d\u014dtaku]].'' Later burial mounds, or ''[[kofun]],'' preserve characteristic clay ''[[haniwa]],'' as well as wall paintings.\n\nBeginning in the [[Nara period]], painting, [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]] flourished under strong Confucian and Buddhist influences from [[Japanese missions to Tang China|China]]. Among the architectural achievements of this period are the [[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]] and the [[Yakushi-ji]], two [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples in [[Nara Prefecture]]. After the cessation of official relations with the [[Tang dynasty]] in the ninth century, Japanese art and architecture gradually became less influenced by China. Extravagant art and clothing was commissioned by nobles to decorate their court, and although the aristocracy was quite limited in size and power, many of these pieces are still extant. After the [[T\u014ddai-ji]] was attacked and burned during the [[Genpei War]], a special office of restoration was founded, and the T\u014ddai-ji became an important artistic center. The leading masters of the time were [[Unkei]] and [[Kaikei]].{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nPainting advanced in the [[Muromachi period]] in the form of [[ink wash painting]] under the influence of [[Zen Buddhism]] as practiced by such masters as [[Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d]]. Zen Buddhist tenets were also elaborated into the [[tea ceremony]] during the [[Sengoku period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the polychrome painting screens of the [[Kan\u014d school]] were made influential thanks to their powerful patrons (including the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawas]]). Popular artists created ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', woodblock prints for sale to commoners in the flourishing cities. Pottery such as [[Imari ware]] was highly valued as far away as Europe.\n\nIn theater, [[Noh]] is a traditional, spare dramatic form that developed in tandem with [[ky\u014dgen]] farce. In stark contrast to the restrained refinement of noh, [[kabuki]], an \"explosion of color\", uses every possible stage trick for dramatic effect. Plays include sensational events such as suicides, and many such works were performed in both kabuki and [[bunraku]] puppet theaters.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nSince the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan has absorbed elements of Western culture and has given them a \"Japanese\" feel or modification into it. Its modern decorative, practical and performing arts works span a spectrum ranging from the traditions of Japan to purely Western modes. Products of popular culture, including [[J-pop]], [[Japanese rock|J-rock]], [[manga]] and [[anime]] have found audiences and fans around the world.\n\n==History==\n===Theories of origins===\n<!-- NOTE: THIS IS A SUMMARY SECTION providing a broad overview of various prominent theories of origins.

Following a population expansion in [[Neolithic]] times, these newcomers then found their way to the Japanese archipelago sometime during the Yayoi period. As a result, admixture was common in the island regions of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Honsh\u016b]], but did not prevail in the outlying islands of [[Okinawa]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and the Ryukyuan and Ainu people continued to dominate there.

The J\u014dmon people were [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers, though at least one middle to late J\u014dmon site ({{nihongo|Minami Mizote|\u5357\u6e9d\u624b}}, ca. 1200\u20131000 BC) had a primitive rice-growing [[agriculture]]. They relied primarily on fish for protein.\n\nSome, including anthropologist Joseph Powell, believe that the J\u014dmon migrated from [[South Asia]] or [[Southeast Asia]] and became the Ainu of today.<ref name=\"NPS Chapter 2\">Powell, Joseph F.; Rose, Jerome C.

The Yayoi brought [[Paddy field|wet-rice farming]] and advanced [[bronze]] and [[iron]] technology to Japan. The more productive [[paddy field]] systems allowed the communities to support larger populations and spread over time, in turn becoming the basis for more advanced [[institution]]s and heralding the new [[civilization]] of the succeeding [[Kofun period]].\n\nThe estimated population of Japan in the late J\u014dmon period was about one hundred thousand, compared to about three million by the [[Nara period]]. Taking the growth rates of hunting and agricultural societies into account, it is calculated that about one and half million immigrants moved to Japan in the period.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} According to Ann Kumar, the Yayoi created the \"Japanese-hierarchical society\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Kumar |first=Ann |year=2009 |title=Globalizing the Prehistory of Japan: Language, Genes and Civilization. |location=Oxford |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\n==Colonialism==\n{{See also|Japanese colonial empire|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\n[[File:Location Japanese Empire.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Location of Imperial Japan]]\n\nDuring the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese colonial period]] of 1895 to 1945, the phrase \"Japanese people\" was used to refer not only to residents of the Japanese archipelago, but also to people from colonies who held Japanese [[citizenship]], such as [[Taiwanese people]] and [[Koreans|Korean people]].

These include the [[haiku]], [[Waka (poetry)|tanka]], and [[I Novel]], although modern writers generally avoid these writing styles. Historically, many works have sought to capture or codify traditional Japanese cultural values and aesthetics. Some of the most famous of these include [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (1021), about [[Heian period|Heian]] court culture; [[Miyamoto Musashi]]'s ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'' (1645), concerning military strategy; [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]]'s ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (1691), a [[Travel literature|travelogue]]; and [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]]'s essay \"[[In Praise of Shadows]]\" (1933), which contrasts Eastern and Western cultures.\n\nFollowing the [[Black Ships|opening of Japan]] to the West in 1854, some works of this style were written in English by natives of Japan; they include ''[[Bushido: The Soul of Japan]]'' by [[Nitobe Inaz\u014d]] (1900), concerning ''[[samurai]]'' ethics, and ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' by [[Okakura Kakuz\u014d]] (1906), which deals with the philosophical implications of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. Western observers have often attempted to evaluate Japanese society as well, to varying degrees of success; one of the most well-known and controversial works resulting from this is [[Ruth Benedict]]'s ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' (1946).\n\nTwentieth-century Japanese writers recorded changes in Japanese society through their works. Some of the most notable authors included [[Natsume S\u014dseki]], [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]], [[Osamu Dazai]], [[Fumiko Enchi]], [[Akiko Yosano]], [[Yukio Mishima]], and [[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba]]. Popular contemporary authors such as [[Ry\u016b Murakami]], [[Haruki Murakami]], and [[Banana Yoshimoto]] have been translated into many languages and enjoy international followings, and [[Yasunari Kawabata]] and [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\n==Arts==\n{{Main|Japanese art|Japanese architecture}}\n[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|The print ''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning|Red Fuji]]'' from [[Hokusai|Katsushika Hokusai]]'s series, ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'']]\nDecorative arts in Japan date back to prehistoric times. [[J\u014dmon pottery]] includes examples with elaborate ornamentation. In the [[Yayoi period]], artisans produced mirrors, spears, and ceremonial bells known as ''[[d\u014dtaku]].'' Later burial mounds, or ''[[kofun]],'' preserve characteristic clay ''[[haniwa]],'' as well as wall paintings.\n\nBeginning in the [[Nara period]], painting, [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]] flourished under strong Confucian and Buddhist influences from [[Japanese missions to Tang China|China]]. Among the architectural achievements of this period are the [[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]] and the [[Yakushi-ji]], two [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples in [[Nara Prefecture]]. After the cessation of official relations with the [[Tang dynasty]] in the ninth century, Japanese art and architecture gradually became less influenced by China. Extravagant art and clothing was commissioned by nobles to decorate their court, and although the aristocracy was quite limited in size and power, many of these pieces are still extant. After the [[T\u014ddai-ji]] was attacked and burned during the [[Genpei War]], a special office of restoration was founded, and the T\u014ddai-ji became an important artistic center. The leading masters of the time were [[Unkei]] and [[Kaikei]].{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nPainting advanced in the [[Muromachi period]] in the form of [[ink wash painting]] under the influence of [[Zen Buddhism]] as practiced by such masters as [[Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d]]. Zen Buddhist tenets were also elaborated into the [[tea ceremony]] during the [[Sengoku period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the polychrome painting screens of the [[Kan\u014d school]] were made influential thanks to their powerful patrons (including the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawas]]). Popular artists created ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', woodblock prints for sale to commoners in the flourishing cities. Pottery such as [[Imari ware]] was highly valued as far away as Europe.\n\nIn theater, [[Noh]] is a traditional, spare dramatic form that developed in tandem with [[ky\u014dgen]] farce. In stark contrast to the restrained refinement of noh, [[kabuki]], an \"explosion of color\", uses every possible stage trick for dramatic effect. Plays include sensational events such as suicides, and many such works were performed in both kabuki and [[bunraku]] puppet theaters.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nSince the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan has absorbed elements of Western culture and has given them a \"Japanese\" feel or modification into it. Its modern decorative, practical and performing arts works span a spectrum ranging from the traditions of Japan to purely Western modes. Products of popular culture, including [[J-pop]], [[Japanese rock|J-rock]], [[manga]] and [[anime]] have found audiences and fans around the world.\n\n==History==\n===Theories of origins===\n<!-- NOTE: THIS IS A SUMMARY SECTION providing a broad overview of various prominent theories of origins.

Following a population expansion in [[Neolithic]] times, these newcomers then found their way to the Japanese archipelago sometime during the Yayoi period. As a result, admixture was common in the island regions of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Honsh\u016b]], but did not prevail in the outlying islands of [[Okinawa]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and the Ryukyuan and Ainu people continued to dominate there.

The Yayoi brought [[Paddy field|wet-rice farming]] and advanced [[bronze]] and [[iron]] technology to Japan. The more productive [[paddy field]] systems allowed the communities to support larger populations and spread over time, in turn becoming the basis for more advanced [[institution]]s and heralding the new [[civilization]] of the succeeding [[Kofun period]].\n\nThe estimated population of Japan in the late J\u014dmon period was about one hundred thousand, compared to about three million by the [[Nara period]].

She was constantly in trouble, saying she was \u201cused to the whippings\u201d and spent her time watching over her grandmother since her grandmother always watched over her. Throughout the story, the grandmother becomes more and more ill, while the narrator becomes more and more responsible. When the cancer finally kills the grandmother, the granddaughter continues to take care of her, undressing her and cleansing her in the tub, as she holds her and rocks her back and forth saying \u201cthere, there Abuelita\u201d.
