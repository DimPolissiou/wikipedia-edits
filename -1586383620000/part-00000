L\u0103z\u0103reanu-L\u0103zuric\u0103''' or '''George L\u0103zuric\u0103''', also known as '''L\u0103z\u0103rescu-L\u0103zuric\u0103''' or '''L\u0103z\u0103ric\u0103''' (1892 \u2013 ?), was a leader of the [[Romani people in Romania|Romani (Gypsy) community]] in [[Romania]], also remembered for his support of Romania's interwar far-right. Originally a musician, he became active within the General Association of Gypsies in Romania, but broke away to establish the (eventually more powerful) General Union of Roma in Romania. From September 1933 to May 1934, he was also a \"[[King of the Gypsies|Voivode of the Gypsies]]\", recognized as such by various local tribes. He and his followers came to resent ethnic designation as \"Gypsies\", and pleaded for the usage of \"Romanies\". L\u0103zuric\u0103 also tried to introduce the term ''Zgrip\u021bi'' as a reference to the people's legendary ancestors.\n\nThough credited with inventing Romani political symbolism and noted for invoking a worldwide tribal identity, L\u0103zuric\u0103 and his followers abstained from Romani nationalist activism, preferring to focus on social reform, and accepted some measure of integration with mainstream Romanian society. The General Union cooperated with the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], spreading Christianity among nomads whom it helped to settle, and competing for baptisms with the [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church|Romanian Greek Catholics]]. From 1933, L\u0103zuric\u0103 blended his Romani identity with [[Romanian nationalism]], and finally with fascism: he campaigned for the [[National Agrarian Party (Romania)|National Agrarian Party]] and maintained contacts with the [[Iron Guard]], while allegedly imitating [[Adolf Hitler]] in his public persona.\n\nL\u0103zuric\u0103 was sidelined by the General Union in 1934, after a violent conflict during which he was forced to deny his belonging to the Romani ethnicity. He soon recanted and involved himself in other projects, with reports suggesting that he was planning a research trip to the [[British Raj]], or that he declared himself \"President\" of the Romanian Romanies. He still attempted to rally support for his politics, and in 1937 became leader of the Citizens' Association of Roma in Romania. This group was more explicitly far-right and antisemitic, viewing the Romanians and Romanies as people of a \"shared destiny\", equally threatened by foreigners. By 1938, it was openly supporting the fascist [[National Christian Party]], of which L\u0103zuric\u0103 himself became a member. In the final known stages of his career, L\u0103zuric\u0103 became a critic of Orthodoxy, reporting on its [[Slavery in Romania|slave-owning practices]] and drawing suspicion that he had converted to Catholicism.\n\n==Activities==\n===Rise to fame===\nReportedly born as Gheorghe L\u0103z\u0103rescu in 1892,<ref name=\"Williams, p. 23\">Williams, p. 23</ref> the future activist belonged to the musicians' tribe of the Romani community, or ''[[L\u0103utari]]''; one report of 1934 suggests that he was still an outstanding performer.<ref name=\"indes\">Michel Condrus, \"Une mission va rechercher aux Indes les orgines de la race tzigane\", in ''[[Le Journal (Paris)|Le Journal]]'', August 27, 1934, p. 4</ref> While sometimes introduced as \"Mr. L\u0103zuric\u0103 the lawyer\",<ref name=\"locale34\">\"\u0218tiri m\u0103runte.

Some of the first steps in this direction occurred in 1919 [[Transylvania]], which was in the process of [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|uniting with Romania]]. \"Gypsy gatherings\", which demanded increased rights and sedentarization of the Romanies within [[Greater Romania]], were nevertheless forgotten by the public, as even some of the active participants refrained from discussing them later in the interwar.<ref>Petre Matei, \"Adun\u0103rile \u021biganilor din Transilvania din anul 1919\", in ''Revista Istoric\u0103'', Part I: Vol. XXI, Issues 5\u20136, 2010, pp. 467\u2013487; Part II: Vol. XXII, Issues 1\u20132, 2011, pp. 135\u2013152.

See also Duminic\u0103, p. 95</ref> The Voivode's legitimacy was still challenged by the other Romani groups resulting from the AG\u021aR schism\u2014although, according to Mudure: \"the agenda of these organizations was pretty much the same. They were interested in creating educational opportunities for the Gypsies, welfare benefits, settling down the nomadic Gypsies, and improving the image of the Gypsies in the media.\"<ref name=\"Mudure, p. 65\"/> The two bodies had virtually identical agendas, though with some major differences of political vocabulary.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 171; Matei (2012), p. 59; Williams, p. 23</ref> In [[Oltenia]], a third group, headed by Aurel Manolescu-Dolj, collaborated with both national organizations in pursuing immediate objectives.<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 156\u2013157; Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 174; Matei (2012), pp. 65\u201367; Mudure, p. 65</ref> Manolescu-Dolj, who also styled himself \"Voivode\", rallied with the UGRR; his associate, [[Constantin S.

See also Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 184; Duminic\u0103, p. 95</ref> As argued by historian Petre Matei, he had had no objection to using ''\u021bigani'' as an [[endonym]] during his association with \u0218erboianu, and had left several written statements describing himself as a \"Gypsy\".<ref>Matei (2012), pp. 57\u201360</ref> Matei notes that the term was most likely suggested to him by [[Nicolae Constantin Batzaria]], the Romanian head editor at ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]''. In his column of September 5, 1933, Batzaria had chided \u0218erboianu for using an implicitly demeaning and hostile term, arguing for ''romi'' as both authentic and preferable.<ref>Matei (2012), pp. 59\u201360, 62</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103's first documented use of ''romi'' is dated by Matei to October 1933, in a manifesto which repeats Batzaria's attack on \u0218erboianu.<ref name=\"matei(12)60\">Matei (2012), p. 60</ref> His newfound appreciation for the term was challenged by the more senior activist Naftanail\u0103, who, by 1934, had reconciled with the word ''\u021bigani'' and was using it in the title of his rival newspaper, ''Neamul \u021aig\u0103nesc''.<ref>Matei (2012), pp. 56\u201357, 62, 65\u201366</ref>\n\nGenerally, L\u0103zuric\u0103 and his followers were primarily interested in cultural, spiritual, and especially social goals, which took precedence over shows of Romani nationalism; historians describe the view the UGRR as mixing social integrationism and cultural separatism.<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 156\u2013157; Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 171, 176\u2013177; Williams, pp. 23\u201326</ref> He took distance from Romani internationalism, asking Romanian authorities to ban \"foreign\" Romani orchestras from performing in the country, hoping to have the trade monopolized by ''L\u0103utari''.<ref>Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 182</ref> The UGRR banner displayed the symbols of Romani trades, which L\u0103zuric\u0103 wanted protected and promoted, alongside the [[coat of arms of Romania]]; at least 36 other banners existed, each representing an UGRR affiliate group.<ref name=\"Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 170, 202\"/> Proposals were accepted which were to create a national flag of the Romanies. Historian [[Ian Hancock]] claims that it was a horizontal bicolor, and as such a predecessor for the [[Flag of the Romani people|current Romani flag]]. However, this interpretation remains disputed.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 172, 202</ref>\n\n===Integration and nationalism===\nThe UGRR's newspaper, ''Glasul Romilor'', declared that the community would defend the Romanian state and its [[King of the Romanians|Kings]] \"until death.

Months before the [[1933 Romanian general election|general elections of 1933]], L\u0103zuric\u0103 was an agent for the hard-right [[National Agrarian Party]] (PNA), instructing the Romanies to cast their vote for its candidates.<ref>Oprescu, pp. 32\u201333; Varga, pp. 631, 632</ref> The AG\u021aR noticed such developments, accusing L\u0103zuric\u0103 of acting as a tool of the PNA leader, [[Octavian Goga]]. In turn, L\u0103zuric\u0103 depicted \u0218erboianu as an apostate of Orthodoxy, deflecting the charge of Greek Catholic proselytism toward the AG\u021aR itself.<ref name=\"Varga, p. 631\"/>\n\nHowever, by the time of the actual vote, he himself had switched sides, opting for the more mainstream [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] and asking that all Romanies do the same.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 202\u2013203; Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, p. 632</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103 was appointed to lead an UGRR delegation expressing support for [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion G.

This culminated with a mass baptism at [[Blaj]] on May 28, 1934.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 166</ref> Immediately after, on May 29<ref name=\"ziuam\"/><ref>Boangiu, p. 713; Dieaconu & Costachie, pp. 184, 185</ref> or May 31,<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 167\">Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 167</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103 was toppled from the UGRR chairmanship and then expelled altogether. His downfall was precipitated by the spread of rumors, nominating him as a \"fraud\" and \"Jew\", and claiming that the \"ex-Voivode\" had defrauded a veterinary doctor.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 204\u2013205</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103 had also recruited the brothers Gheorghe and Nicolae Nicolescu as the UGRR sponsors, but then saw them turning against him.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", pp. 166\u2013167</ref> The Nicolescus engineered L\u0103zuric\u0103's downfall, reportedly brutalizing him until he signed a document in which he falsely denied that he was a Romani. Denying him his ethnicity was a ruse not anticipated by their rival, who had otherwise made the position of chairman intangible.<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 167\"/>\n\nL\u0103zuric\u0103's replacement as UGRR leader, and also as Voivode, was Gheorghe Nicolescu, who served until 1941.<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 155\u2013156; Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 172, 173, 174, 204\u2013205</ref> Despite this change, the group continued to display fascist sympathies: according to one report, the 1935 Romani congress in Bucharest, presided upon by Nicolescu, was held in a hall decked with portraits of Hitler.<ref>Nicholas Saul, ''Gypsies and Orientalism in German Literature and Anthropology of the Long Nineteenth Century'', p. 161.

As noted by Matei, he produced a \"[[Romani mythology|national Romani mythology]]\" with echoes from \"[[Indian nationalism|Indianism]]\",<ref name=\"matei(12)60\"/> centered on a pseudohistorical ethnicity and ancestor of the Romani tribes\u2014called ''Zgrip\u021bi''.<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 172\">Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 172</ref> In August 1934, he was approached by [[Romanichal|English]] and [[Romani Americans|American Romani]] associations, who asked him to join an anthropological expedition to study the people's origins on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He reportedly accepted, claiming that such investigations would provide Romanies with a \"[[Zionism|Palestine of their own]]\".<ref name=\"indes\"/><ref>\"Ali dobe cigani svojo Palestino?\", in ''Slovenski Narod'', Issue 221/1934, p. 5</ref> A year later, he declared his intention to merge the world's Romanies into a single nation, announcing that he would set up his newspaper to promote his goal. He also stated his new conviction, namely that the Romani \"tribe\" was of [[ancient Egypt]]ian origin.<ref name=\"faraonov\"/> ''[[L'Intransigeant]]'' reporter Ren\u00e9 Benazec claimed that, in 1935, L\u0103zuric\u0103 was already styling himself \"President of the Romanies' Republic\", but that this title too had been usurped by a third Romani leader, who also stole and used L\u0103zuric\u0103's business card.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Benazec, \"Chez les pharaons des grands chemins.

They had only been driven out of their homeland by [[Mongol invasions of India|Mongol invasions]], splitting into three groups, only one of which was Egyptian.<ref>Duminic\u0103, pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\nFrom August 5, 1936, L\u0103zuric\u0103 was an honorary chairman of Apostol Matei's new group, called \"Redemption of the Romani Men and Women in Romania\";<ref name=\"ziuam\"/> he was colleagues there with [[Miron Cristea]], the [[Patriarch of All Romania]]. The \"Redemption\" expanded on the UGRR goals, promising protectionism for Romani traders, in preference to \"foreign\" ones, as well as envisaging full equality of treatment between Romanies and Romanians.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 174\u2013175</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103 was also in a position to destabilize Nicolescu's relationship with the Church, obtaining that UGRR men be stripped of their positions as Christian missionaries.<ref>Varga, p. 633. See also Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 169</ref> Nevertheless, Nicolescu was able to win over the Church, slowly pushing it away from its endorsement of L\u0103zuric\u0103.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", pp. 168\u2013170</ref>\n\nIn July 1937, writing for the Romani edition of ''\u021aara Noastr\u0103'', L\u0103zuric\u0103 attacked Romanian Jews, or \"kikes\", for being \"alien to the problems and national interests of the Romanian nation, playing the communist tune\"; Romanies, on the other hand, were loyal.<ref>Matei, \"Romii \u00een perioada interbelic\u0103\", p. 33</ref> He also announced the creation of a Citizens' Association of Roma in Romania (ACRR), which he insisted was not a separate ethnic party. It immediately formed a cartel with the PNC for the [[1937 Romanian local elections|local elections of that summer]], being promised that every [[Communes of Romania|commune]] would have at least one Romani councilor.<ref>Matei, \"Romii \u00een perioada interbelic\u0103\", pp. 33\u201334</ref> This alliance was ridiculed by the PNC's rivals from the [[National Peasants' Party]], but ''\u021aara Noastr\u0103'' defended it as a natural outcome: the Romanies and the Romanians \"shaped each other through a shared destiny\".<ref>Matei, \"Romii \u00een perioada interbelic\u0103\", pp. 34\u201335</ref>\n\nThis affiliation also reunited the deposed Voivode with rivals \u0218erboianu and Manolescu-Dolj, all of whom were accused by the UGRR of seeking to present themselves as PNC candidates in the [[1937 Romanian general election|general election of December]].<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 158\u2013159; Dieaconu & Costachie, pp. 185\u2013186</ref> The ACRR recruited its members in [[Dolj County|Dolj]] and [[Ialomi\u021ba County|Ialomi\u021ba]];<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 175, 201</ref> the former branch was under his direct supervision.<ref name=\"Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186\">Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186</ref> The UGRR press reacted against this new competitor, reviving claims that L\u0103zuric\u0103 was a crypto-Catholic who had personally promised [[Pope Pius XI]] that he would convert Romania's Romanies.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 201</ref> In September 1937, news agencies reported that L\u0103zuric\u0103 had been poisoned with [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]] by \"Left Wing Gipsies\", for being an \"ardent [[Nazism|Nazi]]\".<ref>\"Hemlock in Wine. Gipsy 'Prince' Poisoned\", in ''[[The Age]]'', September 3, 1937, p. 12</ref> Boangiu writes that, as the conflict between the two Voivodes was turning bitter, both figures engaged in \"obvious manipulation\" of the truth.<ref>Boangiu, p. 713</ref>\n\nAs noted by Matei, L\u0103zuric\u0103 and \u0218erboianu, who had fully reconciled, \"could pass for Romani leaders\" when negotiating with their PNC counterparts, Goga and [[A. C. Cuza]]; instead, the UGRR remained tied to the mainstream National Liberals.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 171</ref> The PNC government, appointed after the 1937 election, imposed laws for the \"[[Romanianization]]\" of Romania's economy, including the ouster of \"racial\" minorities; the Romanies, however, were entirely spared.<ref>Achim (2004), p. 163</ref> At an ACRR rally held at [[Craiova]] on February 2, 1938, L\u0103zuric\u0103 announced that he had joined the PNC and, again, that he supported its antisemitic doctrines.<ref>Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186; Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 633\u2013634</ref> He described Romania as invaded by Jewish \"lice\", and praised the PNC leadership for clamping down on the \"kikes' newspapers\".<ref>Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 633\u2013634</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nSoon after, the activities of all Romani groups were curtailed by the imposition of an [[1938 Constitution of Romania|authoritarian Constitution]] and of a single-party rule by the [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN).<ref>Achim (2004), p. 156; Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 173</ref> Nevertheless, the UGRR was still tolerated, the regime having concluded that it \"did not do anything which threatened the security of the state\".<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 205</ref> Its entire leadership, Nicolescu included, joined the Front as early as March 1938.<ref name=\"Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186\"/> The authoritarian drive pushed L\u0103zuric\u0103 away from Patriarch Cristea, who had been appointed Prime Minister after the PNC's recall. Both he and \u0218erboianu came to display their Catholic sympathies. In one such show of support for Catholicism, L\u0103zuric\u0103 abandoned references to the Dormition as a Romani holiday, and proclaimed the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] as the new date of reference.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", pp. 171\u2013172</ref>\n\nWith articles in ''\u021aara Noastr\u0103'' and ''Timpul'', L\u0103zuric\u0103 endorsed claims that Orthodoxy was a traditional persecutor of the ''Zgrip\u021bi'' and Romani people, which it had kept as [[Slavery in Romania|church slaves]].<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", pp. 171\u2013172. See also Duminic\u0103, p. 95</ref> Cristea reacted by having L\u0103zuric\u0103 removed from the ranks of its missionaries, citing concerns that he had converted. L\u0103zuric\u0103 informed his readers that he handed in his card myself, and that he felt \"sickened\" by the affair.<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 172\"/> The FRN's one measure against any Romanies was taken in December 1939, when nomads were forced to submit to inspections by public health officials.<ref>Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 634\u2013635</ref> As late as July 1940, Orthodox dignitaries still complained to the authorities about L\u0103zuric\u0103 and the ACRR having \"insulted the Church\". Their reports were most likely anachronistic, as neither the group nor its leader were still active by then.<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 172\"/>\n\nAlthough it banned all Romani organizations, the [[National Legionary State]], established by the Iron Guard that September, remained generally tolerant of the Romanies as a group. However, the influence of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[scientific racism]] began seeping into its official propaganda.<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 166\u2013167</ref> The subsequent period saw the emergence of a strong [[anti-Romanyism]] in Romanian society, and the degeneration of relations between Romani activists and the Romanian far-right. Shortly after his [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|clash with the Iron Guard]], dictator [[Ion Antonescu]] singled out the Romanies as fundamentally anti-social.<ref>Achim (2004), p. 168. See also Oprescu, p. 34</ref> According to Mudure, L\u0103zuric\u0103's activities, and the impact they had on Romani visibility, had unwittingly contributed to this conceptualization of a \"Gypsy problem\".<ref name=\"Mudure, p. 65\"/> This discourse was eventually adopted by the Antonescu regime, and produced the deportation of over 20,000 Romanies into the [[Transnistria Governorate]].<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 167\u2013185; Mudure, pp. 65\u201366; Oprescu, p. 34; Varga, pp. 635\u2013641</ref> For those Romanies who were deemed as more compliant, deportation was advertised as a work of colonization, granting each family a plot of land and a ready-built house.<ref>Oprescu, p. 34</ref> Around 1943, Romanian authorities began circulating the notion that the usage and recognition of ''romi'' was a liability, since it introduced confusion between Romanians and \"Gypsies\".<ref>Matei (2012), pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nFollowing [[King Michael's Coup|Antonescu's toppling]] in August 1944, the UGRR was reestablished, with Nicolescu as its leader, and with the specific goal of assisting Transnistria deportees making their way back home.<ref name=\"Achim 2010, pp. 452\u2013454\">Achim (2010), pp. 452\u2013454</ref> Renamed Romani People's Union, it survived for less than five years.

L\u0103z\u0103reanu-L\u0103zuric\u0103''' or '''George L\u0103zuric\u0103''', also known as '''L\u0103z\u0103rescu-L\u0103zuric\u0103''' or '''L\u0103z\u0103ric\u0103''' (1892 \u2013 ?), was a leader of the [[Romani people in Romania|Romani (Gypsy) community]] in [[Romania]], also remembered for his support of Romania's interwar far-right. Originally a musician, he became active within the General Association of Gypsies in Romania, but broke away to establish the (eventually more powerful) General Union of Roma in Romania. From September 1933 to May 1934, he was also a \"[[King of the Gypsies|Voivode of the Gypsies]]\", recognized as such by various local tribes. He and his followers came to resent ethnic designation as \"Gypsies\", and pleaded for the usage of \"Romanies\". L\u0103zuric\u0103 also tried to introduce the term ''Zgrip\u021bi'' as a reference to the people's legendary ancestors.\n\nThough credited with inventing Romani political symbolism and noted for invoking a worldwide tribal identity, L\u0103zuric\u0103 and his followers abstained from Romani nationalist activism, preferring to focus on social reform, and accepted some measure of integration with mainstream Romanian society. The General Union cooperated with the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], spreading Christianity among nomads whom it helped to settle, and competing for baptisms with the [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church|Romanian Greek Catholics]]. From 1933, L\u0103zuric\u0103 blended his Romani identity with [[Romanian nationalism]], and finally with fascism: he campaigned for the [[National Agrarian Party (Romania)|National Agrarian Party]] and maintained contacts with the [[Iron Guard]], while allegedly imitating [[Adolf Hitler]] in his public persona.\n\nL\u0103zuric\u0103 was sidelined by the General Union in 1934, after a violent conflict during which he was forced to deny his belonging to the Romani ethnicity. He soon recanted and involved himself in other projects, with reports suggesting that he was planning a research trip to the [[British Raj]], or that he declared himself \"President\" of the Romanian Romanies. He still attempted to rally support for his politics, and in 1937 became leader of the Citizens' Association of Roma in Romania. This group was more explicitly far-right and antisemitic, viewing the Romanians and Romanies as people of a \"shared destiny\", equally threatened by foreigners. By 1938, it was openly supporting the fascist [[National Christian Party]], of which L\u0103zuric\u0103 himself became a member. In the final known stages of his career, L\u0103zuric\u0103 became a critic of Orthodoxy, reporting on its [[Slavery in Romania|slave-owning practices]] and drawing suspicion that he had converted to Catholicism.\n\n==Activities==\n===Rise to fame===\nReportedly born as Gheorghe L\u0103z\u0103rescu in 1892,<ref name=\"Williams, p. 23\">Williams, p. 23</ref> the future activist belonged to the musicians' tribe of the Romani community, or ''[[L\u0103utari]]''; one report of 1934 suggests that he was still an outstanding performer.<ref name=\"indes\">Michel Condrus, \"Une mission va rechercher aux Indes les orgines de la race tzigane\", in ''[[Le Journal (Paris)|Le Journal]]'', August 27, 1934, p. 4</ref> While sometimes introduced as \"Mr. L\u0103zuric\u0103 the lawyer\",<ref name=\"locale34\">\"\u0218tiri m\u0103runte.

Some of the first steps in this direction occurred in 1919 [[Transylvania]], which was in the process of [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|uniting with Romania]]. \"Gypsy gatherings\", which demanded increased rights and sedentarization of the Romanies within [[Greater Romania]], were nevertheless forgotten by the public, as even some of the active participants refrained from discussing them later in the interwar.<ref>Petre Matei, \"Adun\u0103rile \u021biganilor din Transilvania din anul 1919\", in ''Revista Istoric\u0103'', Part I: Vol. XXI, Issues 5\u20136, 2010, pp. 467\u2013487; Part II: Vol. XXII, Issues 1\u20132, 2011, pp. 135\u2013152.

This title had never been claimed by any Romani tribal leader in Romania, where preference had been given to lesser ones, including ''[[Buliba\u0219a]]'' and ''[[V\u0103taf]]''.<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 157\u2013158</ref> The same is argued by researchers Daniel Dieaconu and Silviu Costachie, who see L\u0103zuric\u0103 as having embraced a \"romantic myth\" of purely Western European extraction.<ref>Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 184</ref> Scholar Mihaela Mudure also notes that the usage of \"Voivode\" was meant to evoke a \"romanticized version of Gypsy leadership\" and command \"feudal\" loyalty from UGRR members; \"democratic practices\", she argues, \"were very limited.\"<ref name=\"Mudure, p. 65\">Mudure, p. 65</ref> While the 28-member executive committee worked pro-bono, L\u0103zuric\u0103, as the UGRR acting president, received unconditional refunding for all his expenses.<ref name=\"Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 169\"/> L\u0103zuric\u0103 surrounded himself with distinguished members of the community: violinist [[Grigora\u0219 Dinicu]] assisted him as honorary chairman, though he had initially resisted his own appointment;<ref name=\"afm352\" /> historian [[George Potra]] and musician D.

See also Duminic\u0103, p. 95</ref> The Voivode's legitimacy was still challenged by the other Romani groups resulting from the AG\u021aR schism\u2014although, according to Mudure: \"the agenda of these organizations was pretty much the same. They were interested in creating educational opportunities for the Gypsies, welfare benefits, settling down the nomadic Gypsies, and improving the image of the Gypsies in the media.\"<ref name=\"Mudure, p. 65\"/> The two bodies had virtually identical agendas, though with some major differences of political vocabulary.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 171; Matei (2012), p. 59; Williams, p. 23</ref> In [[Oltenia]], a third group, headed by Aurel Manolescu-Dolj, collaborated with both national organizations in pursuing immediate objectives.<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 156\u2013157; Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 174; Matei (2012), pp. 65\u201367; Mudure, p. 65</ref> Manolescu-Dolj, who also styled himself \"Voivode\", rallied with the UGRR; his associate, [[Constantin S.

See also Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 184; Duminic\u0103, p. 95</ref> As argued by historian Petre Matei, he had had no objection to using ''\u021bigani'' as an [[endonym]] during his association with \u0218erboianu, and had left several written statements describing himself as a \"Gypsy\".<ref>Matei (2012), pp. 57\u201360</ref> Matei notes that the term was most likely suggested to him by [[Nicolae Constantin Batzaria]], the Romanian head editor at ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]''. In his column of September 5, 1933, Batzaria had chided \u0218erboianu for using an implicitly demeaning and hostile term, arguing for ''romi'' as both authentic and preferable.<ref>Matei (2012), pp. 59\u201360, 62</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103's first documented use of ''romi'' is dated by Matei to October 1933, in a manifesto which repeats Batzaria's attack on \u0218erboianu.<ref name=\"matei(12)60\">Matei (2012), p. 60</ref> His newfound appreciation for the term was challenged by the more senior activist Naftanail\u0103, who, by 1934, had reconciled with the word ''\u021bigani'' and was using it in the title of his rival newspaper, ''Neamul \u021aig\u0103nesc''.<ref>Matei (2012), pp. 56\u201357, 62, 65\u201366</ref>\n\nGenerally, L\u0103zuric\u0103 and his followers were primarily interested in cultural, spiritual, and especially social goals, which took precedence over shows of Romani nationalism; historians describe the view the UGRR as mixing social integrationism and cultural separatism.<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 156\u2013157; Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 171, 176\u2013177; Williams, pp. 23\u201326</ref> He took distance from Romani internationalism, asking Romanian authorities to ban \"foreign\" Romani orchestras from performing in the country, hoping to have the trade monopolized by ''L\u0103utari''.<ref>Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 182</ref> The UGRR banner displayed the symbols of Romani trades, which L\u0103zuric\u0103 wanted protected and promoted, alongside the [[coat of arms of Romania]]; at least 36 other banners existed, each representing an UGRR affiliate group.<ref name=\"Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 170, 202\"/> Proposals were accepted which were to create a national flag of the Romanies. Historian [[Ian Hancock]] claims that it was a horizontal bicolor, and as such a predecessor for the [[Flag of the Romani people|current Romani flag]]. However, this interpretation remains disputed.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 172, 202</ref>\n\n===Integration and nationalism===\nThe UGRR's newspaper, ''Glasul Romilor'', declared that the community would defend the Romanian state and its [[King of the Romanians|Kings]] \"until death. Within our brother Roma[ni] we have never found of traitor to the State.\" Subsequent articles \"focused on the same three overarching themes of God, King and Country\".<ref>Williams, p. 25</ref> In its program, the Union pledged to support the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] against proselytizing \"sects\", and promised to oversee Romani processions on [[Dormition of the Mother of God|Dormition Feast]] ([[August 15 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|August 15]], chosen by the UGRR as a \"National Day\").<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 169\u2013170, 176; Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 171</ref> This goal was tempered by other public statements, with L\u0103zuric\u0103 reassuring his followers that they would have freedom of worship.<ref name=\"locale34\"/><ref name=\"lablaj\"/> As noted by Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, the Voivode was spuriously accused by other Romanies of wanting to make his community an appendage of official Orthodoxy; in fact, he \"could have used the support and resources of the Church to further [his] own mobilization goals.\"<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 176</ref>\n\nOn February 6, 1934, L\u0103zuric\u0103 was granted a missionary card, which he used as his ID, notably during trips to [[Hunedoara County]] in October 1934.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", pp. 165\u2013166, 169</ref> He managed to settle some nomads on land purchased by the UGRR, persuading them to undergo baptism and church marriage, also setting up a workers' co-operative and Romani-staffed schools.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 171\u2013172; Williams, pp. 24\u201325.

Months before the [[1933 Romanian general election|general elections of 1933]], L\u0103zuric\u0103 was an agent for the hard-right [[National Agrarian Party]] (PNA), instructing the Romanies to cast their vote for its candidates.<ref>Oprescu, pp. 32\u201333; Varga, pp. 631, 632</ref> The AG\u021aR noticed such developments, accusing L\u0103zuric\u0103 of acting as a tool of the PNA leader, [[Octavian Goga]]. In turn, L\u0103zuric\u0103 depicted \u0218erboianu as an apostate of Orthodoxy, deflecting the charge of Greek Catholic proselytism toward the AG\u021aR itself.<ref name=\"Varga, p. 631\"/>\n\nHowever, by the time of the actual vote, he himself had switched sides, opting for the more mainstream [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] and asking that all Romanies do the same.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 202\u2013203; Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, p. 632</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103 was appointed to lead an UGRR delegation expressing support for [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion G. Duca]], while also pressing him to respond favorably to the Romanies' demands.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 203</ref> At the same time, Manolescu-Dolj and his followers took a different path, and canvassed for the [[National Liberal Party-Br\u0103tianu|Georgist Liberals]].<ref>Achim (2004), p. 158; Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 185</ref> As read by Mudure, these strategies meant \"offering to certain Romanian mainstream politicians the support of the Gypsy vote in exchange for affirmative action policies for the Gypsies.\"<ref name=\"Mudure, p. 65\"/>\n\nL\u0103zuric\u0103's final work within the General Union was a massive effort to bring Transylvania's Romanies into the Orthodox church, which included reversing their [[Magyarization]]. This culminated with a mass baptism at [[Blaj]] on May 28, 1934.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 166</ref> Immediately after, on May 29<ref name=\"ziuam\"/><ref>Boangiu, p. 713; Dieaconu & Costachie, pp. 184, 185</ref> or May 31,<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 167\">Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 167</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103 was toppled from the UGRR chairmanship and then expelled altogether. His downfall was precipitated by the spread of rumors, nominating him as a \"fraud\" and \"Jew\", and claiming that the \"ex-Voivode\" had defrauded a veterinary doctor.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 204\u2013205</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103 had also recruited the brothers Gheorghe and Nicolae Nicolescu as the UGRR sponsors, but then saw them turning against him.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", pp. 166\u2013167</ref> The Nicolescus engineered L\u0103zuric\u0103's downfall, reportedly brutalizing him until he signed a document in which he falsely denied that he was a Romani. Denying him his ethnicity was a ruse not anticipated by their rival, who had otherwise made the position of chairman intangible.<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 167\"/>\n\nL\u0103zuric\u0103's replacement as UGRR leader, and also as Voivode, was Gheorghe Nicolescu, who served until 1941.<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 155\u2013156; Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 172, 173, 174, 204\u2013205</ref> Despite this change, the group continued to display fascist sympathies: according to one report, the 1935 Romani congress in Bucharest, presided upon by Nicolescu, was held in a hall decked with portraits of Hitler.<ref>Nicholas Saul, ''Gypsies and Orientalism in German Literature and Anthropology of the Long Nineteenth Century'', p. 161.

As noted by Matei, he produced a \"[[Romani mythology|national Romani mythology]]\" with echoes from \"[[Indian nationalism|Indianism]]\",<ref name=\"matei(12)60\"/> centered on a pseudohistorical ethnicity and ancestor of the Romani tribes\u2014called ''Zgrip\u021bi''.<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 172\">Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 172</ref> In August 1934, he was approached by [[Romanichal|English]] and [[Romani Americans|American Romani]] associations, who asked him to join an anthropological expedition to study the people's origins on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He reportedly accepted, claiming that such investigations would provide Romanies with a \"[[Zionism|Palestine of their own]]\".<ref name=\"indes\"/><ref>\"Ali dobe cigani svojo Palestino?\", in ''Slovenski Narod'', Issue 221/1934, p. 5</ref> A year later, he declared his intention to merge the world's Romanies into a single nation, announcing that he would set up his newspaper to promote his goal. He also stated his new conviction, namely that the Romani \"tribe\" was of [[ancient Egypt]]ian origin.<ref name=\"faraonov\"/> ''[[L'Intransigeant]]'' reporter Ren\u00e9 Benazec claimed that, in 1935, L\u0103zuric\u0103 was already styling himself \"President of the Romanies' Republic\", but that this title too had been usurped by a third Romani leader, who also stole and used L\u0103zuric\u0103's business card.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Benazec, \"Chez les pharaons des grands chemins.

They had only been driven out of their homeland by [[Mongol invasions of India|Mongol invasions]], splitting into three groups, only one of which was Egyptian.<ref>Duminic\u0103, pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\nFrom August 5, 1936, L\u0103zuric\u0103 was an honorary chairman of Apostol Matei's new group, called \"Redemption of the Romani Men and Women in Romania\";<ref name=\"ziuam\"/> he was colleagues there with [[Miron Cristea]], the [[Patriarch of All Romania]]. The \"Redemption\" expanded on the UGRR goals, promising protectionism for Romani traders, in preference to \"foreign\" ones, as well as envisaging full equality of treatment between Romanies and Romanians.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 174\u2013175</ref> L\u0103zuric\u0103 was also in a position to destabilize Nicolescu's relationship with the Church, obtaining that UGRR men be stripped of their positions as Christian missionaries.<ref>Varga, p. 633. See also Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 169</ref> Nevertheless, Nicolescu was able to win over the Church, slowly pushing it away from its endorsement of L\u0103zuric\u0103.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", pp. 168\u2013170</ref>\n\nIn July 1937, writing for the Romani edition of ''\u021aara Noastr\u0103'', L\u0103zuric\u0103 attacked Romanian Jews, or \"kikes\", for being \"alien to the problems and national interests of the Romanian nation, playing the communist tune\"; Romanies, on the other hand, were loyal.<ref>Matei, \"Romii \u00een perioada interbelic\u0103\", p. 33</ref> He also announced the creation of a Citizens' Association of Roma in Romania (ACRR), which he insisted was not a separate ethnic party. It immediately formed a cartel with the PNC for the [[1937 Romanian local elections|local elections of that summer]], being promised that every [[Communes of Romania|commune]] would have at least one Romani councilor.<ref>Matei, \"Romii \u00een perioada interbelic\u0103\", pp. 33\u201334</ref> This alliance was ridiculed by the PNC's rivals from the [[National Peasants' Party]], but ''\u021aara Noastr\u0103'' defended it as a natural outcome: the Romanies and the Romanians \"shaped each other through a shared destiny\".<ref>Matei, \"Romii \u00een perioada interbelic\u0103\", pp. 34\u201335</ref>\n\nThis affiliation also reunited the deposed Voivode with rivals \u0218erboianu and Manolescu-Dolj, all of whom were accused by the UGRR of seeking to present themselves as PNC candidates in the [[1937 Romanian general election|general election of December]].<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 158\u2013159; Dieaconu & Costachie, pp. 185\u2013186</ref> The ACRR recruited its members in [[Dolj County|Dolj]] and [[Ialomi\u021ba County|Ialomi\u021ba]];<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, pp. 175, 201</ref> the former branch was under his direct supervision.<ref name=\"Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186\">Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186</ref> The UGRR press reacted against this new competitor, reviving claims that L\u0103zuric\u0103 was a crypto-Catholic who had personally promised [[Pope Pius XI]] that he would convert Romania's Romanies.<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 201</ref> In September 1937, news agencies reported that L\u0103zuric\u0103 had been poisoned with [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]] by \"Left Wing Gipsies\", for being an \"ardent [[Nazism|Nazi]]\".<ref>\"Hemlock in Wine. Gipsy 'Prince' Poisoned\", in ''[[The Age]]'', September 3, 1937, p. 12</ref> Boangiu writes that, as the conflict between the two Voivodes was turning bitter, both figures engaged in \"obvious manipulation\" of the truth.<ref>Boangiu, p. 713</ref>\n\nAs noted by Matei, L\u0103zuric\u0103 and \u0218erboianu, who had fully reconciled, \"could pass for Romani leaders\" when negotiating with their PNC counterparts, Goga and [[A. C. Cuza]]; instead, the UGRR remained tied to the mainstream National Liberals.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", p. 171</ref> The PNC government, appointed after the 1937 election, imposed laws for the \"[[Romanianization]]\" of Romania's economy, including the ouster of \"racial\" minorities; the Romanies, however, were entirely spared.<ref>Achim (2004), p. 163</ref> At an ACRR rally held at [[Craiova]] on February 2, 1938, L\u0103zuric\u0103 announced that he had joined the PNC and, again, that he supported its antisemitic doctrines.<ref>Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186; Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 633\u2013634</ref> He described Romania as invaded by Jewish \"lice\", and praised the PNC leadership for clamping down on the \"kikes' newspapers\".<ref>Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 633\u2013634</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nSoon after, the activities of all Romani groups were curtailed by the imposition of an [[1938 Constitution of Romania|authoritarian Constitution]] and of a single-party rule by the [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN).<ref>Achim (2004), p. 156; Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 173</ref> Nevertheless, the UGRR was still tolerated, the regime having concluded that it \"did not do anything which threatened the security of the state\".<ref>Kl\u00edmov\u00e1-Alexander, p. 205</ref> Its entire leadership, Nicolescu included, joined the Front as early as March 1938.<ref name=\"Dieaconu & Costachie, p. 186\"/> The authoritarian drive pushed L\u0103zuric\u0103 away from Patriarch Cristea, who had been appointed Prime Minister after the PNC's recall. Both he and \u0218erboianu came to display their Catholic sympathies. In one such show of support for Catholicism, L\u0103zuric\u0103 abandoned references to the Dormition as a Romani holiday, and proclaimed the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] as the new date of reference.<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", pp. 171\u2013172</ref>\n\nWith articles in ''\u021aara Noastr\u0103'' and ''Timpul'', L\u0103zuric\u0103 endorsed claims that Orthodoxy was a traditional persecutor of the ''Zgrip\u021bi'' and Romani people, which it had kept as [[Slavery in Romania|church slaves]].<ref>Matei, \"Raporturile\", pp. 171\u2013172. See also Duminic\u0103, p. 95</ref> Cristea reacted by having L\u0103zuric\u0103 removed from the ranks of its missionaries, citing concerns that he had converted. L\u0103zuric\u0103 informed his readers that he handed in his card myself, and that he felt \"sickened\" by the affair.<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 172\"/> The FRN's one measure against any Romanies was taken in December 1939, when nomads were forced to submit to inspections by public health officials.<ref>Oprescu, p. 33; Varga, pp. 634\u2013635</ref> As late as July 1940, Orthodox dignitaries still complained to the authorities about L\u0103zuric\u0103 and the ACRR having \"insulted the Church\". Their reports were most likely anachronistic, as neither the group nor its leader were still active by then.<ref name=\"Matei, Raporturile, p. 172\"/>\n\nAlthough it banned all Romani organizations, the [[National Legionary State]], established by the Iron Guard that September, remained generally tolerant of the Romanies as a group. However, the influence of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[scientific racism]] began seeping into its official propaganda.<ref>Achim (2004), pp. 166\u2013167</ref> The subsequent period saw the emergence of a strong [[anti-Romanyism]] in Romanian society, and the degeneration of relations between Romani activists and the Romanian far-right. Shortly after his [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|clash with the Iron Guard]], dictator [[Ion Antonescu]] singled out the Romanies as fundamentally anti-social.<ref>Achim (2004), p. 168.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

The hospital is administered by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres, a Catholic religious congregation providing health services throughout the country.\n\nIn 1990, a 4-storey annex, the Raul Wu Chiu Kuan Building was added, increasing bed capacity to 175. Modern equipment continued to be acquired to make DLSUMC comparable with any of the large hospitals in Metro Manila. A Pulmonary Unit, [[Hemodialysis]] Unit, 12-bed [[Intensive Care Unit]], Cardiovascular Laboratory, [[CT Scan]], Echo-Doppler, and [[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] are just some of the services offered by the medical center.\n\nAugust 28, 1997 marked the inauguration of the 10-storey hospital annex building, the De La Salle University-Do\u00f1a Teodorica Favis Vda.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.
