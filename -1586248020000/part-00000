By the end of the Levantine Aurignacian, gradual changes took place in stone industries. Small stone tools called [[microlith]]s and retouched bladelets can be found for the first time.

The Levant became more arid and the forest vegetation retreated, to be replaced by steppe. The cool and dry period ended at the beginning of Mesolithic 1. The hunter-gatherers of the Aurignacian would have had to modify their way of living and their pattern of settlement to adapt to the changing conditions. The crystallization of these new patterns resulted in Mesolithic 1. New types of settlements and new stone industries developed.\n\nThe inhabitants of a small Mesolithic 1 site in the Levant left little more than their chipped stone tools behind. The industry was of small tools made of bladelets struck off single-platform cores. Besides bladelets, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s and end-[[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s were found. A few bone tools and some ground stone have also been found. These so-called Mesolithic sites of Asia are far less numerous than those of the Neolithic and the archeological remains are very poor.\n\nThe type site is [[Kebara Cave]] south of [[Haifa]]. \nThe Kebaran was characterized by small, [[geometric microliths]], and were thought to lack the specialized grinders and pounders found in later [[Near Eastern]] cultures.\n[[File:Mar Dalan-Rawansar-Kermanshah.jpg|thumb|Small lunates from Epipaleolithic site of Mar Dalan, Rawansar, Kermanshah, Zagros]]\nThe Kebaran is preceded by the Athlitian phase of the [[Levantine Aurignacian]] (formerly called [[Antelian]]) and followed by the proto-agrarian [[Natufian culture]] of the [[Epipalaeolithic]]. The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic. The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref> The Kebaran is also characterised by the earliest collecting of wild cereals, known due to the uncovering of grain grinding tools. It was the first step towards the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The Kebaran people are believed to have practiced dispersal to upland environments in the summer, and aggregation in caves and rockshelters near lowland lakes in the winter. This diversity of environments may be the reason for the variety of tools found in their toolkits.\n\nThe Kebaran is generally thought to have been ancestral to the later [[Natufian]] culture that occupied much of the same range.<ref>[[James Mellaart|Mellaart, James]] (1976), ''Neolithic of the Near East'' ([[Macmillan Publishers]])</ref>\n\n====Harvesting of cereals====\n{{main|Neolithic revolution}}\nThe earliest evidence for the use of composite cereal harvesting tools are glossed flint blades that have been found at the site of [[Ohalo II]], a 23,000-years-old fisher-hunter-gatherers\u2019 camp on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Northern Israel.<ref name=\"CSCH\"/> The Ohalo site is at the junction of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the Early [[Epipaleolithic]], and has been attributed to both periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Enzel |first1=Yehouda |last2=Bar-Yosef |first2=Ofer |title=Quaternary of the Levant |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107090460 |page=335 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhSVDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA335 |language=en}}</ref> The wear traces indicate that tools were used for harvesting near-ripe semi-green wild cereals, shortly before grains are ripe and disperse naturally.<ref name=\"CSCH\"/> The study shows that the tools were not used intensively, and they reflect two harvesting modes: flint knives held by hand and inserts hafted in a handle.<ref name=\"CSCH\"/> The finds reveal the existence of cereal harvesting techniques and tools some 8,000 years before the [[Natufian]], and 12,000 years before the establishment of sedentary farming communities in the Near East during the [[Neolithic Revolution]].<ref name=\"CSCH\"/> Furthermore, the new finds accord well with evidence for the earliest ever cereal cultivation at the site and the use of stone-made grinding implements.<ref name=\"CSCH\">[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was adapted from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{cite journal |last1=Nadel |first1=Dani |last2=Weiss |first2=Ehud |last3=Groman-Yaroslavski |first3=Iris |title=Composite Sickles and Cereal Harvesting Methods at 23,000-Years-Old Ohalo II, Israel |journal=PLOS ONE |date=23 November 2016 |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=e0167151 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0167151 |pmid=27880839 |language=en |issn=1932-6203|pmc=5120854 }}</ref>\n\n====Artistic expression in the Kebaran culture====\n[[File:Engraved Plaquette with bird image from Ein Qashish South, Jezreel Valley, Israel, Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran deposits (ca. 23ka and ca. 16.5ka BP).jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Engraved plaquette with bird image from Ein Qashish South, [[Jezreel Valley]], [[Israel]], Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran ca. 23,000-16,500 BP.<ref name=\"AUA\"/>]]\nEvidence for symbolic behavior of Late Pleistocene foragers in the Levant has been found in engraved limestone plaquettes from the Epipaleolithic open-air site Ein Qashish South in the Jezreel Valley, Israel.<ref name=\"AUA\"/> The engravings were uncovered in Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran deposits (ca. 23,000 and ca. 16,500 BP), and include the image of a bird, the first figurative representation known so far from a pre-Natufian Epipaleolithic site, together with geometric motifs such as chevrons, cross-hatchings and ladders.<ref name=\"AUA\"/> Some of the engravings closely resemble roughly contemporary European finds, and may be interpreted as \"systems of notations\" or \"artificial memory systems\" related to the timing of seasonal resources and related important events for nomadic groups.<ref name=\"AUA\"/>\n\nSimilarly looking signs and patterns are well known from the context of the local [[Natufian]], a final Epipaleolithic period when sedentary or semi-sedentary foragers started practicing agriculture.<ref name=\"AUA\">[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was adapted from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{cite journal |last1=Roskin |first1=Joel |last2=Porat |first2=Naomi |last3=Greenbaum |first3=Noam |last4=Caracuta |first4=Valentina |last5=Boaretto |first5=Elisabeta |last6=Bar-Yosef |first6=Ofer |last7=Yaroshevich |first7=Alla |title=A Unique Assemblage of Engraved Plaquettes from Ein Qashish South, Jezreel Valley, Israel: Figurative and Non-Figurative Symbols of Late Pleistocene Hunters-Gatherers in the Levant |journal=PLOS ONE |date=24 August 2016 |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=e0160687 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0160687 |language=en |issn=1932-6203}}</ref>\n\n===Late Epipaleolithic===\n{{main|Natufian culture}}\n{{see|Khiamian}}\nThe Late Epipaleolithic is also called the [[Natufian culture]].

The stone tools found bore a close resemblance to the [[Geometric Kebaran]], a Levantine industry associated with the Middle Epipalaeolithic. The excavators of the site therefore proposed that northern Arabia was colonised by foragers from the Levant around 15,000 years ago.

The most prevalent animal food sources in the Levant during this period were: deer, gazelle, and [[ibex]] of various species, and smaller animals including birds, lizard, fox, tortoise, and hare.

By the end of the Levantine Aurignacian, gradual changes took place in stone industries. Small stone tools called [[microlith]]s and retouched bladelets can be found for the first time.

The Levant became more arid and the forest vegetation retreated, to be replaced by steppe. The cool and dry period ended at the beginning of Mesolithic 1. The hunter-gatherers of the Aurignacian would have had to modify their way of living and their pattern of settlement to adapt to the changing conditions. The crystallization of these new patterns resulted in Mesolithic 1. New types of settlements and new stone industries developed.\n\nThe inhabitants of a small Mesolithic 1 site in the Levant left little more than their chipped stone tools behind. The industry was of small tools made of bladelets struck off single-platform cores. Besides bladelets, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s and end-[[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s were found. A few bone tools and some ground stone have also been found. These so-called Mesolithic sites of Asia are far less numerous than those of the Neolithic and the archeological remains are very poor.\n\nThe type site is [[Kebara Cave]] south of [[Haifa]]. \nThe Kebaran was characterized by small, [[geometric microliths]], and were thought to lack the specialized grinders and pounders found in later [[Near Eastern]] cultures.\n[[File:Mar Dalan-Rawansar-Kermanshah.jpg|thumb|Small lunates from Epipaleolithic site of Mar Dalan, Rawansar, Kermanshah, Zagros]]\nThe Kebaran is preceded by the Athlitian phase of the [[Levantine Aurignacian]] (formerly called [[Antelian]]) and followed by the proto-agrarian [[Natufian culture]] of the [[Epipalaeolithic]]. The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic.  The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref>  The Kebaran is also characterised by the earliest collecting of wild cereals, known due to the uncovering of grain grinding tools. It was the first step towards the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The Kebaran people are believed to have practiced dispersal to upland environments in the summer, and aggregation in caves and rockshelters near lowland lakes in the winter. This diversity of environments may be the reason for the variety of tools found in their toolkits.\n\nThe Kebaran is generally thought to have been ancestral to the later [[Natufian]] culture that occupied much of the same range.<ref>[[James Mellaart|Mellaart, James]] (1976), ''Neolithic of the Near East'' ([[Macmillan Publishers]])</ref>\n\n====Harvesting of cereals====\n{{main|Neolithic revolution}}\nThe earliest evidence for the use of composite cereal harvesting tools are glossed flint blades that have been found at the site of [[Ohalo II]], a 23,000-years-old fisher-hunter-gatherers\u2019 camp on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Northern Israel.<ref name=\"CSCH\"/> The Ohalo site is at the junction of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the Early [[Epipaleolithic]], and has been attributed to both periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Enzel |first1=Yehouda |last2=Bar-Yosef |first2=Ofer |title=Quaternary of the Levant |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107090460 |page=335 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhSVDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA335 |language=en}}</ref> The wear traces indicate that tools were used for harvesting near-ripe semi-green wild cereals, shortly before grains are ripe and disperse naturally.<ref name=\"CSCH\"/> The study shows that the tools were not used intensively, and they reflect two harvesting modes: flint knives held by hand and inserts hafted in a handle.<ref name=\"CSCH\"/> The finds reveal the existence of cereal harvesting techniques and tools some 8,000 years before the [[Natufian]], and 12,000 years before the establishment of sedentary farming communities in the Near East during the [[Neolithic Revolution]].<ref name=\"CSCH\"/> Furthermore, the new finds accord well with evidence for the earliest ever cereal cultivation at the site and the use of stone-made grinding implements.<ref name=\"CSCH\">[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was adapted from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{cite journal |last1=Nadel |first1=Dani |last2=Weiss |first2=Ehud |last3=Groman-Yaroslavski |first3=Iris |title=Composite Sickles and Cereal Harvesting Methods at 23,000-Years-Old Ohalo II, Israel |journal=PLOS ONE |date=23 November 2016 |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=e0167151 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0167151 |pmid=27880839 |language=en |issn=1932-6203|pmc=5120854 }}</ref>\n\n====Artistic expression in the Kebaran culture====\n[[File:Engraved Plaquette with bird image from Ein Qashish South, Jezreel Valley, Israel, Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran deposits (ca. 23ka and ca. 16.5ka BP).jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Engraved plaquette with bird image from Ein Qashish South, [[Jezreel Valley]], [[Israel]], Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran ca. 23,000-16,500 BP.<ref name=\"AUA\"/>]]\nEvidence for symbolic behavior of Late Pleistocene foragers in the Levant has been found in engraved limestone plaquettes from the Epipaleolithic open-air site Ein Qashish South in the Jezreel Valley, Israel.<ref name=\"AUA\"/> The engravings were uncovered in Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran deposits (ca. 23,000 and ca. 16,500 BP), and include the image of a bird, the first figurative representation known so far from a pre-Natufian Epipaleolithic site, together with geometric motifs such as chevrons, cross-hatchings and ladders.<ref name=\"AUA\"/> Some of the engravings closely resemble roughly contemporary European finds, and may be interpreted as \"systems of notations\" or \"artificial memory systems\" related to the timing of seasonal resources and related important events for nomadic groups.<ref name=\"AUA\"/> \n\nSimilarly looking signs and patterns are well known from the context of the local [[Natufian]], a final Epipaleolithic period when sedentary or semi-sedentary foragers started practicing agriculture.<ref name=\"AUA\">[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was adapted from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{cite journal |last1=Roskin |first1=Joel |last2=Porat |first2=Naomi |last3=Greenbaum |first3=Noam |last4=Caracuta |first4=Valentina |last5=Boaretto |first5=Elisabeta |last6=Bar-Yosef |first6=Ofer |last7=Yaroshevich |first7=Alla |title=A Unique Assemblage of Engraved Plaquettes from Ein Qashish South, Jezreel Valley, Israel: Figurative and Non-Figurative Symbols of Late Pleistocene Hunters-Gatherers in the Levant |journal=PLOS ONE |date=24 August 2016 |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=e0160687 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0160687 |language=en |issn=1932-6203}}</ref>\n\n===Late Epipaleolithic===\n{{main|Natufian culture}}\n{{see|Khiamian}}\nThe Late Epipaleolithic is also called the [[Natufian culture]].

The stone tools found bore a close resemblance to the [[Geometric Kebaran]], a Levantine industry associated with the Middle Epipalaeolithic.

The most prevalent animal food sources in the Levant during this period were: deer, gazelle, and [[ibex]] of various species,  and smaller animals including birds, lizard, fox, tortoise, and hare.  Less common were [[aurochs]], wild [[equid]]s, wild boar, wild cattle, and [[hartebeest]].<ref name=\"Simmons, 48\">Simmons, 48</ref>  At [[Neve David]] near [[Haifa]], 15 mammal species were found, and two reptile species.

When [[Lama]] Norbu, a senior lama from the monastery has a dream that the Buddhist teacher, [[Rinpoche]] has been reborn, he sends Kaaya to Delhi to bring him back to the monastery. Kaaya goes to Delhi and manages to get the child, but just when they are about to return home, the child witnesses the murder of a police officer in a hotel. The investigations are taken over by another police officer, Shiven ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]) who prohibits Kaaya and the young boy from returning home. During this time, the boy identifies Raj Mehra ([[Gulshan Grover]]) as the murderer. Soon Shiven finds himself in a web of intrigue and deceit where he can trust no one. He is forced to make an escape to Spiti along with Kaaya and the young boy who he is now determined to protect. Shiven has however seriously been injured and upon reaching Spiti has to undergo treatment at Kaaya's home.\n\nWhile nursing him back to health, Kaaya is attracted to Shiven, an exciting feeling she has never experienced before. Shiven too finds himself drawn to Kaya, a girl unlike any he has ever known. Kaya is caught in a dilemma for she has too long subdued her basic instincts and desires in her search for the 'ultimate truth'. A sexual attraction is one that her conditioned mind sees as a sin (paap), but one she cannot deny. Shiven sees this dilemma and tries to show Kaya that there is a life out there which she has a full right to live.

When [[Lama]] Norbu, a senior lama from the monastery has a dream that the Buddhist teacher, [[Rinpoche]] has been reborn, he sends Kaaya to Delhi to bring him back to the monastery. Kaaya goes to Delhi and manages to get the child, but just when they are about to return home, the child witnesses the murder of a police officer in a hotel. The investigations are taken over by another police officer, Shiven ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]) who prohibits Kaaya and the young boy from returning home. During this time, the boy identifies Raj Mehra ([[Gulshan Grover]]) as the murderer. Soon Shiven finds himself in a web of intrigue and deceit where he can trust no one. He is forced to make an escape to Spiti along with Kaaya and the young boy who he is now determined to protect. Shiven has however seriously been injured and upon reaching Spiti has to undergo treatment at Kaaya's home.\n\nWhile nursing him back to health, Kaaya is attracted to Shiven, an exciting feeling she has never experienced before. Shiven too finds himself drawn to Kaya, a girl unlike any he has ever known. Kaya is caught in a dilemma for she has too long subdued her basic instincts and desires in her search for the 'ultimate truth'. A sexual attraction is one that her conditioned mind sees as a sin (paap), but one she cannot deny. Shiven sees this dilemma and tries to show Kaya that there is a life out there which she has a full right to live. In the meantime, Kaya's father finds out about what has been going on under his roof and is furious with Shiven. He sees Shiven as a polluting influence upon his peaceful life, a man who has brought defiling things like pistols into their home. At this juncture, Shiven's past catches up with them and Mehra's men are close on his heels.\n\nAfter much chaos, finally Shiven and Kaaya are shown re-uniting with the passionate kiss in the climax.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]] - Inspector Shiven\n* [[Udita Goswami]] - Kaaya\n* [[Gulshan Grover]] - ACP Raj Mehra\n* [[Mohan Agashe]] - Kaaya's father \n* [[Bikramjeet Kanwarpal]] - Ratan Singh\n* [[Denzil Smith]] - Lama Norbu\n* [[Sandeep Mehta]] - Sushil Mathur, DCP\n* [[Anahita Uberoi]] - Anna\n* [[Madan Bhiku]] - Llahmo, the reincarnated boy\n* [[Ahsan Baksh]] - Zakir\n* [[Vikram Kapadia]] - Anna's husband\n* [[Aishwarya Mehta]] - Niloufer, Zakir's wife\n* [[Netaji]] - Lama Dorje\n* [[Ritika Luthria]] - DCP's wife\n* [[Megha Burman]] - DCP's daughter\n\n==Release==\nThe film became the first Bollywood film to be premiered at [[Karachi International Film Festival]] (KARA) on 20 December 2003.

Harris was a prodigious dramatist, writing a newly published play each season. He was a tireless experimenter of forms, themes, and subjects. This modest man of irrepressible imagination and energy carried a vast array of honors and accolades. He was the first recipient of a National Endowment of the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in Children's Theatre. He received an honorary doctorate from the Indiana University and was introduced into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. He was the first playwright to receive the Medallion of the Children's Theatre Foundation of America.  Aurand Harris died on May 6, 1996, in Manhattan, New York.

His father was a physician; his mother, a graduate of Northwestern University, was trained in theater and speech, and was also an active and well-know director, teacher, and amateur actress who maintained her own studio.  From an early age, Aurand Harris was drawn to things theatrical, no doubt in part due to his mother's influence, but also because of the variety and high quality of the theater with which she surrounded him.\n\nHarris' acting career began at age four when he played a bumblebee in a local musical production; before seven, he had written his first \"little dramatic piece.\" His education was augmented with speech, dance, and musical train.  In high school, he was involved in dramatic and oratorical contests, to the extent that when he graduated, he was named 'the best actor and the best orator in the state of Missouri.'\"<ref>Biographical material is based on personal and telephone interviews with the author between 1985 and 1987 and earlier work by Coleman Jennings. \u201cThe Playwright and the Plays,\u201d Six Plays by Aurand Harris, ed.

The plays of Aurand Harris have been produced and applauded in thousands of productions around the world for nearly a half-century. Harris was a prodigious dramatist, writing a newly published play each season. He was a tireless experimenter of forms, themes, and subjects. This modest man of irrepressible imagination and energy carried a vast array of honors and accolades. He was the first recipient of a National Endowment of the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in Children's Theatre. He received an honorary doctorate from the Indiana University and was introduced into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. He was the first playwright to receive the Medallion of the Children's Theatre Foundation of America.  Aurand Harris died on May 6, 1996, in Manhattan, New York.  He is buried in the family plot in Jamesport, Missouri.<ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/76817470/aurand-harris</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nJames Aurand Harris, the only child of Myrtle Sebastian and Dr. George Dowe Harris, was born on July 4, 1915, in Jamesport, Missouri. His father was a physician; his mother, a graduate of Northwestern University, was trained in theater and speech, and was also an active and well-know director, teacher, and amateur actress who maintained her own studio.  From an early age, Aurand Harris was drawn to things theatrical, no doubt in part due to his mother's influence, but also because of the variety and high quality of the theater with which she surrounded him.\n\nHarris' acting career began at age four when he played a bumblebee in a local musical production; before seven, he had written his first \"little dramatic piece.\" His education was augmented with speech, dance, and musical train.  In high school, he was involved in dramatic and oratorical contests, to the extent that when he graduated, he was named \"the best actor and the best orator in the state of Missouri.\"<ref>Biographical material is based on personal and telephone interviews with the author between 1985 and 1987 and earlier work by Coleman Jennings. \u201cThe Playwright and the Plays,\u201d Six Plays by Aurand Harris, ed.
