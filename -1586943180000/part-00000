The husk or hull ([[pericarp]]) around the seeds may be used whole, especially in [[Sichuan cuisine]], and the finely ground powder is one of the ingredients for [[five-spice powder]].

Only the husks are used; the shiny black seeds are discarded or ignored as they have a very gritty, sand-like texture. The spice is generally added at the last moment. [[Star anise]] and [[ginger]] are often used with it in spicy Sichuan cuisine. It has an alkaline [[pH]] and a numbing effect on the lips when eaten in larger doses. ''[[Sichuan mala|Ma la]]'' sauce ({{zh|c=\u9ebb\u8fa3|p=m\u00e1l\u00e0}}; literally \"numbing and spicy\"), common in Sichuan cooking, is a combination of Sichuan pepper and chili pepper, and it is a key ingredient in ''m\u00e1 l\u00e0'' [[hot pot]], the Sichuan version of the traditional Chinese dish.

The peppercorns can also be lightly fried to make a spicy oil with various uses.\n\nIn Indonesian Batak cuisine, ''[[andaliman]]'' (a relative of Sichuan pepper, ''Z. acanthopodium'') is ground and mixed with chilies and seasonings into a green ''sambal tinombur'' or chili paste, to accompany grilled pork, carp, and other regional specialties. ''Arsik'', a Batak dish from the Tapanuli region, uses ''andaliman'' as spice.\n\nSichuan pepper is one of the few spices important for Nepali, Northeast Indian, Tibetan, and [[Bhutanese cuisine|Bhutanese]] cookery of the Himalayas because few spices can be grown there. One Himalayan specialty is the ''momo'', a [[dumpling]] stuffed with vegetables, cottage cheese, or minced [[yak]] meat, water buffalo meat, or pork and flavoured with Sichuan pepper, garlic, ginger, and onion, served with tomato and Sichuan pepper-based gravy. Nepalese-style noodles are steamed and served dry, together with a fiery Sichuan pepper sauce.\n\nIn [[Cuisine of Korea|Korean cuisine]], two species are used: ''Z. piperitum'' and ''Z. schinifolium''.

Related species are used in the cuisines of Tibet, [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[Thailand]], the [[Konkani people|Konkani]] and [[Kumauni people|Kumaoni]] people of [[India]], and the [[Toba Batak people|Toba Batak]] of Indonesia.\n\n==Names==\n{{Misleading|section|date=August 2012}}\n[[File:5911-Linxia-County-Xihe-township-drying-pepper.jpg|thumb|Newly harvested Sichuan pepper (known locally as \u5927\u7ea2\u888d\u82b1\u6912, ''d\u00e0 h\u00f3ng p\u00e1o hu\u0101 ji\u0101o''<ref>[https://archive.today/20090107233626/http://www.lx.gansu.gov.cn/E_ReadNews.asp?NewsID=585 \u4e34\u590f\u53bf\u6982\u51b5] (Linxia County overview)</ref>), left out to dry in the sun.

Only the husks are used; the shiny black seeds are discarded or ignored as they have a very gritty, sand-like texture. The spice is generally added at the last moment. [[Star anise]] and [[ginger]] are often used with it in spicy Sichuan cuisine. It has an alkaline [[pH]] and a numbing effect on the lips when eaten in larger doses. ''[[Sichuan mala|Ma la]]'' sauce ({{zh|c=\u9ebb\u8fa3|p=m\u00e1l\u00e0}}; literally \"numbing and spicy\"), common in Sichuan cooking, is a combination of Sichuan pepper and chili pepper, and it is a key ingredient in ''m\u00e1 l\u00e0'' [[hot pot]], the Sichuan version of the traditional Chinese dish.

The peppercorns can also be lightly fried to make a spicy oil with various uses.\n\nIn Indonesian Batak cuisine, ''[[andaliman]]'' (a relative of Sichuan pepper, ''Z. acanthopodium'') is ground and mixed with chilies and seasonings into a green ''sambal tinombur'' or chili paste, to accompany grilled pork, carp, and other regional specialties. ''Arsik'', a Batak dish from the Tapanuli region, uses ''andaliman'' as spice.\n\nSichuan pepper is one of the few spices important for Nepali, Northeast Indian, Tibetan, and [[Bhutanese cuisine|Bhutanese]] cookery of the Himalayas because few spices can be grown there. One Himalayan specialty is the ''momo'', a [[dumpling]] stuffed with vegetables, cottage cheese, or minced [[yak]] meat, water buffalo meat, or pork and flavoured with Sichuan pepper, garlic, ginger, and onion, served with tomato and Sichuan pepper-based gravy. Nepalese-style noodles are steamed and served dry, together with a fiery Sichuan pepper sauce.\n\nIn [[Cuisine of Korea|Korean cuisine]], two species are used: ''Z. piperitum'' and ''Z. schinifolium''.

It educates over 1,400 pupils aged between 11 and 18 and was founded in 1833 by the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]].\n\n==History==\nMadras College, founded in 1833, takes its name from the system of education devised by the school's founder, the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]. However, the origins of the school can be traced to at least the 1490s, through its predecessor institution, the '''Grammar School of St Andrews'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pacific.st-andrews.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exedsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=16&dsqSearch=%28%28%28text%29%3D%27Grammar%27%29AND%28%28text%29%3D%27School%27%29%29}}</ref>\n\nBell was born in St Andrews in 1753, the son of a local magistrate and wig-maker. He studied at the [[University of St Andrews]] where he distinguished himself in mathematics. He became a clergyman of the [[Church of England]] and took up an appointment as chaplain to the regiments of the [[East India Company]] in [[Chennai|Madras]] (known since 1996 as Chennai), [[India]]. One of his duties was to educate the soldiers' children. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he used the older students, who had been taught the lesson by the master, to instruct groups of younger pupils.

It educates over 1,400 pupils aged between 11 and 18 and was founded in 1833 by the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]].\n\n==History==\nMadras College, founded in 1833, takes its name from the system of education devised by the school's founder, the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]. However, the origins of the school can be traced to at least the 1490s, through its predecessor institution, the '''Grammar School of St Andrews'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pacific.st-andrews.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exedsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=16&dsqSearch=%28%28%28text%29%3D%27Grammar%27%29AND%28%28text%29%3D%27School%27%29%29}}</ref>\n\nBell was born in St Andrews in 1753, the son of a local magistrate and wig-maker. He studied at the [[University of St Andrews]] where he distinguished himself in mathematics. He became a clergyman of the [[Church of England]] and took up an appointment as chaplain to the regiments of the [[East India Company]] in [[Chennai|Madras]] (known since 1996 as Chennai), [[India]]. One of his duties was to educate the soldiers' children. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he used the older students, who had been taught the lesson by the master, to instruct groups of younger pupils. The pupils who assisted the teacher were called 'monitors'. This method of education became widely used in schools at home and abroad.\n\nAfter his return from India, Dr Bell made it his life's work to travel the country and encourage schools to adopt 'the [[Madras system]]', as it had come to be known. By the time of his death in 1832, over 10,000 schools were using his methods.\n\n[[File:Madras College, South Street, St. Andrews Fife.jpg|thumb|left|Madras College; the senior school building on South Street, St Andrews]]\nMadras College was founded in 1832 at the bequest and expense of Bell, as the amalgamation of several St Andrews schools. The first amalgamation was in 1833 when the old Grammar School of St Andrews was joined with the \"English\" school (founded in the 1750s) to form the Madras College. The origin of these names being that the Grammar School was taught mostly in [[Latin language|Latin]] while the \"English\" school used English only. The Grammar School stood on the grounds between Blackfriars' Church and Lade Braes; the \"English\" school was on the grounds behind the Church of Holy Trinity, approximately where the town library is today.\n\nThe second amalgamation happened in 1963, when Madras College was merged with the Burgh School (founded 1889, based in Abbey Walk). As part of this amalgamation and the introduction of comprehensive education, a new school building was contracted on Kilrymont Road, a mile and a half from the South Street building. The Kilrymont building was constructed in a [[modernist]] style, with adjacent playing fields and was opened in 1967.\n\nThe school is the only secondary school in Scotland on a split site. The school catchment area takes in a large part of rural north east Fife, and most of the pupils are transported in from the surrounding area by buses.\n\nThe badge is a chevron between three bells \u2013 a reference to Dr. Bell. The Latin motto is \"''pro rege et grege''\" which is customarily translated as \"For King and People\". It reminds the students of the importance of the idea of service to the community.\n\nBell also left money for schools in [[Inverness]] (Faraline Park, now Inverness Library), [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Leith]] (Commercial Street) and [[Cupar]] (now called [[Bell Baxter High School]], formerly Madras Academy).\n\n== Staff ==\n\n=== Rectors ===\nFrom the foundation of Madras College in 1833 until 1888, the school was run by a board of trustees.
