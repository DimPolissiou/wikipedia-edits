Production of the car was first based in [[Terrebonne, Quebec|Terrebonne]] and was later moved to [[Granby, Quebec|Granby]].\n\n== The Beginning ==\nIn the late 1960s an employee of Renault-Canada's public relations department named Jacques About was asked to assess the feasibility of importing the [[Alpine A110]] berlinette into Canada. At that time Alpine was an independent company (they were absorbed by [[Renault]] in 1974) that used Renault engines in their cars, which were then sold through Renault dealers in Europe. Although the results of the survey were positive, Renault chose not to import the Alpine. About left Renault shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"vance\"/>\n\nJacques About was born in France on February 14, 1938.

The rest of the family moved first to Vienna and then Berlin. When the Nazis came to power, his grandfather moved to Israel, and Salzhauer's father was born in Tel Aviv. His father moved to New York City in 1958, where Salzhauer was born in 1972, and grew up.<ref name=MNT/>\n\nWhile the rest of his family had attended Jewish schools, Salzhauer wanted to go to public high school to compete on the swim team.  He was teased over the shape of his nose, and he left and went to a Jewish high school. He then attended Rockland Community College from 1989 to 1990 then transferred into [[Brooklyn College]]'s BA/MD program. He met his wife, Eva, there.  After two years he transferred to [[Washington University School of Medicine]] in St. Louis, Missouri.  After graduating he did his residency at first at [[Mount Sinai Medical Center & Miami Heart Institute|Mount Sinai]] in Miami in general surgery, then at [[Jackson Memorial Hospital]] in Miami for plastic surgery, then did further training in plastic surgery at [[Cleveland Clinic]] in [[Weston, Florida]].  The other residents gave him a gift of a [[rhinoplasty]] for his own nose, at the completion of his residency.

He is active on social media as  \"'''Dr. Miami'''\", has been on reality TV, has recorded a song, and written a children's book. He runs a plastic surgery practice in [[Bal Harbour, Florida]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Salzhauer's grandfather's family fled the Ukraine and [[pogrom]]s there; his great-grandfather was clubbed to death by a [[Cossack]] as the family left.  The rest of the family moved first to Vienna and then Berlin. When the Nazis came to power, his grandfather moved to Israel, and Salzhauer's father was born in Tel Aviv. His father moved to New York City in 1958, where Salzhauer was born in 1972, and grew up.<ref name=MNT/>\n\nWhile the rest of his family had attended Jewish schools, Salzhauer wanted to go to public high school to compete on the swim team.  He was teased over the shape of his nose, and he left and went to a Jewish high school. He then attended Rockland Community College from 1989 to 1990 then transferred into [[Brooklyn College]]'s BA/MD program. He met his wife, Eva, there.  After two years he transferred to [[Washington University School of Medicine]] in St. Louis, Missouri.  After graduating he did his residency at first at [[Mount Sinai Medical Center & Miami Heart Institute|Mount Sinai]] in Miami in general surgery, then at [[Jackson Memorial Hospital]] in Miami for plastic surgery, then did further training in plastic surgery at [[Cleveland Clinic]] in [[Weston, Florida]].  The other residents gave him a gift of a [[rhinoplasty]] for his own nose, at the completion of his residency.  They also gave him a chin implant and liposuction.<ref name=MNT>{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Michael E.|title=Michael Salzhauer, Miami's Wackiest Plastic Surgeon, Risks Everything for Internet Fame|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/michael-salzhauer-miamis-wackiest-plastic-surgeon-risks-everything-for-internet-fame-6387194|website=Miami New Times|date=21 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Michael Salzhauer|url=https://health.usnews.com/doctors/michael-salzhauer-96215|publisher=U.S. News & World Report - Health|accessdate=23 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 2003, he opened his own practice in [[Bal Harbour, Florida]], and six years later moved to a new five story building there.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Garcia-Roberts|first1=Gus|title=Let's Get Jiggly|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/lets-get-jiggly-6362671|work=Miami New Times|date=5 February 2009}}</ref>  He told a reporter for ''[[Miami New Times]]'' in 2012, that \"Marketing makes the world go 'round\" and that he had courted the publicity of controversy.<ref name=MNT/>\n\nSalzhauer authored a children's book in 2008, titled ''My Beautiful Mommy'' which focused on a young girl whose mother undergoes a [[abdominoplasty|tummy tuck]], a [[rhinoplasty|nose job]], and [[breast augmentation]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Springen|first1=Karen|title=Kids\u2019 Book on Plastic Surgery|url=http://www.newsweek.com/kids-book-plastic-surgery-86421|work=Newsweek|date=14 April 2008|language=en}}</ref> It was illustrated by Victor Guiza.<ref name=Abate>{{cite journal|last=Abate|first=Michelle Ann|title=\"Plastic Makes Perfect\": My Beautiful Mommy, Cosmetic Surgery, and the Medicalization of Motherhood|journal=Women's Studies|year=2010|volume=39|issue=7|pages=715\u2013746|doi=10.1080/00497878.2010.505152}}</ref> Salzhauer and the book were criticized for promoting elective cosmetic surgery and for a line that suggests that mommy's new nose will \"be prettier.\"<ref name=Abate/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Reist|first=Melinda Tankard|title=The pornification of girlhood|journal=[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]|date=Jul\u2013Aug 2008|volume=52|issue=7\u20138|page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Alter|first=Cathy|title='My Beautiful Mommy': How a Picture Book Explains Liposuction to Kids|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/03/my-beautiful-mommy-how-a-picture-book-explains-liposuction-to-kids/73051/|accessdate=19 February 2014|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=Mar 26, 2011}}</ref> [[Child psychologist]] Elizabeth Berger has noted that while an explanatory book will be helpful for children, it \"can be difficult for small kids to understand\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Karen |last=Springen |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/04/14/mommy-2-0.html |title=Mommy 2.0 |work=The Daily Beast |date=April 14, 2008 |accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref> Salzhauer defended the book, saying that he wrote it to help parents explain such surgeries to their children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|title=My beautiful, scarring-me-forever mommy?|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2008/04/18/my-beautiful-mo/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=November 20, 2011|date=April 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/17/us-books-plasticsurgery-idUSN1742411920080417 | work=Reuters | title=Mom's having tummy tuck?

The [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] found on the iPhone 8, has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE. It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly due to being based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|IPhone SE (2nd generation)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the 2nd generation iPhone SE|its predecessor|iPhone SE (1st generation)|the general use of the term ''iPhone SE''|iPhone SE (disambiguation)}}\n<noinclude>\n{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=iPhone SE (2020)|2=Talk:IPhone SE (2nd generation)#Requested move 16 April 2020 }}\n</noinclude>\n{{pp-move|small=yes}}\n{{short description|thirteenth-generation Apple smartphone}}\n{{lowercase title}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox mobile phone\n| name         = iPhone SE\n| codename     = \n| logo         = IPhone SE (2nd generation) wordmark.svg\n| logosize     = <!-- include \"px\" - Uses users default image size if omitted -->\n| image        = IPhone SE (2nd generation) white vector.svg\n| imagesize    = \n| alt          = \n| caption      = <!-- This is indeed white!

It is also the successor to the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE.]] Pre-orders began on April 17, 2020, and the phone itself is planned to be released on April 24, 2020.\n\nThe second-generation SE shares the dimensions and form factor of the iPhone 8 (including its bezel and physical home button with [[Touch ID]]), but shares hardware components from the [[iPhone 11]] lineup, including the [[Apple A13]] processor (instead of the [[Apple A11|A11]], which is found in the iPhone 8).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Peters|first=Jay|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221293/iphone-se-vs-11-pro-specs-comparison-price-camera-size|title=How the second-gen iPhone SE compares to the iPhone 11|date=15 April 2020|work=The Verge|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> This follows the pattern set by the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation SE]] (which shared the dimensions and form factor of the older [[iPhone 5S]] but shared most of its internal hardware with the higher-end [[iPhone 6S|6S]]).\n\nAs with the previous SE, the new phone is positioned as an entry-level iPhone, lacking for instance the edge-to-edge display, gesture navigation, and [[Face ID]] of the higher-end models such as the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone 11 Pro|11 Pro/Pro Max]].\n\n== History ==\nA successor to the first-generation iPhone SE had been a source of rumor since 2017, the year after the device was released.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/22/iphone-se-2-release-date-first-half-2018/ |title = iPhone SE 2 Again Rumored to Launch in First Half of 2018 |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 }}</ref> The name was also subject to speculation.

The [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] found on the iPhone 8, has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE. It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly due to being based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|IPhone SE (2nd generation)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "name_user": "Prahlad balaji", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix link section error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(2nd_generation)"}
