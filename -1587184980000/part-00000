He founded [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]], a [[Trappist]] abbey in [[Leicestershire]], and worked for the reconversion or reconciliation of Britain to Catholicism.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was the son of [[Charles March-Phillipps]] of [[Garendon Hall]], Leicestershire, and Harriet Ducarel, daughter of [[Gerald Gustavus Ducarel ]] of [[Walford, Somerset]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=7457|first=Margaret|last=Pawley|title=Lisle, Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps de}}</ref> The de Lisle family of Leicestershire were originally the Phillippses from London. The Garendon estate, near Loughborough, was inherited by Thomas March who adopted the name Phillipps, and married Susan de Lisles. Their son, Charles, adopted the de Lisle crest and arms. Steady accumulation of landed property made him one of the \u2018wealthiest commoners\u2019 in England. When Charles March-Phillipps died in 1862, Ambrose took the additional name of Lisle, becoming Ambrose Charles Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/march-phillipps-charles-1779-1862 \"March Phillipps, Charles (1779-1862), of Garendon Park\", The History of Parliament]</ref>\n\nHe spent his earliest years at his birthplace and was brought up as a member of the [[Church of England]], receiving his first religious instruction from his uncle, William March Phillipps, a [[High Church]] clergyman. In 1818 Ambrose was sent to a private school in [[South Croxton]], whence he was removed in 1820 to [[Maisemore]] Court School, near [[Gloucester]], kept by the Rev. [[George Hodson (priest)|George Hodson]]. The [[Bishop of Gloucester]], [[Henry Ryder]], having married Sophia March Phillipps, was his uncle by marriage, and so the boy spent Sundays and holidays at the bishop's palace.<ref name=Burton>{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps De Lisle|volume=4}}</ref>\n\nAt school he met for the first time a Catholic, the Abb\u00e9 Giraud, a French \u00e9migr\u00e9 priest. A visit to Paris in 1823 gave him his first acquaintance with Catholic liturgy. The effect on his mind was shown on his return home when he persuaded the Anglican rector to place a cross<!--crucifix?--> on the communion table, but this first effort to restore the cross to English churches was stopped by [[Herbert Marsh|the Bishop of Peterborough]].  He converted to Catholicism, and immediately removed from Rev. Hodson's school, and returned home with his father, who arranged for him to continue his preparation for the university under the private tuition of the Rev. William Wilkinson. He was obliged every Sunday to attend the Anglican church, but did not join in the service.<ref name=Burton/>\n\nAmbrose Phillipps was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in November 1825,<ref>{{acad|id=D825AL|name=De Lisle (formerly Phillipps), Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps}}</ref> though he did not go into residence there until 16 October 1826. At the university he found a congenial friend in [[Kenelm Henry Digby|Kenelm Digby]], author of ''Mores Catholici'' and ''The Broadstone of Honour'', who was, like himself, a member of a long-established family of the [[gentry]] and a recent convert. There was no Catholic chapel then at Cambridge, and every Sunday for two years these two young Catholics used to ride, fasting, over to [[St Edmund's College, Ware]], a distance of twenty-five miles, for [[Catholic Mass]] and Communion. It was on one of these visits to St Edmund's, in April 1828, that Phillipps was seized with a serious illness, having broken a blood-vessel in his lung. The doctors recommended his father to take him to Italy for the winter, and this necessarily cut short his Cambridge career, so that he had to leave the university without taking his degree.(He could not have received it anyway, before [[Catholic Emancipation]].) On his return to England in 1829, he became acquainted with the [[Ignatius Spencer|Hon. George Spencer]], then an Anglican clergyman, and his conversation was largely instrumental in leading to Spencer's conversion, as the latter admits in his ''Account of my Conversion'' \u2013 \"I passed many hours daily in conversation with Phillipps and was satisfied beyond all expectations with the answers he gave me to the different questions I proposed about the principal tenets and practices of Catholics.\" The following winter (1830\u20131831) he again spent in Italy, on which occasion he met [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]], who made a great impression on him.<ref name=Burton/>\n\nOn 25 July 1833, Ambrose Phillipps married Laura Mary, eldest daughter of the Hon. Thomas Clifford, son of Hugh, fourth [[Baron Clifford of Chudleigh]], in the Church of St James, Spanish Place, London.<ref name=Grace>[http://gracedieu.com/history-manor-house/ \"The History of the Manor House\", Grace Dieu Manor School]</ref> Charles March Phillipps gave his son possession of the second family estate, the manor of Grace-Dieu in Leicestershire, which before the [[Protestant Reformation]] had been the [[Augustinian]] [[Grace Dieu Priory]]. Here Ambrose Phillipps built a new manor-house [[Grace Dieu Manor]], 1833\u201334,<ref>His architect was [[William Railton]] (1801\u20131877), a man of modest reputation soon to be appointed architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and designer of [[Nelson's Column]], [[Trafalgar Square]]; the Roman Catholic chapel at Grace-Dieu was enriched by [[A.W.N.

Writing a few years before his death<ref>Letter to the Rev. W. R. Brownlow, 10 December 1869, ''Life'', I, p. 349</ref> he thus summed up the chief aims of his own life: <blockquote>There were three great objects to which I felt after my own conversion as a boy of fifteen specially drawn by internal feeling for the whole space of forty-five years which have since elapsed. The first was to restore to England the primitive monastic contemplative observance, which God enabled me to do in the foundation of the Trappist monastery of Mount St Bernard. The second was the restoration of the primitive ecclesiastical chant, my edition of which is now recommended by the Archbishop of Westminster for the use of churches and chapels. The third was the restoration of the Anglican Church to Catholic Unity.</blockquote>\n\n==Catholic revival==\n[[File:Mount St Bernards Abbey.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Mount St Bernard Abbey]]\nAccording to Purcell, \"In that early day no one did more for the Catholic revival in England, almost single-handed, than Phillipps de Lisle\".<ref name=Purcell>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092447600#page/n9/mode/2up Purcell, Edmund Sheridan. ''Life and Letters of Ambrose Phillipps de Lisle'', p.66, Macmillan and Co., Ltd., London, 1900]</ref>\n\nIn the foundation of the [[Cistercian]] [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]] in Leicestershire he received generous support from his friend John, [[Earl of Shrewsbury]], but it was he himself who conceived the idea, believing it necessary that the ascetic aspect of Catholic life should be presented to the English people. Mount St Bernard Abbey was the first monastery built in England since the Reformation.<ref name=Purcell/> He gave both land and money, severely depleting his own resources in providing the necessary buildings. This work was begun in 1835 and completed in 1844, while, during the same period, he founded missions at [[Grace-Dieu|Grace Dieu]] and [[Whitwick]]. His disappointment was great when he found that the [[Trappist]]s were prevented by their rule from undertaking active missionary work, because he attached the greatest importance to a supply of zealous missionary priests who would labour in English villages; he said, \"I would have them go about and preach everywhere on the foreign plan, in the fields or in the high roads even\".<ref>Letter to Lord Shrewsbury, 1839; ''Life'', I, p. 105</ref>\n\nIn 1838 he joined his friend Rev. George Spencer in establishing and propagating the Association of Universal Prayer for the Conversion of England. In a continental tour he and Spencer made together, accompanied by Mrs Phillipps and two of her children, in 1844, they passed through Belgium, Germany, and North Italy, meeting many distinguished Catholics and enlisting the sympathy of [[prelate]]s and clergy in the cause. [[Nicholas Wiseman]] was co-operating in Rome, and soon the movement spread widely through the Catholic world. He was for some time the only Catholic who was in confidential correspondence with the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]], including [[John Henry Newman]], receiving them at Grace-Dieu.  He saw the Movement as a step towards his desire of reconciling the Anglican Church with Rome. As his son stated:<ref>''Life and Letters'', I, 254, note</ref> <blockquote>National Conversion by means of Corporate Reunion he likened unto the Apostolic practice of fishing with a net \"gathering in multitudes of all kinds of fishes\". And this he considered to be his own special call from on High, to prepare the way and hasten the time when the Divine Word should again be spoken to Peter, 'Cast your nets into the deep\".</blockquote>\n\n==Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom==\nHe welcomed the [[restoration of the English Catholic hierarchy]] in 1850, and tried to reconcile to it some of the Catholic laymen who thought it inexpedient. During the debates that ensued throughout the country he wrote two pamphlets: ''A Letter to Lord Shrewsbury on the Re-establishment of the Hierarchy and the Present Position of Catholic Affairs'', and ''A few words on Lord John Russell's Letter to the Bishop of Durham''. The progress of events raised his hopes so high that he regarded the reconciliation of the Anglican Church to the [[Holy See]] as imminent, and to hasten its fulfilment entered on a new crusade of prayer, in which the co-operation of non-Catholics was desired. The [[Association for Promoting the Unity of Christendom]], (A.P.U.C.) was founded on 8 September 1857, by fourteen people including Father Lockhart, Fr. Collins, O. Cist., and de Lisle; the rest were Anglicans, with one exception, a Russo-Greek priest.\n\nThe only obligation incumbent on members, who might be Catholics, Anglicans, or Greeks, was to pray to God for the unity of the baptised body. At first the association progressed rapidly. De Lisle wrote to [[John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland|Lord John Manners]] (''Life'', I, 415) said, \"We soon counted among our ranks many Catholic Bishops and Archbishops and Dignitaries of all descriptions from Cardinals downwards; the Patriarch of Constantinople and other great Eastern prelates, the Primate of the Russlart Church ... I do not think any Anglican Bishops joined us, but a large number of clergy of the second order\". He gave the number of members as nine thousand. The formation of this association was, however, regarded with distrust by Dr. (later Cardinal) [[Henry Edward Manning|Manning]] and other Catholics, who also took exception to de Lisle's treatise ''On the Future Unity of Christendom''. The matter was referred to Rome and was finally settled by a papal rescript addressed ''Ad omnes episcopos Angli\u00e6'', dated 16 September 1864, which condemned the association and directed the bishops to take steps to prevent Catholics from joining it.\n\nThis was a great blow to de Lisle, who considered that \"the authorities had been deceived by a false relation of facts\".<ref>Letter to Editor of Union Review, 20 December 1864; ''Life'', I, 400</ref> He however withdrew his name from the A.P.U.C. \"under protest, as an act of submission to the Holy See\". The ground on which the association was condemned was that it subverted the Divine constitution of the Church, inasmuch as its aim rested on the supposition that the true Church consists partly of the Catholic Church in communion with Rome, \"partly also of the [[Photian Schism]] and the Anglican heresy, to which equally with the Roman Church belong the one Lord, the one faith and one baptism\" (Rescript, in ''Life'', I, 388). His own pamphlet was not censured, but the condemnation of the A.P.U.C. was regarded by him as the death-blow of his hopes for the reunion of Christendom during his own lifetime. But his own belief in it persevered and influenced his views in other Catholic affairs. Thus he warmly supported the attendance of Catholics at the English universities, and he even approved of the abortive project of a Uniate English Church.\n\nThe rest of his life passed without any very special incident, though he continued ever to take an interest in public affairs as affecting the fortunes of the Church, and in the same connection he carried on intimate and cordial correspondence with men as different as Newman, [[William Ewart Gladstone]], and [[Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert|Count de Montalembert]]. He counted among his friends [[John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury|John, Earl of Shrewsbury]], Cardinal Wiseman, [[A. W. N. Pugin]], who provided designs for Grace-Dieu, [[Frederick William Faber]], and many other well-known Catholics, and though he differed on many points from Cardinal Manning and Dr. [[William George Ward|W.G. Ward]] he remained on friendly terms with both. He died at [[Garendon Hall|Garendon]], survived by his wife and eleven of his sixteen children.\n\nBesides the pamphlets that have been mentioned, his other published works include ''Mahometanism in its relation to Prophecy; or an Inquiry into the prophecies concerning Anti-Christ, with some reference to their bearing on the events of the present day'' (1855). He also translated [[Dominic Barberi]]'s ''Lamentations of England'' (1831); Manzoni's ''Vindication of Catholic Morality'' (1836); Montalembert's ''St Elizabeth of Hungary'' (1839); Rio's ''La petite Chouannerie'' (1842); ''Maxims and Examples of the Saints'' (1844); and he compiled: ''Manual of Devotion for the Confraternity of the Living Rosary'' (1843); ''Catholic Christian's Complete Manual'' (1847); ''The Little Gradual'' (1847); ''Thesaurus anim\u00e6 Christian\u00e6'' (1847); ''Sequenti\u00e6 de Festis per Annum'' (1862).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092447600#page/n9/mode/2up Purcell, Edmund Sheridan.

The name ''Sansego'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''Sansegus'' meaning [[oregano]] which grows in abundance on the island.  A small percentage of natives still reside on the island which has increasingly become a popular tourist destination\u2014especially during the peak summer months.

Unfortunately, little of it prior to the 20th century is known.  This is a result of mainly three factors.  First, few of Susak's inhabitants prior to the 20th century had formal education.  Before the massive exodus off the island after [[World War II]], it was rare to find a resident who had finished the equivalent of grade school.  Next, most of the island's history was not recorded \u2013 it was passed down orally.  Finally, and probably most prevalent, the island's history was consistently manipulated, suppressed, and influenced by those who were its current rulers.{{cn|date=October 2017}}  For example, even the island's name changed at least three times (Sansagus, Sansego, and Susak) depending on which government controlled it.  For these reasons, it is difficult to precisely piece together the island's history.\n\n===Mythical origins===\n<blockquote>\n\"In Antiquity, when the archipelago was home to a Greek colony, the islands were called the Absyrtides.  This is because, according to an episode in the legend of the [[Argonauts]], [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] were said to have taken refuge here on the island of [[Minerva]] to escape pursuit by Absyrtus, the sorceress's brother, after they had stolen the [[golden fleece]].  Medea's brother found them, however, and fell into a trap she had laid: he was chopped into pieces and thrown into the sea where his body parts formed the many islets surrounding [[Cres]] and [[Lo\u0161inj]]. The [[Kolchians]], who had come with them, remained here and founded the city of Absoris.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Knopf\n|first=Alfred\n|title=Croatia and the Dalmatian Coast\n|publisher=Knopf Guides\n|year=2005\n|isbn=0-375-71112-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|last=[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]\n|first=Stephen Trzaskoma\n|title=Anthology of classical myth: primary sources in translation\n|url=https://books.google.at/books?id=K4pZr3JfYqcC&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|page=223\n|publisher=Stephen Trzaskoma, R.

While there is little or no surviving evidence from Susak supporting this claim, there are ancient remains - including buildings, mosaics, coins, and burial sarcophagi - on other islands surrounding Susak.  The latest Susak would have been settled is during the [[early Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Springer\n| first = Zvonko\n| title = Zvonko's Travels: Island of Susak\n| url=http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~zzspri/travels/susak/}}</ref>  Assuming Susak was settled then, probably Slavs would have ruled the island under the [[Byzantine Empire]] during that time period (circa 500 CE through circa 1000 CE).\n\n[[Giovanni the Deacon]] wrote the earliest surviving text referencing Susak in the early 11th century.  He wrote about [[Saracens]] in 844 destroying a fleet of Venetian ships.  The surviving ships were said to have fled to Sansego.\n\n[[File:Dalmazia1560.png|thumb|Map of the Venetian Republic circa 1560]]\n\nSusak was likely governed by the Croatian Kingdom during the 10th and 11th centuries.  In or around 1071, the Croatian King [[Peter Kre\u0161imir IV of Croatia|Kre\u0161imir]] gave Susak to [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monks]] to build an [[Order of Saint Benedict|abbey]] on the island.  The Benedictine monks governed Susak until sometime between the 12th century and 1267.  1267 is the year Istria became a territory of the [[Republic of Venice]] and it is likely that Susak was also ceded to the Venetians at or around the same time.  The monastery was operational from the 11th century until 1770 when the Church of Saint Nicholas was built to replace it.\n\nBetween the 13th and 18th centuries, Susak is mentioned in various documents, charts and official papers of [[Doge of Venice|Venetian doges]].  Around 1280, the oldest surviving nautical chart mentioning Susak, the ''[[Carta Pisana]]'' is published.{{sfn|Ostoji\u0107|2002|p=388}}  Between the 16th and 18th centuries, [[cartographer]]s detail a settlement on Susak.  In 1593, Christiaan Sgrooten<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title =Chrisiaan Sgrooten\n  | url =http://www.danstopicals.com/christiaansgrooten.htm}}</ref> was the first to chart a settlement on the island.  In the late 17th century, the cartographer Cornellius mentioned a tower on Susak: ''Villa e torre di Sansego''.  In 1771, cartographer [[Alberto Fortis]] cited a settlement on Susak with a church, harbor, and several coves and capes.\n\nAfter the Benedictine monks, the [[Republic of Venice]] was next to rule Susak.  Venetian rule lasted until April 17, 1797 when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] signed the [[Treaty of Leoben]] ceding the land between Istria and Dalmatia (including Susak) to Austria.  The proposed secession of this land to Austria was ratified on October 17, 1797 by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]].\n\n===Napoleon through modern times===\nAlthough Susak was now part of the [[Austrian Empire]], it was still under Napoleon's jurisdiction. This area between Istria and Dalmatia during this time (1797 through 1815) was known as the ''Illyrian provinces of Napoleon\u2019s Empire'' or ''Napoleon\u2019s Illyria'' for short.\n\nAfter Napoleon's exile, the Austrian Empire annexed Susak and much of the region per a Viennese congressional resolution.  The Austrian Empire and subsequently the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] ruled over the island for the next 100 years from roughly 1815 through the end of [[World War I]], in 1918. Under Austro-Hungarian rule, Susak became part of the [[Austrian Littoral|Austrian Littoral or K\u00fcstenland]].\n\nAfter the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] gave Susak and several other territories to the relatively new nation of Italy.  The Italian government under [[Benito Mussolini]] began the [[Italianization]] of these new Italian territories. On Susak, for example, the Italian government changed the spellings and pronunciations of several of the island's surnames. Tarabokija became Tarabocchia; Picini\u0107 became Picini. {immigrants from Susak would give Italian as their ethinicity and non Croatian, they themselves would spell Tarabocchia instead of Tarabokija since the Austro-Hungarian government had spent many efforts to reduce the Italian population. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[File:Un-croatia.svg|thumb|left|Map of Croatia based on 2004 U.N. map]]\n\nItalian sovereignty of Susak ended in September 1943 when the [[Allied invasion of Italy|Allies invaded Italy]]. The [[Nazi]]s established the [[Operation Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]] and took control of the area including Susak. The Nazis remained on the island until the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nIn 1947, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] formally ended World War II. Susak became part of the [[Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]] under [[Marshal Tito]]. Yugoslavia consisted of 6 republics, 1 autonomous district, and 1 autonomous province, Susak becoming a part of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]]. Around the middle of the 20th century, Susak experienced a mass exodus. \n\nOn June 25, 1991, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia and Susak remained a part of newly formed [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]].\n\n==Population==\nSusak's inhabitants reside in a single settlement of the same name. The settlement has two parts: atop a small hill, ''Gornje Selo'' is the older part of the village where the island's church is located; and ''Donje Selo'' is the lower part of the village adjacent to the seashore and small harbor.\n\nBetween 1948 and the early 1960s, the island's population plummeted because of the Istrian Exodus.{{cn|date=July 2017}} As of 2011, Susak had only 151 residents with approximately 2,500 emigrants or descendants of emigrants living in [[New Jersey]], [[United States]].{{sfn|Ostoji\u0107|2002|p=389}} While the greatest concentration of emigrants and descendants currently live in the [[New York City metropolitan area]] (particularly in [[northern New Jersey]]), most went to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], people from Susak can be found living throughout the United States.\n\nThere are only about a dozen surnames from Susak.<ref name=\"JL\"/> The engravings on the island's white tombstones boast these names (or some form of them): Busani\u0107, Hron\u010di\u0107, Lister, Mate\u0161i\u0107, Mirkovi\u0107, Morin, Picini\u0107, Sutora, Skrivani\u0107, and Tarabokija.\n\nBefore [[World War II]], most if not all of the inhabitants labored as [[vintner]]s, farmers, fisherman, or some combination of all three occupations. Today, the island's emigrants and descendants hold a wide variety of professions from [[longshoreman|longshoremen]] to conductors and from engineers to lawyers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The climate for to Italians to stay, especially after the mass killings of Italians in nearby Istria, was poor. The Croat and Slovenian nationalists in socialist government sought to impose collective punishment on the Italians afther annexation to Slavic state (Republic of Croatia in Yugoslav federation).\nHabitants of Susak-Sansego spoken in specific sansegotic's language, koine of romanic and slavic language and they don't liked proces of croatization in Croatia. Faced with poverty, famine, lack of employment opportunities, along with the desire for a better life, the island experienced a mass exodus between 1948 through the mid-1960s directly due to the political climate and nationalist policies. After World War II, [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia's]] new government, required that all able men work for a period of time without payment. Many of the Sansegots (people from Susak) by the mid-1960s, more than 80 percent of population had left the island.\n\nSusak's inhabitants immigrated to the United States for two main reasons. First, they believed that the United States would be able to offer them better opportunities for wealth, employment, education, and standard of living. Second, majority of the people who emigrated from Susak prior to World War II had moved to the United States, primarily to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Susak Women Fish.jpg|right|thumb|Two women from Susak proudly show off their day's catch]]For much of the island's history, Susak's inhabitants supported themselves by making wine, farming, and fishing.  The islanders produced a significant quantity of [[wine]] and [[grappa]] between 1936 and 1969 when a cooperative wine cellar aided in the production and manufacturing of the beverages.  At one time, there was also a fish cannery on the island.\n   \nBy the mid-1960s, Susak had become almost completely depopulated with its main town in virtual ruin.\n\n[[File:Susak-view-of-town-beach.jpg|left|thumb|View of the town beach from the Susak village on the hill]]\n[[File:Susak-narrow-streets.JPG|right|thumb|upright|The Susak village has very narrow streets]]\nToday, [[tourism]] is Susak's main industry although some wine is still produced - particularly a red wine called ''pleskunac'' and a dry ros\u00e9 called ''troji\u015b\u0107ina''.  Between June and September, several hundred tourists are visiting the island each day, over night or on day-long excursions.{{sfn|Ostoji\u0107|2002|p=389}} In the peak of the tourist season, in July and August, the island's population swells up to 1,500.{{sfn|Ostoji\u0107|2002|p=389}} A boost to Susak's tourism is the Susak Expo <ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = Susak Expo\n| url = http://susakpress.org/category/susak-expo}}</ref> \u2013 an international annual [[art]] event attracting leading, contemporary [[artist]]s, which has, in recent years, gained a reputation similar to the [[Venice Biennial]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Customs and traditions==\nDue to its significant distance from mainland [[Croatia]] and the many cultures which have through the years governed it, the people from Susak have many unique traditions.  Some traditions are exclusively the island's own (such as the island's language and the fanciful clothing).  Other traditions, such as cuisine, are a blend of the diverse customs from [[southern Europe|southern]] and [[central Europe]].\n\nThe people from Susak speak a distinct dialect which is heard only on the island and among the older generation of the island's emigrants.  Additionally, most of the island's population over the age of 60, to varying degrees, speaks Italian.\n\nThe islanders have a custom of referring to each other by nicknames, and the outsiders who visit Susak are often given a nickname too.<ref name=\"JL\"/>\n\n===Costume and clothing===\n[[File:Susak Woman Everyday.jpg|left|thumb|Woman from Susak wearing \"everyday\" garb circa 1940]]\nSusak is perhaps best known for the ornate and elaborate costumes worn by younger women primarily for special occasions such as a wedding or feast day.  The costume is made up of a short, brightly, almost neon, colored skirt with multiple ruffled [[petticoat]]s underneath which gives the wearer the appearance that she is dressed in a [[ballet tutu]].  A similar-colored vest is generally worn over a long-sleeved, white [[chemise]].  The outfit is accentuated by pink or orange woolen stockings, leather shoes, and a headpiece which matches the colors of the skirt.  When wearing this traditional outfit, women generally place one or both hands their hips to emphasize the dress's uniqueness.\n\nOlder and working women generally wear darker, longer skirts without ruffled petticoats. They wear white or dark, long-sleeved shirts, a short veil to cover their hair, and dark, woolen stockings.\n\nMale costumes from Susak are less ornate than their female counterparts. Men traditionally wear dark trousers and a dark vest over a long-sleeved, white, collared shirt.

The name ''Sansego'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''Sansegus'' meaning [[oregano]] which grows in abundance on the island.  A small percentage of natives still reside on the island which has increasingly become a popular tourist destination\u2014especially during the peak summer months.

Unfortunately, little of it prior to the 20th century is known.  This is a result of mainly three factors.  First, few of Susak's inhabitants prior to the 20th century had formal education.  Before the massive exodus off the island after [[World War II]], it was rare to find a resident who had finished the equivalent of grade school.  Next, most of the island's history was not recorded \u2013 it was passed down orally.  Finally, and probably most prevalent, the island's history was consistently manipulated, suppressed, and influenced by those who were its current rulers.{{cn|date=October 2017}}  For example, even the island's name changed at least three times (Sansagus, Sansego, and Susak) depending on which government controlled it.  For these reasons, it is difficult to precisely piece together the island's history.\n\n===Mythical origins===\n<blockquote>\n\"In Antiquity, when the archipelago was home to a Greek colony, the islands were called the Absyrtides.  This is because, according to an episode in the legend of the [[Argonauts]], [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] were said to have taken refuge here on the island of [[Minerva]] to escape pursuit by Absyrtus, the sorceress's brother, after they had stolen the [[golden fleece]].  Medea's brother found them, however, and fell into a trap she had laid: he was chopped into pieces and thrown into the sea where his body parts formed the many islets surrounding [[Cres]] and [[Lo\u0161inj]]. The [[Kolchians]], who had come with them, remained here and founded the city of Absoris.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Knopf\n|first=Alfred\n|title=Croatia and the Dalmatian Coast\n|publisher=Knopf Guides\n|year=2005\n|isbn=0-375-71112-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|last=[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]\n|first=Stephen Trzaskoma\n|title=Anthology of classical myth: primary sources in translation\n|url=https://books.google.at/books?id=K4pZr3JfYqcC&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|page=223\n|publisher=Stephen Trzaskoma, R.

While there is little or no surviving evidence from Susak supporting this claim, there are ancient remains - including buildings, mosaics, coins, and burial sarcophagi - on other islands surrounding Susak.  The latest Susak would have been settled is during the [[early Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Springer\n| first = Zvonko\n| title = Zvonko's Travels: Island of Susak\n| url=http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~zzspri/travels/susak/}}</ref>  Assuming Susak was settled then, probably Slavs would have ruled the island under the [[Byzantine Empire]] during that time period (circa 500 CE through circa 1000 CE).\n\n[[Giovanni the Deacon]] wrote the earliest surviving text referencing Susak in the early 11th century.  He wrote about [[Saracens]] in 844 destroying a fleet of Venetian ships.  The surviving ships were said to have fled to Sansego.\n\n[[File:Dalmazia1560.png|thumb|Map of the Venetian Republic circa 1560]]\n\nSusak was likely governed by the Croatian Kingdom during the 10th and 11th centuries.  In or around 1071, the Croatian King [[Peter Kre\u0161imir IV of Croatia|Kre\u0161imir]] gave Susak to [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monks]] to build an [[Order of Saint Benedict|abbey]] on the island.  The Benedictine monks governed Susak until sometime between the 12th century and 1267.  1267 is the year Istria became a territory of the [[Republic of Venice]] and it is likely that Susak was also ceded to the Venetians at or around the same time.  The monastery was operational from the 11th century until 1770 when the Church of Saint Nicholas was built to replace it.\n\nBetween the 13th and 18th centuries, Susak is mentioned in various documents, charts and official papers of [[Doge of Venice|Venetian doges]].  Around 1280, the oldest surviving nautical chart mentioning Susak, the ''[[Carta Pisana]]'' is published.{{sfn|Ostoji\u0107|2002|p=388}}  Between the 16th and 18th centuries, [[cartographer]]s detail a settlement on Susak.  In 1593, Christiaan Sgrooten<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title =Chrisiaan Sgrooten\n  | url =http://www.danstopicals.com/christiaansgrooten.htm}}</ref> was the first to chart a settlement on the island.  In the late 17th century, the cartographer Cornellius mentioned a tower on Susak: ''Villa e torre di Sansego''.  In 1771, cartographer [[Alberto Fortis]] cited a settlement on Susak with a church, harbor, and several coves and capes.\n\nAfter the Benedictine monks, the [[Republic of Venice]] was next to rule Susak.  Venetian rule lasted until April 17, 1797 when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] signed the [[Treaty of Leoben]] ceding the land between Istria and Dalmatia (including Susak) to Austria.  The proposed secession of this land to Austria was ratified on October 17, 1797 by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]].\n\n===Napoleon through modern times===\nAlthough Susak was now part of the [[Austrian Empire]], it was still under Napoleon's jurisdiction. This area between Istria and Dalmatia during this time (1797 through 1815) was known as the ''Illyrian provinces of Napoleon\u2019s Empire'' or ''Napoleon\u2019s Illyria'' for short.\n\nAfter Napoleon's exile, the Austrian Empire annexed Susak and much of the region per a Viennese congressional resolution.  The Austrian Empire and subsequently the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] ruled over the island for the next 100 years from roughly 1815 through the end of [[World War I]], in 1918. Under Austro-Hungarian rule, Susak became part of the [[Austrian Littoral|Austrian Littoral or K\u00fcstenland]].\n\nAfter the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] gave Susak and several other territories to the relatively new nation of Italy.  The Italian government under [[Benito Mussolini]] began the [[Italianization]] of these new Italian territories. On Susak, for example, the Italian government changed the spellings and pronunciations of several of the island's surnames. Tarabokija became Tarabocchia; Picini\u0107 became Picini. {immigrants from Susak would give Italian as their ethinicity and non Croatian, they themselves would spell Tarabocchia instead of Tarabokija since the Austro-Hungarian government had spent many efforts to reduce the Italian population. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[File:Un-croatia.svg|thumb|left|Map of Croatia based on 2004 U.N. map]]\n\nItalian sovereignty of Susak ended in September 1943 when the [[Allied invasion of Italy|Allies invaded Italy]]. The [[Nazi]]s established the [[Operation Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]] and took control of the area including Susak. The Nazis remained on the island until the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nIn 1947, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] formally ended World War II. Susak became part of the [[Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]] under [[Marshal Tito]]. Yugoslavia consisted of 6 republics, 1 autonomous district, and 1 autonomous province, Susak becoming a part of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]]. Around the middle of the 20th century, Susak experienced a mass exodus. \n\nOn June 25, 1991, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia and Susak remained a part of newly formed [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]].\n\n==Population==\nSusak's inhabitants reside in a single settlement of the same name. The settlement has two parts: atop a small hill, ''Gornje Selo'' is the older part of the village where the island's church is located; and ''Donje Selo'' is the lower part of the village adjacent to the seashore and small harbor.\n\nBetween 1948 and the early 1960s, the island's population plummeted because of the Istrian Exodus.{{cn|date=July 2017}} As of 2011, Susak had only 151 residents with approximately 2,500 emigrants or descendants of emigrants living in [[New Jersey]], [[United States]].{{sfn|Ostoji\u0107|2002|p=389}} While the greatest concentration of emigrants and descendants currently live in the [[New York City metropolitan area]] (particularly in [[northern New Jersey]]), most went to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], people from Susak can be found living throughout the United States.\n\nThere are only about a dozen surnames from Susak.<ref name=\"JL\"/> The engravings on the island's white tombstones boast these names (or some form of them): Busani\u0107, Hron\u010di\u0107, Lister, Mate\u0161i\u0107, Mirkovi\u0107, Morin, Picini\u0107, Sutora, Skrivani\u0107, and Tarabokija.\n\nBefore [[World War II]], most if not all of the inhabitants labored as [[vintner]]s, farmers, fisherman, or some combination of all three occupations. Today, the island's emigrants and descendants hold a wide variety of professions from [[longshoreman|longshoremen]] to conductors and from engineers to lawyers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The climate for to Italians to stay, especially after the mass killings of Italians in nearby Istria, was poor. The Croat and Slovenian nationalists in socialist government sought to impose collective punishment on the Italians afther annexation to Slavic state (Republic of Croatia in Yugoslav federation).\nHabitants of Susak-Sansego spoken in specific sansegotic's language, koine of romanic and slavic language and they don't liked proces of croatization in Croatia. Faced with poverty, famine, lack of employment opportunities, along with the desire for a better life, the island experienced a mass exodus between 1948 through the mid-1960s directly due to the political climate and nationalist policies. After World War II, [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia's]] new goverment, required that all able men work for a period of time without payment. Many of the Sansegots (people from Susak) by the mid-1960s, more than 80 percent of population had left the island.\n\nSusak's inhabitants immigrated to the United States for two main reasons. First, they believed that the United States would be able to offer them better opportunities for wealth, employment, education, and standard of living. Second, majority of the people who emigrated from Susak prior to World War II had moved to the United States, primarily to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Susak Women Fish.jpg|right|thumb|Two women from Susak proudly show off their day's catch]]For much of the island's history, Susak's inhabitants supported themselves by making wine, farming, and fishing.  The islanders produced a significant quantity of [[wine]] and [[grappa]] between 1936 and 1969 when a cooperative wine cellar aided in the production and manufacturing of the beverages.  At one time, there was also a fish cannery on the island.\n   \nBy the mid-1960s, Susak had become almost completely depopulated with its main town in virtual ruin.\n\n[[File:Susak-view-of-town-beach.jpg|left|thumb|View of the town beach from the Susak village on the hill]]\n[[File:Susak-narrow-streets.JPG|right|thumb|upright|The Susak village has very narrow streets]]\nToday, [[tourism]] is Susak's main industry although some wine is still produced - particularly a red wine called ''pleskunac'' and a dry ros\u00e9 called ''troji\u015b\u0107ina''.  Between June and September, several hundred tourists are visiting the island each day, over night or on day-long excursions.{{sfn|Ostoji\u0107|2002|p=389}} In the peak of the tourist season, in July and August, the island's population swells up to 1,500.{{sfn|Ostoji\u0107|2002|p=389}} A boost to Susak's tourism is the Susak Expo <ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = Susak Expo\n| url = http://susakpress.org/category/susak-expo}}</ref> \u2013 an international annual [[art]] event attracting leading, contemporary [[artist]]s, which has, in recent years, gained a reputation similar to the [[Venice Biennial]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Customs and traditions==\nDue to its significant distance from mainland [[Croatia]] and the many cultures which have through the years governed it, the people from Susak have many unique traditions.  Some traditions are exclusively the island's own (such as the island's language and the fanciful clothing).  Other traditions, such as cuisine, are a blend of the diverse customs from [[southern Europe|southern]] and [[central Europe]].\n\nThe people from Susak speak a distinct dialect which is heard only on the island and among the older generation of the island's emigrants.  Additionally, most of the island's population over the age of 60, to varying degrees, speaks Italian.\n\nThe islanders have a custom of referring to each other by nicknames, and the outsiders who visit Susak are often given a nickname too.<ref name=\"JL\"/>\n\n===Costume and clothing===\n[[File:Susak Woman Everyday.jpg|left|thumb|Woman from Susak wearing \"everyday\" garb circa 1940]]\nSusak is perhaps best known for the ornate and elaborate costumes worn by younger women primarily for special occasions such as a wedding or feast day.  The costume is made up of a short, brightly, almost neon, colored skirt with multiple ruffled [[petticoat]]s underneath which gives the wearer the appearance that she is dressed in a [[ballet tutu]].  A similar-colored vest is generally worn over a long-sleeved, white [[chemise]].  The outfit is accentuated by pink or orange woolen stockings, leather shoes, and a headpiece which matches the colors of the skirt.  When wearing this traditional outfit, women generally place one or both hands their hips to emphasize the dress's uniqueness.\n\nOlder and working women generally wear darker, longer skirts without ruffled petticoats. They wear white or dark, long-sleeved shirts, a short veil to cover their hair, and dark, woolen stockings.\n\nMale costumes from Susak are less ornate than their female counterparts. Men traditionally wear dark trousers and a dark vest over a long-sleeved, white, collared shirt.  The outfit is completed by a soft, dark cap and may be accentuated with a colorful belt or ribbons on the vest.\n\nDuring a period of mourning\u2014generally following the death of close family member such as a spouse, parent, sibling, or child\u2014people from Susak wear all black for a period of time.\n\n===Food===\n[[File:Losi from Susak.jpg|thumb|A plate of losi, a fried pastry made with lemons]]\nSusak's cuisine combines a unique blend of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Croatian cuisine|Croatian]], [[Cuisine of Austria|Austrian]], and [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]] cooking.  Seafood\u2014especially fish such as sardines, mackerel, and grouper\u2014is popular fare due to its relative abundance.  Lamb and pork cooked on an open fire are also popular but are generally reserved for special occasions.\n\nFor dessert, the people of Susak enjoy [[Palacinke]] filled with jam or fruit, [[strudel]] (a throw-back from when the island was under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), or losi, a fried pastry made with flour and sprinkled with powered sugar.\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Cite journal\n  | title=Opskrbljivanje stanovni\u0161tva otoka Suska pitkom vodom\n  |trans-title=Potable water public supply on the island of Susak\n  | url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/54568\n  | last=Ostoji\u0107\n  | first=Borislav\n  | journal=Pomorski zbornik\n  | volume=40\n  | issue=1\n  | date=May 2002\n  | pages=387\u2013408\n  | language=Croatian\n  | format=PDF\n  | accessdate=12 July 2017\n  | ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n  | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/32914\n  | title = Otok Susak \u2013 mogu\u0107nosti revitalizacije\n  |trans-title=The island of Susak - prospects of revitalization\n  | last = Sokoli\u0107\n  | first = Julijano\n  | journal = Dru\u0161tvena istra\u017eivanja\n  | volume = 3\n  | issue = 4\u20135 (12\u201313)\n  | date = July 1994\n  | pages = 503\u2013515\n  | language = hr\n  | format = PDF\n  | accessdate = 14 July 2017\n  | ref = harv}}\n\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Tur\u010di\u0107\n  | first =Don Antun\n  | title = Susak - otok pijeska, trstike i vinograda\n  |trans-title=Susak - the Island of Sand, Reed and Vineyards\n  | year =1998\n  | isbn = 953-96752-1-9\n  | publisher =Parish office\n  | location =Susak\n  | language =hr\n  | ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*{{cite book\n| title = Susak - Environmental Reconstruction of a Loess Island in the Adriatic\n| publisher = Geographical Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences\n| location = Budapest\n| year = 2003}}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Bousfield\n  | first =Jonathan\n  | title =The Rough Guide to Croatia\n  | publisher =Rough Guides\n  | year =2003\n  | isbn = 1-84353-084-8}}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Jo\n  | first =Melvin\n  | title =Susak Conversations\n  | publisher =Susak Press\n  | year =2006\n  | isbn = 978-1-905659-02-9}}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Filipovi\u0107\n  | first =Rudolf\n  | title =The Struggle to Maintain Croatian Dialects in the U.S.\n  | journal = Trends in Linguistics; Studies and Monographs 100; Language and Its Ecology\n  | editor-last =Eliasson\n  | editor-first =Stig\n  | editor2-last =Jahr\n  | editor2-first =Ernst\n  | publisher =Walter de Gruyter\n  | year =1997\n  | isbn = 3-11-014688-6\n  | postscript =<!--None-->}}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Foster\n  | first =Jane\n  | title =Footprint Croatia\n  | publisher =Footprint Travel Guides\n  | year =2004\n  | isbn = 1-903471-79-6}}\n*{{cite book\n  | editor-last =Mirkovi\u0107\n  | editor-first =Mijo\n  | title =Otok Susak: zemlja, voda, ljudi, gospodarstvo, dru\u0161tveni razvitak, govor, no\u0161nja, gra\u0111evine, pjesma i zdravlje\n  | series =Djela Jugoslavenske akademije znanosti i umjetnosti\n  | volume =49\n  | location =Zagreb\n  | publisher =Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts\n  | year =1957\n  | language =hr\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Oliver\n  | first =Jeanne\n  | title =Croatia\n  | publisher =Lonely Planet\n  | year =2005\n  | isbn =1-74059-487-8\n  | url-access =registration\n  | url =https://archive.org/details/croatia00jean_0\n  }}\n*{{Cite book\n  | last =Strci\u0107\n  | first =Petar\n  | title =Croatian Adriatic Islands\n  | place=Zagreb\n  | publisher =Laurana & Trsat\n  | year =1996|display-authors=etal}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Island of Susak}}\n* [http://www.susak.si Island of Susak - touristic information - houses]\n* [http://www.otok-susak.org/en/ Island of Susak - touristic information]\n* [http://susakpress.org/category/susak-expo/ Official Susak Expo site]\n* [http://www.susakklapa.com/index.html Susak Klapa Online]\n* [http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~zzspri/travels/susak/index.html Island of Susak]\n* [http://www.sansego.net/ Sansego.net]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ZZGa_LrOI Slide show of a wedding held on the island in 1957 - notice the traditional and elaborate outfits (particularly worn by women)]\n* [http://www.apartmani-grgac-susak.com/index.htm Otok Susak (site is in Croatian)]\n* [http://www.istrianet.org/ Istria on the Internet]\n* [http://www.istrianet.org/istria/customs/costumes/04narodne.htm Folk Costumes from Istria]\n* [http://www.susakpress.com/ Susak Press]\n\n{{Islands of Croatia}}\n{{Inhabited Islands of Croatia}}\n\n[[Category:Islands of Croatia]]\n[[Category:Islands of the Adriatic Sea]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]]\n", "name_user": "Allenthalben", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo: Government.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susak"}

'''[[Environmental impact]]s''' affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena. '''Sociocultural impacts''' are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods.<ref name=\"Mason\" />  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources. '''[[Economic impact]]s''' are usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Cultural education may also be improved, which can be overlooked.<ref name=\"Rollins et al 2016\">Rollins, R., Dearden P. and Fennell, D. (2016) \"Tourism, Ecotourism and Protected Areas\". In P. Dearden, R. Rollins and M.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17\u201337.</ref> Indirect impacts on trails include changes in [[soil porosity]], changes to [[Microbiota|microflora]] composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.<ref>Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> \n\nAs many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random [[Campsite|campsites]]. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, [[baboons]] and [[hyenas]] have learnt to track tourist [[safari]] vehicles to lead them to [[cheetah]] kills, which they then steal.<ref>Roe, D., Leader-Williams, N., & Dalal-Clayton, D. B. (1997). \"Take only photographs, leave only footprints: the environmental impacts of wildlife tourism\", (No. 10). Iied.</ref> This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the [[food webs]] and [[keystone species]].\n\nThere is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to [[Trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] lions, [[rhino]], [[leopard]]s, and even [[giraffes]]. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by [[trophy hunting]]. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.<ref>Ripple, W. J., Newsome, T. M., & Kerley, G. I. (2016). \"Does Trophy Hunting Support Biodiversity? A Response to Di Minin, et al.\". ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution''.</ref>\n\nAnother tourism destination activity is [[scuba diving]]. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by [[recreational diving]]. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that \"na\u00efve\" divers who engage in [[underwater photography]] are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef.<ref>Sorice, M. G., Oh, C. O., & Ditton, R. B.

(1994). \"The growth of coastal tourism in the Red Sea: present and future effects on coral reefs\".

There are also indirect impacts such as shoreline construction of superstructure and infrastructure.\n\n=== Transit effects ===\n{{see|Environmental impact of transport}}\nSince 2009 there has been a steady yearly increase in the number of tourist arrivals worldwide of approximately 4.4 percent.

[[Anthropogenic climate change]] has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.\n\n== Sociocultural impacts of tourism ==\nAn inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of [https://www.andamanbliss.com/ authenticity], the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.<ref name=\"Fernandes\">([http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes]){{Dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagence\">(Fagence, http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf){{Dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\n===Commodification of culture===\n[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|journal=Tourist Studies}}</ref> There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. [[Rural tourism]] is seen as a \"cure\" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/news/top_news/2017/03/06/content_281475586651838.htm|title=Tourism seen as cure for poverty in central, west regions|website=english.gov.cn|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref> For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.academia.edu/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

Channel View Publications.</ref><ref name =\"Ryan\"/>\n\n=== Negative sociocultural impacts ===\nThere can be negative effects from cultural interactions.<ref>Long, V. H. (1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Economic impacts ==\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5&nbsp;billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">Turner, R.

This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D.

''Tourism and Society; A guide to problems and issues''. Venture Publishing. State College, Pennsylvania. Chapters 01-03</ref> A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.<ref>Kyungmi K. (2002) Doctor of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism and Management: [https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/29954/Title_and_Text.pdf?sequence=1 The Effects of Tourism Impacts upon Quality of Life of Residents in the community], Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Retrieved from: 28 November 2016</ref>\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\"/><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J. J. (1993). \"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year.

As the population increases so do the impacts, [[resources]] become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted.<ref name=\"Nelson\">J.G Nelson, R.

University of Waterloo</ref> Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and [[regulations]]. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\nAdditionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/> Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\">Tyrrell, T.

Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional [[superstructure]] and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n===Tourism satellite account===\nThe [[World Travel and Tourism Council]] (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like [[forest industry|forestry]] or [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]]<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\nBefore TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.<ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\">Buhalis, D., & Costa, C. (2006). ''Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools''.

For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it:\n\n* provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment\n* is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism\n* is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission\n* is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development\n* provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments\n* provides information on tourism human resource characteristics\n\nThrough collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap.<ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and \"tourism's contribution to gross domestic product\".<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n=== Projections for 2020 ===\nPredictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the [[world economy|world's economic system]] appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6&nbsp;billion by the year 2020.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of those tourists, 1.18&nbsp;billion are expected to be intra-regional, and 377 million to be long-haul.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of these travelers, arrivals in [[developing countries]] are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Norjana et al., 2014\"/><ref name=\"Zhang et al\" />\nDirect contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and GDP are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> [[employment rate|Employment]] is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sustainable tourism]]\n*[[Overtourism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite journal|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325376012|first1= A.|last1= Gorrini|first2= V.|last2=Bertini |title= Walkability assessment and tourism cities: the case of Venice|date= 31 May 2018|quote= Tourism-based assessment in the historical Venice.

'''[[Environmental impact]]s''' affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena. '''Sociocultural impacts''' are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods.<ref name=\"Mason\" />  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources. '''[[Economic impact]]s''' are usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Cultural education may also be improved, which can be overlooked.<ref name=\"Rollins et al 2016\">Rollins, R., Dearden P. and Fennell, D. (2016) \"Tourism, Ecotourism and Protected Areas\". In P.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17\u201337.</ref> Indirect impacts on trails include changes in [[soil porosity]], changes to [[Microbiota|microflora]] composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.<ref>Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> \n\nAs many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random [[Campsite|campsites]]. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, [[baboons]] and [[hyenas]] have learnt to track tourist [[safari]] vehicles to lead them to [[cheetah]] kills, which they then steal.<ref>Roe, D., Leader-Williams, N., & Dalal-Clayton, D. B. (1997). \"Take only photographs, leave only footprints: the environmental impacts of wildlife tourism\", (No. 10). Iied.</ref> This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the [[food webs]] and [[keystone species]].\n\nThere is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to [[Trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] lions, [[rhino]], [[leopard]]s, and even [[giraffes]]. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by [[trophy hunting]]. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.<ref>Ripple, W. J., Newsome, T. M., & Kerley, G. I. (2016). \"Does Trophy Hunting Support Biodiversity? A Response to Di Minin, et al.\". ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution''.</ref>\n\nAnother tourism destination activity is [[scuba diving]]. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by [[recreational diving]]. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that \"na\u00efve\" divers who engage in [[underwater photography]] are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef.<ref>Sorice, M. G., Oh, C. O., & Ditton, R. B.

[[Anthropogenic climate change]] has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.\n\n== Sociocultural impacts of tourism ==\nAn inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of [[wikt:authenticity|authenticity]], the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.<ref name=\"Fernandes\">([http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes]){{Dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagence\">(Fagence, http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf){{Dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\n===Commodification of culture===\n[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|journal=Tourist Studies}}</ref> There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. [[Rural tourism]] is seen as a \"cure\" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/news/top_news/2017/03/06/content_281475586651838.htm|title=Tourism seen as cure for poverty in central, west regions|website=english.gov.cn|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref> For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.academia.edu/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

(1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Economic impacts ==\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5&nbsp;billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">Turner, R. (2015). ''Travel and Tourism: Economic Impact 2015 World'' (pp. 1\u201320).

(2007). \"Regional economic impacts of tourism: The case of Denmark\". ''Regional Studies'', 41(6), 839\u2013854.</ref>\n\nThe economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities.  Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\">Goeldner, C. R., & Ritchie, J. B. (2007). ''Tourism Principles, Practices, Philosophies''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by \"residents and non-residents for business and leisure purposes\".<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nIn contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D.

Toronto: Oxford University Press</ref> For example, a foreign tourist injects money into the local economy when he spends a dollar on a souvenir made by a local at the tourism destination.

(1997). \"Estimating the economic impacts of tourism\". ''Annals of Tourism Research'', 24(3), 592\u2013608.</ref>\n\n=== Positive and negative economic impacts of tourism ===\nThere are both positive and negative effects on communities related to the economic impacts of tourism in their communities.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/>  A positive impact can refer to the increase in jobs, a higher quality of life for locals, and an increase in wealth of an area. Tourism also has the advantage of rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures.<ref name=\"Wyllie\">Robert W. Wyllie. 2000. ''Tourism and Society; A guide to problems and issues''. Venture Publishing. State College, Pennsylvania. Chapters 01-03</ref> A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.<ref>Kyungmi K. (2002) Doctor of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism and Management: [https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/29954/Title_and_Text.pdf?sequence=1 The Effects of Tourism Impacts upon Quality of Life of Residents in the community], Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Retrieved from: 28 November 2016</ref>\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\"/><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J. J. (1993). \"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\nNegative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the tourist destination site with detrimental impacts to the social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, [[resources]] become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted.<ref name=\"Nelson\">J.G Nelson, R. Butler, G. Wall. (1999). \"Tourism and Sustainable Development; A Civic Approach\". ''Heritage Resource Centre Joint Publication'', Number 2. ''University of Waterloo and Department of Geography Publication Series'', Number 52. University of Waterloo</ref> Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and [[regulations]]. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\nAdditionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/> Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\">Tyrrell, T. J., & Johnston, R. J. (2006). \"The Economic Impacts of Tourism: A Special Issue\". ''Journal of Travel Research'', 45(1), 3\u20137.</ref> Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay those individuals lower wages, which further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional [[superstructure]] and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n===Tourism satellite account===\nThe [[World Travel and Tourism Council]] (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like [[forest industry|forestry]] or [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]]<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\nBefore TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.<ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\">Buhalis, D., & Costa, C. (2006). ''Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools''. Routledge.</ref> This gap meant missed opportunities for development, as tourism stakeholders were unable to understand where they might be able to better establish themselves in the tourism economy.

country's population. During the [[interwar period]] it served as the capital of the [[South Seas Mandate]], a group of islands that made up the [[League of Nations mandate]]d territory held by the [[Empire of Japan]]. It was subsequently the capital of Palau until it was replaced by [[Ngerulmud]] in 2006.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YTzVs8WRhKkC&pg=PA37&dq=koror+city+capital+palau&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifpJKhxL7WAhWEAsAKHfjnBfgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=koror%20city%20capital%20palau&f=false|title=Papa Mike\u00fds Palau Islands Handbook|last=Hollywood|first=Mike|date=2006-01-12|publisher=iUniverse|year=|isbn=9780595820009|location=|pages=37|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\n* [[Belau National Museum]]\n* [[Etpison Museum]]\n* [[Palau High School]]\n* [[National Stadium (Palau)|Palau National Stadium]]\n* [[Palau Public Library]]\n* [[WCTC Shopping Center]]\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nKoror City is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|PHI}} [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles]], [[Philippines]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://angelescity.com/news/view/555|title=Koror, Palau and Angeles now sister cities|first=|last=|publisher=|access-date=2017-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222050950/http://angelescity.com/news/view/555|archive-date=2017-12-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|PHI}} [[Davao City]], [[Philippines]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/390597/davao-city-palau-forge-sisterhood-accord|title=Davao City, Palau forge sisterhood accord|first=|last=|publisher=}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|USA}} [[Gilroy, California]], [[United States]]\n* {{flagicon|IDN}} [[Manado]], [[Indonesia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{palau-geo-stub}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Palau]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Palau]]\n", "name_user": "ExplodingPoPUps", "label": "safe", "comment": "The city is founded on 1866.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koror_City"}
