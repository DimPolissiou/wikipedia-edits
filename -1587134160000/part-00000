He played for the Athletic Club in the [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]] competition.

The North Island were thrashed 46 to 5 with Loveridge playing in the three-quarters <ref>{{cite news\n| title = England (46) North Island (5)/A Crushing Defeat\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Hastings Standard, Volume X, Issue 198\n| date = 1920-08-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/HAST19200805.2.3.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-16}}</ref>. Then on August 7 just 3 days later Loveridge travelled down to Christchurch to make his test debut for New Zealand. The match was played at Lancaster Park with 6,000 spectators present.

Loveridge\u2019s performance at fullback came in for some comment by the scribes of the time. The general consensus being that he was too hesitant in the fullback position and hung on to the ball too long. The writer for the ''Sun'' (Christchurch) said that he was \u201cweak\u201d, and that \u201che misjudged several kicks, and was tackled in possession on a number of occasions. In addition he missed his man two of three times through lack of determination\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Second Test Match\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Sun (Christchurch), Volume VII, Issue 2023\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19200809.2.6.6\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The writer for the ''Star'' said that \u201cLoveridge nearly had the team in difficulties through holding on too long. By a stroke of good luck however he was able to relieve the position by marking just in front of the posts\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = England Wins, Nineteen Points to Three/Mud Scramble on Lancaster Park\n| page = 10\n| publisher = Star, Issue 20019\n| date = 1920-08-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TS19200807.2.72\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The ''Lyttelton Times'' writer described a passage of play where \u201cLoveridge failed to beat [[Harold Wagstaff|Wagstaff]] before kicking. He was collared, and it looked as if the Englishmen were likely to score\u201d and later a passing rush by England \u201cended in [[Billy Stone (rugby league)|Stone]] side stepping Loveridge and dashing over at the corner <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/English Team Wins Second Test Match\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Lyttelton Times, 9 August 1920\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/LT19200809.2.71\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.\n\nThis was to be his only test match for New Zealand. In fact Loveridge did not even pull on the Auckland jersey. In 1921 and 1922 he continued to play for Marist in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He scored a try in a 27-15 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] and he kicked 5 goals in other matches <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City\u2019s Easy Victory/Wins to Ponsonby and Newton\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIII| issue=161\n| date = 1922-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220710.2.118\n| accessdate = 2019-08-27}}</ref>. Loveridge stopped playing for Marist at the end of this season and does not appear to have played again. In 1927 he was reinstated back into rugby but it is unlikely that he pulled on the boots again officially due to work commitments and he was aged 35 by this point <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Teams for Tomorrow\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIII, Issue 189\n| date = 1922-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220811.2.114\n| accessdate = 2020-04-16}}</ref>.\n\n==Personal life and death==\n===Marriage and children===\nNorm Loverage married Myrtle Francis Manley on March 25, 1913 <ref>{{cite news\n| title = In Divorce/Undefended Cases/Desertion the Main Ground\n| page = 6\n| publisher = Evening Post, Volume CVIII, Issue 101\n| date = 1924-10-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19241029.2.82\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>, they had a son, Darrell William Loveridge in 1913, and another son Raymond Louvain Loveridge in 1915. Raymond died at just 3 weeks of age. They had a daughter in 1919 named Veronica Myrtle Elizabeth Loveridge. \n\nIn 1918 Loveridge was required to serve in the military but he appealed on the grounds of \u201cundue hardship (family reasons)\u201d with the case adjourned until the next sitting of the Wellington Military Service Board <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Military Service/Sitting of Board/Further Appeals\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Evening Post, Volume XCVI, Issue 33\n| date = 1918-08-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19180807.2.47\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.

He played for the Athletic Club in the [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]] competition.

Then on August 7 just 3 days later Loveridge travelled down to Christchurch to make his test debut for New Zealand. The match was played at Lancaster Park with 6,000 spectators present.

Loveridge\u2019s performance at fullback came in for some comment by the scribes of the time. The general consensus being that he was too hesitant in the fullback position and hung on to the ball too long. The writer for the ''Sun'' (Christchurch) said that he was \u201cweak\u201d, and that \u201che misjudged several kicks, and was tackled in possession on a number of occasions. In addition he missed his man two of three times through lack of determination\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Second Test Match\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Sun (Christchurch), Volume VII, Issue 2023\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19200809.2.6.6\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The writer for the ''Star'' said that \u201cLoveridge nearly had the team in difficulties through holding on too long. By a stroke of good luck however he was able to relieve the position by marking just in front of the posts\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = England Wins, Nineteen Points to Three/Mud Scramble on Lancaster Park\n| page = 10\n| publisher = Star, Issue 20019\n| date = 1920-08-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TS19200807.2.72\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The ''Lyttelton Times'' writer described a passage of play where \u201cLoveridge failed to beat [[Harold Wagstaff|Wagstaff]] before kicking. He was collared, and it looked as if the Englishmen were likely to score\u201d and later a passing rush by England \u201cended in [[Billy Stone (rugby league)|Stone]] side stepping Loveridge and dashing over at the corner <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/English Team Wins Second Test Match\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Lyttelton Times, 9 August 1920\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/LT19200809.2.71\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.\n\nThis was to be his only test match for New Zealand. In fact Loveridge did not even pull on the Auckland jersey. In 1921 and 1922 he continued to play for Marist in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He scored a try in a 27-15 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] and he kicked 5 goals in other matches <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City\u2019s Easy Victory/Wins to Ponsonby and Newton\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIII| issue=161\n| date = 1922-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220710.2.118\n| accessdate = 2019-08-27}}</ref>. Loveridge stopped playing for Marist at the end of this season and does not appear to have played again. In 1927 he was reinstated back into rugby but it is unlikely that he pulled on the boots again officially due to work commitments and he was aged 35 by this point <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Teams for Tomorrow\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LIII, Issue 189\n| date = 1922-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220811.2.114\n| accessdate = 2020-04-16}}</ref>.\n\n==Personal life and death==\n===Marriage and children===\nNorm Loverage married Myrtle Francis Manley on March 25, 1913 <ref>{{cite news\n| title = In Divorce/Undefended Cases/Desertion the Main Ground\n| page = 6\n| publisher = Evening Post, Volume CVIII, Issue 101\n| date = 1924-10-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19241029.2.82\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>, they had a son, Darrell William Loveridge in 1913, and another son Raymond Louvain Loveridge in 1915.

{"title_page": "Sports in North America", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=September 2017}}\n\nThere is a wide variety of organized sports in the continent of North America. The continent is the birthplace of several of these organized sports, such as [[basketball]], [[gridiron football]] (including both [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football|Canadian]] games), [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[racquetball]], [[rodeo]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and [[volleyball]]. The modern versions of [[baseball]] and [[softball]], [[skateboarding]], [[snowboarding]], [[stock car racing]], and [[surfing]] also developed in North America.\n\nSports leagues in Canada and the United States use a closed, franchise model which has the same teams playing every year, with occasional additions of [[expansion team]]s or [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocations of existing teams]]. Leagues in other North American countries use [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two divisions based on their performance at the end of each season.\n\nThe [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] dominate organized men's professional team sports in those two countries: [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). [[Liga MX]], the top-level Association football in Mexico is also widely popular. In the [[Caribbean]], where [[Cricket in the West Indies|cricket is popular]], that region's major domestic competitions include the [[Regional Four Day Competition]], the [[Regional Super50]], and the [[Caribbean Premier League]].\n\n[[Major women's sport leagues in North America|Women's professional sports]] in the U.S. and Canada include the [[Women's National Basketball Association]], the [[National Women's Soccer League]], and the [[National Women's Hockey League]]. Individual professional sports organizations based in North America include [[INDYCAR]] and [[NASCAR]] in [[auto racing]], the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[LPGA Tour]] in golf, and the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA). [[College athletics]] in Canada are organized by [[U Sports]] and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] (CCAA). In the U.S., they are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) and the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA).\n\n==Franchise organization in the U.S. and Canada==\n{{main|Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|Promotion and relegation#United States and Canada}}\n\nA distinct feature in American and Canadian professional sports leagues, compared to many other countries around the world, is the lack of [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two levels based on their performance for the completed [[Season (sports)|season]]. Other North American countries, such as the [[Mexican football league system|Mexico's football league system]], may have a promotion and relegation process, where, for example, teams may transfer between the Mexican top level [[Liga MX]] and the second level [[Ascenso MX]].\n\nInstead, professional sports leagues in the U.S. and Canada use a closed, franchise model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of [[expansion teams]] and [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation of existing teams]], and with no team movement between the top level, the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]]s, and the lower levels, the [[minor league]]s. The minor league system then can be generally viewed as an informal relegation system based on ''individual players'' rather than teams. Many minor league teams are generally affiliated with major league teams. Players remain employees of, or under contract to, the parent organization and are assigned to the minor league level appropriate to their skill and development. Skillful players are often promoted, or 'called up', to the parent major league team while under-performing players or players recovering from a major injury are 'sent down' to an affiliated minor league team.\n\n[[College athletics]] act as the primary suppliers of players to the professional leagues. Many [[College athletics in the United States|college sports in the U.S.]] are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), which divides schools into three divisions based on the size and organization of each institution: [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] for large schools, [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] for smaller schools, and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] for schools who do not offer any [[athletic scholarship]] to students. In Canada, college sports are organized by [[U Sports]] for universities and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] for colleges. The [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) has members in both the U.S. and Canada.\n\n==Team sports==\n===Football===\n{{see also|Football#North American football codes}}\nNorth America is the birthplace of [[gridiron football]], the form of [[football]] that originally developed, and is primarily played, in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"Britannica-Gridiron\">{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football | title=Gridiron football | publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] | accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> Both major forms, [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], developed in the late 19th century out of the original games now known as [[rugby football]] and [[association football]].

[[College football]] in the U.S. is primarily organized by the NCAA. The NCAA further divides its Division I football teams into the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] and the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]]. The Football Bowl Subdivision has the largest and most competitive schools, and is noted for its system of postseason [[bowl game]]s.\n\n[[USA Football]] is the [[Sports governing body|governing body]] for amateur American football in the U.S., and is a member of the [[International Federation of American Football]] (IFAF), the international governing body of American football associations. Several other North American counties are a part of [[IFAF Americas]], the federation of IFAF members in the Americas.\n\nIn Mexico, the [[Liga de F\u00fatbol Americano Profesional]] is the professional league, while [[ONEFA]] organizes college football.\n\n====Canadian football====\nThe [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) is the highest professional level of Canadian football, with teams across Canada. Teams from Canadian universities compete in [[U Sports football]]. The [[Canadian Junior Football League]] and [[Quebec Junior Football League]] field teams with players aged 18\u201322.\n\n[[Football Canada]] is the governing body for amateur Canadian football. Although it primarily focuses on the Canadian form of the game, it is also a member of the International Federation of American Football.\n\n====Association football====\n[[CONCACAF]] is the continental governing body for association football in North America, and runs two visible tournaments: the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] and the Champions League <ref name=\"concacaf.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.concacaf.com/concacaf|title=CONCACAF|work=CONCACAF}}</ref> The Gold Cup is competed every two years among the [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] to determine the regional champion of North America. The [[CONCACAF Champions League|Champions League]] is an annual continental competition for the top football clubs in North America, with the winner advancing to the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].\n\n[[Liga MX]] is North America's most popular association football league with an average attendance of 25,557 during the [[2014-15 Liga MX season|2014\u201315 season]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A quick primer on Mexico's Liga MX |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/quick-primer-mexicos-liga-mx/ |publisher=Media Life Magazine |accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref> It forms the top level of the [[Mexican football league system|Mexican men's, four-level league system]], with [[Ascenso MX]], [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]], and [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]]. This Mexican league system uses [[promotion and relegation]], where teams are transferred between levels based on their final records at the end of the season. For women, the [[Super Liga Femenil de F\u00fatbol]] is at the top level.\n\nThe men's professional soccer league systems in both [[United States soccer league system|the U.S.]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canada]] instead primarily use the closed, franchise model which primarily always has the same teams playing. [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) represents the highest level, while the second level consists of the [[USL Championship]]. Although the MLS has teams in both countries, they are only sanctioned by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF), the governing body of soccer in the United States. The [[Canadian Soccer Association]], the governing body in Canada, instead sanctions two third-level semi-pro all-Canadian leagues at the third level: [[League1 Ontario]] and [[Premi\u00e8re Ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec]], as well as a separate level-one league, the [[Canadian Premier League]]. The United States has the [[USL League One]] and [[National Independent Soccer Association]], which are both professional. For women' professional soccer, the [[National Women's Soccer League]] is at the top level, and [[United Women's Soccer]] and [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] are at the second level. [[College soccer]] is played both in the U.S. and Canada, with top players often going on to play professional.\n\nOther countries with multi-level professional league systems include [[Football in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Football in El Salvador#League System|El Salvador]], [[Football in Guatemala#League system|Guatemala]], [[Football in Honduras#Football competitions|Honduras]], [[Jamaican football league system|Jamaica]], [[Football in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], and [[Football in Panama|Panama]]. Most of these use promotion and regulation.\n\n===Baseball===\n{{see also|List of organized baseball leagues#Americas}}\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the United States. The sport is currently popular in various other North American countries.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) is the top professional level of baseball, while [[Minor League Baseball]] (MiLB) comprises several levels and multiple component leagues below MLB.

Several more independent leagues operate in the U.S. and Canada. Primarily because of MiLB, [[college baseball]] plays a smaller role in developing professional players than what college football does with its players.\n\nOther professional leagues in North America include the [[Dominican Professional Baseball League]], [[Liga Mexicana del Pac\u00edfico]] in Mexico, the [[Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League]], the [[Panamanian Professional Baseball League]], and the [[Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]] in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe [[Cuban National Series]] is the primary domestic amateur baseball competition in Cuba. It forms part of the [[Cuban baseball league system]], run by the [[Baseball Federation of Cuba]], the governing body of baseball in that country. Amateur baseball in Canada includes [[Ligue de Baseball \u00c9lite du Qu\u00e9bec]], the [[New Brunswick Senior Baseball League]], and the [[Nova Scotia Senior Baseball League]].

The modern versions of [[baseball]] and [[softball]], [[skateboarding]], [[snowboarding]], [[stock car racing]], and [[surfing]] also developed in North America.\n\nSports leagues in Canada and the United States use a closed, franchise model which has the same teams playing every year, with occasional additions of [[expansion team]]s or [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocations of existing teams]]. Leagues in other North American countries use [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two divisions based on their performance at the end of each season.\n\nThe [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] dominate organized men's professional team sports in those two countries: [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). [[Liga MX]], the top-level Association football in Mexico is also widely popular. In the [[Caribbean]], where [[Cricket in the West Indies|cricket is popular]], that region's major domestic competitions include the [[Regional Four Day Competition]], the [[Regional Super50]], and the [[Caribbean Premier League]].\n\n[[Major women's sport leagues in North America|Women's professional sports]] in the U.S. and Canada include the [[Women's National Basketball Association]], the [[National Women's Soccer League]], and the [[National Women's Hockey League]]. Individual professional sports organizations based in North America include [[INDYCAR]] and [[NASCAR]] in [[auto racing]], the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[LPGA Tour]] in golf, and the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA). [[College athletics]] in Canada are organized by [[U Sports]] and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] (CCAA). In the U.S., they are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) and the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA).\n\n==Franchise organization in the U.S. and Canada==\n{{main|Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|Promotion and relegation#United States and Canada}}\n\nA distinct feature in American and Canadian professional sports leagues, compared to many other countries around the world, is the lack of [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two levels based on their performance for the completed [[Season (sports)|season]]. Other North American countries, such as the [[Mexican football league system|Mexico's football league system]], may have a promotion and relegation process, where, for example, teams may transfer between the Mexican top level [[Liga MX]] and the second level [[Ascenso MX]].\n\nInstead, professional sports leagues in the U.S. and Canada use a closed, franchise model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of [[expansion teams]] and [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation of existing teams]], and with no team movement between the top level, the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]]s, and the lower levels, the [[minor league]]s. The minor league system then can be generally viewed as an informal relegation system based on ''individual players'' rather than teams. Many minor league teams are generally affiliated with major league teams. Players remain employees of, or under contract to, the parent organization and are assigned to the minor league level appropriate to their skill and development. Skillful players are often promoted, or 'called up', to the parent major league team while under-performing players or players recovering from a major injury are 'sent down' to an affiliated minor league team.\n\n[[College athletics]] act as the primary suppliers of players to the professional leagues. Many [[College athletics in the United States|college sports in the U.S.]] are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), which divides schools into three divisions based on the size and organization of each institution: [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] for large schools, [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] for smaller schools, and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] for schools who do not offer any [[athletic scholarship]] to students. In Canada, college sports are organized by [[U Sports]] for universities and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] for colleges. The [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) has members in both the U.S. and Canada.\n\n==Team sports==\n===Football===\n{{see also|Football#North American football codes}}\nNorth America is the birthplace of [[gridiron football]], the form of [[football]] that originally developed, and is primarily played, in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"Britannica-Gridiron\">{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football | title=Gridiron football | publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] | accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> Both major forms, [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], developed in the late 19th century out of the original games now known as [[rugby football]] and [[association football]].

The NCAA further divides its Division I football teams into the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] and the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]]. The Football Bowl Subdivision has the largest and most competitive schools, and is noted for its system of postseason [[bowl game]]s.\n\n[[USA Football]] is the [[Sports governing body|governing body]] for amateur American football in the U.S., and is a member of the [[International Federation of American Football]] (IFAF), the international governing body of American football associations. Several other North American counties are a part of [[IFAF Americas]], the federation of IFAF members in the Americas.\n\nIn Mexico, the [[Liga de F\u00fatbol Americano Profesional]] is the professional league, while [[ONEFA]] organizes college football.\n\n====Canadian football====\nThe [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) is the highest professional level of Canadian football, with teams across Canada. Teams from Canadian universities compete in [[U Sports football]]. The [[Canadian Junior Football League]] and [[Quebec Junior Football League]] field teams with players aged 18\u201322.\n\n[[Football Canada]] is the governing body for amateur Canadian football. Although it primarily focuses on the Canadian form of the game, it is also a member of the International Federation of American Football.\n\n====Association football====\n[[CONCACAF]] is the continental governing body for association football in North America, and runs two visible tournaments: the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] and the Champions League <ref name=\"concacaf.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.concacaf.com/concacaf|title=CONCACAF|work=CONCACAF}}</ref> The Gold Cup is competed every two years among the [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] to determine the regional champion of North America.

This Mexican league system uses [[promotion and relegation]], where teams are transferred between levels based on their final records at the end of the season. For women, the [[Super Liga Femenil de F\u00fatbol]] is at the top level.\n\nThe men's professional soccer league systems in both [[United States soccer league system|the U.S.]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canada]] instead primarily use the closed, franchise model which primarily always has the same teams playing. [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) represents the highest level, while the second level consists of the the [[USL Championship]]. Although the MLS has teams in both countries, they are only sanctioned by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF), the governing body of soccer in the United States. The [[Canadian Soccer Association]], the governing body in Canada, instead sanctions two third-level semi-pro all-Canadian leagues at the third level: [[League1 Ontario]] and [[Premi\u00e8re Ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec]], as well as a separate level-one league, the [[Canadian Premier League]]. The United States has the [[USL League One]] and [[National Independent Soccer Association]], which are both professional. For women' professional soccer, the [[National Women's Soccer League]] is at the top level, and [[United Women's Soccer]] and [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] are at the second level. [[College soccer]] is played both in the U.S. and Canada, with top players often going on to play professional.\n\nOther countries with multi-level professional league systems include [[Football in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Football in El Salvador#League System|El Salvador]], [[Football in Guatemala#League system|Guatemala]], [[Football in Honduras#Football competitions|Honduras]], [[Jamaican football league system|Jamaica]], [[Football in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], and [[Football in Panama|Panama]].

This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the United States. The sport is currently popular in various other North American countries.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) is the top professional level of baseball, while [[Minor League Baseball]] (MiLB) comprises several levels and multiple component leagues below MLB. MiLB also has teams and component leagues in Mexico (such as the [[Mexican League|Mexican Baseball League]]) and the Dominican Republic (such as the [[Dominican Summer League]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/info/teams.jsp|title=Teams by Name \u2013 MiLB.com Official Info \u2013 The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|work=MiLB.com|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref> The relationship between MLB and MilB is also the closed, franchise model, which has the same teams playing, and where the ''players'' are transferred between levels. Several more independent leagues operate in the U.S. and Canada. Primarily because of MiLB, [[college baseball]] plays a smaller role in developing professional players than what college football does with its players.\n\nOther professional leagues in North America include the [[Dominican Professional Baseball League]], [[Liga Mexicana del Pac\u00edfico]] in Mexico, the [[Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League]], the [[Panamanian Professional Baseball League]], and the [[Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]] in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe [[Cuban National Series]] is the primary domestic amateur baseball competition in Cuba. It forms part of the [[Cuban baseball league system]], run by the [[Baseball Federation of Cuba]], the governing body of baseball in that country. Amateur baseball in Canada includes [[Ligue de Baseball \u00c9lite du Qu\u00e9bec]], the [[New Brunswick Senior Baseball League]], and the [[Nova Scotia Senior Baseball League]].

It is a form of [[risk management]], primarily used to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.\n\nAn entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier or [[underwriter]].  A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss.  The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and usually involves something in which the insured has an [[insurable interest]] established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.\n\nThe insured receives a [[contract]], called the [[insurance policy]], which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the '''premium'''. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a [[claims adjuster]]. The insurer may [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] its own risk by taking out [[reinsurance]], whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risks, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of insurance}}\n\n===Early methods===\n[[File:Ferdinand Bol - Governors of the Wine Merchant's Guild - WGA2361.jpg|thumb|Merchants have sought methods to minimize risks since early times. Pictured, ''Governors of the Wine Merchant's Guild'' by [[Ferdinand Bol]], c. 1680.]]\nMethods for transferring or distributing risk were practiced by [[China|Chinese]] and [[Babylonia]]n traders as long ago as the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]] and [[2nd millennium BC|2nd]] [[millennium|millennia]] BC, respectively.<ref>See, e.g., Vaughan, E. J., 1997, ''Risk Management'', New York: Wiley.</ref> Chinese merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessel's capsizing. The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous [[Code of Hammurabi]], c. 1750 BC, and practiced by early [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] sailing [[merchant]]s. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen, or lost at sea.\n\nCirca 800 BC, the inhabitants of [[Rhodes]] created the '[[general average]]'. This allowed groups of merchants to pay to insure their goods being shipped together. The collected premiums would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during transport, whether due to storm or sinkage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LawMuseum/LawArticle-383/Lex-Rhodia-The-Ancient-Ancestor-of-Maritime-Law--800-BC.aspx|title=Lex Rhodia: The Ancient Ancestor of Maritime Law - 800 BC|website=Duhaime.org - Learn Law}}</ref>\n\nSeparate insurance contracts (i.e., insurance policies not bundled with loans or other kinds of contracts) were invented in [[Genoa]] in the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates. The first known insurance contract dates from [[Genoa]] in 1347, and in the next century maritime insurance developed widely and premiums were intuitively varied with risks.<ref>J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 274-277.</ref> These new insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment, a separation of roles that first proved useful in [[marine insurance]].\n\n===Modern methods===\nInsurance became far more sophisticated in [[Enlightenment era]] [[Europe]], where specialized varieties developed.\n\n[[File:Lloyd's coffee house drawing.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lloyd's Coffee House]] was the first organized market for marine insurance.]]\n[[Property insurance]] as we know it today can be traced to the [[Great Fire of London]], which in 1666 devoured more than 13,000 houses. The devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance \"from a matter of convenience into one of urgency, a change of opinion reflected in Sir [[Christopher Wren]]'s inclusion of a site for 'the Insurance Office' in his new plan for London in 1667.\"<ref>Dickson (1960): 4</ref> A number of attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing, but in 1681, [[Economics|economist]] [[Nicholas Barbon]] and eleven associates established the first fire insurance company, the \"Insurance Office for Houses\", at the back of the Royal Exchange to insure brick and frame homes.

By the end of the seventeenth century, London's growing importance as a center for trade was increasing demand for [[marine insurance]]. In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd opened [[Lloyd's Coffee House|a coffee house]], which became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures.

The insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee, with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be an [[insurable risk]], the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as a [[financial intermediary]] is a commercial enterprise and a major part of the financial services industry, but individual entities can also [[self-insurance|self-insure]] through saving money for possible future losses.<ref>Gollier C. (2003). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41953424?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents To Insure or Not to Insure?: An Insurance Puzzle]. ''The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance Theory''.</ref>\n\n===Insurability===\n{{Main|Insurability}}\n\nRisk which can be insured by private companies typically shares seven common characteristics:<ref>This discussion is adapted from Mehr and Camack \"Principles of Insurance\", 6th edition, 1976, pp 34 \u2013 37.</ref>\n\n# '''Large number of similar exposure units''': Since insurance operates through pooling resources, the majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes, allowing insurers to benefit from the [[law of large numbers]] in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include [[Lloyd's of London]], which is famous for ensuring the life or health of actors, sports figures, and other famous individuals. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different premium rates.\n# '''Definite loss''': The loss takes place at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is the death of an insured person on a life insurance policy. [[Fire]], [[Traffic collision|automobile accidents]], and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. [[Occupational disease]], for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.\n# '''Accidental loss''': The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance. The loss should be pure, in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost. Events that contain speculative elements such as ordinary business risks or even purchasing a lottery ticket are generally not considered insurable.\n# '''Large loss''': The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses, these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.\n# '''Affordable premium''': If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, then it is not likely that the insurance will be purchased, even if on offer. Furthermore, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer. If there is no such chance of loss, then the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance (see the U.S. [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] pronouncement number 113: \"Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts\").\n# '''Calculable loss''': There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim.\n# '''Limited risk of catastrophically large losses''': Insurable losses are ideally [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] and non-catastrophic, meaning that the losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base. [[Capital (economics)|Capital]] constrains insurers' ability to sell [[earthquake insurance]] as well as wind insurance in [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] zones. In the United States, [[flood insurance|flood risk]] is insured by the federal government. In commercial fire insurance, it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the [[reinsurance]] market.\n\n===Legal===\nWhen a company insures an individual entity, there are basic legal requirements and regulations. Several commonly cited legal principles of insurance include:<ref>Irish Brokers Association. [https://www.iba.ie/development2009/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=167 Insurance Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411184958/http://www.iba.ie/development2009/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=167 |date=11 April 2009 }}.</ref>\n# [[Indemnity]] \u2013 the insurance company indemnifies or compensates, the insured in the case of certain losses only up to the insured's interest.\n# Benefit insurance \u2013 as it is stated in the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, the insurance company does not have the right of recovery from the party who caused the injury and is to compensate the Insured regardless of the fact that Insured had already sued the negligent party for the damages (for example, personal accident insurance)\n# [[Insurable interest]] \u2013 the insured typically must directly suffer from the loss.  Insurable interest must exist whether property insurance or insurance on a person is involved.  The concept requires that the insured have a \"stake\" in the loss or damage to the life or property insured.  What that \"stake\" is will be determined by the kind of insurance involved and the nature of the property ownership or relationship between the persons.  The requirement of an insurable interest is what distinguishes insurance from [[gambling]].\n# [[Good faith (law)|Utmost good faith]] \u2013 ([[Uberrima fides]]) the insured and the insurer are bound by a [[good faith]] bond of honesty and fairness.  Material facts must be disclosed.\n# Contribution \u2013 insurers which have similar obligations to the insured contribute in the indemnification, according to some method.\n# Subrogation \u2013 the insurance company acquires legal rights to pursue recoveries on behalf of the insured; for example, the insurer may sue those liable for the insured's loss. The Insurers can waive their subrogation rights by using the special clauses.\n# Causa proxima, or [[proximate cause]] \u2013 the cause of loss (the peril) must be covered under the insuring agreement of the policy, and the dominant cause must not be [[exclusion clause|excluded]]\n# Mitigation \u2013 In case of any loss or casualty, the asset owner must attempt to keep loss to a minimum, as if the asset was not insured.\n\n===Indemnification===\n{{Main|Indemnity}}\n\nTo \"indemnify\" means to make whole again, or to be reinstated to the position that one was in, to the extent possible, prior to the happening of a specified event or peril. Accordingly, [[life insurance]] is generally not considered to be indemnity insurance, but rather \"contingent\" insurance (i.e., a claim arises on the occurrence of a specified event). There are generally three types of insurance contracts that seek to indemnify an insured:\n# A \"reimbursement\" policy\n# A \"pay on behalf\" or \"on behalf of policy\"<ref name=\"KulpHall\">C. Kulp & J. Hall, Casualty Insurance, Fourth Edition, 1968, page 35</ref>\n# An \"indemnification\" policy\n\nFrom an insured's standpoint, the result is usually the same: the insurer pays the loss and claims expenses.\n\nIf the Insured has a \"reimbursement\" policy, the insured can be required to pay for a loss and then be \"reimbursed\" by the insurance carrier for the loss and out of pocket costs including, with the permission of the insurer, claim expenses.<ref name=\"KulpHall\" />{{NoteTag|However, the bankruptcy of the insured with a \"reimbursement\" policy does not relieve the insurer.  Certain types of insurance, e.g., workers' compensation and personal automobile liability, are subject to statutory requirements that injured parties have direct access to coverage.}}\n\nUnder a \"pay on behalf\" policy, the insurance carrier would defend and pay a claim on behalf of the insured who would not be out of pocket for anything. Most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of \"pay on behalf\" language which enables the insurance carrier to manage and control the claim.\n\nUnder an \"indemnification\" policy, the insurance carrier can generally either \"reimburse\" or \"pay on behalf of\", whichever is more beneficial to it and the insured in the claim handling process.\n\nAn entity seeking to transfer risk (an individual, corporation, or association of any type, etc.) becomes the 'insured' party once risk is assumed by an 'insurer', the insuring party, by means of a [[contract]], called an [[insurance policy]]. Generally, an insurance contract includes, at a minimum, the following elements: identification of participating parties (the insurer, the insured, the beneficiaries), the premium, the period of coverage, the particular loss event covered, the amount of coverage (i.e., the amount to be paid to the insured or beneficiary in the event of a loss), and [[Exclusion clause|exclusions]] (events not covered). An insured is thus said to be \"[[indemnity|indemnified]]\" against the loss covered in the policy.\n\nWhen insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril, the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium. Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims \u2013 in theory for a relatively few claimants \u2013 and for [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] costs. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer's [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].\n\n===Exclusions===\nPolicies typically include a number of exclusions, including typically:\n* [[Nuclear exclusion clause]], excluding damage caused by nuclear and radiation accidents\n* [[War exclusion clause]], excluding damage from acts of war or terrorism<ref>{{cite news |last1=Menapace |first1=Michael |title=Losses From Malware May Not Be Covered Due To Your Policy's Hostile Acts Exclusion |url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/property-insurance-cyber-insurance-coverage-and-war-losses-malware-may-not-be-0 |accessdate=25 April 2019 |work=The National Law Review |date=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stock |first1=Rob |title=Insurers waive terrorism exclusions for Christchurch shooting victims |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-shooting/111397687/insurers-waive-terrorism-exclusions-for-christchurch-shooting-victims |accessdate=25 April 2019 |work=Stuff |date=19 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Social effects==\nInsurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of losses and damage. On one hand it can increase fraud; on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies.\n\nInsurance can influence the probability of losses through [[moral hazard]], [[insurance fraud]], and preventive steps by the insurance company. Insurance scholars have typically used [[moral hazard]] to refer to the increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference.<ref name=\"ZweifelEisen2012\">{{cite book|author1=Peter Zweifel|author2=Roland Eisen|title=Insurance Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_8qzz5soE8C&pg=PA268|date=24 February 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-20547-7|pages=268\u2013}}</ref> Insurers attempt to address carelessness through inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance, and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts. While in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measures\u2014particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes\u2014because of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles. However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to take a more active role in loss mitigation, such as through [[building code]]s.<ref>Kunreuther H. (1996). [http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/downloads/archive/arch167.pdf Mitigating Disaster Losses Through Insurance]. ''Journal of Risk and Uncertainty''.</ref>\n\n===Methods of insurance===\nAccording to the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, there are variant methods of insurance as follows:\n# Co-insurance \u2013 risks shared between insurers \n# Dual insurance \u2013 having two or more policies with overlapping coverage of a risk (both the individual policies would not pay separately \u2013 under a concept named contribution, they would contribute together to make up the policyholder's losses. However, in case of contingency insurances such as life insurance, dual payment is allowed) \n# Self-insurance \u2013 situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by the entities or individuals themselves\n# Reinsurance \u2013 situations when the insurer passes some part of or all risks to another Insurer, called the reinsurer\n\n==Insurers' business model==\n[[File:Accidents will happen William-H.-Watson-Universal-Star-Featurette-1922.webm|thumb|''Accidents will happen'' (William H. Watson, 1922) is a slapstick silent film about the methods and mishaps of an insurance broker. Collection [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]].]]\n\nInsurers may use the [[subscription business model]] , collecting premium payments periodically in return for on-going and/or [[compound interest | compounding]] benefits offered to policyholders.\n\n===Underwriting and investing===\nInsurers' business model aims to collect more in premium and investment income than is paid out in losses, and to also offer a competitive price which consumers will accept. Profit can be reduced to a simple equation:\n:Profit = [[cancellation (insurance) |earned premium]] + investment income \u2013 incurred loss \u2013 underwriting expenses.\n\nInsurers make money in two ways:\n* Through [[underwriting]], the process by which insurers select the risks to insure and decide how much in premiums to charge for accepting those risks, and taking the brunt of the risk should it come to fruition.\n* By [[investment|investing]] the premiums they collect from insured parties\n\nThe most complicated aspect of insuring is the [[actuarial science]] of ratemaking (price-setting) of policies, which uses [[statistics]] and [[probability]] to approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk. After producing rates, the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept risks through the underwriting process.\n\nAt the most basic level, initial rate-making involves looking at the [[frequency]] and [[wikt:severity |severity]] of insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from these perils. Thereafter an insurance company will collect historical loss-data, bring the loss data to [[present value]], and compare these prior losses to the premium collected in order to assess rate adequacy.<ref>Brown RL. (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1j4O50JENE4C Introduction to Ratemaking and Loss Reserving for Property and Casualty Insurance]. ACTEX Publications.</ref> [[Loss ratio]]s and expense loads are also used. Rating for different risk characteristics involves - at the most basic level - comparing the losses with \"loss relativities\"\u2014a policy with twice as many losses would, therefore, be charged twice as much. More complex [[multivariate analysis| multivariate analyses]] are sometimes used when multiple characteristics are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results. Other statistical methods may be used in assessing the probability of future losses.\n\nUpon termination of a given policy, the amount of premium collected minus the amount paid out in claims is the insurer's [[underwriting profit]] on that policy. Underwriting performance is measured by something called the \"combined ratio\", which is the ratio of expenses/losses to premiums.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Juc4fb1Fx1cC&lpg=PA614&pg=PA614#v=onepage&f=false |title= The Handbook of Municipal Bonds|first1= Sylvan G.|last1= Feldstein|first2= Frank J.|last2= Fabozzi|year= 2008|page= 614|publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]|isbn= 978-0-470-10875-8|accessdate= 8 February 2010}}</ref> A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while anything over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. A company with a combined ratio over 100% may nevertheless remain profitable due to investment earnings.\n\nInsurance companies earn [[investment]] profits on \"float\". Float, or available reserve, is the amount of money on hand at any given moment that an insurer has collected in insurance premiums but has not paid out in claims. Insurers start investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn interest or other income on them until claims are paid out. The [[Association of British Insurers]] (grouping together 400 insurance companies and 94% of UK insurance services) has almost 20% of the investments in the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>[http://www.abi.org.uk/About_The_ABI/role.aspx What we do ABI] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090907134048/http://www.abi.org.uk/About_The_ABI/role.aspx |date= 7 September 2009 }}. Abi.org.uk. Retrieved on 18 July 2013.</ref> In 2007, U.S. industry profits from float totaled $58 billion. In a 2009 letter to investors, Warren Buffett wrote, \"we were ''paid'' $2.8 billion to hold our float in 2008\".<ref>{{Cite book|title= Delay, Deny, Defend : Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It|last= Feinman|first= Jay M.|publisher= Portfolio|year= 2010|isbn= 9781101196281|pages= 16|oclc= 883320058}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the underwriting loss of [[property insurance |property]] and [[casualty insurance]] companies was $142.3 billion in the five years ending 2003. But overall profit for the same period was $68.4 billion, as the result of float. Some insurance-industry insiders, most notably [[Maurice R. Greenberg |Hank Greenberg]], do not believe that it is possible to sustain a profit from float forever without an underwriting profit as well, but this opinion is not universally held. Reliance on float for profit has led some industry experts to call insurance companies \"investment companies that raise the money for their investments by selling insurance\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Weir|first= Audrey A.|last2= Hampton|first2= John H.|date= March 1995|title= Essentials of Risk Management and Insurance|journal= The Journal of Risk and Insurance|volume= 62|issue= 1|pages= 157|doi= 10.2307/253703|issn= 0022-4367|jstor= 253703}}</ref>\n\nNaturally, the float method is difficult to carry out in an [[Depression (economics)|economically depressed]] period. [[Bear market]]s do cause insurers to shift away from investments and to toughen up their underwriting standards, so a poor economy generally means high insurance-premiums. This tendency to swing between profitable and unprofitable periods over time is commonly known{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} as the [[insurance cycle| underwriting, or insurance, cycle]].<ref>\nFitzpatrick, Sean, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=690316 ''Fear is the Key: A Behavioral Guide to Underwriting Cycles,''] 10 Conn. Ins. L.J. 255 (2004).\n</ref>\n\n===Claims===\nClaims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance; it is the actual \"product\" paid for.  Claims may be filed by insureds directly with the insurer or through [[Insurance broker|brokers or agents]].  The insurer may require that the claim be filed on its own proprietary forms, or may accept claims on a standard industry form, such as those produced by [[ACORD]].\n\nInsurance company claims departments employ a large number of [[claims adjuster]]s supported by a staff of [[records management]] and [[data entry clerk]]s.  Incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience.  The adjuster undertakes an investigation of each claim, usually in close cooperation with the insured, determines if coverage is available under the terms of the insurance contract, and if so, the reasonable monetary value of the claim, and authorizes payment.\n\nThe policyholder may hire their own [[public adjuster]] to negotiate the settlement with the insurance company on their behalf. For policies that are complicated, where claims may be complex, the insured may take out a separate insurance policy add-on, called loss recovery insurance, which covers the cost of a public adjuster in the case of a claim.\n\nAdjusting liability insurance claims is particularly difficult because there is a third party involved, the [[plaintiff]], who is under no contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer and may in fact regard the insurer as a [[deep pocket]]. The adjuster must obtain legal counsel for the insured (either inside \"house\" counsel or outside \"panel\" counsel), monitor litigation that may take years to complete, and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement authority at a mandatory settlement conference when requested by the judge.\n\nIf a claims adjuster suspects under-insurance, the [[condition of average]] may come into play to limit the insurance company's exposure.\n\nIn managing the claims handling function, insurers seek to balance the elements of customer satisfaction, administrative handling expenses, and claims overpayment leakages.  As part of this balancing act, [[insurance fraud|fraudulent insurance practices]] are a major business risk that must be managed and overcome. Disputes between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims handling practices occasionally escalate into litigation (see [[insurance bad faith]]).\n\n===Marketing===\nInsurers will often use [[agency (law)|insurance agents]] to initially market or [[Underwrite]] their customers. Agents can be captive, meaning they write only for one company, or independent, meaning that they can issue policies from several companies. The existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due the availability of improved and personalised services. Companies also use Broking firms, Banks and other corporate entities (like Self Help Groups, Microfinance Institutions, NGOs, etc.) to market their products.<ref>{{cite journal\n |first1  = Allen N.\n |last1   = Berger\n |first2  = J.

Specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils. An insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not. Below are non-exhaustive lists of the many different types of insurance that exist. A single policy that may cover risks in one or more of the categories set out below. For example, [[vehicle insurance]] would typically cover both the property risk (theft or damage to the vehicle) and the liability risk (legal claims arising from an [[traffic collision|accident]]). A [[home insurance]] policy in the United States typically includes coverage for damage to the home and the owner's belongings, certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.\n\n[[Business]] insurance can take a number of different forms, such as the various kinds of professional liability insurance, also called professional indemnity (PI), which are discussed below under that name; and the [[business owner's policy]] (BOP), which packages into one policy many of the kinds of coverage that a business owner needs, in a way analogous to how homeowners' insurance packages the coverages that a homeowner needs.<ref>{{cite web | author = Insurance Information Institute | authorlink = Insurance Information Institute | title = Business insurance information. What does a businessowners policy cover? | url = http://www.iii.org/individuals/business/basics/bop/ | accessdate = 9 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Auto insurance===\n{{Main|Vehicle insurance}}\n[[File:Car crash 1.jpg|thumb|right|A wrecked vehicle in [[Copenhagen]]]]\nAuto insurance protects the policyholder against financial loss in the event of an incident involving a vehicle they own, such as in a [[traffic collision]].\n\nCoverage typically includes:\n* Property coverage, for damage to or theft of the car\n* Liability coverage, for the legal responsibility to others for bodily injury or property damage\n* Medical coverage, for the cost of treating injuries, rehabilitation and sometimes lost wages and funeral expenses\n\n===Gap insurance===\n{{Main|Gap insurance}}\n\nGap insurance covers the excess amount on your auto loan in an instance where your insurance company does not cover the entire loan. Depending on the company's specific policies it might or might not cover the deductible as well. This coverage is marketed for those who put low [[down payment]]s, have high interest rates on their loans, and those with 60-month or longer terms. Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.\n\n===Health insurance===\n{{Main|Health insurance|Dental insurance}}\n[[File:Great western hospital.JPG|right|thumb|Great Western Hospital, [[Swindon]]]]\n\nHealth insurance policies cover the cost of medical treatments. Dental insurance, like medical insurance, protects policyholders for dental costs. In most developed countries, all citizens receive some health coverage from their governments, paid through taxation. In most countries, health insurance is often part of an employer's benefits.\n\n===Income protection insurance===\n[[File:Pipe installation 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Workers' compensation]], or employers' liability insurance, is compulsory in some countries]]\n* [[Disability insurance]] policies provide financial support in the event of the policyholder becoming unable to work because of disabling illness or injury. It provides monthly support to help pay such obligations as [[mortgage loan]]s and [[credit card]]s. Short-term and long-term disability policies are available to individuals, but considering the expense, long-term policies are generally obtained only by those with at least six-figure incomes, such as doctors, lawyers, etc. Short-term disability insurance covers a person for a period typically up to six months, paying a stipend each month to cover medical bills and other necessities.\n* Long-term disability insurance covers an individual's expenses for the long term, up until such time as they are considered permanently disabled and thereafter Insurance companies will often try to encourage the person back into employment in preference to and before declaring them unable to work at all and therefore totally disabled.\n* [[Business overhead expense disability insurance|Disability overhead insurance]] allows business owners to cover the overhead expenses of their business while they are unable to work.\n* [[Total permanent disability insurance]] provides benefits when a person is permanently disabled and can no longer work in their profession, often taken as an adjunct to life insurance.\n* [[Workers' compensation]] insurance replaces all or part of a worker's [[wage]]s lost and accompanying medical expenses incurred because of a job-related injury.\n\n===Casualty insurance===\n{{Main|Casualty insurance}}\nCasualty insurance insures against accidents, not necessarily tied to any specific property. It is a broad spectrum of insurance that a number of other types of insurance could be classified, such as auto, workers compensation, and some liability insurances.\n* Crime insurance is a form of casualty insurance that covers the policyholder against losses arising from the [[criminal act]]s of third parties.  For example, a company can obtain crime insurance to cover losses arising from [[theft]] or [[embezzlement]].\n* [[Terrorism insurance]] provides protection against any loss or damage caused by [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities. In the United States in the wake of [[september 11 attacks|9/11]], the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]] 2002 (TRIA) set up a federal program providing a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. The program was extended until the end of 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act 2007 (TRIPRA).\n* [[Kidnap and ransom insurance]] is designed to protect individuals and corporations operating in high-risk areas around the world against the perils of kidnap, extortion, wrongful detention and hijacking.\n* [[Political risk insurance]] is a form of casualty insurance that can be taken out by businesses with operations in countries in which there is a risk that [[revolution]] or other [[politics|political]] conditions could result in a loss.\n\n===Life insurance===\n{{Main|Life insurance}}\n[[File:Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, London, 1801.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office]], Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, [[London]], 1801]]\nLife insurance provides a monetary benefit to a decedent's family or other designated beneficiary, and may specifically provide for income to an insured person's family, burial, funeral and other final expenses. Life insurance policies often allow the option of having the proceeds paid to the beneficiary either in a lump sum cash payment or an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]]. In most states, a person cannot purchase a policy on another person without their knowledge.\n\nAnnuities provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require the same kinds of actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and [[pension]]s that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a [[retirement|retiree]] will outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.\n\nCertain life insurance contracts accumulate [[cash]] values, which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some policies, such as annuities and [[endowment policy|endowment policies]], are financial instruments to accumulate or [[liquidation|liquidate]] [[wealth]] when it is needed.\n\nIn many countries, such as the United States and the UK, the [[tax law]] provides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances. This leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax-efficient method of [[saving]] as well as protection in the event of early death.\n\nIn the United States, the tax on interest income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, in some cases the benefit derived from [[tax deferral]] may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.\n\n===Burial insurance===\nBurial insurance is a very old type of life insurance which is paid out upon death to cover final expenses, such as the cost of a [[funeral]]. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] introduced burial insurance c.&nbsp;600 CE when they organized [[guild]]s called \"benevolent societies\" which cared for the surviving families and paid funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in the [[Middle Ages]] served a similar purpose, as did friendly societies during Victorian times.\n\n===Property===\n{{Main|Property insurance}}\n[[File:Tornado Damage, Illinois 2.JPG|right|thumb|This [[tornado]] damage to an [[Illinois]] home would be considered an \"[[Act of God]]\" for insurance purposes]]\nProperty insurance provides protection against risks to property, such as [[fire]], [[theft]] or [[weather]] damage. This may include specialized forms of insurance such as fire insurance, [[flood insurance]], [[earthquake insurance]], [[home insurance]], inland marine insurance or [[boiler insurance]].\nThe term ''property insurance'' may, like casualty insurance, be used as a broad category of various subtypes of insurance, some of which are listed below:\n\n[[File:Plane crash into Hudson River muchcropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[US Airways Flight 1549]] was [[Write-off|written off]] after ditching into the [[Hudson River]]]]\n* [[Aviation insurance]] protects [[aircraft]] hulls and spares, and associated liability risks, such as passenger and third-party liability. [[Airport]]s may also appear under this subcategory, including air traffic control and refuelling operations for international airports through to smaller domestic exposures.\n* [[Boiler insurance]] (also known as boiler and machinery insurance, or equipment breakdown insurance) insures against accidental physical damage to boilers, equipment or machinery.\n* [[Builder's risk insurance]] insures against the risk of physical loss or damage to property during construction. Builder's risk insurance is typically written on an \"all risk\" basis covering damage arising from any cause (including the negligence of the insured) not otherwise expressly excluded. Builder's risk insurance is coverage that protects a person's or organization's insurable interest in materials, fixtures or equipment being used in the construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from an insured peril.<ref>{{cite web|title=Builder's Risk Insurance: Specialized Coverage for Construction Projects|url=http://adjustersinternational.com/publications/adjusting-today/builders-risk-insurance/1/|website=Adjusting Today|publisher=Adjusters International|accessdate=16 October 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Crop insurance]] may be purchased by farmers to reduce or manage various risks associated with growing crops. Such risks include crop loss or damage caused by weather, hail, drought, frost damage, insects, or disease.<ref>{{US patent application|20060287896}} \"Method for providing crop insurance for a crop associated with a defined attribute\"</ref> [[Index-based insurance]] uses models of how climate extremes affect crop production to define certain climate triggers that if surpassed have high probabilities of causing substantial crop loss. When harvest losses occur associated with exceeding the climate trigger threshold, the index-insured farmer is entitled to a compensation payment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Born|first=Lorna|last2=Spillane|first2=Charles|last3=Murray|first3=Una|date=20 December 2018|title=Integrating gender into index-based agricultural insurance: a focus on South Africa|journal=Development in Practice|volume=29|issue=4|pages=409\u2013423|doi=10.1080/09614524.2018.1556608|issn=0961-4524|hdl=10568/102499|hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n* [[Earthquake insurance]] is a form of property insurance that pays the policyholder in the event of an [[earthquake]] that causes damage to the property. Most ordinary home insurance policies do not cover earthquake damage. Earthquake insurance policies generally feature a high [[deductible]].  Rates depend on location and hence the likelihood of an earthquake, as well as the [[Earthquake engineering|construction of the home]].\n* [[Fidelity bond]] is a form of casualty insurance that covers policyholders for losses incurred as a result of fraudulent acts by specified individuals. It usually insures a business for losses caused by the dishonest acts of its employees.\n\n[[File:FEMA - 14947 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 08-30-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurricane Katrina]] caused over $80 billion of storm and flood damage]]\n* [[Flood insurance]] protects against property loss due to flooding. Many U.S. insurers do not provide flood insurance in some parts of the country. In response to this, the federal government created the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] which serves as the insurer of last resort.\n* [[Home insurance]], also commonly called hazard insurance or homeowners insurance (often abbreviated in the real estate industry as HOI), provides coverage for damage or destruction of the policyholder's home. In some geographical areas, the policy may exclude certain types of risks, such as flood or earthquake, that require additional coverage. Maintenance-related issues are typically the homeowner's responsibility. The policy may include inventory, or this can be bought as a separate policy, especially for people who rent housing. In some countries, insurers offer a package which may include liability and legal responsibility for injuries and property damage caused by members of the household, including pets.<ref>{{cite web | author = Insurance Information Institute | authorlink = Insurance Information Institute | title = What is homeowners insurance? | url = http://www.iii.org/individuals/homei/hbasics/whatis/ | accessdate = 11 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* [[Landlords' insurance|Landlord insurance]] covers residential or commercial property that is rented to tenants. It also covers the landlord's liability for the occupants at the property. Most homeowners' insurance, meanwhile, cover only owner-occupied homes and not liability or damages related to tenants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesrealestatecouncil/2019/09/10/insurance-for-landlords-protecting-your-investment/|title=Insurance For Landlords: Protecting Your Investment|last=Miller|first=Nathan|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref>\n* [[Marine insurance]] and marine cargo insurance cover the loss or damage of vessels at sea or on [[Inland waterways of the United States|inland waterway]]<nowiki/>s, and of cargo in transit, regardless of the method of transit. When the owner of the cargo and the carrier are separate corporations, marine cargo insurance typically compensates the owner of cargo for losses sustained from fire, shipwreck, etc., but excludes losses that can be recovered from the carrier or the carrier's insurance. Many marine insurance underwriters will include \"time element\" coverage in such policies, which extends the indemnity to cover loss of profit and other business expenses attributable to the delay caused by a covered loss.\n* [[Renters' insurance]], often called tenants' insurance, is an insurance policy that provides some of the benefits of homeowners' insurance, but does not include coverage for the dwelling, or structure, with the exception of small alterations that a tenant makes to the structure.\n* Supplemental natural disaster insurance covers specified expenses after a natural disaster renders the policyholder's home uninhabitable. Periodic payments are made directly to the insured until the home is rebuilt or a specified time period has elapsed.\n* [[Surety bond]] insurance is a three-party insurance guaranteeing the performance of the principal.\n[[File:WTC smoking on 9-11.jpeg|thumb|right|The demand for [[terrorism insurance]] surged after [[september 11 attacks|9/11]]]]\n* Volcano insurance is a specialized insurance protecting against damage arising specifically from [[Volcano|volcanic eruptions]].\n* Windstorm insurance is an insurance covering the damage that can be caused by wind events such as [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]].\n\n===Liability===\n{{Main|Liability insurance}}\nLiability insurance is a very broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured in the event of a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense in the event of a lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.\n\n[[File:Sign of the Times-Foreclosure.jpg|thumb|right|The [[subprime mortgage crisis]] was the source of many [[liability insurance]] losses]]\n* [[Public liability]] insurance or general liability insurance covers a business or organization against claims should its operations injure a member of the public or damage their property in some way.\n* [[Directors and officers liability insurance]] (D&O) protects an organization (usually a corporation) from costs associated with litigation resulting from errors made by directors and officers for which they are liable.\n* Environmental liability or environmental impairment insurance protects the insured from bodily injury, property damage and cleanup costs as a result of the dispersal, release or escape of pollutants.\n* [[Professional liability insurance|Errors and omissions insurance]] (E&O) is business liability insurance for professionals such as insurance agents, real estate agents and brokers, architects, third-party administrators (TPAs) and other business professionals.\n* [[Prize indemnity insurance]] protects the insured from giving away a large prize at a specific event. Examples would include offering prizes to contestants who can make a half-court shot at a [[basketball]] game, or a [[hole in one|hole-in-one]] at a [[golf]] tournament.\n* [[Professional liability insurance]], also called [[professional indemnity insurance]] (PI), protects insured professionals such as architectural corporations and medical practitioners against potential negligence claims made by their patients/clients.  Professional liability insurance may take on different names depending on the profession.  For example, professional liability insurance in reference to the medical profession may be called [[medical malpractice]] insurance.\nOften a commercial insured's liability insurance program consists of several layers.  The first layer of insurance generally consists of primary insurance, which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements up to the limits of liability of the primary policy.  Generally, primary insurance is subject to a deductible and obligates the insured to defend the insured against lawsuits, which is normally accomplished by assigning counsel to defend the insured.  In many instances, a commercial insured may elect to self-insure.  Above the primary insurance or self-insured retention, the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional limits of indemnity protection. There are a variety of types of excess insurance, including \"stand-alone\" excess policies (policies that contain their own terms, conditions, and exclusions), \"follow form\" excess insurance (policies that follow the terms of the underlying policy except as specifically provided), and \"umbrella\" insurance policies (excess insurance that in some circumstances could provide coverage that is broader than the underlying insurance).<ref>{{Cite journal |title =Excess Liability Insurance: Law and Litigation |last = Seaman|first = S.

Mortgage insurance is a form of credit insurance, although the name \"credit insurance\" more often is used to refer to policies that cover other kinds of debt.\n* Many credit cards offer payment protection plans which are a form of credit insurance.\n* [[Trade credit insurance]] is business insurance over the accounts receivable of the insured. The policy pays the policy holder for covered accounts receivable if the debtor defaults on payment.\n* [[Collateral protection insurance]] (CPI) insures property (primarily vehicles) held as collateral for loans made by lending institutions.\n\n===Other types===\n* All-risk insurance is an insurance that covers a wide range of incidents and perils, except those noted in the policy. All-risk insurance is different from peril-specific insurance that cover losses from only those perils listed in the policy.<ref>[http://www.business.gov/manage/business-insurance/insurance-types.html Types of Business Insurance | SBA.gov] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629042726/http://www.business.gov/manage/business-insurance/insurance-types.html |date=29 June 2010 }}. Business.gov. Retrieved on 18 July 2013.</ref> In [[car insurance]], all-risk policy includes also the damages caused by the own driver.\n[[File:2006GoodwoodBreedersCup.jpg|thumb|right|High-value horses may be insured under a [[Thoroughbred|bloodstock]] policy]]\n* Bloodstock insurance covers individual [[horse]]s or a number of horses under common ownership. Coverage is typically for mortality as a result of accident, illness or disease but may extend to include infertility, in-transit loss, veterinary fees, and prospective foal.\n* [[Business interruption insurance]] covers the loss of income, and the expenses incurred, after a covered peril interrupts normal business operations.\n* [[Defense Base Act]] (DBA) insurance provides coverage for civilian workers hired by the government to perform contracts outside the United States and Canada. DBA is required for all U.S. citizens, U.S. residents, U.S. Green Card holders, and all employees or subcontractors hired on overseas government contracts. Depending on the country, foreign nationals must also be covered under DBA. This coverage typically includes expenses related to medical treatment and loss of wages, as well as disability and death benefits.\n* [[Expatriate insurance]] provides individuals and organizations operating outside of their home country with protection for automobiles, property, health, liability and business pursuits.\n* [[Legal expenses insurance]] covers policyholders for the potential costs of legal action against an institution or an individual. When something happens which triggers the need for legal action, it is known as \"the event\". There are two main types of legal expenses insurance: [[Legal expenses insurance#Before the event insurance|before the event insurance]] and [[Legal expenses insurance#After the event insurance|after the event insurance]].\n* Livestock insurance is a specialist policy provided to, for example, commercial or hobby farms, aquariums, fish farms or any other animal holding. Cover is available for mortality or economic slaughter as a result of accident, illness or disease but can extend to include destruction by government order.\n* Media liability insurance is designed to cover professionals that engage in film and television production and print, against risks such as [[defamation]].\n* Nuclear incident insurance covers damages resulting from an [[nuclear and radiation accidents|incident involving radioactive materials]] and is generally arranged at the national level. (See the [[nuclear exclusion clause]] and, for the United States, the [[Price\u2013Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act]].)\n* [[Pet insurance]] insures pets against accidents and illnesses; some companies cover routine/wellness care and burial, as well.\n* [[Pollution insurance]] usually takes the form of first-party coverage for contamination of insured property either by external or on-site sources. Coverage is also afforded for liability to third parties arising from contamination of air, water, or land due to the sudden and accidental release of hazardous materials from the insured site. The policy usually covers the costs of cleanup and may include coverage for releases from underground storage tanks. Intentional acts are specifically excluded.\n* Purchase insurance is aimed at providing protection on the products people purchase. Purchase insurance can cover individual purchase protection, [[warranties]], [[guarantees]], care plans and even mobile phone insurance. Such insurance is normally very limited in the scope of problems that are covered by the policy.\n* Tax insurance is increasingly being used in corporate transactions to protect taxpayers in the event that a tax position it has taken is challenged by the IRS or a state, local, or foreign taxing authority<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blitz|first1=Gary|last2=Schoenberg|first2=Daniel|title=Private REITs: Facilitating a Cleaner Exit with Tax Insurance|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/private-reits-facilitating-cleaner-exit-tax-insurance|publisher=Transaction Advisors|issn=2329-9134}}</ref>\n* [[Title insurance]] provides a guarantee that title to [[real property]] is vested in the purchaser or [[mortgage law|mortgagee]], free and clear of [[lien]]s or encumbrances. It is usually issued in conjunction with a search of the public records performed at the time of a [[real estate]] transaction.\n* [[Travel insurance]] is an insurance cover taken by those who travel abroad, which covers certain losses such as medical expenses, loss of personal belongings, travel delay, and personal liabilities.\n* [[Tuition insurance]] insures students against involuntary withdrawal from cost-intensive educational institutions\n* [[Interest rate insurance]] protects the holder from adverse changes in interest rates, for instance for those with a variable rate loan or mortgage\n* Divorce insurance is a form of contractual liability insurance that pays the insured a cash benefit if their marriage ends in divorce.\n\n===Insurance financing vehicles===\n* Fraternal insurance is provided on a cooperative basis by [[Benefit society|fraternal benefit societies]] or other social organizations.<ref>Margaret E. Lynch, Editor, \"Health Insurance Terminology\", Health Insurance Association of America, 1992, {{ISBN|1-879143-13-5}}</ref>\n* [[No-fault insurance]] is a type of insurance policy (typically automobile insurance) where insureds are indemnified by their own insurer regardless of fault in the incident.\n* Protected self-insurance is an alternative risk financing mechanism in which an organization retains the mathematically calculated cost of risk within the organization and transfers the catastrophic risk with specific and aggregate limits to an insurer so the maximum total cost of the program is known. A properly designed and underwritten Protected Self-Insurance Program reduces and stabilizes the cost of insurance and provides valuable risk management information.\n* Retrospectively rated insurance is a method of establishing a premium on large commercial accounts. The final premium is based on the insured's actual loss experience during the policy term, sometimes subject to a minimum and maximum premium, with the final premium determined by a formula. Under this plan, the current year's premium is based partially (or wholly) on the current year's losses, although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year's expiration date. The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract. Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium \u00d7 tax multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use.\n* Formal [[self-insurance]] is the deliberate decision to pay for otherwise insurable losses out of one's own money.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually used to pay for high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n* [[Reinsurance]] is a type of insurance purchased by insurance companies or self-insured employers to protect against unexpected losses. [[Financial reinsurance]] is a form of reinsurance that is primarily used for capital management rather than to transfer insurance risk.\n* [[Social insurance]] can be many things to many people in many countries. But a summary of its essence is that it is a collection of insurance coverages (including components of life insurance, disability income insurance, unemployment insurance, health insurance, and others), plus retirement savings, that requires participation by all citizens. By forcing everyone in society to be a policyholder and pay premiums, it ensures that everyone can become a claimant when or if they need to. Along the way, this inevitably becomes related to other concepts such as the justice system and the [[welfare state]]. This is a large, complicated topic that engenders tremendous debate, which can be further studied in the following articles (and others):\n**[[National Insurance]]\n** [[Social safety net]]\n** [[Social security]]\n** [[Social Security debate (United States)]]\n** [[Social Security (United States)]]\n** [[Social welfare provision]]\n* [[Stop-loss insurance]] provides protection against catastrophic or unpredictable losses. It is purchased by organizations who do not want to assume 100% of the liability for losses arising from the plans. Under a stop-loss policy, the insurance company becomes liable for losses that exceed certain limits called deductibles.\n\n===Closed community and governmental self-insurance===\nSome communities prefer to create virtual insurance amongst themselves by other means than contractual risk transfer, which assigns explicit numerical values to risk. A number of [[religion|religious]] groups, including the [[Amish]] and some [[Muslim]] groups, depend on support provided by their [[community|communities]] when [[disaster]]s strike. The risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind. In supportive communities where others can be trusted to follow community leaders, this tacit form of insurance can work.  In this manner the community can even out the extreme differences in insurability that exist among its members. Some further justification is also provided by invoking the [[moral hazard]] of explicit insurance contracts.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], [[The Crown]] (which, for practical purposes, meant the [[civil service]]) did not insure property such as government buildings.  If a government building was damaged, the cost of repair would be met from public funds because, in the long run, this was cheaper than paying insurance premiums.  Since many UK government buildings have been sold to property companies and rented back, this arrangement is now less common and may have disappeared altogether.\n\nIn the United States, the most prevalent form of [[self-insurance]] is governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage for the majority of governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts.  Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form a [[risk pool]]. Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage (such as general liability, auto liability, professional liability, workers compensation, and property) is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, self-insured pools offer members lower rates (due to not needing insurance brokers), increased benefits (such as loss prevention services) and subject matter expertise.  Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of self-insured pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools.  Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions (self-insured premiums) to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually.<ref>Marcos Antonio Mendoza, \"Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions\", 21 Conn.

The main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life, annuity, and pension business is very long-term in nature \u2013 coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many [[decade]]s. By contrast, non-life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.\n\n===Mutual versus proprietary===\n{{Main|Mutual insurance}}\nInsurance companies are generally classified as either [[Mutual insurance|mutual]] or proprietary companies.<ref>{{cite book|title=IF1 \u2013 Insurance, Legal & Regulatory|year=2011|publisher=Chartered Insurance Institute|isbn=978-0-85713-094-5|author=David Ransom|page=2/5}}</ref> Mutual companies are owned by the policyholders, while shareholders (who may or may not own policies) own proprietary insurance companies.\n\n[[Demutualization]] of mutual insurers to form stock companies, as well as the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century.  However, not all states permit mutual holding companies.\n\n===Reinsurance companies===\n\n[[Reinsurance]] companies are insurance companies that sell policies to other insurance companies, allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from substantial losses. The reinsurance market is dominated by a few very large companies, with huge reserves. A reinsurer may also be a direct writer of insurance risks as well.\n\n===Captive insurance companies===\n{{Main|Captive insurance}}\n\n[[Captive insurance]] companies may be defined as limited-purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may take the form of a \"pure\" entity, which is a 100% subsidiary of the self-insured parent company; of a \"mutual\" captive, which insures the collective risks of members of an industr); and of an \"association\" captive, which self-insures individual risks of the members of a professional, commercial or industrial association. Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.\n\nThe types of risk that a captive can underwrite for their parents include property damage, public and product liability, professional indemnity, employee benefits, employers' liability, motor and medical aid expenses. The captive's exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance.\n\nCaptives are becoming an increasingly important component of the [[risk management]] and risk financing strategy of their parent. This can be understood against the following background:\n* Heavy and increasing premium costs in almost every line of coverage\n* Difficulties in insuring certain types of fortuitous risk\n* Differential coverage standards in various parts of the world\n* Rating structures which reflect market trends rather than individual loss experience\n* Insufficient credit for deductibles or loss control efforts\n\n===Other forms===\nOther possible forms for an insurance company include [[reciprocal inter-insurance exchange|reciprocals]], in which policyholders reciprocate in sharing risks, and Lloyd's organizations.\n\n===Admitted versus non-admitted===\nAdmitted insurance companies are those in the United States that have been admitted or licensed by the state licensing agency. The insurance they sell is called '''admitted insurance'''. Non-admitted companies have not been approved by the state licensing agency, but are allowed to sell insurance under special circumstances when they meet an insurance need that admitted companies cannot or will not meet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/admitted-insurance.asp |title=Admitted Insurance |website=investopedia.com |date=29 January 2018 |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance consultants===\n\nThere are also companies known as \"insurance consultants\". Like a mortgage broker, these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. Similar to an insurance consultant, an 'insurance broker' also shops around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. However, with insurance brokers, the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client.\n\nNeither insurance consultants nor insurance brokers are insurance companies and no risks are transferred to them in insurance transactions. Third party administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies.  These companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have.\n\n===Financial stability and rating===\n\nThe financial stability and strength of an insurance company should be a major consideration when buying an insurance contract. An insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future.  For that reason, the viability of the insurance carrier is very important. In recent years, a number of insurance companies have become insolvent, leaving their policyholders with no coverage (or coverage only from a government-backed insurance pool or other arrangement with less attractive payouts for losses). A number of independent rating agencies provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies.\n\nInsurance companies are rated by various agencies such as [[A.&nbsp;M. Best]]. The ratings include the company's financial strength, which measures its ability to pay claims. It also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance company, such as bonds, notes, and securitization products.\n\n==Across the world==\n[[File:2005life premia.PNG|thumb|right|Life insurance premiums written in 2005]]\n[[File:2005nonlife premia.PNG|thumb|right|Non-life insurance premiums written in 2005]]\n\nGlobal insurance premiums grew by 2.7% in inflation-adjusted terms in 2010 to $4.3 trillion, climbing above pre-crisis levels. The return to growth and record premiums generated during the year followed two years of decline in real terms. Life insurance premiums increased by 3.2% in 2010 and non-life premiums by 2.1%. While industrialised countries saw an increase in premiums of around 1.4%, insurance markets in emerging economies saw rapid expansion with 11% growth in premium income. The global insurance industry was sufficiently capitalised to withstand the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and most insurance companies restored their capital to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2010. With the continuation of the gradual recovery of the global economy, it is likely the insurance industry will continue to see growth in premium income both in industrialised countries and emerging markets in 2011.\n\nAdvanced economies account for the bulk of global insurance. With premium income of $1.62 trillion, Europe was the most important region in 2010, followed by North America $1.41 trillion and Asia $1.16 trillion. Europe has however seen a decline in premium income during the year in contrast to the growth seen in North America and Asia. The top four countries generated more than a half of premiums. The United States and Japan alone accounted for 40% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging economies accounted for over 85% of the world's population but only around 15% of premiums. Their markets are however growing at a quicker pace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Insurance-2011-F2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105174930/http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Insurance-2011-F2.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-date=5 January 2012}}&nbsp;{{small|(365&nbsp;KB)}} p. 2</ref> The country expected to have the biggest impact on the insurance share distribution across the world is China.

This only reduces the financial burden and not the actual chances of happening of an event. Insurance is a risk for both the insurance company and the insured.  The insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform a [[risk assessment]] when writing the policy.  As a result, the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will file a claim.  If a person is financially stable and plans for life's unexpected events, they may be able to go without insurance.  However, they must have enough to cover a total and complete loss of employment and of their possessions.  Some states will accept a surety bond, a government bond, or even making a cash deposit with the state.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Moral hazard===\nAn insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk-averse as they might otherwise be (since, by definition, the insured has transferred the risk to the insurer), a concept known as [[moral hazard]]. This 'insulates' many from the\ntrue costs of living with risk, negating measures that can mitigate or adapt to risk and leading some to describe insurance schemes as potentially maladaptive.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Insurance as maladaptation: Resilience and the 'business as usual' paradox|journal = Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|volume = 34|issue = 6|date = 1 September 2015|issn = 0263-774X|pages = 1175\u20131193|doi = 10.1177/0263774X15602022|first = Paul|last = O'Hare|first2 = Iain|last2 = White|first3 = Angela|last3 = Connelly|url = https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/609056/2/OHare%20et%20al_Insurance%20as%20maladaptation.pdf}}</ref> To reduce their own financial exposure, insurance companies have contractual clauses that mitigate their obligation to provide coverage if the insured engages in behavior that grossly magnifies their risk of loss or liability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nFor example, life insurance companies may require higher premiums or deny coverage altogether to people who work in hazardous occupations or engage in dangerous sports.  Liability insurance providers do not provide coverage for liability arising from [[intentional tort]]s committed by or at the direction of the insured. Even if a provider desired to provide such coverage, it is against the public policy of most countries to allow such insurance to exist, and thus it is usually illegal.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Complexity of insurance policy contracts===\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|[[9/11]] was a major insurance loss, but there were disputes over the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]'s insurance policy]]\nInsurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees and coverages included in a policy. As a result, people may buy policies on unfavorable terms. In response to these issues, many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing every aspect of the insurance business, including minimum standards for policies and the ways in which they may be [[advertising|advertised]] and sold.\n\nFor example, most insurance policies in the English language today have been carefully drafted in [[plain English]]; the industry learned the hard way that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying. Typically, courts construe ambiguities in insurance policies against the insurance company and in favor of coverage under the policy.\n\nMany institutional insurance purchasers buy insurance through an insurance broker. While on the surface it appears the broker represents the buyer (not the insurance company), and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations, in the vast majority of cases a broker's compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium, creating a conflict of interest in that the broker's financial interest is tilted towards encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher price. A broker generally holds contracts with many insurers, thereby allowing the broker to \"shop\" the [[Market (economics)|market]] for the best rates and coverage possible.\n\nInsurance may also be purchased through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). Just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.\n\nAn independent insurance consultant advises insureds on a fee-for-service retainer, similar to an attorney, and thus offers completely independent advice, free of the financial conflict of interest of brokers or agents. However, such a consultant must still work through brokers or agents in order to secure coverage for their clients.\n\n===Limited consumer benefits===\nIn the United States, economists and consumer advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for low-probability, catastrophic losses, but not for high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select high [[deductible]]s and to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies from [[moral hazard]].<ref name=Schindler1994>Schindler, R. M.

Ringold (ed.), Chicago, IL: American Marketing Association, 147\u2013155.</ref>\n\n===Redlining===\n[[Redlining]] is the practice of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas, supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss, while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination. [[Racial profiling]] or [[redlining]] has a long history in the property insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.<ref>''Gregory D. Squires (2003)\nRacial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas'' Journal of Urban Affairs Volume 25 Issue 4 pp. 391\u2013410, November 2003</ref>\n\nIn July 2007, The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) released a report presenting the results of a study concerning credit-based [[insurance score]]s in automobile insurance. The study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk. It also showed that African-Americans and Hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores, and substantially underrepresented in the highest, while Caucasians and Asians are more evenly spread across the scores. The credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups, leading the FTC to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining. The FTC indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers.<ref name=\"FTC Study\">[http://ftc.gov/opa/2007/07/facta.shtm Credit-Based Insurance Scores: Impacts on Consumers of Automobile Insurance], Federal Trade Commission (July 2007)</ref> The report was disputed by representatives of the [[Consumer Federation of America]], the National Fair Housing Alliance, the [[National Consumer Law Center]], and the Center for Economic Justice, for relying on data provided by the insurance industry.<ref>[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/07/insurance_credit.html Consumers Dispute FTC Report on Insurance Credit Scoring] www.consumeraffairs.com (July 2007)</ref>\n\nAll states have provisions in their rate regulation laws or in their fair trade practice acts that prohibit unfair discrimination, often called redlining, in setting rates and making insurance available.<ref>{{cite web | author = Insurance Information Institute | authorlink = Insurance Information Institute | title = Issues Update: Regulation Modernization | url = http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/ratereg/ | accessdate = 11 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn determining premiums and premium rate structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location, [[credit score]]s, [[gender]], [[profession|occupation]], [[marital status]], and [[education]] level. However, the use of such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully [[discrimination|discriminatory]], and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes about the ways in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.\n\nAn insurance underwriter's job is to evaluate a given risk as to the likelihood that a loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Thus, \"discrimination\" against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment goes to the heart of the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore the [[risk premium]] must be higher to cover the greater risk.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.\n\n===Insurance patents===\n{{update|date=January 2018}}\n{{Further|Insurance patent}}\nNew assurance products can now be protected from copying with a [[business method patent]] in the [[United States]].\n\nA recent example of a new insurance product that is patented is [[Usage-based insurance|Usage Based]] [[vehicle insurance|auto insurance]]. Early versions were independently invented and patented by a major US auto insurance company, [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Auto Insurance]] ({{US patent|5797134}}) and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez ({{Cite patent|EP|0700009}}).\n\nMany independent inventors are in favor of patenting new insurance products since it gives them protection from big companies when they bring their new insurance products to market. Independent inventors account for 70% of the new U.S. patent applications in this area.\n\nMany insurance executives are opposed to patenting insurance products because it creates a new risk for them. [[The Hartford]] insurance company, for example, recently had to pay $80 million to an independent inventor, Bancorp Services, in order to settle a patent infringement and theft of trade secret lawsuit for a type of corporate owned life insurance product invented and patented by Bancorp.\n\nThere are currently about 150 new patent applications on insurance inventions filed per year in the United States.

Under [[United States tax law]], for example, most owners of [[annuity (US financial products)|variable annuities]] and [[variable universal life insurance|variable life insurance]] can invest their premium payments in the [[stock market]] and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made.

It is a form of [[risk management]], primarily used to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.\n\nAn entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier or [[underwriter]].  A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss.  The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and usually involves something in which the insured has an [[insurable interest]] established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.\n\nThe insured receives a [[contract]], called the [[insurance policy]], which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the '''premium'''. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a [[claims adjuster]]. The insurer may [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] its own risk by taking out [[reinsurance]], whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risks, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of insurance}}\n\n===Early methods===\n[[File:Ferdinand Bol - Governors of the Wine Merchant's Guild - WGA2361.jpg|thumb|Merchants have sought methods to minimize risks since early times. Pictured, ''Governors of the Wine Merchant's Guild'' by [[Ferdinand Bol]], c. 1680.]]\nMethods for transferring or distributing risk were practiced by [[China|Chinese]] and [[Babylonia]]n traders as long ago as the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]] and [[2nd millennium BC|2nd]] [[millennium|millennia]] BC, respectively.<ref>See, e.g., Vaughan, E. J., 1997, ''Risk Management'', New York: Wiley.</ref> Chinese merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessel's capsizing. The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous [[Code of Hammurabi]], c. 1750 BC, and practiced by early [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] sailing [[merchant]]s. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen, or lost at sea.\n\nCirca 800 BC, the inhabitants of [[Rhodes]] created the '[[general average]]'. This allowed groups of merchants to pay to insure their goods being shipped together. The collected premiums would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during transport, whether due to storm or sinkage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LawMuseum/LawArticle-383/Lex-Rhodia-The-Ancient-Ancestor-of-Maritime-Law--800-BC.aspx|title=Lex Rhodia: The Ancient Ancestor of Maritime Law - 800 BC|website=Duhaime.org - Learn Law}}</ref>\n\nSeparate insurance contracts (i.e., insurance policies not bundled with loans or other kinds of contracts) were invented in [[Genoa]] in the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates. The first known insurance contract dates from [[Genoa]] in 1347, and in the next century maritime insurance developed widely and premiums were intuitively varied with risks.<ref>J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 274-277.</ref> These new insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment, a separation of roles that first proved useful in [[marine insurance]].\n\n===Modern methods===\nInsurance became far more sophisticated in [[Enlightenment era]] [[Europe]], and specialized varieties developed.\n\n[[File:Lloyd's coffee house drawing.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lloyd's Coffee House]] was the first organized market for marine insurance.]]\n[[Property insurance]] as we know it today can be traced to the [[Great Fire of London]], which in 1666 devoured more than 13,000 houses. The devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance \"from a matter of convenience into one of urgency, a change of opinion reflected in Sir [[Christopher Wren]]'s inclusion of a site for 'the Insurance Office' in his new plan for London in 1667.\"<ref>Dickson (1960): 4</ref> A number of attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing, but in 1681, [[Economics|economist]] [[Nicholas Barbon]] and eleven associates established the first fire insurance company, the \"Insurance Office for Houses\", at the back of the Royal Exchange to insure brick and frame homes. Initially, 5,000 homes were insured by his Insurance Office.<ref>Dickson (1960): 7</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the first insurance schemes for the [[underwriting]] of [[business venture]]s became available. By the end of the seventeenth century, London's growing importance as a center for trade was increasing demand for [[marine insurance]]. In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd opened [[Lloyd's Coffee House|a coffee house]], which became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. These informal beginnings led to the establishment of the insurance market [[Lloyd's of London]] and several related shipping and insurance businesses.<ref>{{cite ODNB|url=http://press.oxforddnb.com/index/16/101016829 |title=Lloyd, Edward (''c''.1648\u20131713) |first=Sarah |last=Palmer |date=October 2007 |volume=1 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/16829 |accessdate=16 February 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715030319/http://press.oxforddnb.com/index/16/101016829/ |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:National-insurance-act-1911.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Leaflet promoting the [[National Insurance Act 1911]].]]\nThe first [[life insurance]] policies were taken out in the early 18th century.

The insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee, with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be an [[insurable risk]], the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as a [[financial intermediary]] is a commercial enterprise and a major part of the financial services industry, but individual entities can also [[self-insurance|self-insure]] through saving money for possible future losses.<ref>Gollier C. (2003). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41953424?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents To Insure or Not to Insure?: An Insurance Puzzle]. ''The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance Theory''.</ref>\n\n===Insurability===\n{{Main|Insurability}}\n\nRisk which can be insured by private companies typically shares seven common characteristics:<ref>This discussion is adapted from Mehr and Camack \"Principles of Insurance\", 6th edition, 1976, pp 34 \u2013 37.</ref>\n\n# '''Large number of similar exposure units''': Since insurance operates through pooling resources, the majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes, allowing insurers to benefit from the [[law of large numbers]] in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include [[Lloyd's of London]], which is famous for ensuring the life or health of actors, sports figures, and other famous individuals. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different premium rates.\n# '''Definite loss''': The loss takes place at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is the death of an insured person on a life insurance policy. [[Fire]], [[Traffic collision|automobile accidents]], and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. [[Occupational disease]], for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.\n# '''Accidental loss''': The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance. The loss should be pure, in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost. Events that contain speculative elements such as ordinary business risks or even purchasing a lottery ticket are generally not considered insurable.\n# '''Large loss''': The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses, these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.\n# '''Affordable premium''': If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, then it is not likely that the insurance will be purchased, even if on offer. Furthermore, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer. If there is no such chance of loss, then the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance (see the U.S. [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] pronouncement number 113: \"Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts\").\n# '''Calculable loss''': There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim.\n# '''Limited risk of catastrophically large losses''': Insurable losses are ideally [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] and non-catastrophic, meaning that the losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base. [[Capital (economics)|Capital]] constrains insurers' ability to sell [[earthquake insurance]] as well as wind insurance in [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] zones. In the United States, [[flood insurance|flood risk]] is insured by the federal government. In commercial fire insurance, it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the [[reinsurance]] market.\n\n===Legal===\nWhen a company insures an individual entity, there are basic legal requirements and regulations. Several commonly cited legal principles of insurance include:<ref>Irish Brokers Association. [https://www.iba.ie/development2009/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=167 Insurance Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411184958/http://www.iba.ie/development2009/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=167 |date=11 April 2009 }}.</ref>\n# [[Indemnity]] \u2013 the insurance company indemnifies or compensates, the insured in the case of certain losses only up to the insured's interest.\n# Benefit insurance \u2013 as it is stated in the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, the insurance company does not have the right of recovery from the party who caused the injury and is to compensate the Insured regardless of the fact that Insured had already sued the negligent party for the damages (for example, personal accident insurance)\n# [[Insurable interest]] \u2013 the insured typically must directly suffer from the loss.  Insurable interest must exist whether property insurance or insurance on a person is involved.  The concept requires that the insured have a \"stake\" in the loss or damage to the life or property insured.  What that \"stake\" is will be determined by the kind of insurance involved and the nature of the property ownership or relationship between the persons.  The requirement of an insurable interest is what distinguishes insurance from [[gambling]].\n# [[Good faith (law)|Utmost good faith]] \u2013 ([[Uberrima fides]]) the insured and the insurer are bound by a [[good faith]] bond of honesty and fairness.  Material facts must be disclosed.\n# Contribution \u2013 insurers which have similar obligations to the insured contribute in the indemnification, according to some method.\n# Subrogation \u2013 the insurance company acquires legal rights to pursue recoveries on behalf of the insured; for example, the insurer may sue those liable for the insured's loss. The Insurers can waive their subrogation rights by using the special clauses.\n# Causa proxima, or [[proximate cause]] \u2013 the cause of loss (the peril) must be covered under the insuring agreement of the policy, and the dominant cause must not be [[exclusion clause|excluded]]\n# Mitigation \u2013 In case of any loss or casualty, the asset owner must attempt to keep loss to a minimum, as if the asset was not insured.\n\n===Indemnification===\n{{Main|Indemnity}}\n\nTo \"indemnify\" means to make whole again, or to be reinstated to the position that one was in, to the extent possible, prior to the happening of a specified event or peril. Accordingly, [[life insurance]] is generally not considered to be indemnity insurance, but rather \"contingent\" insurance (i.e., a claim arises on the occurrence of a specified event). There are generally three types of insurance contracts that seek to indemnify an insured:\n# A \"reimbursement\" policy\n# A \"pay on behalf\" or \"on behalf of policy\"<ref name=\"KulpHall\">C. Kulp & J. Hall, Casualty Insurance, Fourth Edition, 1968, page 35</ref>\n# An \"indemnification\" policy\n\nFrom an insured's standpoint, the result is usually the same: the insurer pays the loss and claims expenses.\n\nIf the Insured has a \"reimbursement\" policy, the insured can be required to pay for a loss and then be \"reimbursed\" by the insurance carrier for the loss and out of pocket costs including, with the permission of the insurer, claim expenses.<ref name=\"KulpHall\" />{{NoteTag|However, the bankruptcy of the insured with a \"reimbursement\" policy does not relieve the insurer.  Certain types of insurance, e.g., workers' compensation and personal automobile liability, are subject to statutory requirements that injured parties have direct access to coverage.}}\n\nUnder a \"pay on behalf\" policy, the insurance carrier would defend and pay a claim on behalf of the insured who would not be out of pocket for anything. Most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of \"pay on behalf\" language which enables the insurance carrier to manage and control the claim.\n\nUnder an \"indemnification\" policy, the insurance carrier can generally either \"reimburse\" or \"pay on behalf of\", whichever is more beneficial to it and the insured in the claim handling process.\n\nAn entity seeking to transfer risk (an individual, corporation, or association of any type, etc.) becomes the 'insured' party once risk is assumed by an 'insurer', the insuring party, by means of a [[contract]], called an [[insurance policy]]. Generally, an insurance contract includes, at a minimum, the following elements: identification of participating parties (the insurer, the insured, the beneficiaries), the premium, the period of coverage, the particular loss event covered, the amount of coverage (i.e., the amount to be paid to the insured or beneficiary in the event of a loss), and [[Exclusion clause|exclusions]] (events not covered). An insured is thus said to be \"[[indemnity|indemnified]]\" against the loss covered in the policy.\n\nWhen insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril, the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium. Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims \u2013 in theory for a relatively few claimants \u2013 and for [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] costs. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer's [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].\n\n===Exclusions===\nPolicies typically include a number of exclusions, including typically:\n* [[Nuclear exclusion clause]], excluding damage caused by nuclear and radiation accidents\n* [[War exclusion clause]], excluding damage from acts of war or terrorism<ref>{{cite news |last1=Menapace |first1=Michael |title=Losses From Malware May Not Be Covered Due To Your Policy's Hostile Acts Exclusion |url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/property-insurance-cyber-insurance-coverage-and-war-losses-malware-may-not-be-0 |accessdate=25 April 2019 |work=The National Law Review |date=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stock |first1=Rob |title=Insurers waive terrorism exclusions for Christchurch shooting victims |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-shooting/111397687/insurers-waive-terrorism-exclusions-for-christchurch-shooting-victims |accessdate=25 April 2019 |work=Stuff |date=19 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Social effects==\nInsurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of losses and damage. On one hand it can increase fraud; on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies.\n\nInsurance can influence the probability of losses through [[moral hazard]], [[insurance fraud]], and preventive steps by the insurance company. Insurance scholars have typically used [[moral hazard]] to refer to the increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference.<ref name=\"ZweifelEisen2012\">{{cite book|author1=Peter Zweifel|author2=Roland Eisen|title=Insurance Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_8qzz5soE8C&pg=PA268|date=24 February 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-20547-7|pages=268\u2013}}</ref> Insurers attempt to address carelessness through inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance, and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts. While in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measures\u2014particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes\u2014because of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles. However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to take a more active role in loss mitigation, such as through [[building code]]s.<ref>Kunreuther H. (1996). [http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/downloads/archive/arch167.pdf Mitigating Disaster Losses Through Insurance]. ''Journal of Risk and Uncertainty''.</ref>\n\n===Methods of insurance===\nAccording to the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, there are variant methods of insurance as follows:\n# Co-insurance \u2013 risks shared between insurers \n# Dual insurance \u2013 having two or more policies with overlapping coverage of a risk (both the individual policies would not pay separately \u2013 under a concept named contribution, they would contribute together to make up the policyholder's losses. However, in case of contingency insurances such as life insurance, dual payment is allowed) \n# Self-insurance \u2013 situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by the entities or individuals themselves\n# Reinsurance \u2013 situations when the insurer passes some part of or all risks to another Insurer, called the reinsurer\n\n==Insurers' business model==\n[[File:Accidents will happen William-H.-Watson-Universal-Star-Featurette-1922.webm|thumb|''Accidents will happen'' (William H. Watson, 1922) is a slapstick silent film about the methods and mishaps of an insurance broker. Collection [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]].]]\n\nInsurers may use the [[subscription business model]] , collecting premium payments periodically in return for on-going and/or [[compound interest | compounding]] benefits offered to policyholders.\n\n===Underwriting and investing===\nInsurers' business model aims to collect more in premium and investment income than is paid out in losses, and to also offer a competitive price which consumers will accept. Profit can be reduced to a simple equation:\n:Profit = [[cancellation (insurance) |earned premium]] + investment income \u2013 incurred loss \u2013 underwriting expenses.\n\nInsurers make money in two ways:\n* Through [[underwriting]], the process by which insurers select the risks to insure and decide how much in premiums to charge for accepting those risks, and taking the brunt of the risk should it come to fruition.\n* By [[investment|investing]] the premiums they collect from insured parties\n\nThe most complicated aspect of insuring is the [[actuarial science]] of ratemaking (price-setting) of policies, which uses [[statistics]] and [[probability]] to approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk. After producing rates, the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept risks through the underwriting process.\n\nAt the most basic level, initial rate-making involves looking at the [[frequency]] and [[wikt:severity |severity]] of insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from these perils. Thereafter an insurance company will collect historical loss-data, bring the loss data to [[present value]], and compare these prior losses to the premium collected in order to assess rate adequacy.<ref>Brown RL. (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1j4O50JENE4C Introduction to Ratemaking and Loss Reserving for Property and Casualty Insurance]. ACTEX Publications.</ref> [[Loss ratio]]s and expense loads are also used. Rating for different risk characteristics involves - at the most basic level - comparing the losses with \"loss relativities\"\u2014a policy with twice as many losses would, therefore, be charged twice as much. More complex [[multivariate analysis| multivariate analyses]] are sometimes used when multiple characteristics are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results. Other statistical methods may be used in assessing the probability of future losses.\n\nUpon termination of a given policy, the amount of premium collected minus the amount paid out in claims is the insurer's [[underwriting profit]] on that policy. Underwriting performance is measured by something called the \"combined ratio\", which is the ratio of expenses/losses to premiums.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Juc4fb1Fx1cC&lpg=PA614&pg=PA614#v=onepage&f=false |title= The Handbook of Municipal Bonds|first1= Sylvan G.|last1= Feldstein|first2= Frank J.|last2= Fabozzi|year= 2008|page= 614|publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]|isbn= 978-0-470-10875-8|accessdate= 8 February 2010}}</ref> A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while anything over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. A company with a combined ratio over 100% may nevertheless remain profitable due to investment earnings.\n\nInsurance companies earn [[investment]] profits on \"float\". Float, or available reserve, is the amount of money on hand at any given moment that an insurer has collected in insurance premiums but has not paid out in claims. Insurers start investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn interest or other income on them until claims are paid out. The [[Association of British Insurers]] (grouping together 400 insurance companies and 94% of UK insurance services) has almost 20% of the investments in the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>[http://www.abi.org.uk/About_The_ABI/role.aspx What we do ABI] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090907134048/http://www.abi.org.uk/About_The_ABI/role.aspx |date= 7 September 2009 }}. Abi.org.uk. Retrieved on 18 July 2013.</ref> In 2007, U.S. industry profits from float totaled $58 billion. In a 2009 letter to investors, Warren Buffett wrote, \"we were ''paid'' $2.8 billion to hold our float in 2008\".<ref>{{Cite book|title= Delay, Deny, Defend : Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It|last= Feinman|first= Jay M.|publisher= Portfolio|year= 2010|isbn= 9781101196281|pages= 16|oclc= 883320058}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the underwriting loss of [[property insurance |property]] and [[casualty insurance]] companies was $142.3 billion in the five years ending 2003. But overall profit for the same period was $68.4 billion, as the result of float. Some insurance-industry insiders, most notably [[Maurice R. Greenberg |Hank Greenberg]], do not believe that it is possible to sustain a profit from float forever without an underwriting profit as well, but this opinion is not universally held. Reliance on float for profit has led some industry experts to call insurance companies \"investment companies that raise the money for their investments by selling insurance\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Weir|first= Audrey A.|last2= Hampton|first2= John H.|date= March 1995|title= Essentials of Risk Management and Insurance|journal= The Journal of Risk and Insurance|volume= 62|issue= 1|pages= 157|doi= 10.2307/253703|issn= 0022-4367|jstor= 253703}}</ref>\n\nNaturally, the float method is difficult to carry out in an [[Depression (economics)|economically depressed]] period. [[Bear market]]s do cause insurers to shift away from investments and to toughen up their underwriting standards, so a poor economy generally means high insurance-premiums. This tendency to swing between profitable and unprofitable periods over time is commonly known{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} as the [[insurance cycle| underwriting, or insurance, cycle]].<ref>\nFitzpatrick, Sean, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=690316 ''Fear is the Key: A Behavioral Guide to Underwriting Cycles,''] 10 Conn. Ins. L.J. 255 (2004).\n</ref>\n\n===Claims===\nClaims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance; it is the actual \"product\" paid for.  Claims may be filed by insureds directly with the insurer or through [[Insurance broker|brokers or agents]].  The insurer may require that the claim be filed on its own proprietary forms, or may accept claims on a standard industry form, such as those produced by [[ACORD]].\n\nInsurance company claims departments employ a large number of [[claims adjuster]]s supported by a staff of [[records management]] and [[data entry clerk]]s.  Incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience.  The adjuster undertakes an investigation of each claim, usually in close cooperation with the insured, determines if coverage is available under the terms of the insurance contract, and if so, the reasonable monetary value of the claim, and authorizes payment.\n\nThe policyholder may hire their own [[public adjuster]] to negotiate the settlement with the insurance company on their behalf. For policies that are complicated, where claims may be complex, the insured may take out a separate insurance policy add-on, called loss recovery insurance, which covers the cost of a public adjuster in the case of a claim.\n\nAdjusting liability insurance claims is particularly difficult because there is a third party involved, the [[plaintiff]], who is under no contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer and may in fact regard the insurer as a [[deep pocket]]. The adjuster must obtain legal counsel for the insured (either inside \"house\" counsel or outside \"panel\" counsel), monitor litigation that may take years to complete, and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement authority at a mandatory settlement conference when requested by the judge.\n\nIf a claims adjuster suspects under-insurance, the [[condition of average]] may come into play to limit the insurance company's exposure.\n\nIn managing the claims handling function, insurers seek to balance the elements of customer satisfaction, administrative handling expenses, and claims overpayment leakages.  As part of this balancing act, [[insurance fraud|fraudulent insurance practices]] are a major business risk that must be managed and overcome. Disputes between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims handling practices occasionally escalate into litigation (see [[insurance bad faith]]).\n\n===Marketing===\nInsurers will often use [[agency (law)|insurance agents]] to initially market or [[Underwrite]] their customers. Agents can be captive, meaning they write only for one company, or independent, meaning that they can issue policies from several companies. The existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due the availability of improved and personalised services. Companies also use Broking firms, Banks and other corporate entities (like Self Help Groups, Microfinance Institutions, NGOs, etc.) to market their products.<ref>{{cite journal\n |first1  = Allen N.\n |last1   = Berger\n |first2  = J.

Specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils. An insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not. Below are non-exhaustive lists of the many different types of insurance that exist. A single policy that may cover risks in one or more of the categories set out below. For example, [[vehicle insurance]] would typically cover both the property risk (theft or damage to the vehicle) and the liability risk (legal claims arising from an [[traffic collision|accident]]). A [[home insurance]] policy in the United States typically includes coverage for damage to the home and the owner's belongings, certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.\n\n[[Business]] insurance can take a number of different forms, such as the various kinds of professional liability insurance, also called professional indemnity (PI), which are discussed below under that name; and the [[business owner's policy]] (BOP), which packages into one policy many of the kinds of coverage that a business owner needs, in a way analogous to how homeowners' insurance packages the coverages that a homeowner needs.<ref>{{cite web | author = Insurance Information Institute | authorlink = Insurance Information Institute | title = Business insurance information. What does a businessowners policy cover? | url = http://www.iii.org/individuals/business/basics/bop/ | accessdate = 9 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Auto insurance===\n{{Main|Vehicle insurance}}\n[[File:Car crash 1.jpg|thumb|right|A wrecked vehicle in [[Copenhagen]]]]\nAuto insurance protects the policyholder against financial loss in the event of an incident involving a vehicle they own, such as in a [[traffic collision]].\n\nCoverage typically includes:\n* Property coverage, for damage to or theft of the car\n* Liability coverage, for the legal responsibility to others for bodily injury or property damage\n* Medical coverage, for the cost of treating injuries, rehabilitation and sometimes lost wages and funeral expenses\n\n===Gap insurance===\n{{Main|Gap insurance}}\n\nGap insurance covers the excess amount on your auto loan in an instance where your insurance company does not cover the entire loan. Depending on the company's specific policies it might or might not cover the deductible as well. This coverage is marketed for those who put low [[down payment]]s, have high interest rates on their loans, and those with 60-month or longer terms. Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.\n\n===Health insurance===\n{{Main|Health insurance|Dental insurance}}\n[[File:Great western hospital.JPG|right|thumb|Great Western Hospital, [[Swindon]]]]\n\nHealth insurance policies cover the cost of medical treatments. Dental insurance, like medical insurance, protects policyholders for dental costs. In most developed countries, all citizens receive some health coverage from their governments, paid through taxation. In most countries, health insurance is often part of an employer's benefits.\n\n===Income protection insurance===\n[[File:Pipe installation 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Workers' compensation]], or employers' liability insurance, is compulsory in some countries]]\n* [[Disability insurance]] policies provide financial support in the event of the policyholder becoming unable to work because of disabling illness or injury. It provides monthly support to help pay such obligations as [[mortgage loan]]s and [[credit card]]s. Short-term and long-term disability policies are available to individuals, but considering the expense, long-term policies are generally obtained only by those with at least six-figure incomes, such as doctors, lawyers, etc. Short-term disability insurance covers a person for a period typically up to six months, paying a stipend each month to cover medical bills and other necessities.\n* Long-term disability insurance covers an individual's expenses for the long term, up until such time as they are considered permanently disabled and thereafter Insurance companies will often try to encourage the person back into employment in preference to and before declaring them unable to work at all and therefore totally disabled.\n* [[Business overhead expense disability insurance|Disability overhead insurance]] allows business owners to cover the overhead expenses of their business while they are unable to work.\n* [[Total permanent disability insurance]] provides benefits when a person is permanently disabled and can no longer work in their profession, often taken as an adjunct to life insurance.\n* [[Workers' compensation]] insurance replaces all or part of a worker's [[wage]]s lost and accompanying medical expenses incurred because of a job-related injury.\n\n===Casualty insurance===\n{{Main|Casualty insurance}}\nCasualty insurance insures against accidents, not necessarily tied to any specific property. It is a broad spectrum of insurance that a number of other types of insurance could be classified, such as auto, workers compensation, and some liability insurances.\n* Crime insurance is a form of casualty insurance that covers the policyholder against losses arising from the [[criminal act]]s of third parties.  For example, a company can obtain crime insurance to cover losses arising from [[theft]] or [[embezzlement]].\n* [[Terrorism insurance]] provides protection against any loss or damage caused by [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities. In the United States in the wake of [[september 11 attacks|9/11]], the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]] 2002 (TRIA) set up a federal program providing a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. The program was extended until the end of 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act 2007 (TRIPRA).\n* [[Kidnap and ransom insurance]] is designed to protect individuals and corporations operating in high-risk areas around the world against the perils of kidnap, extortion, wrongful detention and hijacking.\n* [[Political risk insurance]] is a form of casualty insurance that can be taken out by businesses with operations in countries in which there is a risk that [[revolution]] or other [[politics|political]] conditions could result in a loss.\n\n===Life insurance===\n{{Main|Life insurance}}\n[[File:Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, London, 1801.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office]], Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, [[London]], 1801]]\nLife insurance provides a monetary benefit to a decedent's family or other designated beneficiary, and may specifically provide for income to an insured person's family, burial, funeral and other final expenses. Life insurance policies often allow the option of having the proceeds paid to the beneficiary either in a lump sum cash payment or an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]]. In most states, a person cannot purchase a policy on another person without their knowledge.\n\nAnnuities provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require the same kinds of actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and [[pension]]s that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a [[retirement|retiree]] will outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.\n\nCertain life insurance contracts accumulate [[cash]] values, which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some policies, such as annuities and [[endowment policy|endowment policies]], are financial instruments to accumulate or [[liquidation|liquidate]] [[wealth]] when it is needed.\n\nIn many countries, such as the United States and the UK, the [[tax law]] provides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances. This leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax-efficient method of [[saving]] as well as protection in the event of early death.\n\nIn the United States, the tax on interest income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, in some cases the benefit derived from [[tax deferral]] may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.\n\n===Burial insurance===\nBurial insurance is a very old type of life insurance which is paid out upon death to cover final expenses, such as the cost of a [[funeral]]. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] introduced burial insurance c.&nbsp;600 CE when they organized [[guild]]s called \"benevolent societies\" which cared for the surviving families and paid funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in the [[Middle Ages]] served a similar purpose, as did friendly societies during Victorian times.\n\n===Property===\n{{Main|Property insurance}}\n[[File:Tornado Damage, Illinois 2.JPG|right|thumb|This [[tornado]] damage to an [[Illinois]] home would be considered an \"[[Act of God]]\" for insurance purposes]]\nProperty insurance provides protection against risks to property, such as [[fire]], [[theft]] or [[weather]] damage. This may include specialized forms of insurance such as fire insurance, [[flood insurance]], [[earthquake insurance]], [[home insurance]], inland marine insurance or [[boiler insurance]].\nThe term ''property insurance'' may, like casualty insurance, be used as a broad category of various subtypes of insurance, some of which are listed below:\n\n[[File:Plane crash into Hudson River muchcropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[US Airways Flight 1549]] was [[Write-off|written off]] after ditching into the [[Hudson River]]]]\n* [[Aviation insurance]] protects [[aircraft]] hulls and spares, and associated liability risks, such as passenger and third-party liability. [[Airport]]s may also appear under this subcategory, including air traffic control and refuelling operations for international airports through to smaller domestic exposures.\n* [[Boiler insurance]] (also known as boiler and machinery insurance, or equipment breakdown insurance) insures against accidental physical damage to boilers, equipment or machinery.\n* [[Builder's risk insurance]] insures against the risk of physical loss or damage to property during construction. Builder's risk insurance is typically written on an \"all risk\" basis covering damage arising from any cause (including the negligence of the insured) not otherwise expressly excluded. Builder's risk insurance is coverage that protects a person's or organization's insurable interest in materials, fixtures or equipment being used in the construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from an insured peril.<ref>{{cite web|title=Builder's Risk Insurance: Specialized Coverage for Construction Projects|url=http://adjustersinternational.com/publications/adjusting-today/builders-risk-insurance/1/|website=Adjusting Today|publisher=Adjusters International|accessdate=16 October 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Crop insurance]] may be purchased by farmers to reduce or manage various risks associated with growing crops. Such risks include crop loss or damage caused by weather, hail, drought, frost damage, insects, or disease.<ref>{{US patent application|20060287896}} \"Method for providing crop insurance for a crop associated with a defined attribute\"</ref> [[Index-based insurance]] uses models of how climate extremes affect crop production to define certain climate triggers that if surpassed have high probabilities of causing substantial crop loss. When harvest losses occur associated with exceeding the climate trigger threshold, the index-insured farmer is entitled to a compensation payment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Born|first=Lorna|last2=Spillane|first2=Charles|last3=Murray|first3=Una|date=20 December 2018|title=Integrating gender into index-based agricultural insurance: a focus on South Africa|journal=Development in Practice|volume=29|issue=4|pages=409\u2013423|doi=10.1080/09614524.2018.1556608|issn=0961-4524|hdl=10568/102499|hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n* [[Earthquake insurance]] is a form of property insurance that pays the policyholder in the event of an [[earthquake]] that causes damage to the property. Most ordinary home insurance policies do not cover earthquake damage. Earthquake insurance policies generally feature a high [[deductible]].  Rates depend on location and hence the likelihood of an earthquake, as well as the [[Earthquake engineering|construction of the home]].\n* [[Fidelity bond]] is a form of casualty insurance that covers policyholders for losses incurred as a result of fraudulent acts by specified individuals. It usually insures a business for losses caused by the dishonest acts of its employees.\n\n[[File:FEMA - 14947 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 08-30-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurricane Katrina]] caused over $80 billion of storm and flood damage]]\n* [[Flood insurance]] protects against property loss due to flooding. Many U.S. insurers do not provide flood insurance in some parts of the country. In response to this, the federal government created the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] which serves as the insurer of last resort.\n* [[Home insurance]], also commonly called hazard insurance or homeowners insurance (often abbreviated in the real estate industry as HOI), provides coverage for damage or destruction of the policyholder's home. In some geographical areas, the policy may exclude certain types of risks, such as flood or earthquake, that require additional coverage. Maintenance-related issues are typically the homeowner's responsibility. The policy may include inventory, or this can be bought as a separate policy, especially for people who rent housing. In some countries, insurers offer a package which may include liability and legal responsibility for injuries and property damage caused by members of the household, including pets.<ref>{{cite web | author = Insurance Information Institute | authorlink = Insurance Information Institute | title = What is homeowners insurance? | url = http://www.iii.org/individuals/homei/hbasics/whatis/ | accessdate = 11 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* [[Landlords' insurance|Landlord insurance]] covers residential or commercial property that is rented to tenants. It also covers the landlord's liability for the occupants at the property. Most homeowners' insurance, meanwhile, cover only owner-occupied homes and not liability or damages related to tenants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesrealestatecouncil/2019/09/10/insurance-for-landlords-protecting-your-investment/|title=Insurance For Landlords: Protecting Your Investment|last=Miller|first=Nathan|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref>\n* [[Marine insurance]] and marine cargo insurance cover the loss or damage of vessels at sea or on [[Inland waterways of the United States|inland waterway]]<nowiki/>s, and of cargo in transit, regardless of the method of transit. When the owner of the cargo and the carrier are separate corporations, marine cargo insurance typically compensates the owner of cargo for losses sustained from fire, shipwreck, etc., but excludes losses that can be recovered from the carrier or the carrier's insurance. Many marine insurance underwriters will include \"time element\" coverage in such policies, which extends the indemnity to cover loss of profit and other business expenses attributable to the delay caused by a covered loss.\n* [[Renters' insurance]], often called tenants' insurance, is an insurance policy that provides some of the benefits of homeowners' insurance, but does not include coverage for the dwelling, or structure, with the exception of small alterations that a tenant makes to the structure.\n* Supplemental natural disaster insurance covers specified expenses after a natural disaster renders the policyholder's home uninhabitable. Periodic payments are made directly to the insured until the home is rebuilt or a specified time period has elapsed.\n* [[Surety bond]] insurance is a three-party insurance guaranteeing the performance of the principal.\n[[File:WTC smoking on 9-11.jpeg|thumb|right|The demand for [[terrorism insurance]] surged after [[september 11 attacks|9/11]]]]\n* Volcano insurance is a specialized insurance protecting against damage arising specifically from [[Volcano|volcanic eruptions]].\n* Windstorm insurance is an insurance covering the damage that can be caused by wind events such as [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]].\n\n===Liability===\n{{Main|Liability insurance}}\nLiability insurance is a very broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured in the event of a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense in the event of a lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.\n\n[[File:Sign of the Times-Foreclosure.jpg|thumb|right|The [[subprime mortgage crisis]] was the source of many [[liability insurance]] losses]]\n* [[Public liability]] insurance or general liability insurance covers a business or organization against claims should its operations injure a member of the public or damage their property in some way.\n* [[Directors and officers liability insurance]] (D&O) protects an organization (usually a corporation) from costs associated with litigation resulting from errors made by directors and officers for which they are liable.\n* Environmental liability or environmental impairment insurance protects the insured from bodily injury, property damage and cleanup costs as a result of the dispersal, release or escape of pollutants.\n* [[Professional liability insurance|Errors and omissions insurance]] (E&O) is business liability insurance for professionals such as insurance agents, real estate agents and brokers, architects, third-party administrators (TPAs) and other business professionals.\n* [[Prize indemnity insurance]] protects the insured from giving away a large prize at a specific event. Examples would include offering prizes to contestants who can make a half-court shot at a [[basketball]] game, or a [[hole in one|hole-in-one]] at a [[golf]] tournament.\n* [[Professional liability insurance]], also called [[professional indemnity insurance]] (PI), protects insured professionals such as architectural corporations and medical practitioners against potential negligence claims made by their patients/clients.  Professional liability insurance may take on different names depending on the profession.  For example, professional liability insurance in reference to the medical profession may be called [[medical malpractice]] insurance.\nOften a commercial insured's liability insurance program consists of several layers.  The first layer of insurance generally consists of primary insurance, which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements up to the limits of liability of the primary policy.  Generally, primary insurance is subject to a deductible and obligates the insured to defend the insured against lawsuits, which is normally accomplished by assigning counsel to defend the insured.  In many instances, a commercial insured may elect to self-insure.  Above the primary insurance or self-insured retention, the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional limits of indemnity protection. There are a variety of types of excess insurance, including \"stand-alone\" excess policies (policies that contain their own terms, conditions, and exclusions), \"follow form\" excess insurance (policies that follow the terms of the underlying policy except as specifically provided), and \"umbrella\" insurance policies (excess insurance that in some circumstances could provide coverage that is broader than the underlying insurance).<ref>{{Cite journal |title =Excess Liability Insurance: Law and Litigation |last = Seaman|first = S.

Mortgage insurance is a form of credit insurance, although the name \"credit insurance\" more often is used to refer to policies that cover other kinds of debt.\n* Many credit cards offer payment protection plans which are a form of credit insurance.\n* [[Trade credit insurance]] is business insurance over the accounts receivable of the insured. The policy pays the policy holder for covered accounts receivable if the debtor defaults on payment.\n* [[Collateral protection insurance]] (CPI) insures property (primarily vehicles) held as collateral for loans made by lending institutions.\n\n===Other types===\n* All-risk insurance is an insurance that covers a wide range of incidents and perils, except those noted in the policy. All-risk insurance is different from peril-specific insurance that cover losses from only those perils listed in the policy.<ref>[http://www.business.gov/manage/business-insurance/insurance-types.html Types of Business Insurance | SBA.gov] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629042726/http://www.business.gov/manage/business-insurance/insurance-types.html |date=29 June 2010 }}.

Retrieved on 18 July 2013.</ref> In [[car insurance]], all-risk policy includes also the damages caused by the own driver.\n[[File:2006GoodwoodBreedersCup.jpg|thumb|right|High-value horses may be insured under a [[Thoroughbred|bloodstock]] policy]]\n* Bloodstock insurance covers individual [[horse]]s or a number of horses under common ownership. Coverage is typically for mortality as a result of accident, illness or disease but may extend to include infertility, in-transit loss, veterinary fees, and prospective foal.\n* [[Business interruption insurance]] covers the loss of income, and the expenses incurred, after a covered peril interrupts normal business operations.\n* [[Defense Base Act]] (DBA) insurance provides coverage for civilian workers hired by the government to perform contracts outside the United States and Canada. DBA is required for all U.S. citizens, U.S. residents, U.S. Green Card holders, and all employees or subcontractors hired on overseas government contracts. Depending on the country, foreign nationals must also be covered under DBA. This coverage typically includes expenses related to medical treatment and loss of wages, as well as disability and death benefits.\n* [[Expatriate insurance]] provides individuals and organizations operating outside of their home country with protection for automobiles, property, health, liability and business pursuits.\n* [[Legal expenses insurance]] covers policyholders for the potential costs of legal action against an institution or an individual. When something happens which triggers the need for legal action, it is known as \"the event\". There are two main types of legal expenses insurance: [[Legal expenses insurance#Before the event insurance|before the event insurance]] and [[Legal expenses insurance#After the event insurance|after the event insurance]].\n* Livestock insurance is a specialist policy provided to, for example, commercial or hobby farms, aquariums, fish farms or any other animal holding. Cover is available for mortality or economic slaughter as a result of accident, illness or disease but can extend to include destruction by government order.\n* Media liability insurance is designed to cover professionals that engage in film and television production and print, against risks such as [[defamation]].\n* Nuclear incident insurance covers damages resulting from an [[nuclear and radiation accidents|incident involving radioactive materials]] and is generally arranged at the national level. (See the [[nuclear exclusion clause]] and, for the United States, the [[Price\u2013Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act]].)\n* [[Pet insurance]] insures pets against accidents and illnesses; some companies cover routine/wellness care and burial, as well.\n* [[Pollution insurance]] usually takes the form of first-party coverage for contamination of insured property either by external or on-site sources. Coverage is also afforded for liability to third parties arising from contamination of air, water, or land due to the sudden and accidental release of hazardous materials from the insured site. The policy usually covers the costs of cleanup and may include coverage for releases from underground storage tanks. Intentional acts are specifically excluded.\n* Purchase insurance is aimed at providing protection on the products people purchase. Purchase insurance can cover individual purchase protection, [[warranties]], [[guarantees]], care plans and even mobile phone insurance. Such insurance is normally very limited in the scope of problems that are covered by the policy.\n* Tax insurance is increasingly being used in corporate transactions to protect taxpayers in the event that a tax position it has taken is challenged by the IRS or a state, local, or foreign taxing authority<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blitz|first1=Gary|last2=Schoenberg|first2=Daniel|title=Private REITs: Facilitating a Cleaner Exit with Tax Insurance|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/private-reits-facilitating-cleaner-exit-tax-insurance|publisher=Transaction Advisors|issn=2329-9134}}</ref>\n* [[Title insurance]] provides a guarantee that title to [[real property]] is vested in the purchaser or [[mortgage law|mortgagee]], free and clear of [[lien]]s or encumbrances. It is usually issued in conjunction with a search of the public records performed at the time of a [[real estate]] transaction.\n* [[Travel insurance]] is an insurance cover taken by those who travel abroad, which covers certain losses such as medical expenses, loss of personal belongings, travel delay, and personal liabilities.\n* [[Tuition insurance]] insures students against involuntary withdrawal from cost-intensive educational institutions\n* [[Interest rate insurance]] protects the holder from adverse changes in interest rates, for instance for those with a variable rate loan or mortgage\n* Divorce insurance is a form of contractual liability insurance that pays the insured a cash benefit if their marriage ends in divorce.\n\n===Insurance financing vehicles===\n* Fraternal insurance is provided on a cooperative basis by [[Benefit society|fraternal benefit societies]] or other social organizations.<ref>Margaret E. Lynch, Editor, \"Health Insurance Terminology\", Health Insurance Association of America, 1992, {{ISBN|1-879143-13-5}}</ref>\n* [[No-fault insurance]] is a type of insurance policy (typically automobile insurance) where insureds are indemnified by their own insurer regardless of fault in the incident.\n* Protected self-insurance is an alternative risk financing mechanism in which an organization retains the mathematically calculated cost of risk within the organization and transfers the catastrophic risk with specific and aggregate limits to an insurer so the maximum total cost of the program is known. A properly designed and underwritten Protected Self-Insurance Program reduces and stabilizes the cost of insurance and provides valuable risk management information.\n* Retrospectively rated insurance is a method of establishing a premium on large commercial accounts. The final premium is based on the insured's actual loss experience during the policy term, sometimes subject to a minimum and maximum premium, with the final premium determined by a formula. Under this plan, the current year's premium is based partially (or wholly) on the current year's losses, although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year's expiration date. The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract. Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium \u00d7 tax multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use.\n* Formal [[self-insurance]] is the deliberate decision to pay for otherwise insurable losses out of one's own money.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually used to pay for high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n* [[Reinsurance]] is a type of insurance purchased by insurance companies or self-insured employers to protect against unexpected losses. [[Financial reinsurance]] is a form of reinsurance that is primarily used for capital management rather than to transfer insurance risk.\n* [[Social insurance]] can be many things to many people in many countries. But a summary of its essence is that it is a collection of insurance coverages (including components of life insurance, disability income insurance, unemployment insurance, health insurance, and others), plus retirement savings, that requires participation by all citizens. By forcing everyone in society to be a policyholder and pay premiums, it ensures that everyone can become a claimant when or if they need to. Along the way, this inevitably becomes related to other concepts such as the justice system and the [[welfare state]]. This is a large, complicated topic that engenders tremendous debate, which can be further studied in the following articles (and others):\n**[[National Insurance]]\n** [[Social safety net]]\n** [[Social security]]\n** [[Social Security debate (United States)]]\n** [[Social Security (United States)]]\n** [[Social welfare provision]]\n* [[Stop-loss insurance]] provides protection against catastrophic or unpredictable losses. It is purchased by organizations who do not want to assume 100% of the liability for losses arising from the plans. Under a stop-loss policy, the insurance company becomes liable for losses that exceed certain limits called deductibles.\n\n===Closed community and governmental self-insurance===\nSome communities prefer to create virtual insurance amongst themselves by other means than contractual risk transfer, which assigns explicit numerical values to risk. A number of [[religion|religious]] groups, including the [[Amish]] and some [[Muslim]] groups, depend on support provided by their [[community|communities]] when [[disaster]]s strike. The risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind. In supportive communities where others can be trusted to follow community leaders, this tacit form of insurance can work.  In this manner the community can even out the extreme differences in insurability that exist among its members. Some further justification is also provided by invoking the [[moral hazard]] of explicit insurance contracts.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], [[The Crown]] (which, for practical purposes, meant the [[civil service]]) did not insure property such as government buildings.  If a government building was damaged, the cost of repair would be met from public funds because, in the long run, this was cheaper than paying insurance premiums.  Since many UK government buildings have been sold to property companies and rented back, this arrangement is now less common and may have disappeared altogether.\n\nIn the United States, the most prevalent form of [[self-insurance]] is governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage for the majority of governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts.  Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form a [[risk pool]]. Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage (such as general liability, auto liability, professional liability, workers compensation, and property) is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, self-insured pools offer members lower rates (due to not needing insurance brokers), increased benefits (such as loss prevention services) and subject matter expertise.  Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of self-insured pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools.  Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions (self-insured premiums) to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually.<ref>Marcos Antonio Mendoza, \"Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions\", 21 Conn.

The main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life, annuity, and pension business is very long-term in nature \u2013 coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many [[decade]]s. By contrast, non-life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.\n\n===Mutual versus proprietary===\n{{Main|Mutual insurance}}\nInsurance companies are generally classified as either [[Mutual insurance|mutual]] or proprietary companies.<ref>{{cite book|title=IF1 \u2013 Insurance, Legal & Regulatory|year=2011|publisher=Chartered Insurance Institute|isbn=978-0-85713-094-5|author=David Ransom|page=2/5}}</ref> Mutual companies are owned by the policyholders, while shareholders (who may or may not own policies) own proprietary insurance companies.\n\n[[Demutualization]] of mutual insurers to form stock companies, as well as the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century.  However, not all states permit mutual holding companies.\n\n===Reinsurance companies===\n\n[[Reinsurance]] companies are insurance companies that sell policies to other insurance companies, allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from substantial losses. The reinsurance market is dominated by a few very large companies, with huge reserves. A reinsurer may also be a direct writer of insurance risks as well.\n\n===Captive insurance companies===\n{{Main|Captive insurance}}\n\n[[Captive insurance]] companies may be defined as limited-purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may take the form of a \"pure\" entity, which is a 100% subsidiary of the self-insured parent company; of a \"mutual\" captive, which insures the collective risks of members of an industr); and of an \"association\" captive, which self-insures individual risks of the members of a professional, commercial or industrial association. Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.\n\nThe types of risk that a captive can underwrite for their parents include property damage, public and product liability, professional indemnity, employee benefits, employers' liability, motor and medical aid expenses. The captive's exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance.\n\nCaptives are becoming an increasingly important component of the [[risk management]] and risk financing strategy of their parent. This can be understood against the following background:\n* Heavy and increasing premium costs in almost every line of coverage\n* Difficulties in insuring certain types of fortuitous risk\n* Differential coverage standards in various parts of the world\n* Rating structures which reflect market trends rather than individual loss experience\n* Insufficient credit for deductibles or loss control efforts\n\n===Other forms===\nOther possible forms for an insurance company include [[reciprocal inter-insurance exchange|reciprocals]], in which policyholders reciprocate in sharing risks, and Lloyd's organizations.\n\n===Admitted versus non-admitted===\nAdmitted insurance companies are those in the United States that have been admitted or licensed by the state licensing agency. The insurance they sell is called '''admitted insurance'''. Non-admitted companies have not been approved by the state licensing agency, but are allowed to sell insurance under special circumstances when they meet an insurance need that admitted companies cannot or will not meet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/admitted-insurance.asp |title=Admitted Insurance |website=investopedia.com |date=29 January 2018 |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance consultants===\n\nThere are also companies known as \"insurance consultants\". Like a mortgage broker, these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. Similar to an insurance consultant, an 'insurance broker' also shops around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. However, with insurance brokers, the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client.\n\nNeither insurance consultants nor insurance brokers are insurance companies and no risks are transferred to them in insurance transactions. Third party administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies.  These companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have.\n\n===Financial stability and rating===\n\nThe financial stability and strength of an insurance company should be a major consideration when buying an insurance contract. An insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future.  For that reason, the viability of the insurance carrier is very important. In recent years, a number of insurance companies have become insolvent, leaving their policyholders with no coverage (or coverage only from a government-backed insurance pool or other arrangement with less attractive payouts for losses). A number of independent rating agencies provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies.\n\nInsurance companies are rated by various agencies such as [[A.&nbsp;M. Best]]. The ratings include the company's financial strength, which measures its ability to pay claims. It also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance company, such as bonds, notes, and securitization products.\n\n==Across the world==\n[[File:2005life premia.PNG|thumb|right|Life insurance premiums written in 2005]]\n[[File:2005nonlife premia.PNG|thumb|right|Non-life insurance premiums written in 2005]]\n\nGlobal insurance premiums grew by 2.7% in inflation-adjusted terms in 2010 to $4.3 trillion, climbing above pre-crisis levels. The return to growth and record premiums generated during the year followed two years of decline in real terms. Life insurance premiums increased by 3.2% in 2010 and non-life premiums by 2.1%. While industrialised countries saw an increase in premiums of around 1.4%, insurance markets in emerging economies saw rapid expansion with 11% growth in premium income. The global insurance industry was sufficiently capitalised to withstand the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and most insurance companies restored their capital to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2010. With the continuation of the gradual recovery of the global economy, it is likely the insurance industry will continue to see growth in premium income both in industrialised countries and emerging markets in 2011.\n\nAdvanced economies account for the bulk of global insurance. With premium income of $1.62 trillion, Europe was the most important region in 2010, followed by North America $1.41 trillion and Asia $1.16 trillion. Europe has however seen a decline in premium income during the year in contrast to the growth seen in North America and Asia. The top four countries generated more than a half of premiums. The United States and Japan alone accounted for 40% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging economies accounted for over 85% of the world's population but only around 15% of premiums. Their markets are however growing at a quicker pace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Insurance-2011-F2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105174930/http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Insurance-2011-F2.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-date=5 January 2012}}&nbsp;{{small|(365&nbsp;KB)}} p. 2</ref> The country expected to have the biggest impact on the insurance share distribution across the world is China.

This only reduces the financial burden and not the actual chances of happening of an event. Insurance is a risk for both the insurance company and the insured.  The insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform a [[risk assessment]] when writing the policy.  As a result, the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will file a claim.  If a person is financially stable and plans for life's unexpected events, they may be able to go without insurance.  However, they must have enough to cover a total and complete loss of employment and of their possessions.  Some states will accept a surety bond, a government bond, or even making a cash deposit with the state.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Moral hazard===\nAn insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk-averse as they might otherwise be (since, by definition, the insured has transferred the risk to the insurer), a concept known as [[moral hazard]]. This 'insulates' many from the\ntrue costs of living with risk, negating measures that can mitigate or adapt to risk and leading some to describe insurance schemes as potentially maladaptive.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Insurance as maladaptation: Resilience and the 'business as usual' paradox|journal = Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|volume = 34|issue = 6|date = 1 September 2015|issn = 0263-774X|pages = 1175\u20131193|doi = 10.1177/0263774X15602022|first = Paul|last = O'Hare|first2 = Iain|last2 = White|first3 = Angela|last3 = Connelly|url = https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/609056/2/OHare%20et%20al_Insurance%20as%20maladaptation.pdf}}</ref> To reduce their own financial exposure, insurance companies have contractual clauses that mitigate their obligation to provide coverage if the insured engages in behavior that grossly magnifies their risk of loss or liability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nFor example, life insurance companies may require higher premiums or deny coverage altogether to people who work in hazardous occupations or engage in dangerous sports.  Liability insurance providers do not provide coverage for liability arising from [[intentional tort]]s committed by or at the direction of the insured. Even if a provider desired to provide such coverage, it is against the public policy of most countries to allow such insurance to exist, and thus it is usually illegal.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Complexity of insurance policy contracts===\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|[[9/11]] was a major insurance loss, but there were disputes over the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]'s insurance policy]]\nInsurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees and coverages included in a policy. As a result, people may buy policies on unfavorable terms. In response to these issues, many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing every aspect of the insurance business, including minimum standards for policies and the ways in which they may be [[advertising|advertised]] and sold.\n\nFor example, most insurance policies in the English language today have been carefully drafted in [[plain English]]; the industry learned the hard way that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying. Typically, courts construe ambiguities in insurance policies against the insurance company and in favor of coverage under the policy.\n\nMany institutional insurance purchasers buy insurance through an insurance broker. While on the surface it appears the broker represents the buyer (not the insurance company), and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations, in the vast majority of cases a broker's compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium, creating a conflict of interest in that the broker's financial interest is tilted towards encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher price. A broker generally holds contracts with many insurers, thereby allowing the broker to \"shop\" the [[Market (economics)|market]] for the best rates and coverage possible.\n\nInsurance may also be purchased through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). Just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.\n\nAn independent insurance consultant advises insureds on a fee-for-service retainer, similar to an attorney, and thus offers completely independent advice, free of the financial conflict of interest of brokers or agents. However, such a consultant must still work through brokers or agents in order to secure coverage for their clients.\n\n===Limited consumer benefits===\nIn the United States, economists and consumer advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for low-probability, catastrophic losses, but not for high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select high [[deductible]]s and to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies from [[moral hazard]].<ref name=Schindler1994>Schindler, R. M.

Ringold (ed.), Chicago, IL: American Marketing Association, 147\u2013155.</ref>\n\n===Redlining===\n[[Redlining]] is the practice of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas, supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss, while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination. [[Racial profiling]] or [[redlining]] has a long history in the property insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.<ref>''Gregory D. Squires (2003)\nRacial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas'' Journal of Urban Affairs Volume 25 Issue 4 pp. 391\u2013410, November 2003</ref>\n\nIn July 2007, The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) released a report presenting the results of a study concerning credit-based [[insurance score]]s in automobile insurance. The study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk. It also showed that African-Americans and Hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores, and substantially underrepresented in the highest, while Caucasians and Asians are more evenly spread across the scores. The credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups, leading the FTC to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining. The FTC indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers.<ref name=\"FTC Study\">[http://ftc.gov/opa/2007/07/facta.shtm Credit-Based Insurance Scores: Impacts on Consumers of Automobile Insurance], Federal Trade Commission (July 2007)</ref> The report was disputed by representatives of the [[Consumer Federation of America]], the National Fair Housing Alliance, the [[National Consumer Law Center]], and the Center for Economic Justice, for relying on data provided by the insurance industry.<ref>[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/07/insurance_credit.html Consumers Dispute FTC Report on Insurance Credit Scoring] www.consumeraffairs.com (July 2007)</ref>\n\nAll states have provisions in their rate regulation laws or in their fair trade practice acts that prohibit unfair discrimination, often called redlining, in setting rates and making insurance available.<ref>{{cite web | author = Insurance Information Institute | authorlink = Insurance Information Institute | title = Issues Update: Regulation Modernization | url = http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/ratereg/ | accessdate = 11 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn determining premiums and premium rate structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location, [[credit score]]s, [[gender]], [[profession|occupation]], [[marital status]], and [[education]] level. However, the use of such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully [[discrimination|discriminatory]], and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes about the ways in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.\n\nAn insurance underwriter's job is to evaluate a given risk as to the likelihood that a loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Thus, \"discrimination\" against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment goes to the heart of the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore the [[risk premium]] must be higher to cover the greater risk.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.\n\n===Insurance patents===\n{{update|date=January 2018}}\n{{Further|Insurance patent}}\nNew assurance products can now be protected from copying with a [[business method patent]] in the [[United States]].\n\nA recent example of a new insurance product that is patented is [[Usage-based insurance|Usage Based]] [[vehicle insurance|auto insurance]]. Early versions were independently invented and patented by a major US auto insurance company, [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Auto Insurance]] ({{US patent|5797134}}) and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez ({{Cite patent|EP|0700009}}).\n\nMany independent inventors are in favor of patenting new insurance products since it gives them protection from big companies when they bring their new insurance products to market. Independent inventors account for 70% of the new U.S. patent applications in this area.\n\nMany insurance executives are opposed to patenting insurance products because it creates a new risk for them. [[The Hartford]] insurance company, for example, recently had to pay $80 million to an independent inventor, Bancorp Services, in order to settle a patent infringement and theft of trade secret lawsuit for a type of corporate owned life insurance product invented and patented by Bancorp.\n\nThere are currently about 150 new patent applications on insurance inventions filed per year in the United States. The rate at which patents have been issued has steadily risen from 15 in 2002 to 44 in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marketsandpatents.com/IPB-12152006.mht|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235655/http://www.marketsandpatents.com/IPB-12152006.mht|url-status=dead|title=(Source: Insurance IP Bulletin, December 15, 2006)|archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe first insurance patent to be granted was<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/result.html?sort=relevance&srch=top&query_txt=US6922720&submit=&patents=on|title=FPO IP Research & Communities|website=www.freepatentsonline.com}}</ref> including another example of an application posted was [https://web.archive.org/web/20090510094423/http://www.peertopatent.org/patent/20090055227/activity US2009005522 \"risk assessment company\"]. It was posted on 6 March 2009. This patent application describes a method for increasing the ease of changing insurance companies.<ref>Bakos, Nowotarski, \"[http://www.marketsandpatents.com/bulletin/IPB-12152008.html An Experiment in Better Patent Examination]\", Insurance IP Bulletin, 15 December 2008.</ref>\n\n=== Insurance on demand ===\nInsurance on demand (also IoD) is an insurance service that provides clients with insurance protection when they need, i.e. only episodic rather than on [[24/7 service|24/7]] basis as typically provided by traditional insurers (e.g. clients can purchase an insurance for one single flight rather than a longer-lasting travel insurance plan).\n\n===Insurance industry and rent-seeking===\nCertain insurance products and practices have been described as [[rent-seeking]] by critics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} That is, some insurance products or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events. Under [[United States tax law]], for example, most owners of [[annuity (US financial products)|variable annuities]] and [[variable universal life insurance|variable life insurance]] can invest their premium payments in the [[stock market]] and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason people use these products.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an [[inheritance tax|estate tax]] while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax.\n\n===Religious concerns===\nMuslim scholars have varying opinions about life insurance. Life insurance policies that earn interest (or guaranteed bonus/NAV) are generally considered to be a form of ''[[riba]]''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://islamqa.com/en/ref/8889/insurance | title = Islam Question and Answer \u2013 The true nature of insurance and the rulings concerning it | accessdate = 18 January 2010 }}</ref> ([[usury]]) and some consider even policies that do not earn interest to be a form of ''gharar'' ([[speculation]]). Some argue that ''gharar'' is not present due to the actuarial science behind the underwriting.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503543412 | title = Life Insurance from an Islamic Perspective | accessdate = 18 January 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100522222040/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&cid=1119503543412 | archive-date = 22 May 2010 |url-status = dead}}</ref>\nJewish rabbinical scholars also have expressed reservations regarding insurance as an avoidance of God's will but most find it acceptable in moderation.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.jabe.org/insurance.html\n |title        = Jewish Association for Business Ethics \u2013 Insurance\n |accessdate   = 25 March 2008\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100419131351/http://www.jabe.org/insurance.html\n |archive-date = 19 April 2010\n |url-status = dead|df           = \n}}</ref>\n\nSome Christians believe insurance represents a lack of faith<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faith-in-business.org/2016/01/insurance-a-christian-perspective/|title=Insurance: A Christian Perspective - Faith in Business|website=www.faith-in-business.org|access-date=25 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crosswalk.com/family/finances/planning/is-your-insurance-a-lack-of-faith-in-god.html|title=Should Christians Buy Insurance?|website=Crosswalk.com|access-date=25 December 2018}}</ref> and there is a long history of resistance to commercial insurance in [[Anabaptist]] communities ([[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], [[Brethren in Christ]]) but many participate in community-based self-insurance programs that spread risk within their communities.<ref>{{cite news\n |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/05/AR2006100501360.html\n |title=Amish Reluctantly Accept Donations\n |last=Rubinkam\n |first=Michael\n |newspaper=The Washington Post\n |date=5 October 2006\n |accessdate=25 March 2008\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title = The riddle of Amish culture\n|author = Donald B.

The essay suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by [[human cannibalism|selling their children as food]] to rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical [[hyperbole]] mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] policy toward the Irish in general.\n\nIn English writing, the phrase \"a [[wikt:modest proposal|modest proposal]]\" is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire.\n\n==Synopsis==\nSwift's essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the English language. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states: \"A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a [[fricassee]], or a [[ragout]].\"<ref name=\"gutenberg\" />\n\nSwift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which [[Parody|lampoon]] the then-influential [[William Petty]] and the [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] popular among followers of [[Francis Bacon]]. These lampoons include [[appeal to authority|appealing to the authority]] of \"a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London\" and \"the famous [[George Psalmanazar|Psalmanazar]], a native of the island [[Taiwan|Formosa]]\" (who had already confessed to ''not'' being from Formosa in 1706).\n\nIn the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by [[paralipsis]]:\n{{quote|Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from [[Sami people|Laplanders]], and the [[Tupi people|inhabitants of Topinamboo]]: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were [[Zealot Temple Siege|murdering one another]] at the very moment [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|their city was taken]]: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.\n\nTherefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.}}\n\n==Population solutions==\nGeorge Wittkowsky argued that Swift's main target in ''A Modest Proposal'' was not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills.<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p76\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift\u2019s Modest Proposal'', p. 76</ref> Swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution.<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p85\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift\u2019s Modest Proposal'', p. 85</ref> A memorable example of these sorts of schemes \"involved the idea of running the poor through a [[joint-stock company]]\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p85\"/> In response, Swift's ''Modest Proposal'' was \"a burlesque of projects concerning the poor\"<ref name=\"Wittkowsk_p88\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 88</ref> that were in vogue during the early 18th century.\n\n''A Modest Proposal'' also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who \"regard people as commodities\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p101\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 101</ref> In the piece, Swift adopts the \"technique of a political arithmetician\"<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p95\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 95</ref> to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.\n\nCritics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy. Edmund Wilson argues that statistically \"the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defence of crime (arrogated to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p95\"/> Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that \"springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p98\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 98</ref>\n\n==Rhetoric==\nCharles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift's specific strategy is twofold, using a \"trap\"<ref name=\"Smith_p135\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 135</ref> to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, \"details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty\" but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.<ref name=\"Smith_p136\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 136</ref> Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create \"two opposing points of view\" that \"alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way.\"<ref name=\"Smith_p136\"/>\n\nSwift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses \"the vocabulary of animal husbandry\"<ref name=\"Smith_p138\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 138</ref> to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn \"people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound\".<ref name=\"Smith_p138\"/>\n\nSwift uses the proposer's serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, textbook-approved order of argument from Swift's time (which was derived from the Latin rhetorician [[Quintilian]]).<ref name=\"Smith_p139\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 139</ref> The contrast between the \"careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme\" and \"the ridiculousness of the proposal\" create a situation in which the reader has \"to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan\".<ref name=\"Smith_p139\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nScholars have speculated about which earlier works Swift may have had in mind when he wrote ''A Modest Proposal''.\n\n===Tertullian's ''Apology''===\nJames William Johnson argues that ''A Modest Proposal'' was largely influenced and inspired by [[Tertullian]]'s ''[[Apologeticus|Apology]]'': a satirical attack against early Roman persecution of Christianity. Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.<ref name=\"Johnson_p563\">Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p. 563</ref> Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works ''A Modest Proposal'' and ''Apology''.<ref name=\"Johnson_p562\">Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p. 562</ref> In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that \"human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human\".<ref name=\"Johnson_p563\"/> Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.<ref name=\"Johnson_p563\"/> In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic \"justification by ownership\" over the subject of sacrificing children\u2014Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the English mistreatment of the Irish poor.<ref name=\"Baker_p219\">Baker, ''Tertullian and Swift's A Modest Proposal'', p. 219</ref>\n\n===Defoe's ''The Generous Projector''===\nIt has also been argued that ''A Modest Proposal'' was, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essay ''The Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Children'' by Swift's rival [[Daniel Defoe]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/021909/books1.html | title=A modest but failed proposal | work=[[Montreal Mirror]] | date=19 February 2009 | accessdate=10 January 2012 | last=Waters | first=Juliet}}</ref>\n\n=== Mandeville's ''Modest Defence of Publick Stews'' ===\n[[Bernard Mandeville]]'s ''Modest Defence of Publick Stews'' asked to introduce public and state controlled [[bordello]]s. The 1726 paper acknowledges women's interests and{{snd}}while not being a completely satirical text{{snd}}has also been discussed as an inspiration for Jonathan Swift's title.<ref name=\"hur\">Eine Streitschrift\u2026, Essay von Ursula Pia Jauch. Carl Hanser Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2001.</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2V_HAAAAQBAJ |title=Bernard Mandeville's \"A Modest Defence of Publick Stews\": Prostitution and Its Discontents in Early Georgian England |last=Primer |first=I. |date=15 March 2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781403984609}}</ref> Mandeville had by 1705 already become famous for the [[The Fable of the Bees|Fable of The Bees]] and deliberations on private vices and public benefits.\n\n=== John Locke's ''First Treatise of Government'' ===\n[[John Locke]] commented: \"Be it then as Sir Robert says, that Anciently, it was usual for Men to sell and Castrate their Children. Let it be, that they exposed them; Add to it, if you please, for this is still greater Power, ''that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them'': If this proves a right to do so, we may, by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for there are examples of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have the Principle Aggravation from this, that they cross the main intention of Nature, which willeth the increase of Mankind, and the continuation of the Species in the highest perfection, and the distinction of Families, with the Security of the Marriage Bed, as necessary thereunto\". (First Treatise, sec. 59).\n\n==Economic themes==\nRobert Phiddian's article \"Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal\" focuses on two aspects of ''A Modest Proposal'': the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that \"there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody\".<ref name=\"Phiddian_p6\">Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p. 6</ref>\n\nWhile Swift's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of \"Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet\", argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of Swift's time. Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century England. \"[I]f one regards the ''Modest Proposal'' simply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact\".<ref name=\"Phiddian_p3\">Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p. 3</ref>\n\n===\"People are the riches of a nation\"===\nAt the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that \"people are the riches of the nation\", and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.<ref name=\"Phiddian_p4\">Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p. 4</ref> Furthermore, \"in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry\". In those times, the \"somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity\".<ref name=\"Phiddian_p6\"/>\n\nLouis A. Landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the Irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to \"become a source of wealth to the nation\" or else they \"must turn to begging and thievery\".<ref name=\"Landa_p161\" /> This opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for, diversifying their professions, or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in Ireland. Landa wrote that, \"Swift is maintaining that the maxim\u2014people are the riches of a nation\u2014applies to Ireland only if Ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism\"<ref name=\"Landa_p165\" />\n\nLanda presents Swift's ''A Modest Proposal'' as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that \"people are the riches of a nation\".<ref name=\"Landa_p161\">Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p. 161</ref> Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\">Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p. 165</ref> The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\" /> Swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\" /> Swift however, Landa argues, is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that England was denying Irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\" />\n\n== The public's reaction ==\nSwift's essay created a backlash within the community after its publication. The work was aimed at the aristocracy, and they responded in turn. Several members of society wrote to Swift regarding the work. [[Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]]'s letter intimated that he certainly understood the message, and interpreted it as a work of comedy:\n\nFebruary 12, 1729\u201330:<blockquote>\"I did immediately propose it to Lady Bathurst, as your advice, particularly for her last boy, which was born the plumpest, finest thing, that could be seen; but she fell in a passion, and bid me send you word, that she would not follow your direction, but that she would breed him up to be a parson, and he should live upon the fat of the land; or a lawyer, and then, instead of being eat himself, he should devour others. You know women in passion never mind what they say; but, as she is a very reasonable woman, I have almost brought her over now to your opinion; and having convinced her, that as matters stood, we could not possibly maintain all the nine, she does begin to think it reasonable the youngest should raise fortunes for the eldest: and upon that foot a man may perform family duty with more courage and zeal; for, if he should happen to get twins, the selling of one might provide for the other. Or if, by any accident, while his wife lies in with one child, he should get a second upon the body of another woman, he might dispose of the fattest of the two, and that would help to breed up the other.</blockquote><blockquote>The more I think upon this scheme, the more reasonable it appears to me; and it ought by no means to be confined to Ireland; for, in all probability, we shall, in a very little time, be altogether as poor here as you are there. I believe, indeed, we shall carry it farther, and not confine our luxury only to the eating of children; for I happened to peep the other day into a large assembly [Parliament] not far from Westminster-hall, and I found them roasting a great fat fellow, [Walpole again] For my own part, I had not the least inclination to a slice of him; but, if I guessed right, four or five of the company had a devilish mind to be at him. Well, adieu, you begin now to wish I had ended, when I might have done it so conveniently\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HkEUAAAAYAAJ&rdid=book-HkEUAAAAYAAJ&rdot=1|title=The Works of Jonathan Swift: Containing Additional Letters, Tracts, and Poems Not Hitherto Published; with Notes and a Life of the Author|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|last2=Scott|first2=Sir Walter|date=1814|publisher=A.

It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses. Outside of the realm of English studies, ''A Modest Proposal'' is included in many comparative and global literature and history courses, as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts, humanities, and even the social sciences.\n\nThe essay's approach has been copied many times. In his book ''A Modest Proposal'' (1984), the evangelical author [[Frank Schaeffer]] emulated Swift's work in a social conservative polemic against abortion and [[euthanasia]], imagining a future [[dystopia]] that advocates [[recycling]] of aborted [[embryos]], [[fetuses]], and some disabled infants with compound intellectual, physical and physiological difficulties. (Such [[Baby Doe Rules]] cases were then a major concern of the US [[anti-abortion]] movement of the early 1980s, which viewed selective treatment of those infants as [[disability discrimination]].) In his book ''A Modest Proposal for America'' (2013), statistician [[Howard Friedman]] opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by ultra-conservatives.\n\nIn the 1998 edition of ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' by [[Margaret Atwood]] there is a quote from ''A Modest Proposal'' before the introduction.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Handmaid's Tale|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale|website=www.goodreads.com}}</ref>\n\n''A Modest Video Game Proposal'' is the title of an open letter sent by activist/former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] on 10 October 2005. He proposed that someone should \"create, manufacture, distribute, and sell a video game\" that would allow players to act out a scenario in which the game character kills video game developers.<sup>[[A Modest Video Game Proposal#cite note-ModestProposal-1|[1]]]</sup>\n\n[[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s ''[[Fear and Loathing in America|Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist]]'' includes a letter in which he uses Swift's approach in connection with the [[Vietnam War]]. Thompson writes a letter to a local [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] newspaper informing them that, on Christmas Eve, he is going to use [[napalm]] to burn a number of dogs and hopefully any humans they find. The letter protests against the burning of Vietnamese people occurring overseas.\n\nThe 2012 film ''Butcher Boys,'' written by [[Kim Henkel]], is said{{By whom|date=April 2018}} to be loosely based on Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal.'' The film's opening scene takes place in a restaurant named \"J. Swift's\".\n\nOn November 30, 2017, Jonathan Swift's 350th birthday, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a column entitled 'Why Alabamians should consider eating Democrats' babies\", by [[Alexandra Petri]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2017/11/30/why-alabamians-should-consider-eating-democrat-babies/|last=Petri|first=Alexandra|title=Why Alabamians should consider eating Democrats' babies|work=The Washington Post|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2019, [[E.

This satirical [[hyperbole]] mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] policy toward the Irish in general.\n\nIn English writing, the phrase \"a [[wikt:modest proposal|modest proposal]]\" is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire.\n\n==Synopsis==\nSwift's essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the English language. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states: \"A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a [[fricassee]], or a [[ragout]].\"<ref name=\"gutenberg\" />\n\nSwift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which [[lampoon]] the then-influential [[William Petty]] and the [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] popular among followers of [[Francis Bacon]]. These lampoons include [[appeal to authority|appealing to the authority]] of \"a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London\" and \"the famous [[George Psalmanazar|Psalmanazar]], a native of the island [[Taiwan|Formosa]]\" (who had already confessed to ''not'' being from Formosa in 1706).\n\nIn the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by [[paralipsis]]:\n{{quote|Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from [[Sami people|Laplanders]], and the [[Tupi people|inhabitants of Topinamboo]]: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were [[Zealot Temple Siege|murdering one another]] at the very moment [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|their city was taken]]: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.\n\nTherefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.}}\n\n==Population solutions==\nGeorge Wittkowsky argued that Swift's main target in ''A Modest Proposal'' was not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills.<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p76\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift\u2019s Modest Proposal'', p. 76</ref> Swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution.<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p85\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift\u2019s Modest Proposal'', p. 85</ref> A memorable example of these sorts of schemes \"involved the idea of running the poor through a [[joint-stock company]]\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p85\"/> In response, Swift's ''Modest Proposal'' was \"a burlesque of projects concerning the poor\"<ref name=\"Wittkowsk_p88\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 88</ref> that were in vogue during the early 18th century.\n\n''A Modest Proposal'' also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who \"regard people as commodities\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p101\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 101</ref> In the piece, Swift adopts the \"technique of a political arithmetician\"<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p95\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 95</ref> to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.\n\nCritics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy. Edmund Wilson argues that statistically \"the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defence of crime (arrogated to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p95\"/> Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that \"springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p98\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 98</ref>\n\n==Rhetoric==\nCharles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift's specific strategy is twofold, using a \"trap\"<ref name=\"Smith_p135\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 135</ref> to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, \"details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty\" but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.<ref name=\"Smith_p136\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 136</ref> Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create \"two opposing points of view\" that \"alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way.\"<ref name=\"Smith_p136\"/>\n\nSwift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses \"the vocabulary of animal husbandry\"<ref name=\"Smith_p138\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 138</ref> to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn \"people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound\".<ref name=\"Smith_p138\"/>\n\nSwift uses the proposer's serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, textbook-approved order of argument from Swift's time (which was derived from the Latin rhetorician [[Quintilian]]).<ref name=\"Smith_p139\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 139</ref> The contrast between the \"careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme\" and \"the ridiculousness of the proposal\" create a situation in which the reader has \"to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan\".<ref name=\"Smith_p139\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nScholars have speculated about which earlier works Swift may have had in mind when he wrote ''A Modest Proposal''.\n\n===Tertullian's ''Apology''===\nJames William Johnson argues that ''A Modest Proposal'' was largely influenced and inspired by [[Tertullian]]'s ''[[Apologeticus|Apology]]'': a satirical attack against early Roman persecution of Christianity. Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.<ref name=\"Johnson_p563\">Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p. 563</ref> Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works ''A Modest Proposal'' and ''Apology''.<ref name=\"Johnson_p562\">Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p. 562</ref> In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that \"human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human\".<ref name=\"Johnson_p563\"/> Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.<ref name=\"Johnson_p563\"/> In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic \"justification by ownership\" over the subject of sacrificing children\u2014Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the English mistreatment of the Irish poor.<ref name=\"Baker_p219\">Baker, ''Tertullian and Swift's A Modest Proposal'', p. 219</ref>\n\n===Defoe's ''The Generous Projector''===\nIt has also been argued that ''A Modest Proposal'' was, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essay ''The Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Children'' by Swift's rival [[Daniel Defoe]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/021909/books1.html | title=A modest but failed proposal | work=[[Montreal Mirror]] | date=19 February 2009 | accessdate=10 January 2012 | last=Waters | first=Juliet}}</ref>\n\n=== Mandeville's ''Modest Defence of Publick Stews'' ===\n[[Bernard Mandeville]]'s ''Modest Defence of Publick Stews'' asked to introduce public and state controlled [[bordello]]s. The 1726 paper acknowledges women's interests and{{snd}}while not being a completely satirical text{{snd}}has also been discussed as an inspiration for Jonathan Swift's title.<ref name=\"hur\">Eine Streitschrift\u2026, Essay von Ursula Pia Jauch.

Let it be, that they exposed them; Add to it, if you please, for this is still greater Power, ''that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them'': If this proves a right to do so, we may, by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for there are examples of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have the Principle Aggravation from this, that they cross the main intention of Nature, which willeth the increase of Mankind, and the continuation of the Species in the highest perfection, and the distinction of Families, with the Security of the Marriage Bed, as necessary thereunto\". (First Treatise, sec. 59).\n\n==Economic themes==\nRobert Phiddian's article \"Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal\" focuses on two aspects of ''A Modest Proposal'': the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that \"there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody\".<ref name=\"Phiddian_p6\">Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p. 6</ref>\n\nWhile Swift's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of \"Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet\", argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of Swift's time. Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century England. \"[I]f one regards the ''Modest Proposal'' simply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact\".<ref name=\"Phiddian_p3\">Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p. 3</ref>\n\n===\"People are the riches of a nation\"===\nAt the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that \"people are the riches of the nation\", and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.<ref name=\"Phiddian_p4\">Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p. 4</ref> Furthermore, \"in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry\". In those times, the \"somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity\".<ref name=\"Phiddian_p6\"/>\n\nLouis A. Landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the Irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to \"become a source of wealth to the nation\" or else they \"must turn to begging and thievery\".<ref name=\"Landa_p161\" /> This opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for, diversifying their professions, or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in Ireland. Landa wrote that, \"Swift is maintaining that the maxim\u2014people are the riches of a nation\u2014applies to Ireland only if Ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism\"<ref name=\"Landa_p165\" />\n\nLanda presents Swift's ''A Modest Proposal'' as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that \"people are the riches of a nation\".<ref name=\"Landa_p161\">Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p. 161</ref> Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\">Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p. 165</ref> The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\" /> Swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\" /> Swift however, Landa argues, is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that England was denying Irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\" />\n\n== The public's reaction ==\nSwift's essay created a backlash within the community after its publication. The work was aimed at the aristocracy, and they responded in turn. Several members of society wrote to Swift regarding the work. [[Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]]'s letter intimated that he certainly understood the message, and interpreted it as a work of comedy:\n\nFebruary 12, 1729\u201330:<blockquote>\"I did immediately propose it to Lady Bathurst, as your advice, particularly for her last boy, which was born the plumpest, finest thing, that could be seen; but she fell in a passion, and bid me send you word, that she would not follow your direction, but that she would breed him up to be a parson, and he should live upon the fat of the land; or a lawyer, and then, instead of being eat himself, he should devour others. You know women in passion never mind what they say; but, as she is a very reasonable woman, I have almost brought her over now to your opinion; and having convinced her, that as matters stood, we could not possibly maintain all the nine, she does begin to think it reasonable the youngest should raise fortunes for the eldest: and upon that foot a man may perform family duty with more courage and zeal; for, if he should happen to get twins, the selling of one might provide for the other. Or if, by any accident, while his wife lies in with one child, he should get a second upon the body of another woman, he might dispose of the fattest of the two, and that would help to breed up the other.</blockquote><blockquote>The more I think upon this scheme, the more reasonable it appears to me; and it ought by no means to be confined to Ireland; for, in all probability, we shall, in a very little time, be altogether as poor here as you are there. I believe, indeed, we shall carry it farther, and not confine our luxury only to the eating of children; for I happened to peep the other day into a large assembly [Parliament] not far from Westminster-hall, and I found them roasting a great fat fellow, [Walpole again] For my own part, I had not the least inclination to a slice of him; but, if I guessed right, four or five of the company had a devilish mind to be at him. Well, adieu, you begin now to wish I had ended, when I might have done it so conveniently\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HkEUAAAAYAAJ&rdid=book-HkEUAAAAYAAJ&rdot=1|title=The Works of Jonathan Swift: Containing Additional Letters, Tracts, and Poems Not Hitherto Published; with Notes and a Life of the Author|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|last2=Scott|first2=Sir Walter|date=1814|publisher=A.

It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses. Outside of the realm of English studies, ''A Modest Proposal'' is included in many comparative and global literature and history courses, as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts, humanities, and even the social sciences.\n\nThe essay's approach has been copied many times. In his book ''A Modest Proposal'' (1984), the evangelical author [[Frank Schaeffer]] emulated Swift's work in a social conservative polemic against abortion and [[euthanasia]], imagining a future [[dystopia]] that advocates [[recycling]] of aborted [[embryos]], [[fetuses]], and some disabled infants with compound intellectual, physical and physiological difficulties. (Such [[Baby Doe Rules]] cases were then a major concern of the US [[anti-abortion]] movement of the early 1980s, which viewed selective treatment of those infants as [[disability discrimination]].) In his book ''A Modest Proposal for America'' (2013), statistician [[Howard Friedman]] opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by ultra-conservatives.\n\nIn the 1998 edition of ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' by [[Margaret Atwood]] there is a quote from ''A Modest Proposal'' before the introduction.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Handmaid's Tale|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale|website=www.goodreads.com}}</ref>\n\n''A Modest Video Game Proposal'' is the title of an open letter sent by activist/former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] on 10 October 2005. He proposed that someone should \"create, manufacture, distribute, and sell a video game\" that would allow players to act out a scenario in which the game character kills video game developers.<sup>[[A Modest Video Game Proposal#cite note-ModestProposal-1|[1]]]</sup>\n\n[[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s ''[[Fear and Loathing in America|Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist]]'' includes a letter in which he uses Swift's approach in connection with the [[Vietnam War]]. Thompson writes a letter to a local [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] newspaper informing them that, on Christmas Eve, he is going to use [[napalm]] to burn a number of dogs and hopefully any humans they find. The letter protests against the burning of Vietnamese people occurring overseas.\n\nThe 2012 film ''Butcher Boys,'' written by [[Kim Henkel]], is said{{By whom|date=April 2018}} to be loosely based on Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal.'' The film's opening scene takes place in a restaurant named \"J. Swift's\".\n\nOn November 30, 2017, Jonathan Swift's 350th birthday, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a column entitled 'Why Alabamians should consider eating Democrats' babies\", by [[Alexandra Petri]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2017/11/30/why-alabamians-should-consider-eating-democrat-babies/|last=Petri|first=Alexandra|title=Why Alabamians should consider eating Democrats' babies|work=The Washington Post|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2019, [[E.
