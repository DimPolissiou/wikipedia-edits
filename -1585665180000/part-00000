In the past, the land has been used as a [[Ground (cricket)|cricket ground]] for the [[Prince of Wales]] and as a setting for huge dinner parties to commemorate events such as the defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nPresent day features of the Level include a grassed area with [[elm trees]] and outdoor seating, several caf\u00e9s, a [[skatepark]], a rose garden, a childrens [[playground]] and a pond.

The northern part of the [[urban park]] is a grassed area. In the middle section is a [[skatepark]]. The southern part of the park is a children's [[playground]] and also includes two cafes, public lavatories, a pavilion which can be hired for community use, a pond with a fountain, a sensory garden and a zone for [[boccia]] and [[p\u00e9tanque]].<ref name=\"BHCC\" /><ref name=\"LUC\" />\n\n[[Brighton and Hove City Council]] added The Level to their Local List of Heritage Assets in 2015.

The album was largely co-written by Little Mix, who stated that they were more involved in the development of this album than with their debut. Sonically, the album retains the [[pop music|pop]] sound of their debut album.\n\nThe album debuted at number seven in the [[Irish Albums Chart]] and number four on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was released in the US on 4 February 2014. The album became their second top ten in North America, debuting at number six on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]] and selling an estimated 40,414 copies in its first week.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"[[Move (Little Mix song)|Move]]\", made its radio premiere on 23 September 2013 and was released on 3 November 2013. It charted at number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number five on the [[Irish Singles Chart]]. Follow-up singles \"[[Little Me (song)|Little Me]]\" and \"[[Salute (song)|Salute]]\" peaked at number 14 and 6 respectively in the UK. To promote the album, Little Mix embarked on their second headlining concert tour, entitled [[The Salute Tour]] between May and July 2014. A North American extension of this tour was scheduled for September and October, but was later cancelled due the process of recording their [[Get Weird|next album]].\n\n==Background==\nIn an interview with [[Digital Spy]] in March 2013, Little Mix stated that they wanted their second album to have a more [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] sound.<ref name=\"more R&B\">{{cite news|last=Copsey|first=Robert|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a465712/little-mix-talk-next-album-it-will-be-more-rb.html|title=Exclusive: Little Mix talk next album: 'It will be more R&B'|date=14 March 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref> Band member [[Little Mix#Jesy Nelson|Jesy Nelson]] added: \"I personally want to put a lot more [[Dance music|dance]]y stuff in there.

Not that [[David Guetta]] sound, but more R&B \u2013 a bit like [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]] and [[Gwen Stefani]]'s \"[[Let Me Blow Ya Mind]]\". They also revealed that they would be starting to write material for the new album in the coming months.<ref name=\"more R&B\"/> On 19 September Little Mix held a livestream to announce that they had finished recording their second album and it was going to be sent to be mixed. In the same livestream the girls announced that the first single \"[[Move (Little Mix song)|Move]]\" would be premiered on radio on September 23. They also sang an acapella of a song that would become \"[[Little Me (song)|Little Me]]\". On 4 October, Little Mix uploaded a video to their official [[YouTube]] page, announcing that their second album would be called ''Salute'' and would be available for pre-order on 7 October.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a521198/little-mix-announce-new-album-salute-video.html|title=Little Mix announce new album 'Salute' - video|last=Corner|first=Lewis|date=4 October 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref> The album was released in the UK on 11 November 2013 and released in the US on 4 February 2014.<ref name=\"U.S. release date\"/>\n\n==Release and promotion==\nOn 4 October 2013, Little Mix uploaded a video to their official [[YouTube]] page, announcing that their second album would be called ''Salute'' and would be available for pre-order on 7 October.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The album was released on 11 November 2013 in the United Kingdom and was released in the United States 4 February 2014.<ref name=\"U.S. release date\"/>\n\nThey sang \"[[Move (Little Mix song)|Move]]\" for the first time live on 9 October at Big Gig 2013 for the [[Girlguiding]] organisation at [[Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/events-and-opportunities/regular-girlguiding-events/big-gig/past-big-gigs/|title=Past Big Gigs|website=Girlguiding|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref> On 20 October Little Mix travelled to [[Australia]], where they performed the singles \"[[Wings (Little Mix song)|Wings]]\", \"[[DNA (Little Mix song)|DNA]]\" and \"[[Change Your Life (Little Mix song)|Change Your Life]]\" in an autograph signing.
