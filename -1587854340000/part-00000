This small city is most well known for being a warm [[Tourism|vacation]] site during [[religious holiday]]s, especially for college students from [[Bogot\u00e1]] and other surrounding areas.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe town is crossed by the [[Pati River]], which sometimes floods the town.\n\n===History===\nBefore Spanish colonization, the area was home to the [[Guacana]], an [[Amerindian]] tribe belonging to the [[Panche people|Panche]] Amerindian Nation. Tocaima was named in honor of a legendary warrior from this tribe, during the ruling period of the [[Cacique|Cacica]] Guacana.\n\nIt is believed{{By whom|date=November 2010}} that Tocaima is the only city in the [[Cundinamarca Department]] that presently has a royal title and [[coat of arms]] issued by the [[Spanish Monarchy]]. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] issued the royal title and coat of arms on February 7, 1549, in appreciation of the city's loyalty and fame for being a powerful and wealthy region.\n\nIn 1581, the city was completely destroyed by an exceptionally devastating flood of the Pati River. President [[Juan Buenaventura de Borja y Armendia|Juan de Borja]] sent Captain [[Martin de Ocampo]] to refound the city, which he did on March 18, 1621 by constructing the [[Convent]] of San Jacinto and its contiguous chapel.\n\nDuring the decolonization of Colombia from Spain in 1810, Tocaima was represented in the [[electoral college|electoral]] and [[constituent assembly|constitutional college]] by jurist [[Miguel de Tobar y Zerrato]] and Don [[Juan Salvador Rodriguez de Lago]]. The [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]], or colonial administrative council, was re-established that same year.\n\nThe new [[Constitution of Cundinamarca]], created in 1815, divided the nation into [[Canton (subnational entity)|cantons]], which provoked a confrontation between the Tocaima Canton and the neighboring Canton of [[La Mesa, Cundinamarca|La Mesa]]. In 1816, Spain re-conquered the colonies and subsequently repressed the newly created government.\n\nAfter finally defeating the Spanish in 1819, the colonists declared total independence from Spain and created the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]], which\u2014led by General [[Francisco de Paula Santander|Santander]] in 1822\u2014re-established the Tocaima Canton.\n\nIn 1906, Tocaima was notable for its gold and copper mines,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n  | encyclopedia = Lippincott's New Gazetteer: A complete pronouncing gazetteer or geographical dictionary of the world, containing the most recent and authentic information respecting the countries, cities, towns ... in every portion of the globe\n  | editor-last = Heilprin\n  | editor-first = Angelo\n  | editor2-last = Heilprin\n  | editor2-first = Louis\n  | title = Tocaima\n  | page = 1840\n  | volume = 2\n  | publisher = J.

This small city is most well known for being a warm [[Tourism|vacation]] site during [[religious holiday]]s, especially for college students from [[Bogot\u00e1]] and other surrounding areas.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe town is crossed by the [[Pati River]], which sometimes floods the town.\n\n===History===\nBefore Spanish colonization, the area was home to the [[Guacana]], an [[Amerindian]] tribe belonging to the [[Panche people|Panche]] Amerindian Nation. Tocaima was named in honor of a legendary warrior from this tribe, during the ruling period of the [[Cacique|Cacica]] Guacana.\n\nIt is believed{{By whom|date=November 2010}} that Tocaima is the only city in the [[Cundinamarca Department]] that presently has a royal title and [[coat of arms]] issued by the [[Spanish Monarchy]]. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] issued the royal title and coat of arms on February 7, 1549, in appreciation of the city's loyalty and fame for being a powerful and wealthy region.\n\nIn 1581, the city was completely destroyed by an exceptionally devastating flood of the Pati River. President [[Juan Buenaventura de Borja y Armendia|Juan de Borja]] sent Captain [[Martin de Ocampo]] to refound the city, which he did on March 18, 1621 by constructing the [[Convent]] of San Jacinto and its contiguous chapel.\n\nDuring the decolonization of Colombia from Spain in 1810, Tocaima was represented in the [[electoral college|electoral]] and [[constituent assembly|constitutional college]] by jurist [[Miguel de Tobar y Zerrato]] and Don [[Juan Salvador Rodriguez de Lago]]. The [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]], or colonial administrative council, was re-established that same year.\n\nThe new [[Constitution of Cundinamarca]], created in 1815, divided the nation into [[Canton (subnational entity)|cantons]], which provoked a confrontation between the Tocaima Canton and the neighboring Canton of [[La Mesa, Cundinamarca|La Mesa]]. In 1816, Spain re-conquered the colonies and subsequently repressed the newly created government.\n\nAfter finally defeating the Spanish in 1819, the colonists declared total independence from Spain and created the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]], which\u2014led by General [[Francisco de Paula Santander|Santander]] in 1822\u2014re-established the Tocaima Canton.\n\nIn 1906, Tocaima was notable for its gold and copper mines,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n  | encyclopedia = Lippincott's New Gazetteer: A complete pronouncing gazetteer or geographical dictionary of the world, containing the most recent and authentic information respecting the countries, cities, towns ... in every portion of the globe\n  | editor-last = Heilprin\n  | editor-first = Angelo\n  | editor2-last = Heilprin\n  | editor2-first = Louis\n  | title = Tocaima\n  | page = 1840\n  | volume = 2\n  | publisher = J.

In 2011, just months after I reported the [[Arab Spring]] extensively and [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden's death]] I decided to go on [[Hajj]]. This would be my Hajj of defiance\u2014and if found out I faced certain beheading. But as a filmmaker I knew this would be the greatest journey of my life and there was no way I would not film it. It was historic, you are not permitted to film in Mecca according to [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] theology (even though short [[YouTube]] videos proliferate) but I did. Many shut their doors on me. Many foundations who had embraced Jihad were too afraid of this. In any case a three-year struggle ensued and we had another world first\u2014 A Sinner in Mecca, a film in Mecca and Medina shot entirely on an [[iPhone]]. Then I began writing the book that would say everything the film was not able to. That became A Sinner in Mecca: A Gay Muslim's Hajj of Defiance.

In 2011, just months after I reported the [[Arab Spring]] extensively and [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden's death]] I decided to go on [[Hajj]]. This would be my Hajj of defiance\u2014and if found out I faced certain beheading. But as a filmmaker I knew this would be the greatest journey of my life and there was no way I would not film it. It was historic, you are not permitted to film in Mecca according to [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] theology (even though short [[YouTube]] videos proliferate) but I did. Many shut their doors on me. Many foundations who had embraced Jihad were too afraid of this. In any case a three-year struggle ensued and we had another world first\u2014 A Sinner in Mecca, a film in Mecca and Medina shot entirely on an [[iPhone]]. Then I began writing the book that would say everything the film was not able to. That became A Sinner in Mecca: A Gay Muslim's Hajj of Defiance.
