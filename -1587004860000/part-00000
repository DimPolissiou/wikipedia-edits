There are two models: the A4000/040 released in October 1992 with a [[Motorola 68040]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], and the A4000/030 released in April 1993 with a [[Motorola 68EC030]].\n\nThe Amiga 4000 system design was generally similar to the A3000's, but introduced the [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) chipset with enhanced graphics. The [[SCSI]] system from previous Amigas was replaced by the lower-cost [[Parallel ATA]].\n\nThe original A4000 is housed in a beige horizontal desktop box with a separate keyboard. Later, Commodore released an expanded tower version called the [[Amiga 4000T|A4000T]].\n\n==Technical information==\n\n=== Processor and RAM ===\nThe stock A4000 shipped with either a [[Motorola 68EC030]] or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], 2&nbsp;MB of [[Amiga Chip RAM]] and up to 16&nbsp;MB of additional RAM in 32-bit [[SIMM]]s.<ref name=\"a4000_user\">{{citation | url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613032230/http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-06-13 | title=A4000 User's Guide | publisher=Commodore Electronics Limited | year=1992 }}</ref> There is a non-functional jumper that was intended to expand the \"chip RAM\" to 8MB.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/amiga/a4000jumpers.html | title=A4000 Motherboard Jumpers | accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Later, third-party developers created various CPU expansion boards featuring higher rated [[Motorola 68040|68040]], [[Motorola 68060|68060]] and [[PowerPC]] CPUs. Such hardware also typically offers faster and higher capacity RAM (128&nbsp;MB or greater).\n\n===A4000-CR version===\nUnlike previous Amiga models, early A4000 machines have the CPU mounted in an expansion board; the [[motherboard]] does not have an integrated CPU. Later revisions of the A4000 have the CPU and 2&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] RAM [[surface-mount technology|surface-mounted]] on the motherboard in an effort to reduce costs. These machines are known as the A4000-CR (cost-reduced) and the surface-mounted CPU is a 68EC030. The cost-reduced models also make use of a non-rechargeable lithium battery for real-time clock battery backup rather than a rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|NiCad battery]]. The NiCad backup battery is one of the most common causes of problems in an aging device that uses one because it has a tendency to eventually leak. The released fluids are somewhat corrosive and can eventually damage the circuitry.\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nThe A4000 is the first Amiga model to have shipped with Commodore's third-generation Amiga chipset, the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA). As the name implies, AGA introduces improved graphical abilities, specifically, a palette expanded from 12-bit color depth (4096 colors) to 24-bit (16.8 million colors) and new 64, 128, 256 and 262,144 ([[hold-and-modify|HAM-8]]) color modes. Unlike earlier Amiga chipsets, all color modes are available at all display resolutions. AGA also improves sprite capacity and graphics performance. The on-board sound hardware remains identical to that of the original Amiga chipset (the [[original Amiga chipset#Audio features in general|Paula sound chip]]), namely, four [[direct memory access|DMA]]-driven 8-bit [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.\n\n===Peripherals and expansion===\nThe A4000 has a number of Amiga-specific connectors including two [[DE-9 connector|DE-9]] ports for [[joystick]]s, [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], and [[light pen]]s, a standard 25-pin [[RS-232]] [[serial port]] and a 25-pin [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]]. As a result, at launch the A4000 was compatible with many existing Amiga peripherals, such as, [[MIDI]] devices, serial [[modem]]s and [[sampling (signal processing)|sound samplers]].<ref name=\"a4000_user\"/>\n\nLike the just-earlier Amiga model, the [[Amiga 3000|3000]], the A4000 has four internal 32-bit [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion slots. This expansion bus allows the use of devices which comply with the [[AutoConfig]] standard, such as graphic cards, audio cards, network cards, SCSI controllers, and later even [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] controllers.<ref name=\"zorro3\">{{citation | url=http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | title=The Zorro III Bus Specification | first=Dave | last=Haynie | date=20 March 1991 | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | access-date=2 September 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212151/http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | archive-date=16 July 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> One of the most notable hardware items of the era is the [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] system which became popular in the 1990s for amateur and commercial [[desktop video]] production of [[standard-definition]] [[broadcast quality]] video, consisting of tools for [[vision mixer|video switching]], [[chroma key]]ing, [[character generator|character generation]], [[animation]], and [[image manipulation]].\n\nThe three [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots can be activated by use of a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board [[IBM PC Compatible|IBM-PC-compatible]] hardware, including [[Intel 80286]], [[80386]], or [[80486]] microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. Compatible ISA cards may then be installed into the two remaining ISA slots.\n\nLater, in an effort to offer modern expansion options third-party developers created replacement expansion boards for the A4000 which provide [[peripheral component interconnect|PCI]] slots allowing use of higher performance and widely available PCI hardware, such as graphic, sound, and network cards.\n\n===Operating System===\nThe A4000 shipped with [[AmigaOS version history#Amiga_OS_3.0,_3.1|AmigaOS 3.0]], consisting of Workbench 3.0 and [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 3.0, which together provide a single-user multi-tasking operating system and support for the built-in hardware. Following release of AmigaOS 3.1 it became possible to upgrade the A4000 by installing compatible Kickstart 3.1 ROM chips. The later AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 releases were software-only updates requiring Kickstart 3.1.\n\n[[AmigaOS 4]], a [[PowerPC]]-native release of the operating system, can be used with the A4000 provided a [[PowerUP (accelerator)#CyberStorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]] board is installed. Likewise, [[MorphOS]], an alternative Amiga-compatible operating system, can be used with this hardware.\n\nVariants of platform-independent operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] can also be used with the A4000.\n\n[[File:A4000 \u00f6ppen.png|right|thumb|Amiga 4000 with case open]]\n[[File:Amiga A3200 A3400 CPU card.jpg|thumb|Amiga A3200/A3400 CPU card]]\n\n===Specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

However, it does not identify the specific subtypes, so it cannot be used to match the person with the environmental source of infection. The ''Legionella'' bacteria can be cultured from sputum or other respiratory samples. ''Legionella'' spp. stain poorly with Gram stain, stains positive with silver, and is cultured on charcoal yeast extract with iron and cysteine ([[CYE agar]]).\n\nA significant under-reporting problem occurs with legionellosis. Even in countries with effective health services and readily available diagnostic testing, about 90% of cases of Legionnaires' disease are missed. This is partly due to the disease being a relatively rare form of pneumonia, which many clinicians may not have encountered before, thus may misdiagnose. A further issue is that people with legionellosis can present with a wide range of symptoms, some of which (such as diarrhea) may distract clinicians from making a correct diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Makin, T |title=Legionella bacteria and solar pre-heating of water for domestic purposes |journal=UK Water Regulations Advisory Scheme Report |page=4 |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305211608/https://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nAlthough the risk of Legionnaires' disease being spread by large-scale water systems cannot be eliminated, it can be greatly reduced by writing and enforcing a highly detailed, systematic [[water safety plan]] appropriate for the specific  facility involved (office building, hospital, hotel, spa, cruise ship, etc.)<ref name=\"WHO 2007\"/> Some of the elements that such a plan may include are:\n* Keep water temperature either above or below the {{convert|20|-|50|C}} range in which the ''Legionella'' bacterium thrives.\n* Prevent [[Water stagnation|stagnation]], for example, by removing from a network of pipes any sections that have no outlet (dead ends). Where stagnation is unavoidable, as when a wing of a hotel is closed for the off-season, systems must be thoroughly disinfected just prior to resuming normal operation.\n* Prevent the buildup of [[biofilm]], for example, by not using (or by replacing) construction materials that encourage its development, and by reducing the quantity of nutrients for bacterial growth that enter the system.\n* Periodically disinfect the system, by high heat or a chemical [[biocide]], and use [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] where appropriate.

Current treatments of choice are the respiratory tract quinolones ([[levofloxacin]], [[moxifloxacin]], [[gemifloxacin]]) or newer macrolides ([[azithromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], [[roxithromycin]]). The antibiotics used most frequently have been levofloxacin, [[doxycycline]], and azithromycin.\n\nMacrolides (azithromycin) are used in all age groups, while tetracyclines (doxycycline) are prescribed for children above the age of 12 and quinolones (levofloxacin) above the age of 18. [[Rifampicin]] can be used in combination with a quinolone or macrolide. Whether rifampicin is an effective antibiotic to take for treatment is uncertain. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] does not recommend the use of rifampicin with added regimens. Tetracyclines and [[erythromycin]] led to improved outcomes compared to other antibiotics in the original American Legion outbreak. These antibiotics are effective because they have excellent intracellular penetration in ''Legionella''-infected cells.

However, it does not identify the specific subtypes, so it cannot be used to match the person with the environmental source of infection. The ''Legionella'' bacteria can be cultured from sputum or other respiratory samples. ''Legionella'' spp. stain poorly with Gram stain, stains positive with silver, and is cultured on charcoal yeast extract with iron and cysteine ([[CYE agar]]).\n\nA significant under-reporting problem occurs with legionellosis. Even in countries with effective health services and readily available diagnostic testing, about 90% of cases of Legionnaires' disease are missed. This is partly due to the disease being a relatively rare form of pneumonia, which many clinicians may not have encountered before, thus may misdiagnose. A further issue is that people with legionellosis can present with a wide range of symptoms, some of which (such as diarrhea) may distract clinicians from making a correct diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Makin, T |title=Legionella bacteria and solar pre-heating of water for domestic purposes |journal=UK Water Regulations Advisory Scheme Report |page=4 |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305211608/https://www.wras.co.uk/PDF_Files/Preheated_Water_Report.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nAlthough the risk of Legionnaires' disease being spread by large-scale water systems cannot be eliminated, it can be greatly reduced by writing and enforcing a highly detailed, systematic [[water safety plan]] appropriate for the specific  facility involved (office building, hospital, hotel, spa, cruise ship, etc.)<ref name=\"WHO 2007\"/> Some of the elements that such a plan may include are:\n* Keep water temperature either above or below the {{convert|20|-|50|C}} range in which the ''Legionella'' bacterium thrives.\n* Prevent [[Water stagnation|stagnation]], for example, by removing from a network of pipes any sections that have no outlet (dead ends). Where stagnation is unavoidable, as when a wing of a hotel is closed for the off-season, systems must be thoroughly disinfected just prior to resuming normal operation.\n* Prevent the buildup of [[biofilm]], for example, by not using (or by replacing) construction materials that encourage its development, and by reducing the quantity of nutrients for bacterial growth that enter the system.\n* Periodically disinfect the system, by high heat or a chemical [[biocide]], and use [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] where appropriate.

Current treatments of choice are the respiratory tract quinolones ([[levofloxacin]], [[moxifloxacin]], [[gemifloxacin]]) or newer macrolides ([[azithromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], [[roxithromycin]]). The antibiotics used most frequently have been levofloxacin, [[doxycycline]], and azithromycin.\n\nMacrolides (azithromycin) are used in all age groups, while tetracyclines (doxycycline) are prescribed for children above the age of 12 and quinolones (levofloxacin) above the age of 18. [[Rifampicin]] can be used in combination with a quinolone or macrolide. Whether rifampicin is an effective antibiotic to take for treatment is uncertain. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] does not recommend the use of rifampicin with added regimens. Tetracyclines and [[erythromycin]] led to improved outcomes compared to other antibiotics in the original American Legion outbreak. These antibiotics are effective because they have excellent intracellular penetration in ''Legionella''-infected cells. The recommended treatment is 5\u201310 days of levofloxacin or 3\u20135 days of azithromycin, but in people who are immunocompromised, have severe disease, or other pre-existing health conditions, longer antibiotic use may be necessary.<ref name=\"pmid26231463\"/> During outbreaks, prophylactic antibiotics have been used to prevent Legionnaires' disease in high-risk individuals who have possibly been exposed.<ref name=\"pmid26231463\"/>\n\nThe mortality at the original American Legion convention in 1976 was high (29 deaths in 182 infected individuals<ref name=Winn1988>{{cite journal |vauthors=Winn WC |title=Legionnaires disease: Historical perspective |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=60\u201381 |year=1988 |pmid=3060246 |pmc=358030 |doi=10.1128/cmr.1.1.60}}</ref>) because the antibiotics used (including [[penicillin]]s, [[cephalosporin]]s, and [[aminoglycoside]]s) had poor intracellular penetration.

The 1972 film was produced by [[M.J. Frankovich]], released by [[Columbia Pictures]], directed by [[Milton Katselas]] and adapted for the screen by Gershe. It was released on 6 July 1972 in the USA. The film is about a woman, Jill Tanner, who moves into an apartment beside a blind man, Don Baker, who has recently moved out on his own. The two become attracted and move in together, but Don's mother tries to end the romance, fearing that Jill will break her son's heart. Jill goes along with the suggestion, and tries to break off the relationship, but finally they are reconciled.\n\n[[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Edward Albert]] starred. [[Eileen Heckart]] received an [[Academy Award]] for her performance. While the original play was set in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City|New York]], the screenplay written for the 1972 film was set in an unknown location in [[San Francisco]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the San Francisco of the 1970s, Don Baker, who was born blind, has lived all his life with his mother. When Don was young, Mrs. Baker wrote a popular series of children\u2019s books about Little Donny Dark, a blind boy who performs heroic deeds. Don moves out into an apartment on his own, but finds himself all alone. He has made a contract that his mother will not come to see him for at least two months.\n\nOne month has passed. This is when Jill Tanner moves into an adjoining apartment. She listens to Don talking to his mother over the phone and turns on the radio. When Don asks her to turn the volume down, she invites herself over for a cup of coffee. They start talking and find each other friendly. Jill does not realize that Don is blind until she sees him dropping his cigarette ash on the table. Jill has never met a blind man before, so she asks all sorts of questions about how Don manages everyday chores.\n\nJill tells Don that her favorite quote is: \"I only ask to be free. The butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies.\" (From [[Dickens]]' ''[[Bleak House]]''.)  She takes him to Asparagus, a bohemian clothing store, where owner Roy helps them pick out some free-spirited fashion. Back home, Don makes up a song and starts to sing \"Butterflies Are Free\" on his guitar. They discover they can unlock the door separating their two apartments.\n\nSurprising Don with a visit, Mrs. Baker sees that Don has attached himself to Jill. She also encounters them in the apartment partially undressed. She fears that Jill will break Don's heart. She takes Jill out for a lunch and tries to talk her out of Don's life. Jill has strong feelings for Don and tells Mrs. Baker that if there is someone who should get out of Don's life, it is she.\n\nFollowing Mrs. Baker's input, Jill later breaks a dinner date at Don's apartment, showing up much later with Ralph, the director of the play she has auditioned for. Jill hesitantly announces that she is moving in with Ralph, trying too hard to convince Don, and herself, that it is a great idea.\n\nWhen Jill goes to pack her things, a heartbroken Don asks his mother if he can move back home. She talks him out of it, pointing out that her Little Donny Dark books had been her way of helping young Don face his fears, and she (sadly) must do the same now. They finally make peace over their new roles in life. Jill and Don fight over her moving out, and Don tells her she is the one who is disabled. She leaves but returns to Don, and the two reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n <!--- Cast per closing credits order, with roles as credited --->\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Jill\n* [[Edward Albert]] as Don\n* [[Eileen Heckart]] as Mrs. Baker\n* [[Paul Michael Glaser|Michael Glaser]] as Ralph\n* [[Michael Warren (actor)|Michael Warren]] as Roy\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Although the setting has been changed from New York to San Francisco for no apparent reason, Leonard Gershe's screen adaptation of his successful Broadway play ... is an excellent example of how to switch from one medium to another without sacrificing any of the qualities which makes the original version such a success.\"<ref name=\"variety\">\"Film Reviews: Butterflies Are Free\".

The 1972 film was produced by [[M.J. Frankovich]], released by [[Columbia Pictures]], directed by [[Milton Katselas]] and adapted for the screen by Gershe. It was released on 6 July 1972 in the USA. The film is about a woman, Jill Tanner, who moves into an apartment beside a blind man, Don Baker, who has recently moved out on his own. The two become attracted and move in together, but Don's mother tries to end the romance, fearing that Jill will break her son's heart. Jill goes along with the suggestion, and tries to break off the relationship, but finally they are reconciled.\n\n[[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Edward Albert]] starred. [[Eileen Heckart]] received an [[Academy Award]] for her performance. While the original play was set in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City|New York]], the screenplay written for the 1972 film was set in an unknown location in [[San Francisco]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the San Francisco of the 1970s, Don Baker, who was born blind, has lived all his life with his mother. When Don was young, Mrs. Baker wrote a popular series of children\u2019s books about Little Donny Dark, a blind boy who performs heroic deeds. Don moves out into an apartment on his own, but finds himself all alone. He has made a contract that his mother will not come to see him for at least two months.\n\nOne month has passed. This is when Jill Tanner moves into an adjoining apartment. She listens to Don talking to his mother over the phone and turns on the radio. When Don asks her to turn the volume down, she invites herself over for a cup of coffee. They start talking and find each other friendly. Jill does not realize that Don is blind until she sees him dropping his cigarette ash on the table. Jill has never met a blind man before, so she asks all sorts of questions about how Don manages everyday chores.\n\nJill tells Don that her favorite quote is: \"I only ask to be free. The butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies.\" (From [[Dickens]]' \"[[Bleak House]]\").  She takes him to Asparagus, a bohemian clothing store, where owner Roy helps them pick out some free-spirited fashion. Back home, Don makes up a song and starts to sing \"Butterflies are Free\" on his guitar. They discover they can unlock the door separating their two apartments.\n\nSurprising Don with a visit, Mrs. Baker sees that Don has attached himself to Jill. She also encounters them in the apartment partially undressed. She fears that Jill will break Don's heart. She takes Jill out for a lunch and tries to talk her out of Don's life. Jill has strong feelings for Don and tells Mrs. Baker that if there is someone who should get out of Don's life, it is she.\n\nFollowing Mrs. Baker's input, Jill later breaks a dinner date at Don's apartment, showing up much later with Ralph, the director of the play she has auditioned for. Jill hesitantly announces that she is moving in with Ralph, trying too hard to convince Don, and herself, that it is a great idea.\n\nWhen Jill goes to pack her things, a heartbroken Don asks his mother if he can move back home. She talks him out of it, pointing out that her Little Donny Dark books had been her way of helping young Don face his fears, and she (sadly) must do the same now. They finally make peace over their new roles in life. Jill and Don fight over her moving out, and Don tells her she is the one who is disabled. She leaves but returns to Don, and the two reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n <!--- Cast per closing credits order, with roles as credited --->\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Jill\n* [[Edward Albert]] as Don\n* [[Eileen Heckart]] as Mrs. Baker\n* [[Paul Michael Glaser|Michael Glaser]] as Ralph\n* [[Michael Warren (actor)|Michael Warren]] as Roy\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Although the setting has been changed from New York to San Francisco for no apparent reason, Leonard Gershe's screen adaptation of his successful Broadway play ... is an excellent example of how to switch from one medium to another without sacrificing any of the qualities which makes the original version such a success.\"<ref name=\"variety\">\"Film Reviews: Butterflies Are Free\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.

Part IV, p. 1.</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that \"one of the attractive aspects of 'Butterflies Are Free' is that each of the three characters is incomplete and flawed.

''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 5.</ref> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated, \"While the material is essentially shallow and often insufferable in its sentimental opportunism, Gershe and Katselas demonstrate some theatrical talent and mechanical aptitude ... The play itself is nothing to brag about, but I doubt if one could transpose it much more adroitly and presentably. Instead of inflating or vulgarising this frail property, Katselas tries to keep it intimate and engaging.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (July 13, 1972). \"'Butterflies' Shallow but Diverting\".
