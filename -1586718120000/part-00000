The group comprises [[KSI (entertainer)|JJ Olatunji]], Simon Minter, Josh Bradley, Tobi Brown, Ethan Payne, Vik Barn, and Harry Lewis, also known by their [[Pseudonym|online aliases]] KSI, Miniminter, Zerkaa, Tobjizzle, Behzinga, Vikkstar123, and W2S, respectively. They produce online videos consisting of challenges, game-show formats and [[Let's Play|video game commentaries]], as well as selling exclusive merchandise.\n\nFounded on 19 October 2013 as an informal gaming group, the group recorded gameplays and challenges together which the members would upload to their respective channels. As their channels grew, the group began producing a wider variety of videos and other projects and, since 2018, has published primarily on their combined channels, Sidemen and MoreSidemen. {{As of|2020|3}}, their eponymous YouTube channel has over 7.6 million subscribers.<ref name=\"SidemenStats\">{{Cite web |url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCDogdKl7t7NHzQ95aEwkdMw |title=Sidemen's YouTube Stats |website=[[Social Blade]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830020618/https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCDogdKl7t7NHzQ95aEwkdMw |archive-date=30 August 2019 |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the members knew each other before the group was formed: Josh Bradley and Tobi Brown both attended [[Bexley Grammar School]] in London, and [[KSI (entertainer)|JJ Olatunji]] and Simon Minter both attended [[Berkhamsted School]] in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=\"SidemenBook\">{{Cite book |last=The Sidemen |title=Sidemen: The Book |date=18 October 2016 |publisher=[[Coronet Books]] |isbn=978-1473648166 |pages=52\u201357}}</ref>\n\nThe group was informally created on 19 October 2013, when Olatunji, Minter, Bradley, Brown, and Ethan Payne formed a [[Rockstar Games Social Club]] group called '''The Ultimate Sidemen''' in the then-recently released ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]''; Vik Barn joined the group soon afterwards.
