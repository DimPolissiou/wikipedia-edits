{"title_page": "Claudin de Sermisy", "text_new": "'''Claudin de Sermisy''' (c. 1490 &ndash; 13 October 1562) was a [[France|French]] composer of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]].<ref name=G>Isabelle Cazeaux, \"Claudin d Sermisy\", \"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", ed. Stanley Sadie. 20 vol.  (London, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., 1980).</ref>  Along with [[Cl\u00e9ment Janequin]] he was one of the most renowned composers of French [[chanson]]s in the early 16th century; in addition he was a significant composer of sacred music.  His music was both influential on, and influenced by, contemporary [[Italy|Italian]] styles.\n\n==Biography==\nSermisy was most likely born either in [[Picardy]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], or [[\u00cele-de-France]], based on the similarity of his surname to place names there.<ref name=G/> Sometime in his early life he may have studied with [[Josquin des Prez]], if [[Pierre Ronsard]] is to be believed, but many musicologists consider the claim unreliable; at any rate he absorbed some of the older composer's musical ideas either early, or later, as he became acquainted with his music.  Josquin was possibly at the French court between 1501 and about 1503, though this has never been definitely established, so a master-pupil relationship would have been possible then; Sermisy's whereabouts before 1508 are not known, but presence at the Royal Chapel was certainly possible.\n\nIn 1508 the young Sermisy was appointed as a singer in the Royal Chapel of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], where he was also a cleric.<ref name=C>Gustave Reese, \"Music in the Renaissance\". (New York, W.W. Norton & Co., 1954)</ref>  His birthdate is inferred from the date he joined the royal chapel; 18 was about the right age for such an appointment.  In 1515 he went to Italy with [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], and in 1520 he was part of the musical festivities arranged by Francis I and [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]], directed by [[Jean Mouton]], where he was almost certainly a singer.<ref name=C/>  He may have been a composer of some of the music there as well.  In 1532 he also participated in the similar meeting between the kings at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], for which he wrote a ceremonial motet.\n\nFor a while in the early 1520s Sermisy was a canon at Notre-Dame-de-la-Rotonde in [[Rouen]], but he left there in 1524 to take a similar position in [[Amiens]].  By 1532 he was music director of the Royal Chapel, still under Francis I, who reigned until 1547.  At this post he was expected to teach and care for the boys of the choir, as well as find talented singers to recruit.  In 1533, in addition to his post at the Royal Chapel, he became a canon of the [[Sainte-Chapelle (choir)|Sainte-Chapelle]], which would have required him to live in [[Paris]].  He acquired a large house there, large enough to shelter refugees from the church in [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|St Quentin]] when the Spanish sacked their city in 1559.  In 1554 he also was given a [[prebend]] at Ste Catherine in [[Troyes]].  Few biographical details are available about his last years, but he seems to have been active as a composer up to the end of his life based on publication dates of works.  He was buried in the Sainte-Chapelle.<ref name=G/>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Sacred music===\nSermisy wrote both sacred music and secular music, and all of it is for voices.  Of his sacred music, 12 complete [[mass (music)|masses]] have survived, including a [[Requiem]] mass, as well as approximately 100 [[motet]]s, some [[magnificat]]s and a set of [[Lamentations (music)|Lamentations]].  Unlike many of his contemporaries writing sacred music in France, there is no evidence he had any [[Huguenot]] sympathies; he seemed to remain a faithful [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] all his life.\n\nHis interest in the sacred genres increased steadily throughout his life, corresponding to a decline in interest in secular forms, using the publication dates as a guide (actual dates of compositions are extremely difficult to establish for composers of this period, unless a work happened to be composed for a specific occasion).  Since the prevailing style of [[polyphony]] among contemporary composers during his late career was dense, seamless, with pervasive [[imitation (music)|imitation]], as typified in the music of [[Jean Mouton|Mouton]] and [[Nicolas Gombert|Gombert]], it is significant that he tended to avoid this style, preferring clearer textures and short phrases: a style more akin to the [[chanson]]s he wrote earlier in his career.  In addition he varied the texture in his composition by alternating [[polyphony|polyphonic]] passages with [[homophony|homorhythmic]], chordal ones, much like the texture found in his secular music.\n\nSermisy wrote two of the few polyphonic settings of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] found in French music of the period; the musical setting is simple, compared to his masses and motets, and he strove to make the words clearly understandable.  The gospels chosen were those of [[St. Matthew]] and [[John the Apostle|St. John]]. Sermisy's settings were published in the 10th volume of Motets published by [[Pierre Attaignant]].\n\n===Chansons===\nBy far Sermisy's most famous contribution to music literature is his output of chansons, of which there are approximately 175.  They are similar to those of [[Clement Janequin|Janequin]], although less programmatic; his style in these works has also been described as more graceful and polished than that of the rival composer.<ref>Harold Gleason and Warren Becker, ''Music in the Middle Ages and Renaissance'' (Music Literature Outlines Series I), p. 112.  Bloomington, Indiana.  Frangipani Press, 1986.  {{ISBN|0-89917-034-X}}</ref> Typically Sermisy's chansons are chordal and syllabic, shunning the more ostentatious polyphony of composers from the Netherlands, striving for lightness and grace instead.  Sermisy was fond of quick repeated notes, which give the texture an overall lightness and dance-like quality.  Another stylistic trait seen in many of Sermisy's chansons is an initial rhythmic figure consisting of long-short-short (minim-crotchet-crotchet, or half-quarter-quarter), a figure which was to become the defining characteristic of the [[canzona]] later in the century.\n\nThe texts Sermisy chose were usually from contemporary poets, such as [[Cl\u00e9ment Marot]] (he set more verse by Marot than any other composer).  Typical topics were unrequited love, nature, and drinking.  Several of his songs are on the topic of an unhappy young woman stuck with an unattractive and unvirile old man, a sentiment not unique to his age.<ref name=G/>\n\nMost of his chansons are for four voices, though he wrote some for three early in his career, before four-voice writing became the norm.  Influence from the Italian [[frottola]] is evident, and Sermisy's chansons themselves influenced Italian composers, since his music was reprinted numerous times both in France and in other parts of Europe.\n\n==Influence==\nSermisy was well known throughout western Europe, and copies of his music are found in Italy, Spain, Portugal, England and elsewhere.

Sermisy's music was transcribed numerous times for instruments, including [[viol]]s and [[lute]] as well as [[organ (music)|organ]] and other keyboard instruments, by performers from Italy, Germany, and Poland in addition to France.  Even though Sermisy was a Catholic, many of his tunes were appropriated by Protestant musicians in the next generation:  even a [[Lutheran chorale]] tune (\"[[Was mein Gott will, das g'scheh allzeit]]\") is based on a chanson by Sermisy (''Il me suffit de tous mes maulx'').<ref name=G/>\n\n==Compositions==\n\n===Chansons===\n\n*''Au joly boys''\n*''Aupres de vous secretement'' (two parts)\n*''C'est une dure departie''\n*''Changeons propos, c'est trop chante d'amours''\n*''Content desir, qui cause ma douleur''\n*''En entrant en ung jardin'' (publ. 1529)\n*''Languir me fais''\n*''Si mon malheur my continue''\n*''Si vous m'aimez''\n*''Tant que vivray'' (publ. 1527)\n*''Tu disais que j'en mourrais''\n*''Vignon, vignon, vignon, vignette''\n*''Vive la serpe''\n\n===Motets===\n*''Aspice, Domine''\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n*Isabelle Cazeaux, \"Claudin de Sermisy\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', ed.

Stanley Sadie. 20 vol.  (London, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., 1980).</ref>  Along with [[Cl\u00e9ment Janequin]] he was one of the most renowned composers of French [[chanson]]s in the early 16th century; in addition he was a significant composer of sacred music.  His music was both influential on, and influenced by, contemporary [[Italy|Italian]] styles.\n\n==Biography==\nSermisy was most likely born either in [[Picardy]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], or [[\u00cele-de-France]], based on the similarity of his surname to place names there.<ref name=G/> Sometime in his early life he may have studied with [[Josquin des Prez]], if [[Pierre Ronsard]] is to be believed, but many musicologists consider the claim unreliable; at any rate he absorbed some of the older composer's musical ideas either early, or later, as he became acquainted with his music.  Josquin was possibly at the French court between 1501 and about 1503, though this has never been definitely established, so a master-pupil relationship would have been possible then; Sermisy's whereabouts before 1508 are not known, but presence at the Royal Chapel was certainly possible.\n\nIn 1508 the young Sermisy was appointed as a singer in the Royal Chapel of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], where he was also a cleric.<ref name=C>Gustave Reese, \"Music in the Renaissance\". (New York, W.W. Norton & Co., 1954)</ref>  His birthdate is inferred from the date he joined the royal chapel; 18 was about the right age for such an appointment.  In 1515 he went to Italy with [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], and in 1520 he was part of the musical festivities arranged by Francis I and [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]], directed by [[Jean Mouton]], where he was almost certainly a singer.<ref name=C/>  He may have been a composer of some of the music there as well.  In 1532 he also participated in the similar meeting between the kings at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], for which he wrote a ceremonial motet.\n\nFor a while in the early 1520s Sermisy was a canon at Notre-Dame-de-la-Rotonde in [[Rouen]], but he left there in 1524 to take a similar position in [[Amiens]].  By 1532 he was music director of the Royal Chapel, still under Francis I, who reigned until 1547.  At this post he was expected to teach and care for the boys of the choir, as well as find talented singers to recruit.  In 1533, in addition to his post at the Royal Chapel, he became a canon of the [[Sainte-Chapelle (choir)|Sainte-Chapelle]], which would have required him to live in [[Paris]].  He acquired a large house there, large enough to shelter refugees from the church in [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|St Quentin]] when the Spanish sacked their city in 1559.  In 1554 he also was given a [[prebend]] at Ste Catherine in [[Troyes]].  Few biographical details are available about his last years, but he seems to have been active as a composer up to the end of his life based on publication dates of works.  He was buried in the Sainte-Chapelle.<ref name=G/>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Sacred music===\nSermisy wrote both sacred music and secular music, and all of it is for voices.  Of his sacred music, 12 complete [[mass (music)|masses]] have survived, including a [[Requiem]] mass, as well as approximately 100 [[motet]]s, some [[magnificat]]s and a set of [[Lamentations (music)|Lamentations]].  Unlike many of his contemporaries writing sacred music in France, there is no evidence he had any [[Huguenot]] sympathies; he seemed to remain a faithful [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] all his life.\n\nHis interest in the sacred genres increased steadily throughout his life, corresponding to a decline in interest in secular forms, using the publication dates as a guide (actual dates of compositions are extremely difficult to establish for composers of this period, unless a work happened to be composed for a specific occasion).  Since the prevailing style of [[polyphony]] among contemporary composers during his late career was dense, seamless, with pervasive [[imitation (music)|imitation]], as typified in the music of [[Jean Mouton|Mouton]] and [[Nicolas Gombert|Gombert]], it is significant that he tended to avoid this style, preferring clearer textures and short phrases: a style more akin to the [[chanson]]s he wrote earlier in his career.  In addition he varied the texture in his composition by alternating [[polyphony|polyphonic]] passages with [[homophony|homorhythmic]], chordal ones, much like the texture found in his secular music.\n\nSermisy wrote two of the few polyphonic settings of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] found in French music of the period; the musical setting is simple, compared to his masses and motets, and he strove to make the words clearly understandable.  The gospels chosen were those of [[St. Matthew]] and [[John the Apostle|St. John]]. Sermisy's settings were published in the 10th volume of Motets published by [[Pierre Attaignant]].\n\n===Chansons===\nBy far Sermisy's most famous contribution to music literature is his output of chansons, of which there are approximately 175.  They are similar to those of [[Clement Janequin|Janequin]], although less programmatic; his style in these works has also been described as more graceful and polished than that of the rival composer.<ref>Harold Gleason and Warren Becker, ''Music in the Middle Ages and Renaissance'' (Music Literature Outlines Series I), p. 112.  Bloomington, Indiana.  Frangipani Press, 1986.  {{ISBN|0-89917-034-X}}</ref> Typically Sermisy's chansons are chordal and syllabic, shunning the more ostentatious polyphony of composers from the Netherlands, striving for lightness and grace instead.  Sermisy was fond of quick repeated notes, which give the texture an overall lightness and dance-like quality.  Another stylistic trait seen in many of Sermisy's chansons is an initial rhythmic figure consisting of long-short-short (minim-crotchet-crotchet, or half-quarter-quarter), a figure which was to become the defining characteristic of the [[canzona]] later in the century.\n\nThe texts Sermisy chose were usually from contemporary poets, such as [[Cl\u00e9ment Marot]] (he set more verse by Marot than any other composer).  Typical topics were unrequited love, nature, and drinking.  Several of his songs are on the topic of an unhappy young woman stuck with an unattractive and unvirile old man, a sentiment not unique to his age.<ref name=G/>\n\nMost of his chansons are for four voices, though he wrote some for three early in his career, before four-voice writing became the norm.  Influence from the Italian [[frottola]] is evident, and Sermisy's chansons themselves influenced Italian composers, since his music was reprinted numerous times both in France and in other parts of Europe.\n\n==Influence==\nSermisy was well known throughout western Europe, and copies of his music are found in Italy, Spain, Portugal, England and elsewhere.  [[Rabelais]] mentioned him in ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (Book 4) along with several other contemporary composers.  Sermisy's music was transcribed numerous times for instruments, including [[viol]]s and [[lute]] as well as [[organ (music)|organ]] and other keyboard instruments, by performers from Italy, Germany, and Poland in addition to France.  Even though Sermisy was a Catholic, many of his tunes were appropriated by Protestant musicians in the next generation:  even a [[Lutheran chorale]] tune (''[[Was mein Gott will, das g'scheh allzeit]]'') is based on a chanson by Sermisy (''Il me suffit de tous mes maulx'').<ref name=G/>\n\n==Compositions==\n\n===Chansons===\n\n*''Au joly boys''\n*''Aupres de vous secretement'' (two parts)\n*''C'est une dure departie''\n*''Changeons propos, c'est trop chante d'amours''\n*''Content desir, qui cause ma douleur''\n*''En entrant en ung jardin'' (publ. 1529)\n*''Languir me fais''\n*''Si mon malheur my continue''\n*''Si vous m'aimez''\n*''Tant que vivray'' (publ. 1527)\n*''Tu disais que j'en mourrais''\n*''Vignon, vignon, vignon, vignette''\n*''Vive la serpe''\n\n===Motets===\n*''Aspice, Domine''\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n*Isabelle Cazeaux, \"Claudin de Sermisy\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', ed.

The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar [[riffs]], overlaid with [[Shred guitar|shredding]]-style lead guitar work. The lyrical subject matter often deals with criticisms of [[The Establishment]] and concern over the destruction of [[Environmentalism|the environment]], and at times shares a disdain for [[Christian dogma]] resembling that of their [[black metal]] counterparts. The language is typically quite direct and denunciatory, an approach borrowed from [[hardcore punk]].\n\nThe genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex guitar stylings of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of [[hardcore punk]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McIver|first=Joel|title=A History of Thrash Metal|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/a-history-of-thrash-metal-249162/|work=[[Total Guitar]]|publisher=[[MusicRadar]]|date=April 29, 2010|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref> Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the [[conservatism]] of the [[Reaganomics|Reagan era]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Farrar|first=Justin|title=The 30 Greatest Thrash Bands of All Time|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/12/the-30-greatest-thrash-bands-of-all-time/|work=|publisher=Spin Magazine|date=December 26, 2017|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref> and the much more moderate, [[Pop music|pop]]-influenced and widely accessible heavy metal sub-genre of [[glam metal]] which also developed concurrently in the 1980s.{{sfn|Weinstein|2000|p=48}} Thrash metal was an inspiration for subsequent extreme genres such as [[death metal]] and black metal.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Metallica London 2008-09-15 Kirk and James.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kirk Hammett]] and [[James Hetfield]] of [[Metallica]] (pictured in 2008). Metallica's early work is regarded as essential to the development of the genre in the 1980s.]]\n\nThrash metal generally features fast [[tempos]], low-register, complex guitar [[riffs]], high-register guitar [[guitar solo|solos]] and [[double bass drumming]].<ref name=\"Bowar\">{{cite web|first=Chad|last=Bowar|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/heavymetal101/a/101_thrash.htm|title=What Is Thrash Metal?|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> The rhythm guitar parts are played with heavy distortion and often [[palm mute]]d to create a tighter and more precise sound.{{sfn|Pillsbury|2006|p=20}} Vocally, thrash metal can employ anything from melodic singing to shouted vocals. Most guitar solos are played at high speed and technically demanding, as they are usually characterized by [[Shred guitar|shredding]], and use advanced techniques such as [[sweep picking]], [[Legato|legato phrasing]], [[alternate picking]], [[tremolo picking]], [[string skipping]], and [[Tapping|two-hand tapping]].\n\n[[File:Anthrax Rockavaria 2016 (12 von 12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[New York City|New York]] band [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] were among the earliest and most successful thrash acts]]\n\nThe guitar riffs often use [[chromatic scale]]s and emphasize the tritone and diminished intervals, instead of using conventional single scale based riffing. For example, the intro riff of Metallica's \"[[Master of Puppets (song)|Master of Puppets]]\" (the title track of the [[Master of Puppets|namesake album]]) is a chromatic descent, followed by a chromatic ascent based on the [[tritone]].\n\nSpeed, pacing and time-changes also define thrash metal. Thrash tends to have an accelerating feel which may be due in large part to its aggressive drumming style. For example, drummers often use two bass drums, or a double-bass pedal, in order to create a relentless, driving beat. Cymbal stops/[[Cymbal choke|chokes]] are often used to transition from one riff to another or to precede an acceleration in tempo. Some common characteristics of the genre are fast guitar riffs with aggressive picking styles and fast guitar solos, and extensive use of two bass drums as opposed to the conventional use of only one, typical of most rock music.\n\nTo keep up with the other instruments, many bassists use a [[plectrum]]. However, some prominent thrash metal bassists have used their fingers, such as [[Frank Bello]], [[Greg Christian]], [[Steve DiGiorgio]], [[Robert Trujillo]] and [[Cliff Burton]]. Several bassists use a [[fuzz bass|distorted bass tone]], an approach popularized by Burton and Mot\u00f6rhead's [[Lemmy]]. Lyrical themes in thrash metal include warfare, corruption, injustice, murder, suicide, isolation, alienation, addiction, and other maladies that afflict the individual and society. In addition, politics, particularly pessimism and dissatisfaction towards politics, are common themes among thrash metal bands. Humor and irony can occasionally be found ([[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] for example), but they are limited, and are exception rather than a rule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=David|title=Anthrax's ode to Judge Dredd became thrash metal's missing link|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/anthraxs-ode-judge-dredd-became-thrash-metals-miss-207361|work=[[The A.V.

The early work of artists such as Diamond Head, [[Iron Maiden]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[Tygers of Pan Tang]], [[Raven (band)|Raven]], and [[Angel Witch]], among others, introduced the fast-pace and intricate musicianship that became core aspects of thrash. [[Phil Taylor (musician)|Phil Taylor]]'s double-bass drumming featured in Mot\u00f6rhead's 1979 song \"[[Overkill (Mot\u00f6rhead song)|Overkill]]\" has been acknowledged by many thrash drummers, most notably [[Lars Ulrich]], as a primary influence on their playing. [[Metal Blade Records]] executive [[Brian Slagel]] played a key role in bringing the emerging genre to a larger audience, as he was responsible for discovering  both [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]] and producing their earliest studio recordings.\n\n[[Void (band)|Void]] is hailed as one of the earliest examples of hardcore/heavy metal crossover, whose chaotic musical approach is often cited as particularly influential.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burton|first=Brent|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/41541/classic-dc-hardcore-bands-faith-and-void-reissues-empty-the/|title=Two classic D.C. hardcore bands empty their vaults|newspaper=[[Washington City Paper]]|date=August 30, 2011|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> Their 1982 [[Faith/Void Split|split LP]] with fellow Washington band [[The Faith (American band)|The Faith]] showed both bands exhibiting quick, fiery, high-speed [[punk rock]].

Their 1982 album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' has been cited as a major influence on many subsequent genres and bands in the extreme metal world, such as [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Hellhammer]], [[Slayer]], and [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]. The European scene was almost exclusively influenced by the most aggressive music Germany and England were producing at the time. British bands such as [[Tank (band)|Tank]] and [[Raven (band)|Raven]], along with German band [[Accept (band)|Accept]], motivated musicians from central Europe to start bands of their own, eventually producing groups such as [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Kreator]], and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] from Germany, as well as Switzerland's [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]]. The Swedish punk band [[Warheads (band)|Warheads]] have also been described as a proto-thrash band.\n\n===Early 1980s===\nIn 1981, [[Southern California]] band [[Leather Charm]] wrote a song entitled \"Hit the Lights\". Leather Charm soon disbanded and the band's primary songwriter, vocalist/rhythm guitarist [[James Hetfield]] met drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] through a classified advertisement. Together, Hetfield and Ulrich formed [[Metallica]], the first of the \"Big Four\" thrash bands, with lead guitarist [[Dave Mustaine]], who would later form [[Megadeth]], another of the \"Big Four\" originators of thrash, and bassist [[Ron McGovney]]. McGovney would be replaced by Cliff Burton, and Mustaine was later replaced by [[Kirk Hammett]], and at Burton's insistence the band relocated to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Before Metallica had even settled on a definitive lineup, [[Metal Blade Records]] executive [[Brian Slagel]] asked Hetfield and Ulrich (credited as \"Mettallica\") to record \"Hit the Lights\" for the first edition of his ''[[Metal Massacre]]'' compilation in 1982. An updated version of \"Hit the Lights\" would later open their first studio album, ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'', released in mid\u20131983.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heller|first=Jason|title=An introduction to the snarling, belligerent rebelliousness of thrash|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/an-introduction-to-the-snarling-belligerent-rebell,95715/|work=[[The A.V.

Hanneman and King recruited vocalist/bassist [[Tom Araya]], a former [[respiratory therapist]], and drummer [[Dave Lombardo]], a [[pizza delivery]] driver, and [[Slayer]] was formed. Slayer was discovered by Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel; the band's live performance of Iron Maiden's \"Phantom of the Opera\" so impressed him that he promptly signed them to his label. In December 1983, less than six months after the release of ''Kill 'Em All'', Slayer released their debut album, ''[[Show No Mercy (Slayer album)|Show No Mercy]]''.\n\nIn 1982, [[Stress (Brazil band)|Stress]] recorded what is considered to be the first Brazilian heavy metal album.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eduardo|last=Rivadavia|title=Stress Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stress-mn0002107464|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> Roosevelt \"Bala\" (bass and vocals) claimed this to be the first thrash metal album, since it was recorded before Metallica's ''[[Kill 'Em All]]''. However, later he stated that some compositions have elements of thrash, like the speed, fast alternate picking, and the aggressive vocals and sound. Canada also produced influential [[speed metal]] bands such as [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]], [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]], [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]], [[Razor (band)|Razor]] and [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]].\n\n===Mid-1980s===\n{{Listen\n| filename = \n| title = \"Set the World Afire\"\n| description = The second track from Megadeth's third studio album, ''[[So Far, So Good...

[[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] and Slayer released extended plays on independent labels the same year. This led to a heavier sounding form of thrash, which was reflected in Exodus' ''[[Bonded by Blood]]'' and Slayer's ''[[Hell Awaits]]''. In 1985, the German band [[Kreator]] released their debut album ''[[Endless Pain]]'' and the Brazilian band [[Sepultura]] released their EP ''[[Bestial Devastation]]''. Megadeth, which was formed by former Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine, released their debut album ''[[Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!]]'', and Anthrax released the critically acclaimed ''[[Spreading the Disease]]'' in 1985.\n\nFrom a creative standpoint, the year 1986 was perhaps the pinnacle of thrash metal, as a number of critically acclaimed and genre defining albums were released. Metallica's major label debut ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' was released in March, becoming the first thrash album to be certified platinum, being certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Kreator released ''[[Pleasure to Kill]]'' in April, which would later be a major influence on the death metal scene.<ref>{{cite web|first=Cosmo |last=Lee |title=Interview with Cannibal Corpse |url=http://invisibleoranges.com/interviews/cannibalcorpse.html |publisher=Invisible Oranges |year=2006 |accessdate=August 29, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703180313/http://invisibleoranges.com/interviews/cannibalcorpse.html |archivedate=July 3, 2007 }}</ref> Megadeth released ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]'' in September, an album which proved to be the band's commercial and critical breakthrough and which [[AllMusic]] later cited as \"a classic of early thrash\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Megadeth: Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/peace-sellsbut-whos-buying-bonus-tracks-mw0000650486|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> [[Slayer]], regarded as one of the most sinister thrash metal bands of the early 1980s,<ref name=\"Rockd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,8188.sm |title=Slayer band page|publisher=Rockdetector.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184733/http://www.rockdetector.com/officialbio,8188.sm |archivedate=2007-09-30|accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=March 2016}} released ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' in October, an album considered by some to have single-handedly inspired the [[death metal]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Huey|title=Slayer: Reign in Blood|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/reign-in-blood-mw0000191741|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref> Also in October, [[Nuclear Assault]] released their debut album ''[[Game Over (Nuclear Assault album)|Game Over]]''.\n\n===Late 1980s===\n[[File:Slayer, The Fields of Rock, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Slayer (pictured in 2007) released ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' in 1986, considered a landmark achievement in the genre's history.]]\n\nIn 1987, [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] released their third album ''[[Among the Living]]'', which borrowed elements from their two previous releases, with fast guitar riffs and pounding drums.

All of those albums were commercial high points for the aforementioned artists. Many of these bands embarked on a group tour called the [[Clash of the Titans tour|\"Clash of the Titans\"]] the same year. Several albums that continued this style, which had come to be known as technical thrash metal, were released in 1991, such as Overkill's ''[[Horrorscope (Overkill album)|Horrorscope]]'', [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]]'s ''[[Victims of Deception]]'', [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]]'s ''[[Time Does Not Heal]]'', Sepultura's ''[[Arise (Sepultura album)|Arise]]'', and Coroner's ''[[Mental Vortex]]''.\n\nLater in 1991, Metallica released their [[Metallica (album)|eponymous album]], known as \"The Black Album\". The album marked a stylistic change in the band, eliminating much of the speed and longer song structures of the band's previous work, and instead focusing on more concise and slower songs. It would go on to become the band's best selling album, and began a wave of thrash metal bands releasing more commercially oriented albums.\n\nAfter the commercial and artistic climax for the genre, the energy of the thrash metal was exhausted and it was overtaken by the rising [[alternative metal]] and [[grunge]] movements.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mclver|first1=Joel|title=The Bloody Reign of Slayer|date=2009|publisher=Omnibus Press}}</ref> In the 1990s many veteran thrash metal bands began changing to more accessible, radio-friendly styles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speed/Thrash Metal|website=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/speed-thrash-metal-ma0000002874|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> Metallica was a notable example of this shift, particularly with their mid\u2013to\u2013late 1990s albums ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'', and ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|ReLoad]]'', which displayed minor [[blues]] and [[southern rock]] influences, and were seen as a major departure from the band's earlier sound.{{sfn|Sharpe-Young|2007|p=256}} Megadeth took a more accessible heavy metal route starting with their 1992 album ''[[Countdown to Extinction]]'',{{sfn|Sharpe-Young|2007|p=241}} and Testament released the melodic ''[[The Ritual (Testament album)|The Ritual]]'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Syme|title=Interview with Chuck Billy|publisher=MetalUpdate.com|url=http://metalupdate.com/interviewbilly.html|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs further [[extreme metal]] genres came to prominence in the 1990s ([[industrial metal]], [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] each finding their own fanbase), the heavy metal \"family tree\" soon found itself blending aesthetics and styles.<ref>Dunn, Sam (2005). [http://imdb.com/title/tt0478209/ ''Metal: A Headbanger's Journey'']. IMDB.</ref> For example, bands with all the musical traits of thrash metal began using [[death growls]], a vocal style borrowed from death metal, while black metal bands often utilized the airy feel of [[synthesizers]], popularized in industrial metal. Today the placing of bands within distinct subgenres remains a source of contention for heavy metal fans, however, little debate resides over the fact that thrash metal is the sole proprietor of its respective spinoffs.\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\nMany 1980s-era thrash bands who split or were inactive during the 1990s \u2013 such as [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], [[Death Angel]], [[Nuclear Assault]], and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]] \u2013 reunited in the 2000s. Notable bands returned to their roots with releases such as Kreator's ''[[Violent Revolution]]'' (2001), Metallica's ''[[Death Magnetic]]'' (2008), Megadeth's ''[[Endgame (Megadeth album)|Endgame]]'' (2009), Slayer's ''[[World Painted Blood]]'' (2009), Exodus' ''[[Exhibit B: The Human Condition]]'' (2010), Anthrax's ''[[Worship Music (album)|Worship Music]]'' (2011), Overkill's ''[[The Electric Age]]'' (2012), Testament's ''[[Dark Roots of Earth]]'' (2012), and Flotsam and Jetsam's ''[[Ugly Noise]]'' (2012).\n\n==Genre spinoffs==\nThrash metal is directly responsible for the development of underground metal genres, such as [[death metal]], [[black metal]]{{sfn|Weinstein|2000|p=288}} and [[groove metal]].<ref name=BestPanteraCDs>{{cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/toppicks/tp/bestpanteraalbums.htm |title=Best Pantera Albums |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> In addition to this, [[metalcore]], [[grindcore]] and [[deathcore]] employ similar riffs in their composition, the former with more focus on melody rather than chromaticism. The blending of punk ethos and metal's brutal nature led to even more extreme, underground styles after thrash metal began gaining mild commercial success in the late 1980s.{{sfn|Sharpe-Young|2007|p=162}} With gorier subject matter, heavier downtuning of guitars, more consistent use of [[blast beats|blast beat drumming]], and darker, atonal [[death growls]], death metal was established in the mid-1980s. Black metal, also related to thrash metal, has emerged at the same time, with many black metal bands taking influence from thrash metal bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]].{{sfn|Sharpe-Young|2007|p=208}} Black metal continued deviating from thrash metal, often providing more orchestral overtones, open [[tremolo picking]], blast beat drumming, [[screaming (music)#Black metal|shrieked]] or raspy vocals and [[Paganism|pagan]] or [[Occultism|occult]]-based aesthetics to distinguish itself from thrash metal. Thrash metal would later combine with its spinoffs, thus giving rise to genres like [[blackened thrash metal]] and [[deathrash]].<ref name=\"loudwire.com\">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/best-metal-albums-subgenres/#photogallery-1=5|title=The Best Metal Album From 40 Subgenres|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2017/12/06/top-black-thrash-albums/|title=Top Ten Black-Thrash Albums by Steve Jansson (Daeva) - Decibel Magazine|date=6 December 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=Deathrash>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/01/03/album-of-the-day-deathchains-deathrash-assault/|title=ALBUM OF THE DAY: DEATHCHAIN\u2019S DEATHRASH ASSAULT|date=3 January 2012|publisher=Metal Sucks|last=FORD|first=LEYLA|accessdate= 30 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=Ekeroth>{{cite book |last=Ekeroth |first=Daniel |title=Swedish Death Metal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&hl=en&source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |isbn= |access-date=30 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\nGroove metal takes the intensity and sonic qualities of thrash metal and plays them at mid-[[tempo]], with most bands making only occasional forays into fast tempo,<ref name=BestPanteraCDs/> but since the early 1990s it started to favor a more [[death metal]]\u2013derived sound.<ref name=\"Sound of the Beast\">{{citation |author=Christe |year=2003 |page=264 |quote=As close to death metal as any other gold-selling record before it, ''Chaos A.D.'' stripped down Sepultura's sound into a coarse metallic loop.

[[Metallica]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Death Angel]], [[Vio-lence]], and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]] are prominent examples of bands to emerge from this region.\n* '''East Coast thrash metal''': Centered in [[New York City]], the East Coast's thrash metal tended to display a sound that incorporated a strong [[hardcore punk]] influence. An emphasis was placed on aggression and speed rather than technicality. [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Nuclear Assault]], [[Toxik]], and [[Whiplash (band)|Whiplash]] exemplified the style to emerge from this regional scene.\n* '''British thrash metal''': The British thrash bands leaned towards a more [[traditional heavy metal]] approach, often heavier though less aggressive than their American counterparts. The most notable bands from this scene are [[Onslaught (band)|Onslaught]] and [[Sabbat (English band)|Sabbat]].\n* '''[[Brazilian thrash metal]]''': The Brazilian thrash scene is notable for producing a handful of bands that would become principal parts of thrash metal's prevalence in the early 1990s. There were three scenes where Brazilian thrash metal was originated: Belo Horizonte (the most prominent), S\u00e3o Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. The most famous bands from this scene are [[Sepultura]], [[Dorsal Atl\u00e2ntica]], [[Executer]], [[Chakal]], [[MX (band)|MX]], [[Korzus]], and [[Sarc\u00f3fago]].\n* '''[[Teutonic thrash metal]]''': The German and Swiss region spawned dozens of bands since the mid-1980s that developed its own style. The most prominent bands from this scene are [[Kreator]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Tankard (band)|Tankard]], [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]], [[Holy Moses]], and [[Exumer]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of thrash metal bands]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Ekeroth|2008}}|last=Ekeroth|first=Daniel|year=2008|title=Swedish Death Metal|publisher=[[Bazillion Points Books]]|isbn=978-0-9796163-1-0}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Pillsbury|2006}}|last=Pillsbury|first=Glenn|title=Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity|year=2006|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1-136-09122-X}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Sharpe-Young|2007}}|last=Sharpe-Young|first=Garry|year=2007|title=Thrash Metal|publisher=Zonda Books Limited|isbn=978-0-9582684-3-1}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Weinstein|2000}}|last=Weinstein|first=Deena|year=2000|title=Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|isbn=978-0-306-80970-5}}\n\n{{heavy metal}}\n{{extreme metal}}\n{{hardcore punk}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thrash Metal}}\n[[Category:Thrash metal|*]]\n[[Category:Heavy metal genres]]\n[[Category:Extreme metal]]\n[[Category:1980s in music]]\n[[Category:1990s in music]]\n[[Category:2000s in music]]\n[[Category:20th-century music genres]]\n[[Category:American styles of music]]\n[[Category:American rock music genres]]\n[[Category:British styles of music]]\n[[Category:British rock music genres]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Subgenre of heavy metal}}\n{{About|a subgenre of [[heavy metal music]]|the similar subgenre of heavy metal music|Crossover thrash}}\n{{Infobox music genre\n| name              = Thrash metal\n| color             = white\n| bgcolor           = #BB0022\n| stylistic_origins = {{hlist|[[New wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]]|[[speed metal]]|[[hardcore punk]]}}\n| cultural_origins  = Early 1980s, [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]]\n| instruments       = {{hlist|[[Electric guitar]]|[[bass guitar]]|[[Drum kit|drums]]|[[Singing|vocals]]}}\n| derivatives       = {{hlist|[[Black metal]]|[[death metal]]|[[groove metal]]|[[grunge]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://getthrashed.com|title=Get Thrashed: The Story of Thrash Metal|publisher=|accessdate=November 9, 2018|quote=from its early years, through its influence on grunge, nu metal and today's heavy metal scene.}}</ref>}}\n| subgenres         = \n| subgenrelist      = \n| fusiongenres      = \n* [[Blackened thrash metal]]\n* [[crossover thrash]]\n* [[deathrash]]\n* [[funk metal]]<ref name=\"primusbook\">{{cite book|last1=Prato|first1=Greg|title=Primus, Over the Electric Grapevine: Insight into Primus and the World of Les Claypool|date=16 September 2014|publisher=Akashic Books|isbn=978-1-61775-322-0}}</ref>\n* [[metalcore]]\n| regional_scenes   =\n* [[Australian thrash metal|Australia]]\n* [[Bay Area thrash metal|San Francisco Bay Area]]\n* [[Brazilian thrash metal|Brazil]]\n* [[Teutonic thrash metal|Germany]]\n* [[Polish thrash metal|Poland]]\n* [[British heavy metal|United Kingdom]]\n| local_scenes      = \n| other_topics      = \n* [[Extreme metal]]\n* [[New Wave of American Heavy Metal|NWOAHM]]\n* [[power metal]]\n* [[thrashcore]]\n| footnotes         = \n| current_year      = \n}}\n\n'''Thrash metal''' (or simply '''thrash''') is an [[Extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]] characterized by its overall aggression and often fast tempo. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar [[riffs]], overlaid with [[Shred guitar|shredding]]-style lead guitar work. The lyrical subject matter often deals with criticisms of [[The Establishment]] and concern over the destruction of [[Environmentalism|the environment]], and at times shares a disdain for [[Christian dogma]] resembling that of their [[black metal]] counterparts. The language is typically quite direct and denunciatory, an approach borrowed from [[hardcore punk]].\n\nThe genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex guitar stylings of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of [[hardcore punk]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McIver|first=Joel|title=A History of Thrash Metal|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/a-history-of-thrash-metal-249162/|work=[[Total Guitar]]|publisher=[[MusicRadar]]|date=April 29, 2010|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref> Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the [[Conservatism]] of the [[Reaganomics|Reagan era]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Farrar|first=Justin|title=The 30 Greatest Thrash Bands of All Time|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/12/the-30-greatest-thrash-bands-of-all-time/|work=|publisher=Spin Magazine|date=December 26, 2017|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref> and the much more moderate, [[Pop music|pop]]-influenced and widely accessible heavy metal sub-genre of [[glam metal]] which also developed concurrently in the 1980s.{{sfn|Weinstein|2000|p=48}} Thrash metal was an inspiration for subsequent extreme genres such as [[death metal]] and black metal.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Metallica London 2008-09-15 Kirk and James.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kirk Hammett]] and [[James Hetfield]] of [[Metallica]] (pictured in 2008). Metallica's early work is regarded as essential to the development of the genre in the 1980s.]]\n\nThrash metal generally features fast [[tempos]], low-register, complex guitar [[riffs]], high-register guitar [[guitar solo|solos]] and [[double bass drumming]].<ref name=\"Bowar\">{{cite web|first=Chad|last=Bowar|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/heavymetal101/a/101_thrash.htm|title=What Is Thrash Metal?|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> The rhythm guitar parts are played with heavy distortion and often [[palm mute]]d to create a tighter and more precise sound.{{sfn|Pillsbury|2006|p=20}} Vocally, thrash metal can employ anything from melodic singing to shouted vocals. Most guitar solos are played at high speed and technically demanding, as they are usually characterized by [[Shred guitar|shredding]], and use advanced techniques such as [[sweep picking]], [[Legato|legato phrasing]], [[alternate picking]], [[tremolo picking]], [[string skipping]], and [[Tapping|two-hand tapping]].\n\n[[File:Anthrax Rockavaria 2016 (12 von 12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[New York City|New York]] band [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] were among the earliest and most successful thrash acts]]\n\nThe guitar riffs often use [[chromatic scale]]s and emphasize the tritone and diminished intervals, instead of using conventional single scale based riffing. For example, the intro riff of Metallica's \"[[Master of Puppets (song)|Master of Puppets]]\" (the title track of the [[Master of Puppets|namesake album]]) is a chromatic descent, followed by a chromatic ascent based on the [[tritone]].\n\nSpeed, pacing and time-changes also define thrash metal. Thrash tends to have an accelerating feel which may be due in large part to its aggressive drumming style. For example, drummers often use two bass drums, or a double-bass pedal, in order to create a relentless, driving beat. Cymbal stops/[[Cymbal choke|chokes]] are often used to transition from one riff to another or to precede an acceleration in tempo. Some common characteristics of the genre are fast guitar riffs with aggressive picking styles and fast guitar solos, and extensive use of two bass drums as opposed to the conventional use of only one, typical of most rock music.\n\nTo keep up with the other instruments, many bassists use a [[plectrum]]. However, some prominent thrash metal bassists have used their fingers, such as [[Frank Bello]], [[Greg Christian]], [[Steve DiGiorgio]], [[Robert Trujillo]] and [[Cliff Burton]]. Several bassists use a [[fuzz bass|distorted bass tone]], an approach popularized by Burton and Mot\u00f6rhead's [[Lemmy]]. Lyrical themes in thrash metal include warfare, corruption, injustice, murder, suicide, isolation, alienation, addiction, and other maladies that afflict the individual and society. In addition, politics, particularly pessimism and dissatisfaction towards politics, are common themes among thrash metal bands.

The early work of artists such as Diamond Head, [[Iron Maiden]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[Tygers of Pan Tang]], [[Raven (band)|Raven]], and [[Angel Witch]], among others, introduced the fast-pace and intricate musicianship that became core aspects of thrash. [[Phil Taylor (musician)|Phil Taylor]]'s double-bass drumming featured in Mot\u00f6rhead's 1979 song \"[[Overkill (Mot\u00f6rhead song)|Overkill]]\" has been acknowledged by many thrash drummers, most notably [[Lars Ulrich]], as a primary influence on their playing. [[Metal Blade Records]] executive [[Brian Slagel]] played a key role in bringing the emerging genre to a larger audience, as he was responsible for discovering  both [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]] and producing their earliest studio recordings.\n\n[[Void (band)|Void]] is hailed as one of the earliest examples of hardcore/heavy metal crossover, whose chaotic musical approach is often cited as particularly influential.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burton|first=Brent|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/41541/classic-dc-hardcore-bands-faith-and-void-reissues-empty-the/|title=Two classic D.C. hardcore bands empty their vaults|newspaper=[[Washington City Paper]]|date=August 30, 2011|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> Their 1982 [[Faith/Void Split|split LP]] with fellow Washington band [[The Faith (American band)|The Faith]] showed both bands exhibiting quick, fiery, high-speed [[punk rock]].

Their 1982 album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' has been cited as a major influence on many subsequent genres and bands in the extreme metal world, such as [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Hellhammer]], [[Slayer]], and [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]. The European scene was almost exclusively influenced by the most aggressive music Germany and England were producing at the time. British bands such as [[Tank (band)|Tank]] and [[Raven (band)|Raven]], along with German band [[Accept (band)|Accept]], motivated musicians from central Europe to start bands of their own, eventually producing groups such as [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Kreator]], and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] from Germany, as well as Switzerland's [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]]. The Swedish punk band [[Warheads (band)|Warheads]] have also been described as a proto-thrash band.\n\n===Early 1980s===\nIn 1981, [[Southern California]] band [[Leather Charm]] wrote a song entitled \"Hit the Lights\". Leather Charm soon disbanded and the band's primary songwriter, vocalist/rhythm guitarist [[James Hetfield]] met drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] through a classified advertisement. Together, Hetfield and Ulrich formed [[Metallica]], the first of the \"Big Four\" thrash bands, with lead guitarist [[Dave Mustaine]], who would later form [[Megadeth]], another of the \"Big Four\" originators of thrash, and bassist [[Ron McGovney]]. McGovney would be replaced by Cliff Burton, and Mustaine was later replaced by [[Kirk Hammett]], and at Burton's insistence the band relocated to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Before Metallica had even settled on a definitive lineup, [[Metal Blade Records]] executive [[Brian Slagel]] asked Hetfield and Ulrich (credited as \"Mettallica\") to record \"Hit the Lights\" for the first edition of his ''[[Metal Massacre]]'' compilation in 1982. An updated version of \"Hit the Lights\" would later open their first studio album, ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'', released in mid\u20131983.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heller|first=Jason|title=An introduction to the snarling, belligerent rebelliousness of thrash|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/an-introduction-to-the-snarling-belligerent-rebell,95715/|work=[[The A.V.

Hanneman and King recruited vocalist/bassist [[Tom Araya]], a former [[respiratory therapist]], and drummer [[Dave Lombardo]], a [[pizza delivery]] driver, and [[Slayer]] was formed. Slayer was discovered by Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel; the band's live performance of Iron Maiden's \"Phantom of the Opera\" so impressed him that he promptly signed them to his label. In December 1983, less than six months after the release of ''Kill 'Em All'', Slayer released their debut album, ''[[Show No Mercy (Slayer album)|Show No Mercy]]''.\n\nIn 1982, [[Stress (Brazil band)|Stress]] recorded what is considered to be the first Brazilian heavy metal album.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eduardo|last=Rivadavia|title=Stress Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stress-mn0002107464|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> Roosevelt \"Bala\" (bass and vocals) claimed this to be the first thrash metal album, since it was recorded before Metallica's ''[[Kill 'Em All]]''. However, later he stated that some compositions have elements of thrash, like the speed, fast alternate picking, and the aggressive vocals and sound. Canada also produced influential [[speed metal]] bands such as [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]], [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]], [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]], [[Razor (band)|Razor]] and [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]].\n\n===Mid-1980s===\n{{Listen\n| filename = \n| title = \"Set the World Afire\"\n| description = The second track from Megadeth's third studio album, ''[[So Far, So Good...

[[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] and Slayer released extended plays on independent labels the same year. This led to a heavier sounding form of thrash, which was reflected in Exodus' ''[[Bonded by Blood]]'' and Slayer's ''[[Hell Awaits]]''. In 1985, the German band [[Kreator]] released their debut album ''[[Endless Pain]]'' and the Brazilian band [[Sepultura]] released their EP ''[[Bestial Devastation]]''. Megadeth, which was formed by former Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine, released their debut album ''[[Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!]]'', and Anthrax released the critically acclaimed ''[[Spreading the Disease]]'' in 1985.\n\nFrom a creative standpoint, the year 1986 was perhaps the pinnacle of thrash metal, as a number of critically acclaimed and genre defining albums were released. Metallica's major label debut ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' was released in March, becoming the first thrash album to be certified platinum, being certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

All of those albums were commercial high points for the aforementioned artists. Many of these bands embarked on a group tour called the [[Clash of the Titans tour|\"Clash of the Titans\"]] the same year. Several albums that continued this style, which had come to be known as technical thrash metal, were released in 1991, such as Overkill's ''[[Horrorscope (Overkill album)|Horrorscope]]'', [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]]'s ''[[Victims of Deception]]'', [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]]'s ''[[Time Does Not Heal]]'', Sepultura's ''[[Arise (Sepultura album)|Arise]]'', and Coroner's ''[[Mental Vortex]]''.\n\nLater in 1991, Metallica released their [[Metallica (album)|eponymous album]], known as \"The Black Album\". The album marked a stylistic change in the band, eliminating much of the speed and longer song structures of the band's previous work, and instead focusing on more concise and slower songs. It would go on to become the band's best selling album, and began a wave of thrash metal bands releasing more commercially oriented albums.\n\nAfter the commercial and artistic climax for the genre, the energy of the thrash metal was exhausted and it was overtaken by the rising [[alternative metal]] and [[grunge]] movements.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mclver|first1=Joel|title=The Bloody Reign of Slayer|date=2009|publisher=Omnibus Press}}</ref> In the 1990s many veteran thrash metal bands began changing to more accessible, radio-friendly styles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speed/Thrash Metal|website=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/speed-thrash-metal-ma0000002874|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> Metallica was a notable example of this shift, particularly with their mid\u2013to\u2013late 1990s albums ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'', and ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|ReLoad]]'', which displayed minor [[blues]] and [[southern rock]] influences, and were seen as a major departure from the band's earlier sound.{{sfn|Sharpe-Young|2007|p=256}} Megadeth took a more accessible heavy metal route starting with their 1992 album ''[[Countdown to Extinction]]'',{{sfn|Sharpe-Young|2007|p=241}} and Testament released the melodic ''[[The Ritual (Testament album)|The Ritual]]'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Syme|title=Interview with Chuck Billy|publisher=MetalUpdate.com|url=http://metalupdate.com/interviewbilly.html|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs further [[extreme metal]] genres came to prominence in the 1990s ([[industrial metal]], [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] each finding their own fanbase), the heavy metal \"family tree\" soon found itself blending aesthetics and styles.<ref>Dunn, Sam (2005). [http://imdb.com/title/tt0478209/ ''Metal: A Headbanger's Journey''].

[[Metallica]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Death Angel]], [[Vio-lence]], and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]] are prominent examples of bands to emerge from this region.\n* '''East Coast thrash metal''': Centered in [[New York City]], the East Coast's thrash metal tended to display a sound that incorporated a strong [[hardcore punk]] influence. An emphasis was placed on aggression and speed rather than technicality. [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Nuclear Assault]], [[Toxik]], and [[Whiplash (band)|Whiplash]] exemplified the style to emerge from this regional scene.\n* '''British thrash metal''': The British thrash bands leaned towards a more [[traditional heavy metal]] approach, often heavier though less aggressive than their American counterparts. The most notable bands from this scene are [[Onslaught (band)|Onslaught]] and [[Sabbat (English band)|Sabbat]].\n* '''[[Brazilian thrash metal]]''': The Brazilian thrash scene is notable for producing a handful of bands that would become principal parts of thrash metal's prevalence in the early 1990s.

In October 1971, [[Resolution 2758]] was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], expelling  \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" and transferring China's seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to the PRC. The resolution declared that \"the representatives of the Government of the PRC are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations.\" However, the ''[[eo ipso]]'' nature of [[Taiwan and weapons of mass destruction]] remained a contentious issue.{{clarify|date=May 2018}}\n\nMany attempts by the ROC to rejoin the UN have not made it past committee, under fierce PRC opposition and threatened vetoes. President [[Chen Shui-bian]] argued that Resolution 2758, replacing the ROC with the PRC in 1971, only addressed the question of who should have China's seat in the UN, rather than whether an additional seat for the [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]] could be created to represent the 23 million people residing in the Taiwanese mainland and [[list of islands of Taiwan|other islands]]. The argument, however, has not been accepted by the UN, because the issue of [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]] was not raised in the UN.\n\nSince the 1970s, the PRC and ROC have competed for diplomatic recognition from nations across the world, often by offering financial aid to poorer countries as an inducement.<ref>{{cite journal | surname = Hu | given = Shaohua | title = Small State Foreign Policy: The Diplomatic Recognition of Taiwan | journal = China: An International Journal | volume = 13 | number = 2 | year = 2015 | pages = 1\u201323 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | surname = Rich | given = Timothy S. | title = Status for Sale: Taiwan and the Competition for Diplomatic Recognition | journal = Issues & Studies | volume = 45 | number = 4 | year = 2009 | pages = 159\u2013188 | url = http://www.timothysrich.com/documents/Status_for_Sale_Taiwan_Recognition.pdf | access-date = 17 January 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220100047/http://www.timothysrich.com/documents/Status_for_Sale_Taiwan_Recognition.pdf | archive-date = 20 December 2016 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> As a precondition for diplomatic relations, the PRC requires that the other country renounce any recognition of the ROC.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, Taiwan was placed under the temporary administration of the ROC to handle the surrender of Japanese administration. The [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out again between the Nationalists and the Communists. The Communists gained control of the [[mainland China|mainland]] in 1949 and proclaimed the People's Republic of China (PRC), while the Nationalists fled to Taiwan, taking the ROC government with them. In 1952, Japan renounced Taiwan in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] without specifying to whom Taiwan is ceded.\n\nIn 1916, A. P.

The government position that both Taiwan and mainland China are parts of the same state is not universally accepted among the people of Taiwan. In particular, the pro-independence [[Pan-Green Coalition]] considers Taiwan and China to be different countries. By contrast, the [[Chinese reunification|pro-reunification]] [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] take the view that both Taiwan and mainland China are parts of the ROC. Former president [[Lee Tung-hui]] described these relations as \"[[Special state-to-state relations]]\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904023430/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_/ai_62170616Taiwan \"Taiwan won't broach state-to-state concept again\"]. \"The press reports quoted Taiwan's incoming top China policy-maker Tsai Ing-wen as saying Thursday that the special state-to-state label was an adequate description of Taiwan's current ties with China.\"  \"'The two-states theory is a good thing.

'We can refrain from using it as a description, although we cannot deny the existence of the situation described by it,' Tsai said on local television.\"</ref> The Chen administrations described Taiwan and China by saying \"[[one country on each side|...with Taiwan and China on each side of the Taiwan Strait, each side is a country.]]\". Former President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] returned to the government position of the early 1990s, calling relations with Beijing [[special non-state-to-state relations|special relations between two areas within one state]].

The constitutional position of Taipei is that the territory of the ROC is divided into the \"Mainland Area\" and the \"[[free area of the republic of china|Free Area]]\" (also known as \"Taiwan Area\"). Administratively, cross-strait relations are not conducted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] of Taiwan, but by the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], an instrument of the [[Executive Yuan]]. The relations with Hong Kong and [[Macau]] are also conducted by the Mainland Affairs Council, although not all regulations applicable to mainland China automatically apply to those territories.\n\nTaiwanese and Chinese governments do not directly interact. Talks are conducted by China's [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS) and Taiwan's [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF), privately constituted bodies that are controlled and directly answerable to the executive branches of their respective governments.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, Hong Kong and [[Macau]] were [[British Hong Kong|British]] and [[Portuguese Macau|Portuguese]] colonies respectively. They provided neutral detour points for people and goods crossing the strait. They and Singapore served as venues for talks between the two sides at that time. One ''[[modus vivendi]]'' outcome of such talks was the [[1992 Consensus]], arising from a 1992 meeting in Hong Kong. Under this consensus, the two sides agree that both Taiwan and mainland China are under the same single sovereignty of China, but the two sides agree to disagree on which side is the legitimate representative of that sovereignty.

Panamanians studying in Taiwan were given the choice of returning to Panama within 30 days or continuing their studies in China. Panama was motivated by promises of multibillion-dollar investments.  It all began with a letter sent in 2015 to the Chinese government that, according to Isabel Saint Malo, Panama's vice president, was titled \"Panama wants to make ties with China\". The contents of the letter are kept confidential, as well as the reasons of why it was sent. It has also been kept confidential who delivered the letter and assisted in the switchover process, which is only described as \"a distinguished member of the Chinese community living in Panama\". The exembassador of the US to Panama, [[John Feeley]], said that he had asked [[List of heads of state of Panama|Panamanian President]] [[Juan Carlos Varela]] about the switchover in 2016 but Varela lied to him, saying that there were no plans to make the switchover. He also said that Varela didn't tell him the truth until 1 hour before the nationwide announcement. Others questioned why the Panamanian government continues to use equipment donated by Taiwan. The Panamanian government initially gave no reason, later saying that one reason was because \"China is the second largest user of the Panama Canal\" and President Varela said it was because he \"couldn't accept it anymore\" and \"that's what every responsible leader would do\". The Panamanian government officially said that Taiwan was an inalienable part of China and that the switchover was to comply with the one-China policy. The ROC government said that Panama was its \"number one ally\" and that it would not participate in Beijing's checkbook diplomacy. The Taiwanese government complained that Panama maliciously hid the switchover process until the last moment. In the first year of diplomatic relations, 19 treaties were signed, including a Free Trade Treaty. Varela said that its main purpose was to allow Chinese nationals to easily invest in Panama. Controversies over the sudden switchover, included lack of due process, unusually high levels of confidentiality, and the fact that a few weeks before the switchover, Taiwan had donated medical equipment to Panama. In 2018, the first flight from Beijing To Panama by Air China landed in [[Tocumen International Airport]], with a technical stop in Houston. Varela called it a milestone in Panamanian aviation. Due to this new route, the Panamanian ministry of tourism expected at least 40,000 Chinese tourist visits per year. \"History and socioeconomic reality\" were cited as reasons. Varela said that the move was backed by diplomatic relationships dating from 1912 and that the move strengthened the existing relationships, despite the fact that those relationships were with the ROC, not the PRC. As a result, Panama City was almost immediately added to China's list of officially approved tourist destinations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prensa.com/economia/Aterriza-primer-Air-China-Panama_0_5001249854.html|title=Aterriza el primer vuelo de Air China en Panam\u00e1 &#124; La Prensa Panam\u00e1|date=5 April 2018|website=www.prensa.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/180323/air-china-vuelo-beijing-inaugura|title=Air China inaugura vuelo Beijing-Houston-Panam\u00e1|first=GESE-La Estrella de|last=Panam\u00e1|website=La Estrella de Panam\u00e1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40256499|title=Panama cuts ties with Taiwan in favour of China|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Conoce-posible-ruta-estaciones-Panama-Chiriqui_0_4966003387.html|title=Conoce la posible ruta y estaciones del tren Panam\u00e1-Chiriqu\u00ed|date=17 February 2018|website=TVN}}</ref>\nThe [[Chinese Communist Party]] government has offered the [[Paname\u00f1ista Party]]-led government a free feasibility study for the planned 4th set of locks in the Panama Canal to gain a competitive advantage in bids for choosing the company to build the 4th set of locks, not to mention plans for a 1200 hectare industrial park on the Pacific coast and a 4 hectare campus in Amador near the Biomuseo to house the PRC embassy in Panama. There are also fears that Panama could turn into a conflict zone between the US and the PRC, due to Panama's strategic location. A Panamanian government agency later said that the switchover was because of Taiwanese president [[Tsai Ing-wen]]'s violations and lack of regard to the 1992 consensus regarding China, Taiwan and the One-china policy. Panamanian newspaper La Estrella questioned the reasons Varela initially gave for the switchover, like \"China is the world's largest population and the 2nd largest economy and user of the Panama Canal\", calling Varela's actions contradictory and saying that the reasons Varela gave were the reality Panama has lived under for decades, so those couldn't be regarded as valid reasons for the switchover.

However, in 1995 CAL dropped the [[national colours]] from its [[Aircraft livery|livery]], and now flies to international destinations under its own name. Many countries' national airlines similarly set up special subsidiaries to operate services to Taipei, with a different name, and livery omitting national symbols.

In October 1971, [[Resolution 2758]] was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], expelling  \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" and transferring China's seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to the PRC.

President [[Chen Shui-bian]] argued that Resolution 2758, replacing the ROC with the PRC in 1971, only addressed the question of who should have China's seat in the UN, rather than whether an additional seat for the [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]] could be created to represent the 23 million people residing in the Taiwanese mainland and [[list of islands of Taiwan|other islands]].

The Communists gained control of the [[mainland China|mainland]] in 1949 and proclaimed the People's Republic of China (PRC), while the Nationalists fled to Taiwan, taking the ROC government with them. In 1952, Japan renounced Taiwan in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] without specifying to whom Taiwan is ceded.\n\nIn 1916, A. P.

The government position that both Taiwan and mainland China are parts of the same state is not universally accepted among the people of Taiwan.

The constitutional position of Taipei is that the territory of the ROC is divided into the \"Mainland Area\" and the \"[[free area of the republic of china|Free Area]]\" (also known as \"Taiwan Area\"). Administratively, cross-strait relations are not conducted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] of Taiwan, but by the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], an instrument of the [[Executive Yuan]]. The relations with Hong Kong and [[Macau]] are also conducted by the Mainland Affairs Council, although not all regulations applicable to mainland China automatically apply to those territories.\n\nTaiwanese and Chinese governments do not directly interact. Talks are conducted by China's [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS) and Taiwan's [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF), privately constituted bodies that are controlled and directly answerable to the executive branches of their respective governments.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, Hong Kong and [[Macau]] were [[British Hong Kong|British]] and [[Portuguese Macau|Portuguese]] colonies respectively. They provided neutral detour points for people and goods crossing the strait. They and Singapore served as venues for talks between the two sides at that time. One ''[[modus vivendi]]'' outcome of such talks was the [[1992 Consensus]], arising from a 1992 meeting in Hong Kong. Under this consensus, the two sides agree that both Taiwan and mainland China are under the same single sovereignty of China, but the two sides agree to disagree on which side is the legitimate representative of that sovereignty. Setting aside that disagreement, the two sides agreed to co-operate on practical matters, such as recognising certifications authenticated by the other side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=113&anum=9607 |title=Kuomintang News Network |publisher=Kmt.org.tw |accessdate=25 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419103952/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=113&anum=9607 |archivedate=19 April 2012  }}</ref>\n\nRelations between Taipei and Beijing warmed during the Ma government with the promotion of cross-strait links and increased economic and social interchanges between the two sides, but the [[2014 Taiwan local elections|2014 local elections]] cooled them again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Staff%20Report_Taiwan%27s%20Local%20Elections--Implications%20for%20Cross-Strait%20Relations%20_12%2030%202014.pdf |title=Taiwan's 2014 Local Elections: Implications for Cross-Strait Relations |website=Origin.www.uscc.gov |accessdate=22 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224103514/http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Staff%20Report_Taiwan%27s%20Local%20Elections--Implications%20for%20Cross-Strait%20Relations%20_12%2030%202014.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2016  }}</ref> A [[2014 Wang-Zhang Meeting|high-level meeting]] was held on 11 February 2014 in [[Nanjing]] that marked the first time China recognised Taiwan's top government officials on matters across the Taiwan Strait.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303874504579375943230344648?KEYWORDS=taiwan&mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303874504579375943230344648.html%3FKEYWORDS%3Dtaiwan|title=Taiwan, China Talks End Cordially|author=Jenny W.

The Panamanian government initially gave no reason, later saying that one reason was because \"China is the second largest user of the Panama Canal\" and President Varela said it was because he \"couldn't accept it anymore\" and \"that's what every responsible leader would do\". The Panamanian government officially said that Taiwan was an inalienable part of China and that the switchover was to comply with the one-China policy. The ROC government said that Panama was its \"number one ally\" and that it would not participate in Beijing's checkbook diplomacy. The Taiwanese government complained that Panama maliciously hid the switchover process until the last moment. In the first year of diplomatic relations, 19 treaties were signed, including a Free Trade Treaty. Varela said that its main purpose was to allow Chinese nationals to easily invest in Panama. Controversies over the sudden switchover, included lack of due process, unusually high levels of confidentiality, and the fact that a few weeks before the switchover, Taiwan had donated medical equipment to Panama. In 2018, the first flight from Beijing To Panama by Air China landed in [[Tocumen International Airport]], with a technical stop in Houston. Varela called it a milestone in Panamanian aviation. Due to this new route, the Panamanian ministry of tourism expected at least 40,000 Chinese tourist visits per year. \"History and socioeconomic reality\" were cited as reasons. Varela said that the move was backed by diplomatic relationships dating from 1912 and that the move strengthened the existing relationships, despite the fact that those relationships were with the ROC, not the PRC. As a result, Panama City was almost immediately added to China's list of officially approved tourist destinations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prensa.com/economia/Aterriza-primer-Air-China-Panama_0_5001249854.html|title=Aterriza el primer vuelo de Air China en Panam\u00e1 &#124; La Prensa Panam\u00e1|date=5 April 2018|website=www.prensa.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/180323/air-china-vuelo-beijing-inaugura|title=Air China inaugura vuelo Beijing-Houston-Panam\u00e1|first=GESE-La Estrella de|last=Panam\u00e1|website=La Estrella de Panam\u00e1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40256499|title=Panama cuts ties with Taiwan in favour of China|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Conoce-posible-ruta-estaciones-Panama-Chiriqui_0_4966003387.html|title=Conoce la posible ruta y estaciones del tren Panam\u00e1-Chiriqu\u00ed|date=17 February 2018|website=TVN}}</ref>\nThe [[Chinese Communist Party]] government has offered the [[Paname\u00f1ista Party]]-led government a free feasibility study for the planned 4th set of locks in the Panama Canal to gain a competitive advantage in bids for choosing the company to build the 4th set of locks, not to mention plans for a 1200 hectare industrial park on the Pacific coast and a 4 hectare campus in Amador near the Biomuseo to house the PRC embassy in Panama. There are also fears that Panama could turn into a conflict zone between the US and the PRC, due to Panama's strategic location. A Panamanian government agency later said that the switchover was because of Taiwanese president [[Tsai Ing-wen]]'s violations and lack of regard to the 1992 consensus regarding China, Taiwan and the One-china policy. Panamanian newspaper La Estrella questioned the reasons Varela initially gave for the switchover, like \"China is the world's largest population and the 2nd largest economy and user of the Panama Canal\", calling Varela's actions contradictory and saying that the reasons Varela gave were the reality Panama has lived under for decades, so those couldn't be regarded as valid reasons for the switchover. The same newspaper also says that China's plans in Latin America convince Latin American nations easily, with apparent benefits in the short term but with dependency in China in the long term and that China is silently invading other countries and Latin America in general.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laestrella.com.pa/internacional/america/180718/china-panama-franquicia|title=Panam\u00e1, \u00bfuna franquicia china?|first=GESE-La Estrella de|last=Panam\u00e1|website=La Estrella de Panam\u00e1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elsiglo.com.pa/panama/panama-espera-jugosas-inversiones-china/24016355|title=Panam\u00e1 espera jugosas inversiones de China|website=El Siglo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://m.prensa.com/opinion/China-agenda-ambiciosa_0_4812268806.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824034511/https://m.prensa.com/opinion/China-agenda-ambiciosa_0_4812268806.html |archive-date=24 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There are also concerns that, in the long term, Chinese investments may control the Panamanian economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Conoce-inversiones-China-planea-Panama_0_4897010348.html|title=Conoce las inversiones que China planea hacer en Panam\u00e1|date=17 November 2017|website=TVN}}</ref>\n\n===Paraguay===\n{{Main|Paraguay\u2013Taiwan relations}}\n[[File:2016\u5e745\u670820\u65e5\u7e3d\u7d71\u5c31\u8077 09.jpg|thumb|Paraguay President [[Horacio Cartes]] and President [[Tsai Ing-wen]] in Taiwan.]]\nParaguayan leader General [[Alfredo Stroessner]] was a partner of Generalissimo Chiang.

However, in 1995 CAL dropped the [[national colours]] from its [[Aircraft livery|livery]], and now flies to international destinations under its own name. Many countries' national airlines similarly set up special subsidiaries to operate services to Taipei, with a different name, and livery omitting national symbols. For example, [[British Airways]]' now defunct subsidiary, [[British Asia Airways]], operated flights to London, [[KLM]]'s subsidiary, [[KLM Asia]], operated flights to [[Amsterdam]], and [[Swissair]]'s subsidiary, [[Swissair#Swissair Asia|Swissair Asia]], operated flights to [[Zurich]], [[Air France#Air France Asie and Air France Cargo Asie|Air France Asie]] operated flights to Paris while [[Qantas]] had a subsidiary called [[Australia Asia Airlines]], which operated flights to Sydney. Other countries' flag carriers, such as Germany's [[Lufthansa]], operated flights to Taipei using an existing subsidiary (in Lufthansa's case, [[Condor Airlines|Condor]]).\n\n[[Japan Air Lines]] established a subsidiary called [[Japan Asia Airways]] to operate flights to Tokyo. Before the completion of the second runway at New Tokyo International Airport (now [[Narita International Airport]]) near Tokyo, Japan, airlines from Taiwan were required to fly to [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] (commonly known as ''Haneda Airport'') in [[Ota, Tokyo]] in order not to offend the airlines from the PRC that flew to Narita. [[All Nippon Airways]], however, used an existing subsidiary, [[Air Nippon]]. With the implementation of a new Japan-Taiwan air agreement, [[Japan Air Lines|JAL]] and [[Air Nippon|ANA]] took over flight operations between Japan and Taiwan in April 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jal.com/en/history/history/jal/age_04-10.html|title=History of JAL \u2013 History of JAL|website=jal.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ana.co.jp/eng/aboutana/press/2007/080123.html|title=Press Release|website=ana.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nBeginning July 2008, charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan, which were traditionally only allowed on special holidays such as Chinese New Year, were expanded greatly.\n\n===Telecommunications===\n[[List of country calling codes|International dialing code]]s are assigned by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) to its member states and their dependencies.
