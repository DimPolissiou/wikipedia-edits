The first director for the film, [[John D. Hancock]], proved to be unsuitable for an action film and was replaced by Szwarc.<ref name=\"makingof\">''The Making of Jaws 2'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref> Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.<ref name=\"loynd103\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=103}}</ref>\n\n''Jaws 2'' was briefly the highest-grossing sequel in history until ''[[Rocky II]]'' was released in 1979.

See WP:FILMPLOT for guidelines on film plots. -->\nWhen a new hotel opens on Amity Island, a gigantic [[great white shark]] ambushes and kills two scuba divers photographing the wreckage of the ''Orca'' and then heads into Amity waters. Their camera, which took pictures during the attack, is recovered the next day. The shark then swiftly kills a female water skier. The driver tries to kill the monster using a gas tank and [[flare gun]]. However, this causes the boat to explode, which kills the driver instead and severely burns the right side of the shark's face.\n\nA [[killer whale]] carcass bearing fatal wounds is found beached. Police Chief Martin Brody believes that a shark is responsible for these events. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who expresses doubts that the town has another shark problem following the events of the [[Jaws (film)|previous movie]]. Brody then finds floating debris from the destroyed speedboat and the boat driver's burnt remains. Brody calls Matt Hooper for assistance, but he is unavailable due to being in Antarctica on a research expedition. Brody prohibits his son Mike from boating out of concern for his safety and instead lands him a job on the beach, much to Mike's dismay.\n\nThe following day, Brody watches from an observation tower and causes a panic after mistaking a school of bluefish for a shark, and shooting at it with his gun. However, his fears are confirmed when photos from the diver's camera are processed, and one of them shows a close-up of the shark. When he presents it to the Amity Town Council, they refuse to believe it is a shark, and vote Brody out as police chief with the sole dissent coming from the Mayor.\n\nThe next morning, Mike disobeys his father's orders by sneaking out to go sailing with his friends, taking his younger brother Sean with him to silence him. Marge, another teen, takes Sean with her, and they head out on six separate boats, going past a team of divers led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after submerging and catching lobster, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an [[embolism]]. Soon after, the shark hits the boat of teenagers Tina and Eddie, who have strayed away from the others; Eddie falls into the water and is eaten.\n\nBrody and his wife Ellen witness Tom's evacuation by ambulance and hear that the other divers suspect something scared him underwater. Former deputy Len Hendricks, who has taken over as Brody's replacement, tells them that Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody and Ellen commandeer the police boat (aided by a reluctant Hendricks) to rescue them. They come across Tina's boat and find her hiding in the [[bow (ship)|bow]], whereupon she confirms the shark's presence. Brody hails a passing boat to take Hendricks, Ellen, and Tina to shore, where the truth is revealed, while he goes on to find the kids.\n \nMeanwhile, the shark attacks the group, striking one of their boats and causing most of them to capsize or crash into each other in the ensuing chaos. Mike is knocked unconscious, falls in the water, and nearly gets eaten. The only pair whose boat is still seaworthy barely pull him out and leave the others to take him ashore and get help, while Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore, but the shark latches onto the chopper's pontoons, capsizing it and drowning the pilot in the process. It then knocks Sean into the water, and Marge is killed while saving him.\n\nBrody finds Mike, who informs him of the situation and apologizes for not knowing about the shark; Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety, then finds the others at Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station that supplies power to Amity. The cheering and jumping that greet him attract the shark, which attacks again, causing him to maroon the police boat. He tries to pull them in with a winch but instead hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next move sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to the edge of Cable Junction, while Jackie Peters, Mike's love interest, and Sean are still on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody taps the power cable with an oar to lure the shark towards him, holding the cable out in front of him. The shark bites the cable, which electrocutes it until it dies. Brody collects Sean and Jackie and they join the others on Cable Junction to await rescue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Chief Martin Brody\n* [[Lorraine Gary]] as Ellen Brody\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mayor Larry Vaughn\n* [[Joseph Mascolo]] as Len Peterson\n* [[Jeffrey Kramer]] as Deputy Jeff Hendricks\n* [[Collin Wilcox (actress)|Collin Wilcox]] as Dr. Elkins\n* [[Ann Dusenberry]] as Tina Wilcox\n* [[Mark Gruner]] as Michael \"Mike\" Brody\n* [[Susan French]] as Old Lady\n* [[Barry Coe]] as Tom Andrews\n* Gary Springer as Andy Nicholas\n* [[Donna Wilkes]] as Jackie Peters\n* [[Gary Dubin]] as Eddie Marchand\n* [[John Dukakis]] as Paul 'Polo' Loman\n* G.

He claimed that the planned plot was to involve the sons of Quint and Brody hunting a new shark.<ref name=\"Ref_\">{{harvnb|Baxter|1997|p=145}}</ref> Brown said that Spielberg did not want to direct the sequel because he felt that he had done the \"definitive shark movie\".<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Prigg\u00e98\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=8}}</ref> The director later added that his decision was influenced by the problems the ''Jaws'' production faced \u2013 \"I would have done the sequel if I hadn't had such a horrible time at sea on the first film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/08/steven-spielberg-jaws-interview/|title=Steven Spielberg talks about 'Jaws' \u2013 the greatest summer movie ever made|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|date=2011-06-08|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\nDespite Spielberg's rejection, the studio went ahead with plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month pre-production process. [[Howard Sackler]], who had contributed to the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a [[prequel]] based on the sinking of the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']], the story relayed by [[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]] in the first film. Although Universal president [[Sidney Sheinberg]] thought Sackler's [[Film treatment|treatment]] for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea.<ref name=\"Ref_a\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=24\u20135}}</ref> On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director [[John D. Hancock]] was chosen to helm the picture.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=27}}</ref> \n\nHancock began filming in June 1977. However, after nearly a month of filming, Universal and MCA executives disliked the dark, subtle tone that the film was taking and wanted a more lighthearted and action oriented story. Additionally, Hancock ran into trouble with Sheinberg, who suggested to Hancock and Tristan that his (Sheinberg's) wife, actress [[Lorraine Gary]] (Ellen Brody), \"should go out on a boat and help to rescue the kids.\" When told of the idea, Zanuck replied, \"Over my dead body.\" The next draft of the film's screenplay was turned in with Gary not going out to sea. Hancock says that this, and his later firing of another actress who turned out to be a Universal executive's girlfriend, contributed to his own dismissal from the film.<ref name=\"luke\">{{harvnb|Ford|2004|p=191}}</ref>\n\nHancock began to feel the pressure of directing his first epic adventure film \"with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas\".<ref name=\"Ref_c\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=66}}</ref> The producers were unhappy with his material, and on a Saturday evening in June 1977, after a meeting with the producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife left for [[Rome]] and production was shut down for a few weeks. The couple had been involved in the film for eighteen months.<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=70}}</ref> Hancock blamed his departure on the mechanical shark, telling a newspaper that it still could not swim or bite after a year and a half: \"You get a couple of shots, and [the shark] breaks.\"<ref name=\"kach78\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=78}}</ref> Echoing the first film's production, [[Carl Gottlieb]] was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence.<ref name=\"Ref_e\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=36\u20137}}</ref> Gottlieb wrote on location at [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]].<ref name=\"Gottlieb221\">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2010|p=221}}</ref> It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in the first place.<ref name=\"Ref_e\"/>\n\nAt this point, Spielberg considered returning to direct the sequel. Over the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial weekend]] in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's ''Indianapolis'' speech. Because of his contract for ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', however, he would not be able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=73}}</ref> Production designer [[Joe Alves]] (who would direct ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'') and [[Verna Fields]] (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it.<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Ref_g\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=74}}</ref> The request was declined by the [[Directors Guild of America]],<ref name=\"Ref_h\">{{harvnb|Rosenfield|1982|1}}</ref> partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'', had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to [[Jeannot Szwarc]], best known for the film ''[[Bug (1975 film)|Bug]]'' and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series ''[[Night Gallery]]''.<ref name=\"Ref_i\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=75\u20136}}</ref> Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated water skier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by [[Jeffrey Kramer]], who had been missing from the earlier script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.<ref name=\"Ref_j\">''Jaws 2: A Portrait by Actor Keith Gordon'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nThree sharks were built for the film. The first was the \"platform shark\", also referred to as the \"luxurious shark\". Special mechanical effects supervisor [[Robert Mattey]] and Roy Arbogast used the same body mould used for the shark in the first film.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The sharks from the original film had rotted behind sheds on the lower lot of Universal Studios in the intervening years, and the only pieces that were salvageable were the chromoly tube frames. Mattey's design was much more complicated and ambitious than the first film. The same (male) body was used, but a brand new head was made by sculptor Chris Mueller which made use of an all-new mouth mechanism, one which incorporated jowls to disguise the pinching of the cheeks that had proven to be a problem with the shark in the original film. The sharks for ''Jaws 2'' were known as ''Bruce Two'' (the sharks for the original film had been nicknamed \"Bruce\", after Steven Spielberg's lawyer), but on set they were referred to as \"Fidel\" and \"Harold\", the latter after David Brown's Beverly Hills lawyer.<ref name=\"kach77\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=77}}</ref>  The other shark props used were a fin and a full shark, both of which could be pulled by boats. \"Cable Junction\", the island shown in the film's climax, was actually a floating barge covered with fiber-glass rocks. This was created in order to enable the shark platform to be positioned to it as close as possible (a real island would have hindered this due to the upward slope of the seabed making the shark platform visible). Like the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers [[Ron & Valerie Taylor]] was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nAlthough the first film was commended for leaving the shark to the imagination until two thirds of the way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the dramatic \"first image of it coming out of the water\" in the first film could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented that there was no way that they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nLike the first film, shooting on water proved challenging. Scheider said that they were \"always contending with tides, surf and winds ... jellyfish, sharks, waterspouts and hurricane warnings.\"<ref name=\"kach77\"/> After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction. The saltwater's corrosive effect damaged some equipment, including the metal parts in the sharks.<ref name=\"kach77\"/>\n\n[[Susan Ford]], daughter of U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]], was hired to shoot publicity photographs.<ref name=\"kach76\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=76}}</ref> Many of these appeared in Ray Loynd's ''Jaws 2 Log'', a book documenting the film's production, similar to what Carl Gottlieb had done for the first film.\n\n===Location===\n[[Martha's Vineyard]] was again used as the location for the town scenes and [[Emerald Coast]] was included on this film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Betty Archer |title=GB teens helped keep 'Jaws 2' water scenes moving |url=https://news.gulfbreezenews.com/articles/gb-teens-helped-keep-jaws-2-water-scenes-moving/ |date=August 21, 2008 |access-date=January 17, 2018 |newspaper=Gulf Breeze News}}</ref> Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing.<ref name=\"Ref_k\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=60\u20132}}</ref> Shortly after the production arrived in June 1977, local newspaper the ''Grapevine'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|The ''Jaws'' people are back among us, more efficient, more organized and more moneyed.

Some people, however, were less pleased by the film crew's presence and refused to cooperate. Only one drugstore allowed its windows to be boarded up for the moody look that Hancock wanted. \"Universal Go Home\" T-shirts began appearing on the streets in mid-June 1977.<ref name=\"Ref_m\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=64}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Navarre Beach Florida sand.jpg|thumb|right|The majority of filming was at [[Navarre Beach, Florida|Navarre Beach]] in [[Florida]]]]\nWhen Szwarc took over, the majority of the film was shot at [[Navarre Beach, Florida|Navarre Beach]] in [[Florida]], because of the warm weather and the water's depth being appropriate for the shark platform. The company was at this location from August 1 until December 22, 1977.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The production \"was a boost to the local economy because local boaters, extras and stand-ins or doubles were hired. Universal brought in actors, directors, producers and their wives, camera and crew people who needed housing, food and clothing for the movie. Services were needed for laundry, dry-cleaning and recreation.\" Navarre's Holiday Inn \"Holidome\" was used as the film's headquarters, with the ground floor converted into production offices, and some of the Gulf-front suites remodelled for David Brown and Roy Scheider. Universal rented 100 of the hotel's 200 rooms, spending $1 million. The Holiday Inn was destroyed in the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season]].<ref name=\"gbn1\">{{Citation |first=Betty Archer |last=Allen |work=Gulf Breeze News |title=30 years later, Gulf Breeze still recalls 'Jaws 2' excitement |url=http://www.gulfbreezenews.com/news/2008/0807/Front_Page/002.html |date=August 7, 2008 |accessdate=2009-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825010823/http://www.gulfbreezenews.com/news/2008/0807/Front_Page/002.html |archivedate=August 25, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Boats and parts for their maintenance were purchased from local businesses.

Williams says that it was assumed by everyone that \"the music would come back also and be part of the cast ... it would require new music, certainly, but the signature music of ''Jaws'' should be used as well\". He compares this to \"the great tradition\" for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as ''[[Roy Rogers]]'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger (serial)|The Lone Ranger]]''. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc says Williams also composed a \"youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around when the kids are sailing or going out to sea. It was very inventive\".<ref name=\"musicdvd\">''The Music of Jaws 2'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nSzwarc said that the sequel's music should be \"more complex because it was a more complex film\". Williams says that this score is broader, allowing him to make more use of the orchestra, and use longer notes, and \"fill the space\" created by the director. Williams used a larger ensemble than for the first film, and \"the orchestral palette may have been broader or had longer notes\". Delays in shooting meant that Williams was forced to start working on the score before the film was completed. Szwarc discussed the film with the composer, showing him edited sequences and storyboards. The director praises Williams in being able to work under such difficult conditions.<ref name=\"musicdvd\"/> Critic Mike Beek suggests these time constraints enabled Williams \"to create themes based on ideas and suggestions, rather than a locked down print.\"<ref name=\"Beek\"/>\n\nCritics have praised Williams' score, comparing it favorably to the original. Williams \"uses a few basic elements of the original\u2014the obligatory shark motif, for one\u2014and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions.\" The score is \"more disturbing in places\" than the original, and \"Williams {{sic|fash|ion}} some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music.\" Because ''Jaws 2'' \"isn't a film that requires subtlety ...

See WP:FILMPLOT for guidelines on film plots. -->\nWhen a new hotel opens on Amity Island, a gigantic [[great white shark]] ambushes and kills two scuba divers photographing the wreckage of the ''Orca'' and then heads into Amity waters. Their camera, which took pictures during the attack, is recovered the next day. The shark then swiftly kills a female water skier. The driver tries to kill the monster using a gas tank and [[flare gun]]. However, this causes the boat to explode, which kills the driver instead and severely burns the right side of the shark's face.\n\nA [[killer whale]] carcass bearing fatal wounds is found beached. Police Chief Martin Brody believes that a shark is responsible for these events. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who expresses doubts that the town has another shark problem following the events of the [[Jaws (film)|previous movie]]. Brody then finds floating debris from the destroyed speedboat and the boat driver's burnt remains. Brody calls Matt Hooper for assistance, but he is unavailable due to being in Antarctica on a research expedition. Brody prohibits his son Mike from boating out of concern for his safety and instead lands him a job on the beach, much to Mike's dismay.\n\nThe following day, Brody watches from an observation tower and causes a panic after mistaking a school of bluefish for a shark, and shooting at it with his gun. However, his fears are confirmed when photos from the diver's camera are processed, and one of them shows a close-up of the shark. When he presents it to the Amity Town Council, they refuse to believe it is a shark, and vote Brody out as police chief with the sole dissent coming from the Mayor.\n\nThe next morning, Mike disobeys his father's orders by sneaking out to go sailing with his friends, taking his younger brother Sean with him to silence him. Marge, another teen, takes Sean with her, and they head out on six separate boats, going past a team of divers led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after submerging and catching lobster, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an [[embolism]]. Soon after, the shark hits the boat of teenagers Tina and Eddie, who have strayed away from the others; Eddie falls into the water and is eaten.\n\nBrody and his wife Ellen witness Tom's evacuation by ambulance and hear that the other divers suspect something scared him underwater. Former deputy Len Hendricks, who has taken over as Brody's replacement, tells them that Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody and Ellen commandeer the police boat (aided by a reluctant Hendricks) to rescue them. They come across Tina's boat and find her hiding in the [[bow (ship)|bow]], whereupon she confirms the shark's presence. Brody hails a passing boat to take Hendricks, Ellen, and Tina to shore, where the truth is revealed, while he goes on to find the kids.\n \nMeanwhile, the shark attacks the group, striking one of their boats and causing most of them to capsize or crash into each other in the ensuing chaos. Mike is knocked unconscious, falls in the water, and nearly gets eaten. The only pair whose boat is still seaworthy barely pull him out and leave the others to take him ashore and get help, while Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore, but the shark latches onto the chopper's pontoons, capsizing it and drowning the pilot in the process. It then knocks Sean into the water, and Marge is killed while saving him.\n\nBrody finds Mike, who informs him of the situation and apologizes for not knowing about the shark; Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety, then finds the others at Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station that supplies power to Amity. The cheering and jumping that greet him attract the shark, which attacks again, causing him to maroon the police boat. He tries to pull them in with a winch but instead hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next move sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to the edge of Cable Junction, while Jackie Peters, Mike's love interest, and Sean are still on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody taps the power cable with an oar to lure the shark towards him, holding the cable out in front of him. The shark bites the cable, which electrocutes it until it dies. Brody collects Sean and Jackie and they join the others on Cable Junction to await rescue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Chief Martin Brody\n* [[Lorraine Gary]] as Ellen Brody\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mayor Larry Vaughn\n* [[Joseph Mascolo]] as Len Peterson\n* [[Jeffrey Kramer]] as Deputy Jeff Hendricks\n* [[Collin Wilcox (actress)|Collin Wilcox]] as Dr. Elkins\n* [[Ann Dusenberry]] as Tina Wilcox\n* [[Mark Gruner]] as Michael \"Mike\" Brody\n* [[Susan French]] as Old Lady\n* [[Barry Coe]] as Tom Andrews\n* Gary Springer as Andy Nicholas\n* [[Donna Wilkes]] as Jackie Peters\n* [[Gary Dubin]] as Eddie Marchand\n* [[John Dukakis]] as Paul 'Polo' Loman\n* G.

He claimed that the planned plot was to involve the sons of Quint and Brody hunting a new shark.<ref name=\"Ref_\">{{harvnb|Baxter|1997|p=145}}</ref> Brown said that Spielberg did not want to direct the sequel because he felt that he had done the \"definitive shark movie\".<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Prigg\u00e98\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=8}}</ref> The director later added that his decision was influenced by the problems the ''Jaws'' production faced \u2013 \"I would have done the sequel if I hadn't had such a horrible time at sea on the first film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/08/steven-spielberg-jaws-interview/|title=Steven Spielberg talks about 'Jaws' \u2013 the greatest summer movie ever made|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|date=2011-06-08|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\nDespite Spielberg's rejection, the studio went ahead with plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month pre-production process. [[Howard Sackler]], who had contributed to the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a [[prequel]] based on the sinking of the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']], the story relayed by [[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]] in the first film. Although Universal president [[Sidney Sheinberg]] thought Sackler's [[Film treatment|treatment]] for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea.<ref name=\"Ref_a\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=24\u20135}}</ref> On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director [[John D. Hancock]] was chosen to helm the picture.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=27}}</ref> \n\nHancock began filming in June 1977. However, after nearly a month of filming, Universal and MCA executives disliked the dark, subtle tone that the film was taking and wanted a more lighthearted and action oriented story. Additionally, Hancock ran into trouble with Sheinberg, who suggested to Hancock and Tristan that his (Sheinberg's) wife, actress [[Lorraine Gary]] (Ellen Brody), \"should go out on a boat and help to rescue the kids.\" When told of the idea, Zanuck replied, \"Over my dead body.\" The next draft of the film's screenplay was turned in with Gary not going out to sea. Hancock says that this, and his later firing of another actress who turned out to be a Universal executive's girlfriend, contributed to his own dismissal from the film.<ref name=\"luke\">{{harvnb|Ford|2004|p=191}}</ref>\n\nHancock began to feel the pressure of directing his first epic adventure film \"with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas\".<ref name=\"Ref_c\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=66}}</ref> The producers were unhappy with his material, and on a Saturday evening in June 1977, after a meeting with the producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife left for [[Rome]] and production was shut down for a few weeks. The couple had been involved in the film for eighteen months.<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=70}}</ref> Hancock blamed his departure on the mechanical shark, telling a newspaper that it still could not swim or bite after a year and a half: \"You get a couple of shots, and [the shark] breaks.\"<ref name=\"kach78\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=78}}</ref> Echoing the first film's production, [[Carl Gottlieb]] was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence.<ref name=\"Ref_e\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=36\u20137}}</ref> Gottlieb wrote on location at [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]].<ref name=\"Gottlieb221\">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2010|p=221}}</ref> It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in the first place.<ref name=\"Ref_e\"/>\n\nAt this point, Spielberg considered returning to direct the sequel. Over the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial weekend]] in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's ''Indianapolis'' speech. Because of his contract for ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', however, he would not be able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=73}}</ref> Production designer [[Joe Alves]] (who would direct ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'') and [[Verna Fields]] (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it.<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Ref_g\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=74}}</ref> The request was declined by the [[Directors Guild of America]],<ref name=\"Ref_h\">{{harvnb|Rosenfield|1982|1}}</ref> partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'', had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to [[Jeannot Szwarc]], best known for the film ''[[Bug (1975 film)|Bug]]'' and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series ''[[Night Gallery]]''.<ref name=\"Ref_i\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=75\u20136}}</ref> Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated water skier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by [[Jeffrey Kramer]], who had been missing from the earlier script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.<ref name=\"Ref_j\">''Jaws 2: A Portrait by Actor Keith Gordon'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nThree sharks were built for the film. The first was the \"platform shark\", also referred to as the \"luxurious shark\". Special mechanical effects supervisor [[Robert Mattey]] and Roy Arbogast used the same body mould used for the shark in the first film.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The sharks from the original film had rotted behind sheds on the lower lot of Universal Studios in the intervening years, and the only pieces that were salvageable were the chromoly tube frames. Mattey's design was much more complicated and ambitious than the first film. The same (male) body was used, but a brand new head was made by sculptor Chris Mueller which made use of an all-new mouth mechanism, one which incorporated jowls to disguise the pinching of the cheeks that had proven to be a problem with the shark in the original film. The sharks for ''Jaws 2'' were known as ''Bruce Two'' (the sharks for the original film had been nicknamed \"Bruce\", after Steven Spielberg's lawyer), but on set they were referred to as \"Fidel\" and \"Harold\", the latter after David Brown's Beverly Hills lawyer.<ref name=\"kach77\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=77}}</ref>  The other shark props used were a fin and a full shark, both of which could be pulled by boats. \"Cable Junction\", the island shown in the film's climax, was actually a floating barge covered with fiber-glass rocks. This was created in order to enable the shark platform to be positioned to it as close as possible (a real island would have hindered this due to the upward slope of the seabed making the shark platform visible). Like the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers [[Ron & Valerie Taylor]] was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nAlthough the first film was commended for leaving the shark to the imagination until two thirds of the way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the dramatic \"first image of it coming out of the water\" in the first film could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented that there was no way that they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nLike the first film, shooting on water proved challenging. Scheider said that they were \"always contending with tides, surf and winds ... jellyfish, sharks, waterspouts and hurricane warnings.\"<ref name=\"kach77\"/> After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction. The saltwater's corrosive effect damaged some equipment, including the metal parts in the sharks.<ref name=\"kach77\"/>\n\n[[Susan Ford]], daughter of U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]], was hired to shoot publicity photographs.<ref name=\"kach76\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=76}}</ref> Many of these appeared in Ray Loynd's ''Jaws 2 Log'', a book documenting the film's production, similar to what Carl Gottlieb had done for the first film.\n\n===Location===\n[[Martha's Vineyard]] was again used as the location for the town scenes and [[Emerald Coast]] was included on this film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Betty Archer |title=GB teens helped keep 'Jaws 2' water scenes moving |url=https://news.gulfbreezenews.com/articles/gb-teens-helped-keep-jaws-2-water-scenes-moving/ |date=August 21, 2008 |access-date=January 17, 2018 |newspaper=Gulf Breeze News}}</ref> Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing.<ref name=\"Ref_k\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=60\u20132}}</ref> Shortly after the production arrived in June 1977, local newspaper the ''Grapevine'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|The ''Jaws'' people are back among us, more efficient, more organized and more moneyed.

Universal brought in actors, directors, producers and their wives, camera and crew people who needed housing, food and clothing for the movie. Services were needed for laundry, dry-cleaning and recreation.\" Navarre's Holiday Inn \"Holidome\" was used as the film's headquarters, with the ground floor converted into production offices, and some of the Gulf-front suites remodelled for David Brown and Roy Scheider.

Williams says that it was assumed by everyone that \"the music would come back also and be part of the cast ... it would require new music, certainly, but the signature music of ''Jaws'' should be used as well\". He compares this to \"the great tradition\" for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as ''[[Roy Rogers]]'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger (serial)|The Lone Ranger]]''. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc says Williams also composed a \"youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around when the kids are sailing or going out to sea. It was very inventive\".<ref name=\"musicdvd\">''The Music of Jaws 2'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nSzwarc said that the sequel's music should be \"more complex because it was a more complex film\". Williams says that this score is broader, allowing him to make more use of the orchestra, and use longer notes, and \"fill the space\" created by the director. Williams used a larger ensemble than for the first film, and \"the orchestral palette may have been broader or had longer notes\". Delays in shooting meant that Williams was forced to start working on the score before the film was completed. Szwarc discussed the film with the composer, showing him edited sequences and storyboards. The director praises Williams in being able to work under such difficult conditions.<ref name=\"musicdvd\"/> Critic Mike Beek suggests these time constraints enabled Williams \"to create themes based on ideas and suggestions, rather than a locked down print.\"<ref name=\"Beek\"/>\n\nCritics have praised Williams' score, comparing it favorably to the original. Williams \"uses a few basic elements of the original\u2014the obligatory shark motif, for one\u2014and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions.\" The score is \"more disturbing in places\" than the original, and \"Williams {{sic|fash|ion}} some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music.\" Because ''Jaws 2'' \"isn't a film that requires subtlety ...

Historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] says that in terms of foreign policy, Pitt  and other leaders were disappointed with his performance as a minister. Leeds, as he became upon his father's death in 1789, was anti-French but did not develop an active and aggressive foreign policy. Instead, King George III himself set the main lines of foreign policy before he became  mentally disabled.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783-1793'' (1994) p 55-56</ref>  Pitt's rejection of Leeds'  anti-Russian policy was the final blow and he left office in April 1791.<ref>William Hague   ''William Pitt the Younger''</ref>\n\nLeeds had done nothing to foster good relations with the newly independent [[United States|United States of America]]: two future Presidents,  [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], as envoys from the United States, both complained of his obstructive attitude and \"aversion to having anything to do with us\".<ref>[[David McCullough|McCullough, David]] ''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]''  Simon and Schuster New York 2001</ref> While Adams, who was rather  [[Anglophile]]  by inclination, was prepared to forgive and forget, Jefferson was not, and it can be argued that Leeds's only lasting achievement was to foster Jefferson's implacable hostility as [[President of the United States|President]] to Great Britain and its rulers.<ref>McCullough  ''John Adams''</ref>\n\nSubsequently Leeds took little part in politics: in 1792, hearing rumours that a new coalition might be formed, he unwisely offered himself as its  head and met with a firm rebuff from both Pitt and the King.<ref>Hague, William   ''William Pitt the Younger''  Harper Collins 2004</ref>\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Coat of arms of Osborne.jpg|thumb|200px|Ancestral arms of the Osborne family, Dukes of Leeds]]\nLeeds married firstly in 1773 [[Amelia Osborne, Marchioness of Carmarthen|Lady Amelia Darcy]], daughter of [[Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness]] on 29 November 1773.

He was succeeded in the dukedom by his eldest son from his first marriage, [[George Osborne, 6th Duke of Leeds]]. His second son from his first marriage, [[Francis Osborne, 1st Baron Godolphin|Lord Francis Osborne]], was created [[Baron Godolphin]] in 1832. The dowager Duchess of Leeds died in October 1837, aged 73.

Leeds, as he became upon his father's death in 1789, was anti-French but did not develop an active and aggressive foreign policy. Instead, King George III himself set the main lines of foreign policy before he became  mentally disabled.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783-1793'' (1994) p 55-56</ref>  Pitt's rejection of Leeds'  anti-Russian policy was the final blow and he left office in April 1791.<ref>William Hague   ''William Pitt the Younger''</ref>\n\nLeeds had done nothing to foster good relations with the newly independent [[United States|United States of America]]: two future Presidents,  [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], as envoys from the United States, both complained of his obstructive attitude and \"aversion to having anything to do with us\".<ref>[[David McCullough|McCullough, David]] ''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]''  Simon and Schuster New York 2001</ref> While Adams, who was rather  [[Anglophile]]  by inclination, was prepared to forgive and forget, Jefferson was not, and it can be argued that Leeds's only lasting achievement was to foster Jefferson's implacable hostility as [[President of the United States|President]] to Great Britain and its rulers.<ref>McCullough  ''John Adams''</ref>\n\nSubsequently Leeds took little part in politics: in 1792, hearing rumours that a new coalition might be formed, he unwisely offered himself as its  head and met with a firm rebuff from both Pitt and the King.<ref>Hague, William   ''William Pitt the Younger''  Harper Collins 2004</ref>\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Coat of arms of Osborne.jpg|thumb|200px|Ancestral arms of the Osborne family, Dukes of Leeds]]\nLeeds married firstly in 1773 [[Amelia Osborne, Marchioness of Carmarthen|Lady Amelia Darcy]], daughter of [[Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness]] on 29 November 1773.

He was succeeded in the dukedom by his eldest son from his first marriage, [[George Osborne, 6th Duke of Leeds]]. His second son from his first marriage, [[Francis Osborne, 1st Baron Godolphin|Lord Francis Osborne]], was created [[Baron Godolphin]] in 1832. The dowager Duchess of Leeds died in October 1837, aged 73.

The Schindlers suggested that he was wasting the assets within the guardianship account by transferring Terri Schiavo to a [[Pinellas Park, Florida]], [[hospice care|hospice]] \"after it was clear that she was not 'terminal' within Medicare guidelines\" for hospices. By this time, while still legally married to Terri Schiavo, Michael Schiavo was in a relationship with Jodi Centonze, and had fathered their first child. He said he chose not to divorce his wife and relinquish guardianship because he wanted to ensure her final wishes (not to be kept alive in a PVS) were carried out. The court denied the motion to remove the guardian, allowing that the evidence was not sufficient and in some instances, not relevant.

The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to [[recuse]] himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001, the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while  Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts.

The tape included Terri Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Terri \"clearly does not consistently respond to her mother\".

Bush]] and Congressional Republicans anticipated Greer's adverse ruling well before it was delivered and worked on a daily basis to find an alternative means of overturning the legal process by utilizing the authority of the [[United States Congress]]. On March 20, 2005, the Senate, by [[unanimous consent]], passed their version of a relief bill; since the vote was taken by voice vote, there was no official tally of those voting in favor and those opposed. Soon after Senate approval, the House of Representatives passed an identical version of the bill S.686, which came to be called the \"[[Palm Sunday Compromise]]\" and transferred jurisdiction of the Schiavo case to the federal courts. The bill passed the House on March 21, 2005, at 12:41&nbsp;a.m. ([[UTC-5]]). Bush flew to [[Washington, D.C.]] from his vacation in [[Texas]] in order to sign the bill into law at 1:11&nbsp;a.m.\n\nWhile the bill had been proposed by Republican Senators [[Rick Santorum]] and [[Mel Mart\u00ednez]], it also had the support of Democratic Senator [[Tom Harkin]] due to [[disability rights]] concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].<ref name=\"disability rights\"/> American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left;<ref name=\"disability rights\"/> however, in the Schiavo case, they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise.<ref name=\"Congress Debate\"/> According to [[Marilyn Golden]], Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.<ref name=\"disability rights\"/>\n\nAs in the state courts, all of the Schindlers' federal petitions and appeals were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant [[certiorari]], effectively ending the Schindlers' judicial options. At the same time, the so-called [[Schiavo memo]] surfaced, causing a political firestorm. The memo was written by [[Brian Darling]], the legal counsel to Florida Republican senator [[Mel Martinez]]. It suggested the Schiavo case offered \"a great political issue\" that would appeal to the party's [[base (politics)|base]] (core supporters) and could be used against Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Florida]], because he had refused to co-sponsor the bill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002213728_memo20.html|title=GOP memo says issue offers political rewards|author=Unsigned|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 4, 2005|accessdate=March 2, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306125620/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002213728_memo20.html|archive-date=March 6, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Nelson easily won re-election in 2006.\n\nSenator and physician [[Bill Frist]] opposed the removal of her feeding tube and in a speech delivered on the Senate Floor, challenged the diagnosis of Schiavo's physicians of Schiavo being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS): \"I question it based on a review of the video footage which I spent an hour or so looking at last night in my office\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Frist|first=Bill|title=Bill Frist : a senator speaks out on ethics, respect and compassion|year=2005|publisher=Monument Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-9769668-3-2|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0aFiYpPzsgYC&pg=PA195#v=onepage&q=%22I%20question%20it%20based%20on%20a%20review%22&f=false}}</ref> Frist was criticized by a medical ethicist at [[Northwestern University]] for making a diagnosis without personally examining the patient and for questioning the diagnosis when he was not a neurologist.<ref>[http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Letter_Frist_Schiavo_diagnosis_being_reviewed_in_Te_0630.html Letter: Frist Schiavo diagnosis being reviewed in Tennessee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029032011/http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Letter_Frist_Schiavo_diagnosis_being_reviewed_in_Te_0630.html |date=October 29, 2013 }} June 24, 2005</ref> After her death, the autopsy showed signs of long-term and irreversible damage to her brain consistent with PVS.<ref>[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/schiavo/61305autopsyrpt.pdf Medical Examiner's Report on the Schiavo Autopsy (PDF)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013124733/http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/schiavo/61305autopsyrpt.pdf |date=October 13, 2016 }} June 13, 2005</ref> Frist defended his actions after the autopsy.<ref>[[Anne E.

The [[autopsy]] occurred on April 1, 2005. It revealed extensive brain damage. The manner of death was certified as \"undetermined\". The autopsy was led by Chief Medical Examiner Jon R. Thogmartin, In addition to consultation with a neuropathologist (Stephen J. Nelson), Thogmartin also arranged for specialized cardiac and genetic examinations to be made. The official autopsy report<ref name=\"thogmartin\" /> was released on June 15, 2005. In addition to studying Terri Schiavo's remains, Thogmartin scoured court, medical and other records and interviewed her family members, doctors and other relevant parties. Examination of Schiavo's nervous system by neuropathologist Stephen J. Nelson, revealed extensive injury. The [[human brain|brain]] itself weighed only {{convert|615|g|abbr=on}}, only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight, an effect caused by the loss of a massive number of neurons. Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all [[List of regions in the human brain|brain regions]], including the [[cerebral cortex]], the [[thalamus]], the [[basal ganglia]], the [[hippocampus]], the [[cerebellum]], and the [[midbrain]]. The neuropathologic changes in her brain were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal [[Betz cell|neurons]] that comprise some 70% of cortical cells \u2013 critical to the functioning of the cortex \u2013 were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen from the front of the cortex to the back, was also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalamus) \u2013 another common pathologic finding in cases of PVS. The damage was, in the words of Thogmartin, \"irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/06/15/schiavo.autopsy|title=Autopsy: No sign Schiavo was abused: Findings show woman's brain 'profoundly atrophied'|author=Phillips, Rich Producer|publisher=CNN|date=June 7, 2005|accessdate=May 3, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421071228/http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/06/15/schiavo.autopsy/|archive-date=April 21, 2006|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe cardiac pathologist who studied Schiavo's heart found it and the [[coronary circulation|coronary vessels]] to be healthy, which excludes the possibility that her initial collapse was the result of [[myocardial infarction]], although there was a localized area of healed inflammation (opening the possibility of [[myocarditis]]). Thogmartin found that \"there was no proof that Terri Schiavo ever had an eating disorder such as bulimia.\" Regarding the possibility of strangulation or domestic violence as a cause of Schiavo's initial collapse, the report states: \"No trauma was noted on any of the numerous physical exams or radiographs performed on Mrs. Schiavo on the day of, in the days after, or in the months after her initial collapse. Indeed, within an hour of her initial hospital admission, radiographic examination of her cervical spine was negative. Specifically, external signs of strangulation including cutaneous or deep neck injury, facial/conjunctival petechiae, and other blunt trauma were not observed or recorded during her initial hospital admission.

She died after being removed from life support in 1990.<ref name=\"cruzan death\">{{cite web|title=The Death of Nancy Cruzan|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1014.html|publisher=Frontline, PBS|date=March 24, 1992|access-date=September 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514022938/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1014.html|archive-date=May 14, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Terri Schiavo case\" actually refers to a series of cases. It differed from the Quinlan and Cruzan cases by involving settled law rather than breaking new legal ground on the right-to-die issue. In 2006, Shepherd said that it was \"unclear\" whether the Schiavo case represents a [[landmark decision]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Lois |last=Shepherd |url=http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/llj/pdfs/shepherd.pdf |title=Terri Schiavo: Unsettling The Settled |journal=Loyola University Chicago Law Journal |year=2006 |volume=37 |page=297 |access-date=October 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502171024/http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/llj/pdfs/shepherd.pdf |archive-date=May 2, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Schiavo case instead involved a dispute between family members over what Schiavo's wishes would have been for such a situation. According to medical ethicist Matthew Stonecipher, \"The movement to challenge the decisions made for Terri Schiavo threatened to destabilize end-of-life law that had developed over the last quarter of the 20th century, principally through the cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan.\"<ref name=\"M Stonecipher\"/> The outcome of the Schiavo case was also in part determined by a 1990 Florida case, ''Guardianship of Estelle Browning''.<ref name=\"Browning Schiavo\"/><ref name=\"Browning TBO\">{{cite news|last=Sommer|first=David|title=Schiavo Case Could Cause Change In Law|url=http://news.tbo.com/news/MGA1IEYHYLD.html|accessdate=November 30, 2012|newspaper=Tampa Bay Online|date=October 19, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031023002811/http://news.tbo.com/news/MGA1IEYHYLD.html |archivedate=October 23, 2003 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In that case, George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo in the Schiavo case, represented a Browning relative. Felos successfully argued before the [[Florida Supreme Court]] that Browning's feeding tube should be removed. The elderly Browning had expressed, in a living will, her wish not to be kept alive by any artificial means, including receiving food and water \"by a gastric tube or intravenously\". At that time, it was common to remove people from ventilators, but the law in Florida was not clear on removing them from feeding tubes. In a landmark ruling, the Florida Supreme Court decided that Browning had \"the constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right extends to all relevant decisions concerning one's health\".<ref name=\"Browning Schiavo\"/>\n\n===Disability rights===\nDuring the years of legal proceedings, [[disability rights]] groups and activists closely monitored and involved themselves in the case. In March 2003, twelve disability rights groups, led by [[Not Dead Yet]], along with four other amici, filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo's feeding tube.<ref name=\"amicus brief\">{{cite web|last=Townsend|first=Liz|title=Disability Rights Groups File Amicus Brief in Terri Schiavo Case''|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-98775346.html|publisher=National Right to Life News|accessdate=November 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610055842/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-98775346.html|archive-date=June 10, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}{{Subscription|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support from patients unable to give consent.<ref name=\"disability rights\"/><ref name=\"Congress Debate\">{{cite news|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|title=Congress Ready to Again Debate End-of-Life Issues|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/28/politics/28cong.html?pagewanted=print&position=&_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 28, 2005|access-date=February 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132316/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/28/politics/28cong.html?pagewanted=print&position=&_r=0|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nThey argued that persistent vegetative state is frequently misdiagnosed, and that the reasons for withdrawal of life support from a patient should be scrutinized since even family member surrogates can have conflicts of interest.

The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to [[recuse]] himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001, the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while  Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts.

In October 2002, on [[remand (court procedure)|remand]] by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new [[computed axial tomography]] scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe [[cerebral atrophy]]. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were William Maxfield, a [[radiology|radiologist]], and four [[neurology|neurologists]]: [[William Hammesfahr]], Ronald Cranford, Melvin Greer and Peter Bambakidis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/11/10/Tampabay/Schiavo_tapes__snippe.shtml|title=Schiavo tapes: snippets, then not much|last=Nohlgren|first=Stephen|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=November 10, 2003|accessdate=April 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111053415/http://www.sptimes.com/2003/11/10/Tampabay/Schiavo_tapes__snippe.shtml|archive-date=January 11, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe five doctors examined Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Terri herself. Cranford, Greer, and Bambakidis testified that Terri Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state. Drs. Maxfield and Hammesfahr testified that she was in a [[minimally conscious state]]. As part of the court-ordered medical exam, six hours of video of Terri Schiavo were taped and filed at the Pinellas County courthouse. The tape included Terri Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Terri \"clearly does not consistently respond to her mother\". From that six hours of video, the Schindlers and their supporters produced six clips showing reactions and emotions, totaling less than six minutes, and released those clips to public websites.<ref name=\"tbo\">{{cite news|url=http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBQ67CTI6E.html|title=Schiavo Videotapes Offer Powerful But Misleading Evidence|last=Smith|first=Brad|work=Tampa Tribune|date=March 20, 2005|accessdate=February 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320120815/http://news.tbo.com/news/MGBQ67CTI6E.html |archivedate=March 20, 2005 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Judge Greer ruled that Terri Schiavo was in a PVS, and was beyond hope of significant improvement.

On September 11, 2003, the Schindlers petitioned the court to forestall removal of the feeding tube in order to provide for \"eight weeks' therapy\". Accompanying the petition were four affidavits from members of the Schindler family and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon. At the hearing, the Schindlers' counsel read into the record additional affidavits from three speech professionals and two nurses. In particular, Nurse Carla Sauer lyer asserted that she was able to feed Terri Schiavo orally but that Michael characterized any such interaction as \"therapy\" and ordered her not to do so. Iyer claimed in her affidavit that her initial training in 1996 consisted solely of the instruction, \"Do what Michael Schiavo tells you or you're terminated\", and that standing orders were not to contact the Schindler family, but that she \"would call them anyway\".\n\nOn September 17, 2003, Judge [[George Greer]] denied the petition, and wrote that \"the Petition is an attempt by Mr. and Mrs. Schindler to re-litigate the entire case.

Bush]] and Congressional Republicans anticipated Greer's adverse ruling well before it was delivered and worked on a daily basis to find an alternative means of overturning the legal process by utilizing the authority of the [[United States Congress]]. On March 20, 2005, the Senate, by [[unanimous consent]], passed their version of a relief bill; since the vote was taken by voice vote, there was no official tally of those voting in favor and those opposed. Soon after Senate approval, the House of Representatives passed an identical version of the bill S.686, which came to be called the \"[[Palm Sunday Compromise]]\" and transferred jurisdiction of the Schiavo case to the federal courts. The bill passed the House on March 21, 2005, at 12:41&nbsp;a.m. ([[UTC-5]]). Bush flew to [[Washington, D.C.]] from his vacation in [[Texas]] in order to sign the bill into law at 1:11&nbsp;a.m.\n\nWhile the bill had been proposed by Republican Senators [[Rick Santorum]] and [[Mel Mart\u00ednez]], it also had the support of Democratic Senator [[Tom Harkin]] due to [[disability rights]] concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].<ref name=\"disability rights\"/> American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left;<ref name=\"disability rights\"/> however, in the Schiavo case, they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise.<ref name=\"Congress Debate\"/> According to [[Marilyn Golden]], Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.<ref name=\"disability rights\"/>\n\nAs in the state courts, all of the Schindlers' federal petitions and appeals were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant [[certiorari]], effectively ending the Schindlers' judicial options. At the same time, the so-called [[Schiavo memo]] surfaced, causing a political firestorm. The memo was written by [[Brian Darling]], the legal counsel to Florida Republican senator [[Mel Martinez]]. It suggested the Schiavo case offered \"a great political issue\" that would appeal to the party's [[base (politics)|base]] (core supporters) and could be used against Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Florida]], because he had refused to co-sponsor the bill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002213728_memo20.html|title=GOP memo says issue offers political rewards|author=Unsigned|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 4, 2005|accessdate=March 2, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306125620/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002213728_memo20.html|archive-date=March 6, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Nelson easily won re-election in 2006.\n\nSenator and physician [[Bill Frist]] opposed the removal of her feeding tube and in a speech delivered on the Senate Floor, challenged the diagnosis of Schiavo's physicians of Schiavo being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS): \"I question it based on a review of the video footage which I spent an hour or so looking at last night in my office\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Frist|first=Bill|title=Bill Frist : a senator speaks out on ethics, respect and compassion|year=2005|publisher=Monument Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-9769668-3-2|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0aFiYpPzsgYC&pg=PA195#v=onepage&q=%22I%20question%20it%20based%20on%20a%20review%22&f=false}}</ref> Frist was criticized by a medical ethicist at [[Northwestern University]] for making a diagnosis without personally examining the patient and for questioning the diagnosis when he was not a neurologist.<ref>[http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Letter_Frist_Schiavo_diagnosis_being_reviewed_in_Te_0630.html Letter: Frist Schiavo diagnosis being reviewed in Tennessee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029032011/http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Letter_Frist_Schiavo_diagnosis_being_reviewed_in_Te_0630.html |date=October 29, 2013 }} June 24, 2005</ref> After her death, the autopsy showed signs of long-term and irreversible damage to her brain consistent with PVS.<ref>[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/schiavo/61305autopsyrpt.pdf Medical Examiner's Report on the Schiavo Autopsy (PDF)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013124733/http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/schiavo/61305autopsyrpt.pdf |date=October 13, 2016 }} June 13, 2005</ref> Frist defended his actions after the autopsy.<ref>[[Anne E.

The order was appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals the following day, which resulted in an automatic stay under state law. While the stay was in effect, Florida Department of Law Enforcement personnel prepared to take custody of Terri Schiavo and transfer her to a local hospital for reinsertion of the feeding tube. Once Greer was made aware of the stay, he ordered it lifted and all parties stood down. Governor Bush decided to obey the court order despite enormous pressure from the political right. If Bush (or the Florida Legislature) had ignored Greer's order by attempting to remove her from the hospice, a confrontation between the Pinellas Park Police Department and the FDLE agents could have ensued.

The [[autopsy]] occurred on April 1, 2005. It revealed extensive brain damage. The manner of death was certified as \"undetermined\". The autopsy was led by Chief Medical Examiner Jon R. Thogmartin, In addition to consultation with a neuropathologist (Stephen J. Nelson), Thigmartin also arranged for specialized cardiac and genetic examinations to be made. The official autopsy report<ref name=\"thogmartin\" /> was released on June 15, 2005. In addition to studying Terri Schiavo's remains, Thogmartin scoured court, medical and other records and interviewed her family members, doctors and other relevant parties. Examination of Schiavo's nervous system by neuropathologist Stephen J. Nelson, revealed extensive injury. The [[human brain|brain]] itself weighed only {{convert|615|g|abbr=on}}, only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight, an effect caused by the loss of a massive number of neurons. Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all [[List of regions in the human brain|brain regions]], including the [[cerebral cortex]], the [[thalamus]], the [[basal ganglia]], the [[hippocampus]], the [[cerebellum]], and the [[midbrain]]. The neuropathologic changes in her brain were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal [[Betz cell|neurons]] that comprise some 70% of cortical cells \u2013 critical to the functioning of the cortex \u2013 were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen from the front of the cortex to the back, was also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalamus) \u2013 another common pathologic finding in cases of PVS. The damage was, in the words of Thogmartin, \"irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/06/15/schiavo.autopsy|title=Autopsy: No sign Schiavo was abused: Findings show woman's brain 'profoundly atrophied'|author=Phillips, Rich Producer|publisher=CNN|date=June 7, 2005|accessdate=May 3, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421071228/http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/06/15/schiavo.autopsy/|archive-date=April 21, 2006|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe cardiac pathologist who studied Schiavo's heart found it and the [[coronary circulation|coronary vessels]] to be healthy, which excludes the possibility that her initial collapse was the result of [[myocardial infarction]], although there was a localized area of healed inflammation (opening the possibility of [[myocarditis]]). Thogmartin found that \"there was no proof that Terri Schiavo ever had an eating disorder such as bulimia.\" Regarding the possibility of strangulation or domestic violence as a cause of Schiavo's initial collapse, the report states: \"No trauma was noted on any of the numerous physical exams or radiographs performed on Mrs. Schiavo on the day of, in the days after, or in the months after her initial collapse. Indeed, within an hour of her initial hospital admission, radiographic examination of her cervical spine was negative. Specifically, external signs of strangulation including cutaneous or deep neck injury, facial/conjunctival petechiae, and other blunt trauma were not observed or recorded during her initial hospital admission. Autopsy examination of her neck structures 15 years after her initial collapse did not detect any signs of remote trauma, but, with such a delay, the exam was unlikely to show any residual neck findings.\"<ref name=\"thogmartin\" />\n\nRegarding the cause and manner of Schiavo's death, Thogmartin wrote, \"Mrs. Schiavo suffered severe anoxic brain injury.

At that time, it was common to remove people from ventilators, but the law in Florida was not clear on removing them from feeding tubes.

This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\n[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used for producing soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.\n\nThe [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process to make soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co \u2013 Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Buxton Lime Firms ===\n[[File:Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington 1964.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Limestone%20train%20from%20Tunstead%20to%20ICI%20Winnington%201964.jpg|thumb|'''Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington, 1964''']]\nThe arrival of the main railway lines from [[Manchester]] and [[London]] to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBuxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891. BLF controlled the price of stone and lime from its 17 initial quarries. BLF owned over 1500 acres of land with about 100 lime kilns and 3 collieries. It produced 360,000 tons of limestone and 280,000 tons of lime per year. Larger, more advanced kilns were now in use and firebricks were introduced into kilns from 1907. By 1915 BLF had developed or acquired an additional 9 quarries including the opening of: Small Dale in 1891, Dowlow in 1898, Buxton South in 1900, Topley Pike in 1907, Brier Low in 1907, Cowdale in 1908.

This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\n[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used for producing soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.\n\nThe [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process to make soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co \u2013 Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Buxton Lime Firms ===\n[[File:Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington 1964.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Limestone%20train%20from%20Tunstead%20to%20ICI%20Winnington%201964.jpg|thumb|'''Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington, 1964''']]\nThe arrival of the main railway lines from [[Manchester]] and [[London]] to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBuxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891. BLF controlled the price of stone and lime from its 17 initial quarries. BLF owned over 1500 acres of land with about 100 lime kilns and 3 collieries. It produced 360,000 tons of limestone and 280,000 tons of lime per year. Larger, more advanced kilns were now in use and firebricks were introduced into kilns from 1907. By 1915 BLF had developed or acquired an additional 9 quarries including the opening of: Small Dale in 1891, Dowlow in 1898, Buxton South in 1900, Topley Pike in 1907, Brierlow in 1907, Cowdale in 1908.
