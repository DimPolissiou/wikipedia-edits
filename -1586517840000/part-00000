{"title_page": "Kilnavert", "text_new": "'''Kilnavert''' ({{Irish derived place name|Cill na bhFeart|The Church of the Tumuli}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The present local pronunciation is ''Killnavart'' but up to the 1870s the local pronunciation was ''Kilfertin''.[[File:St Patrick&#039;s church, Kildallon, Co.

Cavan - geograph.org.uk - 1385727]]\n\n==Geography==\n\nKilnavert is bounded on the north by [[Lissanover]] and [[Killycluggin]] townlands, on the west by [[Gortnaleck]] and [[Camagh]] townlands, on the south by [[Derrycassan]] townland and on the east by [[Corran, County Cavan]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Camagh Lough, a gravel pit, a wood, streams, a spring well and dug wells. Kilnavert is traversed by the national secondary [[R205 road (Ireland)]], minor roads, rural lanes and the disused [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]]. The townland covers 188 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe reason for the Irish name Cill na bhFeart meaning ''The Church of the Tumuli'', is that there is a Roman Catholic church and eight prehistoric monuments in the townland, including 3 barrows ([[Tumulus]]), 3 standing stones, 1 wedge tomb and 1 stone circle.<ref name=\"templeport1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/magh-slecht-dara-fort/plain-of-blood.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Plain of Blood : A Study of the Ritual Landscape of Magh Slecht, Co.

Kilnavert was originally named Fossa Sl\u00e9cht or Rath Sl\u00e9cht and was the first Christian church founded in [[County Cavan]] by [[Saint Patrick]]. [[T\u00edrech\u00e1n]]'s Memoir written c.680 A.D.<ref>[Bury, J.B. (1902) ''T\u00edrech\u00e1n's Memoir of St. Patrick'']</ref> states-\n\n''Patrick however, sending Methbrain, a foreign kinsman of Patrick's, to Fossam Sl\u00e9cht, who told wonders of God.''\n\nThe 9th century [[Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii]], p.&nbsp;93, states- ''Patrick founded a church in that stead, namely, Domnach Maighe Sleacht, and left therein Mabran [whose cognomen is] Barbarus Patricii, a relative of his and a prophet. And there is Patrick's well, wherein he baptized many. Then Patrick went into the province of Connaught by Snam da En over the Shannon''.\n \nMethbrain, also known as [[Banban the Wise]] was the first Christian priest of Templeport.\n\nKilnavert is mentioned several times in the 14th century Book of Magauran.<ref>{{Citation |author= L. McKenna |title=The Book of Magauran |year=1947 |ref=BM}}</ref>\n\nFor example-\n\nPoem 21, stanza 18, written c.1338 refers to Saint Patrick at Kilnavert-\n\n''One day when Patrick lay to rest at fair soft-grassed Chill Fhearta, this vision, so consoling to us, was given to his prophetic eye......''\n\nPoem 2, Stanza 36 written c.1291\n\n''Achadh Fearta, home of stout heroes, where the tombs of our forebears lie side by side. Its name comes from the tombs of the noble Gaoidhil being placed unceasingly on that stone-strewn plain.''\n\nSince the 5th century, Kilnavert has formed part of the church lands belonging to Kilnavert Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then in 1609 granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nOn 26 October 1579 [[Pope Gregory XIII]] asked [[Richard Brady]], the [[Bishop of Ardagh]] to settle a dispute where the parish priest of Templeport, Fergal Magauran, claimed the chapel of ''Cillfert'' was usurped by nobles.<ref>Vatican Archives, Dataria Apostolica, Minutae Brevium Lateranensium, n. 20099.</ref>\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the church lands of Kilfert to consist of two polls of land at a yearly value of 2 shillings''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GuNaAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA71&dq=Kilfert&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOv8vT2LrdAhVLIMAKHUQjD_gQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=Kilfert&f=false]</ref>\n\nBy grant dated 6 March 1605, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of 2 polls of ''Kilfeart'' for 21 years at an annual rent of 5 shillings to Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]].\n\nBy grant dated 10 August 1607, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of ''the lands of Kilfearte containing 2 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of \u00a30-6s-6d'' to the aforesaid Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]] of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]].\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte included 2 polls of Killfeart lying near the chaple of Killfeart which belongs to the church of Templeport''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=popOAAAAIAAJ&dq=killfeart+templeporte+killadough&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=killfeart]</ref>\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport included two polls of land adjoyninge to the chapple of Kilfert, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 12d per annum''. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 2 polls in Kilfert'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]].\n\nBy deed dated 17 July 1639, [[William Bedell]], the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], extended the above lease of ''Killfert'' to Oliver Lambert's son, [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as ''The Lord of Cavan''.\n\nOn 19 January 1586 Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] granted a pardon (No. 4813) to ''Edmund M'Cormuck M'Ferrall Magawran of Kilfert'' for fighting against the Queen's forces.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Irish Fiants of the Tudor Sovereigns: During the Reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Philip & Mary, and Elizabeth I|author=Nicholls, K.W.|date=1994|volume=2|publisher=\u00c9amonn de B\u00farca for Edmund Burke|isbn=9780946130085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=salDAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe said Edmund McGovern was the great-grandson of [[Cormac M\u00e1g Shamhradh\u00e1in]], the Roman Catholic [[Bishop of Kilmore]] diocese, Ireland from 1476 to 1480 and the anti-bishop of Kilmore from 1480 to 1511.\n\n[[John O'Hart]] in his book ''Irish Pedigrees; or the Origin and Stem of the Irish Nation'', p.&nbsp;414, mentions an incident that occurred at Kilnavert Church c.1590.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/irishpedigreesor_01ohar |title=Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation : O'Hart, John : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n''Bryan Dolan came with his two sons Cormac and Charles to the neighbourhood of Ballymagauran, near the end of the sixteenth century. A bad time it was for priests and papists; yet, notwithstanding, Cormac and Charles rode on Sunday mornings to '''Killnavart''', to hear Mass, a distance of some ten or twelve miles; and, having come there, they attached their horses by their bridle-reins to the branches of trees near the chapel. Baron MacGauran was then Earl of Tullaghagh, and heard Mass at '''Killnavart'''. He observed the two strange young men at Mass, and their horses tied by their bridles to trees near the chapel; he enquired to whom the horses belonged, and where the owners were from. Having been informed on those points, the Baron invited the young men to dinner on the following Sunday; and soon afterwards proffered them a residence in the neighbourhood of Ballymagauran, and they willingly accepted the invitation. Almost immediately afterwards Cormac Dolan, the elder son, married a near relative of the Baron,\u2014the daughter of Terence MacGauran, who was better known as Trealach Caoch or \"Blind Terry,\" in consequence of his being squint-eyed. But the Baron's hospitality and Dolan's marriage became a great misfortune to both parties.''\n''In due time after the marriage a son was born to Cormac Dolan; about the same time another child was born for Baron MacGauran, who claimed that his relative Cormac Dolan's wife and daughter of Blind Terry should nurse his (the Baron's) child. Bryan Dolan took this demand as a great insult: he instructed his daughter-in-law to say that he had not come so low that she should become a \"hippin-washer\" to any man. This message enraged the Baron to madness; he at once rode to Dolan's house, called for the old man, whom he seized by the hair of the head and dragged him by the horse's side at full gallop, and threw him dead on the road. The sons Cormac and Charles seeing the Baron gallop furiously to their house, and immediately galloping back dragging something by his horse's side, one said to the other \"the Baron is dragging something after him;\" the other exclaimed with an oath \"it is my father,\" and, snapping up a gun that lay near, he rushed to the road and shot the Baron dead on the spot. Old Dolan and the Baron were just buried when the relatives and retainers of the Baron came at night, broke into Dolan's dwelling, and killed the brothers Cormac and Charles. Cormac's wife exclaimed, were there none of the friends of Blind Terry there? They spared her and her child, whose name was Rodger, and reared him up as one of themselves.''\n\nThe Baron MacGauran referred to was probably the chief of the McGovern Clan, [[Tomas \u00d3g M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]], who lived in [[Ballymagauran]] and who received a pardon on 19 January 1586 from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], ''Thomas oge m'Brien m'Thomas Magawran, of Magawranstowne'', for fighting against the Queen's forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofdeputyke1416irel/reportofdeputyke1416irel_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"The ... report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records in Ireland / presented to both houses of the Parliament by command of Her Majesty\" |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Kilfart''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf |title=Map of Tullyhaw, County Cavan |format=PDF |website=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html |title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map |website=Templeport.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as ''Kilfart''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Kilfert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 |title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project |website=Downsurvey.tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Killfert''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Kilfart''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Kilfort'' which map meant the land was still belonging to the Anglican Church of Ireland.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The present local pronunciation is ''Killnavart'' but up to the 1870s the local pronunciation was ''Kilfertin''.[[File:St Patrick&#039;s church, Kildallon, Co.

Its chief geographical features are Camagh Lough, a gravel pit, a wood, streams, a spring well and dug wells. Kilnavert is traversed by the national secondary [[R205 road (Ireland)]], minor roads, rural lanes and the disused [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]]. The townland covers 188 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe reason for the Irish name Cill na bhFeart meaning ''The Church of the Tumuli'', is that there is a Roman Catholic church and eight prehistoric monuments in the townland, including 3 barrows ([[Tumulus]]), 3 standing stones, 1 wedge tomb and 1 stone circle.<ref name=\"templeport1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/magh-slecht-dara-fort/plain-of-blood.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Plain of Blood : A Study of the Ritual Landscape of Magh Slecht, Co.

Kilnavert was originally named Fossa Sl\u00e9cht or Rath Sl\u00e9cht and was the first Christian church founded in [[County Cavan]] by [[Saint Patrick]]. [[T\u00edrech\u00e1n]]'s Memoir written c.680 A.D.<ref>[Bury, J.B. (1902) ''T\u00edrech\u00e1n's Memoir of St. Patrick'']</ref> states-\n\n''Patrick however, sending Methbrain, a foreign kinsman of Patrick's, to Fossam Sl\u00e9cht, who told wonders of God.''\n\nThe 9th century [[Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii]], p.&nbsp;93, states- ''Patrick founded a church in that stead, namely, Domnach Maighe Sleacht, and left therein Mabran [whose cognomen is] Barbarus Patricii, a relative of his and a prophet. And there is Patrick's well, wherein he baptized many. Then Patrick went into the province of Connaught by Snam da En over the Shannon''.\n \nMethbrain, also known as [[Banban the Wise]] was the first Christian priest of Templeport.\n\nKilnavert is mentioned several times in the 14th century Book of Magauran.<ref>{{Citation |author= L. McKenna |title=The Book of Magauran |year=1947 |ref=BM}}</ref>\n\nFor example-\n\nPoem 21, stanza 18, written c.1338 refers to Saint Patrick at Kilnavert-\n\n''One day when Patrick lay to rest at fair soft-grassed Chill Fhearta, this vision, so consoling to us, was given to his prophetic eye......''\n\nPoem 2, Stanza 36 written c.1291\n\n''Achadh Fearta, home of stout heroes, where the tombs of our forebears lie side by side. Its name comes from the tombs of the noble Gaoidhil being placed unceasingly on that stone-strewn plain.''\n\nSince the 5th century, Kilnavert has formed part of the church lands belonging to Kilnavert Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then in 1609 granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nOn 26 October 1579 [[Pope Gregory XIII]] asked [[Richard Brady]], the [[Bishop of Ardagh]] to settle a dispute where the parish priest of Templeport, Fergal Magauran, claimed the chapel of ''Cillfert'' was usurped by nobles.<ref>Vatican Archives, Dataria Apostolica, Minutae Brevium Lateranensium, n. 20099.</ref>\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the church lands of Kilfert to consist of two polls of land at a yearly value of 2 shillings''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GuNaAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA71&dq=Kilfert&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOv8vT2LrdAhVLIMAKHUQjD_gQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=Kilfert&f=false]</ref>\n\nBy grant dated 6 March 1605, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of 2 polls of ''Kilfeart'' for 21 years at an annual rent of 5 shillings to Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]].\n\nBy grant dated 10 August 1607, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted a lease of ''the lands of Kilfearte containing 2 pulls for 21 years at an annual rent of \u00a30-6s-6d'' to the aforesaid Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]] of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]].\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte included 2 polls of Killfeart lying near the chaple of Killfeart which belongs to the church of Templeport''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=popOAAAAIAAJ&dq=killfeart+templeporte+killadough&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=killfeart]</ref>\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport included two polls of land adjoyninge to the chapple of Kilfert, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 12d per annum''. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 2 polls in Kilfert'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]].\n\nBy deed dated 17 July 1639, [[William Bedell]], the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], extended the above lease of ''Killfert'' to Oliver Lambert's son, [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as ''The Lord of Cavan''.\n\nOn 19 January 1586 Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] granted a pardon (No. 4813) to ''Edmund M'Cormuck M'Ferrall Magawran of Kilfert'' for fighting against the Queen's forces.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Irish Fiants of the Tudor Sovereigns: During the Reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Philip & Mary, and Elizabeth I|author=Nicholls, K.W.|date=1994|volume=2|publisher=\u00c9amonn de B\u00farca for Edmund Burke|isbn=9780946130085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=salDAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe said Edmund McGovern was the great-grandson of [[Cormac M\u00e1g Shamhradh\u00e1in]], the Roman Catholic [[Bishop of Kilmore]] diocese, Ireland from 1476 to 1480 and the anti-bishop of Kilmore from 1480 to 1511.\n\n[[John O'Hart]] in his book ''Irish Pedigrees; or the Origin and Stem of the Irish Nation'', p.&nbsp;414, mentions an incident that occurred at Kilnavert Church c.1590.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/irishpedigreesor_01ohar |title=Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation : O'Hart, John : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n''Bryan Dolan came with his two sons Cormac and Charles to the neighbourhood of Ballymagauran, near the end of the sixteenth century. A bad time it was for priests and papists; yet, notwithstanding, Cormac and Charles rode on Sunday mornings to '''Killnavart''', to hear Mass, a distance of some ten or twelve miles; and, having come there, they attached their horses by their bridle-reins to the branches of trees near the chapel. Baron MacGauran was then Earl of Tullaghagh, and heard Mass at '''Killnavart'''. He observed the two strange young men at Mass, and their horses tied by their bridles to trees near the chapel; he enquired to whom the horses belonged, and where the owners were from. Having been informed on those points, the Baron invited the young men to dinner on the following Sunday; and soon afterwards proffered them a residence in the neighbourhood of Ballymagauran, and they willingly accepted the invitation. Almost immediately afterwards Cormac Dolan, the elder son, married a near relative of the Baron,\u2014the daughter of Terence MacGauran, who was better known as Trealach Caoch or \"Blind Terry,\" in consequence of his being squint-eyed. But the Baron's hospitality and Dolan's marriage became a great misfortune to both parties.''\n''In due time after the marriage a son was born to Cormac Dolan; about the same time another child was born for Baron MacGauran, who claimed that his relative Cormac Dolan's wife and daughter of Blind Terry should nurse his (the Baron's) child. Bryan Dolan took this demand as a great insult: he instructed his daughter-in-law to say that he had not come so low that she should become a \"hippin-washer\" to any man. This message enraged the Baron to madness; he at once rode to Dolan's house, called for the old man, whom he seized by the hair of the head and dragged him by the horse's side at full gallop, and threw him dead on the road. The sons Cormac and Charles seeing the Baron gallop furiously to their house, and immediately galloping back dragging something by his horse's side, one said to the other \"the Baron is dragging something after him;\" the other exclaimed with an oath \"it is my father,\" and, snapping up a gun that lay near, he rushed to the road and shot the Baron dead on the spot. Old Dolan and the Baron were just buried when the relatives and retainers of the Baron came at night, broke into Dolan's dwelling, and killed the brothers Cormac and Charles. Cormac's wife exclaimed, were there none of the friends of Blind Terry there? They spared her and her child, whose name was Rodger, and reared him up as one of themselves.''\n\nThe Baron MacGauran referred to was probably the chief of the McGovern Clan, [[Tomas \u00d3g M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]], who lived in [[Ballymagauran]] and who received a pardon on 19 January 1586 from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], ''Thomas oge m'Brien m'Thomas Magawran, of Magawranstowne'', for fighting against the Queen's forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofdeputyke1416irel/reportofdeputyke1416irel_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"The ... report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records in Ireland / presented to both houses of the Parliament by command of Her Majesty\" |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Kilfart''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf |title=Map of Tullyhaw, County Cavan |format=PDF |website=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html |title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map |website=Templeport.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as ''Kilfart''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Kilfert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 |title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project |website=Downsurvey.tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Killfert''.\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Kilfort''.\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Kilfart''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts Kilnavert as still belonging to the Anglican Church of Ireland.

There are 5 lance-shaped, very hairy, green to red [[sepal]]s, mostly {{convert|10-18|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long. The [[petal]]s are {{convert|20-25|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is purple, lilac or mauve and white inside with a few purple spots. The tube is mostly [[glabrousness|glabrous]] on the outside and filled with woolly hairs inside. The 4 [[stamen]]s are fully enclosed in the petal tube.

In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog fighter that does battle with numerous brutal opponents, and wins the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]] twice. The last two entries in the series are  ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' and ''[[Creed II]]'', that serve as spin-off films focusing on [[Donnie Creed|Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed]], the son of the ill-fated boxer [[Apollo Creed]], to whom the long retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role during the 2010s brought Stallone praise, and his first [[Golden Globe]] award for the first ''Creed'', as well as a third [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/golden-globes/2016/01/12/golden-globes-sylvester-stallone-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-apology/|title=Sylvester Stallone says he owes 'Creed' team 'everything' after Globes omission|website=EW.com}}</ref>\n\nStallone had similar box-office success, portraying the [[PTSD]] plagued soldier [[John Rambo]] in the five [[Rambo (film series)|''Rambo'' films]] (1982\u20132019) and as mercenary [[List of characters from The Expendables film series#Barney Ross|Barney Ross]] in the three [[The Expendables (film series)|''The Expendables'' films]] (2010\u20132014). He wrote or co-wrote most of the films in his three biggest franchises, and directed many of them.\n\nStallone's film ''[[Rocky]]'' was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]], and had its props placed in the [[Smithsonian Museum]]. His use of the front entrance to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the ''Rocky'' series led the area to be nicknamed the [[Rocky Steps]], and [[Philadelphia]] has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum.

A personal disappointment was failing to earn himself a spot as an Italian extra in what was to become one of the most massive hits of 1972 - ''[[The Godfather]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/sylvester-stallone-was-rejected-as-extra-in-the-godfather/|title=Sylvester Stallone was rejected as extra in \u2018The Godfather\u2019|date=February 27, 2016}}</ref> He could not understand why he was rejected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.projectcasting.com/news/sylvester-stallone-the-godfather/|title=Stallone: I Was Turned Down for an Extra Role in 'The Godfather'|date=February 25, 2016}}</ref> Instead, he was relegated to a background role in another Hollywood hit; ''[[What's Up, Doc|What's Up, Doc?]]'', with [[Barbra Streisand]]. Stallone is hardly visible in his two appearances. \n\nStallone happened to be acting in a play that a friend invited him to partake in, and an agent in attendance thought that Stallone fit the role of Stanley, a main character in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]'', which had a start-stop schedule from 1972 to 1974 over budget issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/8347-REVIEW-THE-LORDS-OF-FLATBUSH-STARRING-SYLVESTER-STALLONE,-PERRY-KING,-and-HENRY-WINKLER-From-Sony-Pictures-Choice-Collection.html|title=REVIEW: \u201cTHE LORDS OF FLATBUSH\u201d STARRING SYLVESTER STALLONE, PERRY KING, and HENRY WINKLER From Sony Pictures Choice Collection - Cinema Retro|website=cinemaretro.com}}</ref> Stallone, around mid-1973, achieved his first proper starring role, in the independent film ''[[No Place to Hide (1970 film)|No Place to Hide]]'', playing a man who is associated with a New York-based urban terrorist movement, with a jewellery-seller as his love interest. The film was re-cut and retitled ''Rebel'' years later, this second version featuring Stallone as its star. After the style of [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'', this film, in 1990, was re-edited from [[outtake]]s from the original movie and newly shot matching footage, then [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|redubbed]] into an award-winning parody of itself titled ''A Man Called... Rainbo''.\n\nStallone's other first few film roles were minor, and included brief uncredited appearances in ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970) as a soldier sitting at a table, ''[[Pigeons (film)|Pigeons]]'' (1970) as a party guest, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971) as a subway thug, in the psychological thriller ''[[Klute]]'' (1971) as an extra dancing in a club, and in the [[Jack Lemmon]] film ''[[The Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'' (1975) as a youth. In the Lemmon film, Jack Lemmon's character chases, tackles and mugs Stallone, thinking that Stallone's character is a pickpocket. He had his second starring role in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]'', in 1974.<ref name=tca/> In 1975, he played supporting roles in ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]''; ''[[Capone (film)|Capone]]''; and ''[[Death Race 2000]]''. He made guest appearances on the TV series ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'' and ''[[Kojak]]''. He is also supposedly in ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]''.

Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff became interested and offered Stallone {{US$|350,000}} for the rights, but had their own casting ideas for the lead role, including [[Robert Redford]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. Stallone refused to sell unless he played the lead character and eventually, after a substantial budget cut to compromise, it was agreed he could be the star.<ref>{{cite book| last = Nelson| first= Murray R.| title = American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas [4 Volumes]: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas | date= May 23, 2013 | page= 1095}}</ref>\n\n''Rocky'' was nominated for ten [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] nominations for Stallone. The film went on to win the Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Directing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\nFollowing the success of ''Rocky'', Stallone made his directorial debut and starred in the 1978 film ''[[Paradise Alley]]'', a family drama in which he played one of three brothers who enter the world of [[wrestling]]. That same year, he starred in [[Norman Jewison]]'s ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'', a social drama in which he plays a warehouse worker, very loosely modelled on [[James Hoffa]], who becomes involved in the labor union leadership. In 1979 he wrote, directed and starred in the sequel to his 1976 hit, ''[[Rocky II]]'' (replacing [[John G. Avildsen]], who won an Academy Award for directing the first film), which also became a major success,<ref name=tca/> grossing {{US$|200}}&nbsp;million. In 1981, he starred alongside [[Michael Caine]] and soccer star [[Pel\u00e9]] in ''[[Escape to Victory]]'', a sports drama in which he plays a [[prisoner of war]] involved in a Nazi propaganda soccer game. That same year, he starred in the thriller ''[[Nighthawks (1981 film)|Nighthawks]]'', in which he plays a New York city cop who plays a cat-and-mouse game with a foreign terrorist, played by [[Rutger Hauer]].\n\n===Continued success with more ''Rocky'', ''Rambo'' and additional action roles===\n[[File:Stallone-Hollywood-Star.jpg|thumb|upright|Sylvester Stallone Hollywood Star on [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]\nStallone launched another major franchise success, starring as [[Vietnam-American War|Vietnam]] veteran [[John Rambo]], a former Green Beret, in the action film ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982).<ref name=tca/> The first installment of ''Rambo'' was both a critical and box office success. Critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human, as opposed to the way he is portrayed in the book of the same name. Three Rambo sequels, ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]'' (2008), and ''[[Rambo: Last Blood]]'' (2019) followed. He also continued his box office success with the ''Rocky'' franchise and wrote, directed, and starred in two more 1980s sequels to the series: ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982) and ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985). Stallone has portrayed these two characters in a total of eleven films. In preparation for these roles, Stallone embarked upon a vigorous training regimen, which often meant six days a week in the gym and further sit-ups in the evenings. Stallone claims to have reduced his [[body fat percentage]] to his all-time low of 2.8% for ''Rocky III''.<ref>Berg, Michael. ''Muscle & Fitness'', Sept. 2004.</ref> Stallone met former [[Mr. Olympia]] [[Franco Columbu]] to develop his character's appearance for the films ''Rocky IV'' and ''Rambo II'', just as if he were preparing for the Mr. Olympia competition.

He also attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, roles in different genres. In 1984, he co-wrote and starred alongside [[Dolly Parton]] in the comedy film ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'', where he played a wannabe country music singer. For the [[Rhinestone (film soundtrack)|''Rhinestone'' soundtrack]], he performed a song. Stallone turned down the lead male role in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' in order to make ''Rhinestone'' instead, a decision he later regretted.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/evening-sylvester-stallone-quotes/ |title=Sylvester Stallone: in his own words |magazine=Empire |date=January 14, 2014 |access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref> In 1987, he starred in the family drama ''[[Over the Top (1987 film)|Over the Top]]'' as a struggling trucker who tries to make amends with his estranged son. These films did not do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 [[James Cagney]] classic ''[[Angels With Dirty Faces]]''. The film would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Films and was to co-star [[Christopher Reeve]] and be directed by [[Menahem Golan]]. The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and horror by top critic [[Roger Ebert]]. Cannon opted to make ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' instead. ''Cobra'' (1986) and the [[buddy cop]] action film ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989), the latter alongside [[Kurt Russell]], did solid business domestically and blockbuster business overseas, grossing over {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million in foreign markets and over {{US$|160}}&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nStallone began the 1990s starring in the fifth installment of the ''Rocky'' franchise, ''[[Rocky V]]''. This film brought back the original film's director John G. Avildsen. It was considered a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Home' KOs 'Rocky V' at Box Office : Movies: The comedy grabs {{US$|17}}&nbsp;million in receipts to take the No. 1 spot over Stallone's much-hyped sequel.|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-20/entertainment/ca-5106_1_weekend-box|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 20, 1990}}</ref> He attempted the comedy genre, starring in two comedies during the early 1990s, the critical and commercial disasters ''[[Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar]]'' (1991) and ''[[Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'' (1992).\n\nIn 1993, he made a comeback with the hit ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', which was a success in the US, grossing {{US$|84}}&nbsp;million, but even more successful worldwide, grossing {{US$|171}}&nbsp;million. Later that year, he starred with [[Wesley Snipes]] in the [[futuristic]] action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', which grossed over {{US$|158}}&nbsp;million worldwide. His string of hits continued with 1994's ''[[The Specialist]]'' (over {{US$|170}}&nbsp;million worldwide gross). In 1995, he played the futuristic character [[Judge Dredd]] (from the British comic book ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'') in the eponymous film ''[[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|Judge Dredd]]''. His overseas box office appeal saved the domestic box office disappointment of ''Judge Dredd'', which cost almost {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million and barely made its budget back, with a worldwide tally of {{US$|113}}&nbsp;million. He also appeared in the thriller ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' (1995) with [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Antonio Banderas]]. In 1996, he starred in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]''.\n\nThat same year, Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] short comedy film \"[[Your Studio and You]]\" commissioned by the [[Seagram]] Company for a party celebrating their acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he is saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a [[wine cooler]] and calling him \"brainiac.\" In response, Stallone says, \"Thank you very much.\" He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, \"Stupid cheap studio!\"<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 Your Studio and you] (From Google Video) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020045255/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing his breakthrough performance in ''Rocky'', critic Roger Ebert had stated that Stallone could become the next [[Marlon Brando]], though he barely recaptured the critical acclaim achieved with ''Rocky''. Stallone did go on to receive acclaim for his role in the crime drama ''[[Cop Land]]'' (1997), in which he starred alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Ray Liotta]]. His performance led him to win the [[Stockholm International Film Festival]] Best Actor Award. In 1998, he did voice-over work for the computer-animated film ''[[Antz]]'', which was a big hit domestically.\n\n===Declining years===\nIn 2000, Stallone starred in the thriller ''[[Get Carter (2000 film)|Get Carter]]'', a remake of the 1971 British [[Michael Caine]] film of the [[Get Carter|same name]], but the film was poorly received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined considerably after his subsequent films ''[[Driven (2001 film)|Driven]]'' (2001), ''[[Avenging Angelo]]'' (2002) and ''[[D-Tox]]'' (2002) were also critical and commercial failures. In 2003, he played a villainous role in the third installment of the ''[[Spy Kids (film series)|Spy Kids]]'' series: ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'', which was a huge box office success (almost {{US$|200}}&nbsp;million worldwide). Stallone also had a cameo appearance in the 2003 French film ''[[Taxi 3]]'' as a passenger.\n\nFollowing several poorly reviewed box office flops, Stallone started to regain prominence for his supporting role in the [[neo-noir]] crime drama ''[[Shade (film)|Shade]]'' (2003) which was only released in a limited fashion but was praised by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shade/ |title=Shade |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> He was also attached to star and direct a film tentatively titled ''Rampart Scandal'', which was to be about the murder of rappers [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and the surrounding [[Los Angeles Police Department]] corruption scandal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1472396/20030606/story.jhtml|title=Sylvester Stallone Making Movie About Biggie, Tupac Murders|last=Patel|first=Joseph|date=June 6, 2003|publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref> It was later titled ''Notorious'' but was shelved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur30196.cfm |title=Stallone's Tupac/Biggie Movie a No Go: Actor was to play LAPD detective who found dirty cops at root of murders |date=December 7, 2006 |publisher=EURWeb.com |accessdate=January 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, he was the co-presenter, alongside [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], of the [[NBC]] Reality television boxing series ''[[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]]''.

After the critical and box office failure of the previous installment ''[[Rocky V]]'', Stallone had decided to write, direct and star in a sixth installment which would be a more appropriate climax to the series.

American actor, director, screenwriter, and producer.\n\nAfter his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to [[New York City]] in 1969 and later [[Hollywood]] in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/lords-of-flatbush/|title=45 Years Ago: 'The Lords of Flatbush' Introduces Rocky and Fonzie|first=Michael|last=Christopher|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>\n\nStallone mostly only found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizeable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor, starting in 1976 with his self-created role as the boxer [[Rocky Balboa]], in the first film of the successful [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' series]] (1976\u20132018). In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog fighter that does battle with numerous brutal opponents, and wins the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]] twice. The last two entries in the series are  ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' and ''[[Creed II]]'', that serve as spin-off films focusing on [[Donnie Creed|Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed]], the son of the ill-fated boxer [[Apollo Creed]], to whom the long retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role during the 2010s brought Stallone praise, and his first [[Golden Globe]] award for the first ''Creed'', as well as a third [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/golden-globes/2016/01/12/golden-globes-sylvester-stallone-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-apology/|title=Sylvester Stallone says he owes 'Creed' team 'everything' after Globes omission|website=EW.com}}</ref>\n\nStallone had similar box-office success, portraying the [[PTSD]] plagued soldier [[John Rambo]] in the five [[Rambo (film series)|''Rambo'' films]] (1982\u20132019) and as mercenary [[List of characters from The Expendables film series#Barney Ross|Barney Ross]] in the three [[The Expendables (film series)|''The Expendables'' films]] (2010\u20132014). He wrote or co-wrote most of the films in his three biggest franchises, and directed many of them.\n\nStallone's film ''[[Rocky]]'' was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]], and had its props placed in the [[Smithsonian Museum]]. His use of the front entrance to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the ''Rocky'' series led the area to be nicknamed the [[Rocky Steps]], and [[Philadelphia]] has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum.

That same year, he starred in [[Norman Jewison]]'s ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'', a social drama in which he plays a warehouse worker, very loosely modelled on [[James Hoffa]], who becomes involved in the labor union leadership.

Critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human, as opposed to the way he is portrayed in the book of the same name. Three Rambo sequels, ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]'' (2008), and ''[[Rambo: Last Blood]]'' (2019) followed.

Stallone has portrayed these two characters in a total of eleven films. In preparation for these roles, Stallone embarked upon a vigorous training regimen, which often meant six days a week in the gym and further sit-ups in the evenings.

In 1984, he co-wrote and starred alongside [[Dolly Parton]] in the comedy film ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'', where he played a wannabe country music singer. For the [[Rhinestone (film soundtrack)|''Rhinestone'' soundtrack]], he performed a song.

These films did not do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 [[James Cagney]] classic ''[[Angels With Dirty Faces]]''. The film would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Films and was to co-star [[Christopher Reeve]] and be directed by [[Menahem Golan]]. The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and horror by top critic [[Roger Ebert]]. Cannon opted to make ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' instead. ''Cobra'' (1986) and the [[buddy cop]] action film ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989), the latter alongside [[Kurt Russell]], did solid business domestically and blockbuster business overseas, grossing over {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million in foreign markets and over {{US$|160}}&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nStallone began the 1990s starring in the fifth installment of the ''Rocky'' franchise, ''[[Rocky V]]''.

Later that year, he starred with [[Wesley Snipes]] in the [[futuristic]] action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', which grossed over {{US$|158}}&nbsp;million worldwide. His string of hits continued with 1994's ''[[The Specialist]]'' (over {{US$|170}}&nbsp;million worldwide gross). In 1995, he played the futuristic character [[Judge Dredd]] (from the British comic book ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'') in the eponymous film ''[[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|Judge Dredd]]''. His overseas box office appeal saved the domestic box office disappointment of ''Judge Dredd'', which cost almost {{US$|100}}&nbsp;million and barely made its budget back, with a worldwide tally of {{US$|113}}&nbsp;million. He also appeared in the thriller ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' (1995) with [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Antonio Banderas]]. In 1996, he starred in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]''.\n\nThat same year, Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] short comedy film \"[[Your Studio and You]]\" commissioned by the [[Seagram]] Company for a party celebrating their acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he is saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a [[wine cooler]] and calling him \"brainiac.\" In response, Stallone says, \"Thank you very much.\" He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, \"Stupid cheap studio!\"<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 Your Studio and you] (From Google Video) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020045255/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing his breakthrough performance in ''Rocky'', critic Roger Ebert had stated that Stallone could become the next [[Marlon Brando]], though he barely recaptured the critical acclaim achieved with ''Rocky''. Stallone did go on to receive acclaim for his role in the crime drama ''[[Cop Land]]'' (1997), in which he starred alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Ray Liotta]]. His performance led him to win the [[Stockholm International Film Festival]] Best Actor Award. In 1998, he did voice-over work for the computer-animated film ''[[Antz]]'', which was a big hit domestically.\n\n===Declining years===\nIn 2000, Stallone starred in the thriller ''[[Get Carter (2000 film)|Get Carter]]'', a remake of the 1971 British [[Michael Caine]] film of the [[Get Carter|same name]], but the film was poorly received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined considerably after his subsequent films ''[[Driven (2001 film)|Driven]]'' (2001), ''[[Avenging Angelo]]'' (2002) and ''[[D-Tox]]'' (2002) were also critical and commercial failures. In 2003, he played a villainous role in the third installment of the ''[[Spy Kids (film series)|Spy Kids]]'' series: ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'', which was a huge box office success (almost {{US$|200}}&nbsp;million worldwide). Stallone also had a cameo appearance in the 2003 French film ''[[Taxi 3]]'' as a passenger.\n\nFollowing several poorly reviewed box office flops, Stallone started to regain prominence for his supporting role in the [[neo-noir]] crime drama ''[[Shade (film)|Shade]]'' (2003) which was only released in a limited fashion but was praised by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shade/ |title=Shade |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> He was also attached to star and direct a film tentatively titled ''Rampart Scandal'', which was to be about the murder of rappers [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and the surrounding [[Los Angeles Police Department]] corruption scandal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1472396/20030606/story.jhtml|title=Sylvester Stallone Making Movie About Biggie, Tupac Murders|last=Patel|first=Joseph|date=June 6, 2003|publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref> It was later titled ''Notorious'' but was shelved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur30196.cfm |title=Stallone's Tupac/Biggie Movie a No Go: Actor was to play LAPD detective who found dirty cops at root of murders |date=December 7, 2006 |publisher=EURWeb.com |accessdate=January 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, he was the co-presenter, alongside [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], of the [[NBC]] Reality television boxing series ''[[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]]''.

{"title_page": "Family support", "text_new": "{{underlinked|date=November 2012}}\n\n'''Family support''' is the support of families with a member with a [[disability]], which may include a child, an adult or even the parent in the family. In the [[United States]], family support includes \"unpaid\" or \"informal\" support by neighbors, families and friends, \"paid services\" through specialist agencies providing an array of services termed \"family support services\", school or parent services for [[special needs]] such as [[respite care]], specialized child care or peer companions, or cash subsidies, [[Tax deduction|tax deductions]] or other financial subsidies. '''Family support''' has been extended to different population groups in the US and worldwide. Family support services is currently a \"community services and funding\" stream in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the US which has had variable \"application\" based on disability group, administrating agency, and even, regulatory and [[legislative intent]].\n\n==History==\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s are considered pivotal times for the development of respite and family support services, particularly through the demands and initiatives of parents of children with disabilities.<ref>Cohen, S. & Warren, R.

The five subgoals include:\n*Goal A: To ensure family-professional partnerships in research, policy-making, and the planning and delivery of supports and services so that families control their own destinies with due regard to the autonomy of adult family members with disabilities to control their own lives.\n*Goal B: To ensure that families fully participate in communities of their choice through comprehensive, inclusive, neighborhood-based, and culturally responsive supports and services.\n*Goal C: To ensure that services and supports for all families are available, accessible, appropriate, affordable and accountable.\n*Goal D: To ensure that sufficient public and private funding will be available to implement these goals and that all families will participate in directing the use of public funds authorized and appropriated for their benefits.\n*Goal E: To ensure that families and professionals have full access to state-of-the-art knowledge and best practices and that they will collaborate in using knowledge and practices.

(1995). \"Return to the community: Building Support Services for People with Psychiatric Disabilities\". NY, NY: The Guilford Press.</ref> In addition, community agencies often have developed parent education programs (which remains as a government-funded program in the US), and family therapists and counselors (often in private practice) tend to work with the whole family. Personal assistance and independent living approaches tend to begin with the desires and wishes of the youth or adult, and less often, the children; these approaches in mental health still remain relatively uncommon though psychosocial approaches have some similarity.<ref>Racino, J. (1999). Psychiatric survivors, the international self help movement, and personal assistance services. \"Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All\". London: Haworth Press.</ref> While housing and support and employment supports have been transferred across fields, greater reluctance exists in the field of mental health for \"family support\" (often starting with parental concerns) who often bill the parents as secondary service recipients.\n\nIn psychiatric rehabilitation, \"families are a major resource impacting rehabilitation outcome\" (families as allies) with 50-60% returning home from hospitals in US (Anthony, et al., 2002, p.&nbsp;185). Extended families are viewed as critical worldwide, and many approaches are categorized as \"family management\" (e.g., information, treatments, family management), family interventions or \"psychoeducational\" (Ibid, 2002).<ref>Anthony, W., Cohen, M., Farkas, M. & Gagne, C.

In addition, brain or head injuries can be caused by vehicular accidents, sports injuries, falls or accidents, war and terrorism, and related medical conditions (e.g., brain tumor, stroke). Family support in these fields often refers to support groups or direct support from the family and neighbors to the individual with the brain injury, or the rehabilitation or hospital program as the family support.<ref>Williams, J. & Kay, T.

''National goals and research for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.'' Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and the American Association on Mental Retardation.</ref> support of families and family life across the lifespan was considered one of the major goals of the extensive work group of leaders in that field (e.g., Ann Turnbull, Rud Turnbull, John Agosta, Elizabeth Erwin, Glenn Fujuira, George Singer, and Leslie Sodak, among others).<ref>Turnbull, A., Turnbull, R., Agosta, J., Erwin, E., Fujuira, G., Singer, G., & Sodak, L. et al.

(pp. 217-256). Washington, DC: The Arc and the American Association on Mental Retardation.</ref> The overarching goal was: To support the caregiving efforts and enhance the quality of life of all families so that families will remain the core unit of American society. The five subgoals include:\n*Goal A: To ensure family-professional partnerships in research, policy-making, and the planning and delivery of supports and services so that families control their own destinies with due regard to the autonomy of adult family members with disabilities to control their own lives.\n*Goal B: To ensure that families fully participate in communities of their choice through comprehensive, inclusive, neighborhood-based, and culturally responsive supports and services.\n*Goal C: To ensure that services and supports for all families are available, accessible, appropriate, affordable and accountable.\n*Goal D: To ensure that sufficient public and private funding will be available to implement these goals and that all families will participate in directing the use of public funds authorized and appropriated for their benefits.\n*Goal E: To ensure that families and professionals have full access to state-of-the-art knowledge and best practices and that they will collaborate in using knowledge and practices. (p.&nbsp;221).\nSuch efforts are critical as the US has often been criticized for having a lack of a coherent family policy for all its people (e.g., health care, housing, employment, leisure, community and economic development).<ref>Racino, J.
