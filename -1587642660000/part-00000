{"title_page": "1925 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1925 season of [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 16th. On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=17th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1925}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Trophy Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] who defeated [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] in the final.\n\nIn the lower grades [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches. They played against the New Zealand team twice and the touring Queensland side who they drew with 18 all. The Auckland side claimed the Northern Union Challenege Cup off the holders, South Auckland and they retained it against the same opponents in a later match. In addition the Auckland Provincial team played Queensland but were soundly beaten 54-14.\n\n===Death of Bill Stormont and inauguration of the Stormont Shield===\nOn June 4 [[William Stormont]] (known better as Bill Stormont) died, succumbing to rheumatic heart disease. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths - Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1925-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.5\n| accessdate = 2019-11-10}}</ref> Stormont had played for the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] senior team from 1920 to 1924 scoring 24 tries and kicking 31 goals. He had also represented [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] on 16 occasions, scoring 4 tries and kicking 2 goals as well as playing 3 matches for [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] in 1920. He had been ill for quite some time and had not played for Marist since the end of the 1924 season. The funeral was on the Sunday leaving his parents residence in Epsom and progressing to Purewa Cemetery where he was buried. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths-Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19037\n| date = 1925-06-06\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250606.2.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The match between Marist and [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] on Saturday was originally postponed but was never played. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.126\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The matches at [[Carlaw Park]] saw one minutes silence before kickoff.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16.

After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches.

On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=17th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1925}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Trophy Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] who defeated [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] in the final.\n\nIn the lower grades [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches. They played against the New Zealand team twice and the touring Queensland side who they drew with 18 all. The Auckland side claimed the Northern Union Challenege Cup off the holders, South Auckland and they retained it against the same opponents in a later match. In addition the Auckland Provincial team played Queensland but were soundly beaten 54-14.\n\n===Death of Bill Stormont and inauguration of the Stormont Shield===\nOn June 4 [[William Stormont]] (known better as Bill Stormont) died, succumbing to rheumatic heart disease. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths - Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1925-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.5\n| accessdate = 2019-11-10}}</ref> Stormont had played for the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] senior team from 1920 to 1924 scoring 24 tries and kicking 31 goals.

He had been ill for quite some time and had not played for Marist since the end of the 1924 season.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

Traditionally, it covers [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]], bounded on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In terms of social, economic and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, and sometimes includes [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] and the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]].

Much of the southern cone is covered by the [[Arid Diagonal]] of which Monte Desert is part.]]\n[[Image:Bariloche view.jpg|thumb|The region of the forests of coniferous and lakes of glacier origin concerning [[Bariloche]]. ]]\nThe climates are mostly temperate, but include humid subtropical, Mediterranean, highland tropical, maritime temperate, sub-Antarctic temperate, highland cold, desert and semi-arid temperate regions. Except for northern regions of Argentina ([[thermal equator]] in January), the whole country of Paraguay, the Argentina-Brazil border and the interior of the [[Atacama desert]], the region rarely suffers from heat. In addition to that, the winter presents mostly cool temperatures. Strong and constant wind and high humidity is what brings low temperatures in the winter. The Atacama is the driest place on Earth.\n\nOne of the most peculiar plants of the region is the ''[[Araucaria]]'' tree, which can be found in Brazil, Chile and Argentina. The only native group of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] found in the southern hemisphere had its origin in the Southern Cone. ''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]'', once widespread in Southern Brazil, is now a critically endangered species, protected by law. The [[prairies]] region of central Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil is known as the [[Pampas]].\n\nCentral Chile has [[Mediterranean vegetation]] and [[mediterranean climate|climate]], grading southward into [[oceanic climate]]. The [[Atacama Desert|Atacama]], [[Patagonian Desert|Patagonian]] and [[Monte desert]]s form a [[Arid Diagonal|diagonal of arid lands]] separating the woodlands, croplands and pastures of [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin|La Plata basin]] from Central and Southern Chile. Apart from the desert diagonal, the north-south running Andes form a major divide in the Southern Cone and constitute, for most of its part in the southern cone, the [[Argentina\u2013Chile border]]. In the east the river systems of the [[La Plata]] basin form natural barriers and sea-lanes between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto

colonial heritage, the residents of the states of the Southern Cone are avid players and fans of [[soccer|football]], with top-notch teams competing in the sport. [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] have both won the [[FIFA World Cup]] twice; they are the only national teams along with Brazil outside [[UEFA|Europe]] to have won the cup. Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil have all hosted the World Cup. Additionally, national teams from the region have won several [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic medals]] in football. Also, football clubs from the Southern Cone countries have won large numbers of club competitions in [[Copa Libertadores|South]]-[[Copa Sudamericana|American]] competitions, [[Copa Interamericana|Pan-American]] competitions, and [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|world-FIFA Club World Cup-level]] competitions.\n\nThe ''[[asado]]'' barbecue is a culinary tradition typical of the Southern Cone. The asado developed from the horsemen and cattle culture of the region, more specifically from the ''[[gaucho]]s'' of Argentina, Uruguay and Southern Brazil (and Southern Chile) and the ''[[huaso]]s'' of Chile. In the Southern Cone, horsemen are considered icons of [[national identity]]; they are featured in the [[epic poem]] ''[[Mart\u00edn Fierro]]''.

Except for northern regions of Argentina ([[thermal equator]] in January), the whole country of Paraguay, the Argentina-Brazil border and the interior of the [[Atacama desert]], the region rarely suffers from heat. In addition to that, the winter presents mostly cool temperatures. Strong and constant wind and high humidity is what brings low temperatures in the winter. The Atacama is the driest place on Earth.\n\nOne of the most peculiar plants of the region is the ''[[Araucaria]]'' tree, which can be found in Brazil, Chile and Argentina. The only native group of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] found in the southern hemisphere had its origin in the Southern Cone. ''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]'', once widespread in Southern Brazil, is now a critically endangered species, protected by law. The [[prairies]] region of central Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil is known as the [[Pampas]].\n\nCentral Chile has [[Mediterranean vegetation]] and [[mediterranean climate|climate]], grading southward into [[oceanic climate]]. The [[Atacama Desert|Atacama]], [[Patagonian Desert|Patagonian]] and [[Monte desert]]s form a [[Arid Diagonal|diagonal of arid lands]] separating the woodlands, croplands and pastures of [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin|La Plata basin]] from Central and Southern Chile. Apart from the desert diagonal, the north-south running Andes form a major divide in the Southern Cone and constitute, for most of its part in the southern cone, the [[Argentina\u2013Chile border]]. In the east the river systems of the [[La Plata]] basin form natural barriers and sea-lanes between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto

Mehrauli is derived from a Sanskrit word Mihira-awali. It signifies the township where the well-known astronomer Varaha-Mihira of [[Vikramaditya]]\u2019s court lived along with his helpers, mathematicians, and technicians.\n\nThe [[Lal Kot]] fort was constructed by the <ref name=\"Khari2007\">{{cite book|author=Rahul Khari|title=Jats and Gujars: origin, history and culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lGgAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 September 2011|date=5 January 2007|publisher=Reference Press|isbn=978-81-8405-031-8|quote=In the contemporary Delhi, there are about 75 villages inhabited by the Gujars out of which 12 villages happened to be in Mehrauli where Gujars belonging to Tomar clan dwell, who call themselves 'Tanwar'.}}</ref>[[Tanwar]] chief [[Anangpal]] I around 731{{nbsp}}AD and expanded by AnangPal II in the 11th{{nbsp}}century, who shifted his capital to Lal Kot from [[Kannauj]]s The Tanwars were defeated by the [[Chauhan]]s in the 12th&nbsp;century. [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] further expanded the fort and called it [[Qila Rai Pithora]]. He was defeated and killed in 1192 by [[Mohammed Ghori]], who put his general [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]] in charge and returned to Afghanistan. Subsequently in 1206, after the death of Mohammed Ghori, Qutubuddin enthroned himself as the first [[Sultan of Delhi]]. Thus  Delhi became the capital of the [[Mamluk dynasty of Delhi]] ([[Slave dynasty]]), the first dynasty of Muslim sultans to rule over northern India.<ref name=\"delhigovt\"/> Mehrauli remained the capital of the Mamluk dynasty which ruled until 1290. During the [[Khalji dynasty]], the capital shifted to [[Siri Fort|Siri]].<ref name=\"delhigovt\">{{cite web |title=Seven Cities Of Delhi: Mehrauli| url = http://delhigovt.nic.in/dept/prj/visitor/city.asp?opt=2 |publisher=[[Government of Delhi]] Official website|accessdate = 16 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Balban's tomb, Mehrauli.jpg|right|thumb|[[Balban's tomb]], Mehrauli]]\nIn 12th-century Jain scriptures, the location is also mentioned as ''Yogninipura'', now noticeable by the presence of the \"[[Yogmaya Temple]]\", near the [[Qutub Minar]] complex, believed to have been built by the [[Pandavas]].<ref>[http://www.india9.com/i9show/Yogmaya-Temple-28482.htm Yogmaya Temple]</ref>\n\nAlso, Martyr Place of Great Sikh Saint-Soldier Baba [[Banda Singh Bahadur]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\nMehrauli lies in the South district of Delhi at {{coord|28|30|57|N|77|10|39|E |region:IN-DL_type:city}}. To its north lies Malviya Nagar. Vasant Kunj lies to its West and Tughlakabad to its south.\n\nLike the rest of Delhi, Mehrauli has a semi-arid climate with high variation between summer and winter temperatures. While the summer temperatures may go up to 46&nbsp;\u00b0C, the winters can seem freezing to people used to a warm climate with near 0&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nThe soil of Mehrauli consists of sandy loam to loam texture.

Subsequently in 1206, after the death of Mohammed Ghori, Qutubuddin enthroned himself as the first [[Sultan of Delhi]].

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The organisation arose [[History of the Anushilan Samiti|from a conglomeration]] of local youth groups and gyms (akhara) in [[Bengal]] in 1902. It had two prominent, somewhat independent, arms in [[East Bengal|East]] and [[West Bengal]], [[Dhaka Anushilan Samiti]] (centred in [[Dhaka]], modern day [[Bangladesh]]), and the [[Jugantar]] group (centred at [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]).\n\nFrom its foundation to its dissolution during the 1930s, the Samiti challenged British rule in India by engaging in militant nationalism, including bombings, assassinations, and politically-motivated violence. The Samiti collaborated with other [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary organisations in India]] and abroad. It was led by the nationalists [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] and his brother [[Barindra Ghosh]], and influenced by philosophies as diverse as [[Hindu]] [[Shakti|Shakta philosophy]], as set forth by Bengali authors [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Bankim]] and [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda]], [[Carbonari|Italian Nationalism]], and the [[Pan-Asianism]] of [[Kakuzo Okakura]]. The Samiti was involved in a number of noted incidents of revolutionary attacks against British interests and administration in India, including [[Alipore bomb case|early attempts]] to assassinate [[British Raj]] officials. These were followed by the [[Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy|1912 attempt]] on the life of the Viceroy of India, and the [[Hindu-German Conspiracy|Seditious conspiracy]] during World War I, led by [[Rash Behari Bose]] and [[Jatindranath Mukherjee]] respectively.\n\nThe organisation moved away from its philosophy of violence in the 1920s due to the influence of the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[Indian independence movement|Gandhian non-violent movement]]. A section of the group, notably those associated with [[Sachindranath Sanyal]], remained active in the revolutionary movement, founding the [[Hindustan Republican Association]] in north India. A number of Congress leaders from Bengal, especially [[Subhash Chandra Bose]], were accused by the British Government of having links with the organisation during this time.\n\nThe Samiti's violent and radical philosophy revived in the 1930s, when it was involved in the [[Kakori conspiracy]], the [[Chittagong armoury raid]], and other actions against the administration in British-occupied India.\n\nShortly after its inception, the organisation became the focus of an extensive police and intelligence operation which led to the founding of the [[Special Branch|Special branch]] of the [[Calcutta Police]]. Notable officers who led the police and intelligence operations against the ''Samiti'' at various times included [[Sir Robert Nathan]], [[Sir Harold Stuart]], [[Sir Charles Stevenson-Moore]] and [[Sir Charles Tegart]]. The threat posed by the activities of the ''Samiti'' in Bengal during [[World War I]], along with the threat of a [[Ghadar mutiny|Ghadarite uprising in Punjab]], led to the passage of [[Defence of India Act 1915]]. These measures enabled the arrest, internment, transportation and execution of a number of revolutionaries linked to the organisation, which crushed the East Bengal Branch. In the aftermath of the war, the [[Rowlatt committee]] recommended extending the Defence of India Act (as the [[Rowlatt Act]]) to thwart any possible revival of the ''Samiti'' in Bengal and the Ghadarite movement in Punjab. After the war, the activities of the party led to the implementation of the [[Bengal Criminal Law Amendment]] in the early 1920s, which reinstated the powers of incarceration and detention from the Defence of India Act. However, the ''Anushilan Samiti'' gradually disseminated into the Gandhian movement. Some of its members left for the Indian National Congress then led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], while others identified more closely with [[Communism]]. The ''Jugantar'' branch formally dissolved in 1938. In independent India, the party in West Bengal evolved into the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]], while the Eastern Branch later evolved into the ''[[Shramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal]]'' (Workers and Peasants Socialist Party) in present-day [[Bangladesh]].\n\n==Background==\nThe growth of the Indian middle class during the 19th century led to a growing sense of Indian identity<ref name=Mitra63>{{Harvnb|Mitra|2006|p=63}}</ref> that fed a rising tide of nationalism in India in the last decades of the 1800s.<ref name=Desai30>{{Harvnb|Desai|2005|p=30}}</ref> The creation of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1885 by [[A.O.

In 1914 Bose, the Maharashtrian [[Vishnu Ganesh Pingle]] and Sikh militants planned simultaneous troop uprisings for February 1915. In Bengal, Anushilan and Jugantar launched what has been described by historians as \"a reign of terror in both the cities and the countryside ... [which] ... came close to achieving their key goal of paralysing the administration\". An atmosphere of fear severely affected morale in both the police and courts.<ref name=\"Popplewell201\">{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=201}}</ref> In August 1914, Jugantar seized a large amount of arms and ammunition from the [[Rodda company arms heist|Rodda company]], a Calcutta arms dealer, and used them in robberies in Calcutta for the next two years. In 1915, only six revolutionaries were successfully tried.\n\nBoth the February 1915 plot and a December 1915 plot were thwarted by British intelligence. Jatin and a number of fellow revolutionaries were killed in a firefight with police at [[Balasore]], in present-day Orissa, which brought Jugantar to a temporary end. The [[Defence of India Act 1915]] led to widespread arrests, internments, deportations and executions of members of the revolutionary movement.

It received widespread support from prominent members of the Indian independence movement. In Bengal, Jugantar agreed to a request by [[Chittaranjan Das]] (a respected leader of the Indian National Congress) to refrain from violence. Although Anushilan Samiti did not adhere to the agreement, it sponsored no major actions between 1920 and 1922. During the next few years, Jugantar and the Samiti became active again. The resurgence of radical nationalism linked to the Samiti during the 1920s led to the passage of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance in 1924. The act restored extraordinary powers of detention to the police; by 1927 more than 200 suspects were imprisoned under the act, including [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], curtailing the resurgence of nationalist violence in Bengal.<ref name=\"Hees2010p171-172\" /> Branches of Jugantar formed in Chittagong and Dhaka, in present-day Bangladesh. The Chittagong branch, led by [[Surya Sen]], robbed the Chittagong office of the Assam-Bengal Railway in December 1923. In January 1924 a young Bengali, Gopi Mohan Saha, shot dead a European he mistook for Calcutta police commissioner [[Charles Tegart]]. The assassin was praised by the Bengali press and, to Gandhi's chagrin, proclaimed a martyr by the Bengal branch of the Congress. Around this time, Jugantar became closely associated with the [[Calcutta Corporation]], headed by Das and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], and terrorists (and ex-terrorists) became significant factors in local Bengali government.\n\nIn 1923 another group linked to Anushilan Samiti, the Hindustan Republican Association, was founded in Benares by [[Sachindranath Sanyal]] and [[Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee]], helping to radicalise north India. It soon had branches from Calcutta to [[Lahore]]. A series of successful dacoities in Uttar Pradesh were followed by a train robbery in Kakori, and subsequent investigations and two trials broke the organization. Several years later, it was reborn as the [[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association]] (HSRA).\n\nIn 1927, the [[Indian National Congress]] came out in favour of independence from Britain. Bengal had quietened over a four-year period, and the government released most of those interned under the Act of 1925 despite an unsuccessful attempt to forge an alliance between Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti. Some younger radicals struck out in new directions, and many (young and old) took part in Congress activities such as the 1928 anti-[[Simon Commission]] protests. Congress leader [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] died of injuries received when police broke up a Lahore protest march in October, and [[Bhagat Singh]] and other members of the HSRA avenged his death in December; Singh also later bombed the legislative assembly. He and other HSRA members were arrested, and three went on a hunger strike in jail; Bengali bomb-maker [[Jatindra Nath Das]] persisted in his strike until his death in September 1929. The Calcutta Corporation passed a condolence resolution after his death, as did Congress when Bhagat Singh was executed.\n\n==={{anchor|Last phase}}Final phase===\n{{See also|Chittagong armoury raid|Benoy Basu|Dinesh Gupta|Badal Gupta}}\n[[File:Surya Sen before 1934.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|alt=Photo of a serious-looking man|[[Surya Sen]], Jugantar leader and mastermind of the [[Chittagong armoury raid|Chittagong raid]].]]\nAs the Congress-led movement picked up its pace during the early 1930s, some former revolutionaries identified with the Gandhian political movement and became influential Congressmen (notably [[Surendra Mohan Ghose]]). Many Bengali Congressmen also maintained links with the Samiti. Simultaneously with the nonviolent protests of the Gandhi-led [[Salt March]], in April 1930, a group led by [[Surya Sen]] raided the Chittagong Armoury. In 1930 eleven British officials were killed, notably during the Writer's Building raid of December 1930 by [[Benoy Basu]], [[Dinesh Gupta]] and [[Badal Gupta]]. Three successive district magistrates in [[Midnapore]] were assassinated, and dozens of other actions were carried out during the first half of the decade.

During the mass detentions of the 1930s surrounding the civil-disobedience movement, many members joined Congress. Jugantar was formally dissolved in 1938; many former members continued to act together under Surendra Mohan Ghose, who was a liaison between other Congress politicians and Aurobindo Ghose in Pondicherry. During the late 1930s, Marxist-leaning members of the Samiti in the CSP announced the formation of the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (RSP).\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Structure===\nAnushilan Samiti and Jugantar were organised on different lines, reflecting their divergence. The Samiti was centrally organised, with a rigid discipline and vertical hierarchy. Jugantar was more loosely organised as an alliance of groups under local leaders that occasionally coordinated their actions. The prototype of Jugantar's organisation was Barin Ghosh's organisation set up in 1907, in the run-up to the Manicktala conspiracy.  It sought to emulate the model of Russian revolutionaries described by Frost.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} The regulations of the central Dhaka organization of the Samiti were written down, and reproduced and summarised in government reports.\n\nAccording to one estimate, the Dacca Anushilan Samiti at one point had 500 branches, mostly in the eastern districts of Bengal, and 20,000 members. Branches were opened later in the western districts, [[Bihar]], and the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]]. Shelters for absconders were established in Assam and in two farms in Tripura. Organisational documents show a primary division between the two active leaders, Barin Ghosh and Upendranath Bannerjee, and the rank-and-file. Higher leaders such as Aurobindo were supposed to be known only to the active leaders. Past members of the Samiti asserted that the groups were interconnected with a vast web of secret societies throughout British India. However, historian [[Peter Heehs]] concluded that the links between provinces were limited to contacts between a few individuals like Aurobindo who was familiar with leaders and movements in Western India, and that relationships among the different revolutionary groups were more often competitive than co-operative.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}  An internal document of circa 1908 written by [[Pulin Behari Das]] describes the division of the organisation in Bengal, which largely followed British administrative divisions.\n\n===Cadre===\nSamiti membership was predominantly made up of Hindus, at least initially, which was ascribed to the religious oath of initiation being unacceptable to Muslims. Each member was assigned to one or more of three roles: collection of funds, implementation of planned actions and propaganda. In practice, however, the fundamental division was between \"military\u2019\u2019 work and \u2018\u2018civil\u2019\u2019 work. Dals (teams) consisting of five or ten members led by a ''dalpati'' (team leader) were grouped together in local Samiti led by ''adhyakshas'' (executive officers) and other officers. These reported to district officers appointed by and responsible to the central Dhaka organization, commanded by Pulin Das and those who deputised for him during his periods of imprisonment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}  Samitis were divided into four functional groups: violence, organisation, keepers of arms, and householders. Communications were carried by special couriers and written in secret code. These practices and others were inspired by literary sources and were partly a concession to the desire of young men to act out romantic drama. Less is known about the Jugantar network, which took the place of the Manicktala society after the [[Alipore bomb case]]. It faced divisions similar to the Samiti. Historian [[Leonard A. Gordon|Leonard Gordon]] notes that at least in the period between 1910 and 1915, the dals in the Jugantar network were separate units, led by a dada (lit: elder brother). The dada was also [[guru]], teaching those under his command practical skills, revolutionary ideology, and strategy. Gordon suggests that the dada system developed out of pre-existing social structures in rural Bengal. Dadas both co-operated and competed with each other for men, money, and material.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nMany members of the Samiti came from upper castes. By 1918, nearly 90% of the revolutionaries killed or convicted were [[Brahmin]]s, [[Kayastha]]s or [[Vaishya]]s.<ref name=\"Sarkar2014p107\" /> As the Samiti spread its influence to other parts of the country, particularly north India, it began to draw in people of other religions and of varying religious commitments. For example, many who joined the Hindustan Republican Socialist Association were [[Marxist]]s and many were militant [[atheist]]s.<ref name=\"Chowdhry2000p138\" />  By the late 1930s, members with a more secular outlook were beginning to participate. Some components of the Samiti also included prominent participation from women, including [[Pritilata Waddedar]] who led a Jugantar attack during the [[Chittagong Armoury raid]], and [[Kalpana Dutta]] who manufactured bombs at Chittagong.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/bollywood-revolutionary-bengal-revisiting-the-chittagong-uprising-1930-34/ |title=Bollywood & Revolutionary Bengal: Revisiting the Chittagong Uprising (1930-34) |website=[[History Workshop]]}}</ref>\n\n==Ideologies==\n\n===Indian philosophies===\nThe Samiti was influenced by the writings of the Bengali nationalist author [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]].

Bankim's cultural and martial nationalism, exemplified in [[Anandamath]],{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} along with his reinterpretation of the [[Bhagavat Gita]], were strong influences on the strain of nationalism that inspired the early societies that later became Anushilan Samiti.<ref name=\"Sisson1988p83\">{{Harvnb|Ray|1988|p=83|ps=: \"To explain the direct reason for the conversions to revolutionary terrorism, one must turn to the intellectual origins of the movement.

A minority broke away from the Samiti and joined the [[Communist Consolidation]], and later the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI). The majority of the Anushilan Marxists were hesitant to join the Communist Party, however, since they distrusted the political lines formulated by the [[Communist International]].<ref name=\"Saha, Murari Mohan 2001. p. 20-21\">Saha, Murari Mohan (ed.), ''Documents of the Revolutionary Socialist Party: Volume One 1938\u20131947''.

Notable officers who led the police and intelligence operations against them at various times included [[Sir Robert Nathan]], [[Sir Harold Stuart]], [[Sir Charles Stevenson-Moore]] and [[Sir Charles Tegart]].\n\nThe [[Criminal Investigations Department|CIDs]] of Bengal and the provinces of Eastern Bengal and Assam were founded in response to the revolutionary movement led by the Samiti.<ref name=\"Popplewell104\" /> By 1908, political crime duties took the services of one deputy Superintendent of Police, 52 Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors, and nearly 720 constables. Foreseeing a rise in the strength of the revolutionary movement, [[Sir Harold Stuart]] (then [[Secretary of State for India]]) implemented plans for secret service to fight the menace posed by the Samiti.<ref name=\"Popplewell105\">{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=105}}</ref> A Political Crime branch of the C.I.D. (known as the \"Special Department\") was developed in September 1909, staffed by 23 officers and 45 men. The government of India allocated Rs 2,227,000 for the Bengal Police alone in the reforms of 1909-1910.<ref name=\"Popplewell105\" />\n\nBy 1908 a Special Officer for Political Crime was appointed from the Bengal Police, with the Special Branch of Police working under him. This post was first occupied by C.W.C. Plowden and later by F.C. Daly.<ref name=\"Popplewell105\" /> Godfrey Denham, then Assistant Superintendent of Police, served under the Special Officer.<ref name=\"Popplewell105\" /> Denham was credited with uncovering the Manicktala safe house of the Samiti, raiding it in May 1908, which ultimately led to the Manicktala conspiracy case. This case led to further expansion of the Special Branch in Bengal. The CID in Eastern Bengal and Assam (EBA) were founded in 1906 and expanded from 1909 onwards. However, the EBA police's access to informers and secret agents remained difficult.<ref name=\"Popplewell105to107\">{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|pp=105\u2013107}}</ref> In EBA, a civil servant, H.L.

Until 1909, the police were unclear whether they were dealing with a single organisation or with a conglomeration of independent groups.<ref name=\"Popplewell108\" />\n\nThe [[visit of King George V to India]] in 1911 catalyzed improvements in police equipment and staffing in Bengal and EBA. In 1912, the political branch of the Bengal CID was renamed the Intelligence Branch, staffed with 50 officers and 127 men. The branch had separate sections dealing with explosives, assassinations, and robberies.<ref name=\"Popplewell114\" /> It was headed by [[Charles Tegart]], who built up a network of agents and informers to infiltrate the Samiti.<ref name=\"Popplewell114\" /> Tegart would meet his agents under cover of darkness, at times disguising himself as a [[pathan]] or [[Pashtun diaspora|kabuliwallah]].<ref name=\"Popplewell114\" /> Assisting Denham and Petrie, Tegart led the investigation in the aftermath of the [[Dalhi-Lahore Conspiracy]] and identified [[Chandernagore]] as the main hub for the Samiti.<ref name=\"Popplewell114\" /> Tegart remained in the Bengal police until at least the 1930s, earning notoriety amongst the Samiti for his work, and was subjected to a number of assassination attempts. In 1924, Ernest Day, an Englishman, was shot dead by [[Gopinath Saha]] at [[Chowringhee Road]] in Calcutta, due to being mistaken for Tegart. In 1930, a bomb was thrown into Tegart's car at [[Dalhousie Square]] but Tegart managed to shoot the revolutionary and escaped unhurt. His efficient curbing of the revolutionary movement earned praise from [[Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] and he was awarded the King's medal. In 1937 Tegart was sent to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], then in the throes of [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|the Arab Revolt]], to advise the Inspector General on security.<ref name=\"BritishSpies\">{{cite web|title=Londonderry born imperial policeman remembered|url=http://sluggerotoole.com/2012/09/10/londonderry-born-imperial-policeman-remembered|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal Law Amendment 1908===\nIn its fight against the Raj, the Samiti{{'}}s members who turned [[approver]]s (i.e. gave evidence against their colleagues) and the Bengal Police staff who were investigating the Samiti were consistently targeted. A number of assassinations were carried out of approvers who had agreed to act as crown witnesses. In 1909 Naren Gossain, crown witness for the prosecution in [[Alipore bomb case]], was shot dead within [[Alipore Jail]] by [[Satyendranath Bosu|Satyendranath Boseu]] and Kanai Lal Dutt. Ashutosh Biswas, an advocate of Calcutta High Court in charge of prosecution of Gossain murder case, was shot dead within Calcutta High Court in 1909. In 1910, Shamsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Bengal Police responsible for investigating the [[Alipore bomb case]], was shot dead on the steps of Calcutta High Court. The failures of a number of prosecutions of violence linked to the Samiti under the Criminal Procedures Act of 1898 led to a special act that provided for crimes of nationalist violence to be tried by a special tribunal composed of three high-court judges. In December 1908 the Criminal Law amendments were passed under the terms of Regulation III of 1818, with the goal of suppressing associations formed for seditious conspiracies.<ref name=\"Riddick93\">{{Harvnb|Riddick|2006|p=93}}</ref> The act was first applied to deport nine Bengali revolutionaries to [[Mandalay prison]] in 1908.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Despite these measures however, the high standards of evidence demanded by the [[Calcutta High Court]], insufficient investigations by police, and at times outright fabrication of evidence, led to persistent failures to tame nationalist violence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Horniman|1984|p=42}} [There are] records of cases during the years from 1908 to 1914 which were abortive ... due to the usual faults of police work in India\u2014the hankering~after approvers and confessions, to be obtained by any means, good or bad; the concoction of a little evidence to make a bad case good- or a good case better; and the suppression of facts which fail to fit the theory.</ref> The police forces felt unable to deal with the operations of secretive nationalist organisations, leading to demands for special powers.

The act received universal support from Indian non-officiating members in the Governor General's council and from moderate leaders within the Indian political movement. The British war effort had received popular support within India and the act received support on the understanding that the measures enacted were necessary in the war situation. These measures enabled the arrest, internment, transportation, and execution of a number of revolutionaries linked to the organisation, which crushed the East Bengal branch of the Samiti. Its application led to 46 executions, as well as 64 life sentences given to revolutionaries in Bengal and Punjab in the Lahore Conspiracy Trial and Benares Conspiracy Trial, and in tribunals in Bengal,<ref name=\"Bates118\" /> effectively crushing the revolutionary movement. By March 1916, widespread arrests had helped Bengal Police crush the [[Dhaka Anushilan Samiti]] in Calcutta.<ref name=\"Popplewell210\" /> The power of preventive detention was used extensively in Bengal, and revolutionary violence in Bengal plummeted to 10 incidents in 1917.<ref name=\"Bates118\" /> By the end of the war there were over 800 detainees under the act in Bengal under the act. However, indiscriminate application of the act made it increasingly unpopular with the Indian public.\n\n===Rowlatt act===\nThe 1915 act was designed to expire in 1919, and the [[Rowlatt Committee]] was appointed to recommend measures to continue to suppress the revolutionary movement. The committee recommended an extension of the provisions of the Defence of India Act for a further three years with the removal of [[habeas corpus]] provisions. However this was met with universal opposition by the Indian members of the Viceroy's council, as well as the population in general, and Gandhi called the proposed act \"The Black Bills\". [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]] left the Viceroy's council in protest, after having warned the council of the danger of enacting such an unpopular bill. Nevertheless, the recommendations were enacted in the [[Rowlatt Bills]]. Gandhi then led a protest, the [[Rowlatt Satyagraha]], one of the first civil disobedience movements that would become the [[Indian independence movement]]. The protests included [[hartal]]s in Delhi, public protests in Punjab, and other protest movements across India. In Punjab, the protests culminated in the [[Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre]] in April 1919. After nearly three years of agitation, the government finally repealed the Rowlatt act and its component sister acts.\n\n===Bengal Criminal Law Amendment===\n{{Main|Bengal Criminal Law Amendment}}\nA resurgence of radical nationalism linked to the Samiti after 1922 led to the implementation of the [[Bengal Criminal Law Amendment]] in 1924, which reinstated the powers of incarceration and detention from the Defence of India Act. The act re-introduced extraordinary powers of detention to the police, and by 1927 more than 200 suspects had been imprisoned, including [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The implementation of the act successfully curtailed a resurgence in nationalist violence in Bengal, at a time when the Hindustan Republican Association was rising in the United Provinces.<ref name=\"Hees2010p171-172\">{{Harvnb|Heehs|2010|pp=171\u2013172}} \"The activity and influence of the Bengal terrorists led to the passage in 1924 of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, extended the next year as an Act. This again gave the police extraordinary powers, and between 1924 and 1927 almost 200 suspects were imprisoned, among them Subhas Bose. Acts of terrorism in Bengal dropped off, but an Anushilan-linked group in the United Provinces [the Hindustan Republican Association] grew to some importance.\"</ref>\n\nAfter the 1920s, the Anushilan Samiti gradually dissolved into the Gandhian movement. Some of its members left for the Indian National Congress, then led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], while others identified more closely with [[Communism]]. The Jugantar branch formally dissolved in 1938. In independent India, the party in West Bengal evolved into the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]], while the Eastern Branch later evolved into the [[Sramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal]] (Workers and Peasants Socialist Party) in present-day [[Bangladesh]].\n\n==Influence==\n\n===Revolutionary nationalism===\nThe nationalist publication ''[[Jugantar Patrika|Jugantar]]'', which served as the organ of the Samiti, inspired fanatical loyalty among its readers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sanyal|2014|p=89}} \"The ''Jugantar'' newspaper served as the propaganda vehicle for a loose congregation of revolutionaries led by individuals like Jain Banerjee and Barin Ghose who drew inspiration from  ...

The novel was banned by The Raj as \"seditious\", but acquired wild popularity. It formed the basis of a 1977 Bengali language film, ''Sabyasachi'', with [[Uttam Kumar]] playing the lead role of the protagonist.\n\n''[[Do and Die]]'' is a historical account of the Chittagong armoury raid published in 2000 by Indian author Manini Chatterjee. It was awarded the [[Rabindra Puraskar]], the highest literary award in Bengal. The book formed the basis of ''[[Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey]]'' (We Play with Our Lives), a 2010 [[Bollywood]] film with [[Abhishek Bachchan]] playing the role of Surya Sen.\n<!--Jugantar pamphlets -->\n\nA marble plaque marks the building in Calcutta where the Samiti was founded.

Many of the Samiti's members are known in India and abroad, and are commemorated in different forms. A number of Calcutta suburbs are today named after revolutionaries and nationalists of the Samiti. Grey Street, where Aurobindo Ghosh's press office stood, is today named Aurobido Sarani (Aurobindo Avenue).

The organisation arose [[History of the Anushilan Samiti|from a conglomeration]] of local youth groups and gyms (akhara) in [[Bengal]] in 1902. It had two prominent, somewhat independent, arms in [[East Bengal|East]] and [[West Bengal]], [[Dhaka Anushilan Samiti]] (centred in [[Dhaka]], modern day [[Bangladesh]]), and the [[Jugantar]] group (centred at [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]).\n\nFrom its foundation to its dissolution during the 1930s, the Samiti challenged British rule in India by engaging in militant nationalism, including bombings, assassinations, and politically-motivated violence. The Samiti collaborated with other [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary organisations in India]] and abroad. It was led by the nationalists [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] and his brother [[Barindra Ghosh]], and influenced by philosophies as diverse as [[Hindu]] [[Shakti|Shakta philosophy]], as set forth by Bengali authors [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Bankim]] and [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda]], [[Carbonari|Italian Nationalism]], and the [[Pan-Asianism]] of [[Kakuzo Okakura]]. The Samiti was involved in a number of noted incidents of revolutionary attacks against British interests and administration in India, including [[Alipore bomb case|early attempts]] to assassinate [[British Raj]] officials. These were followed by the [[Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy|1912 attempt]] on the life of the Viceroy of India, and the [[Hindu-German Conspiracy|Seditious conspiracy]] during World War I, led by [[Rash Behari Bose]] and [[Jatindranath Mukherjee]] respectively.\n\nThe organisation moved away from its philosophy of violence in the 1920s due to the influence of the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[Indian independence movement|Gandhian non-violent movement]]. A section of the group, notably those associated with [[Sachindranath Sanyal]], remained active in the revolutionary movement, founding the [[Hindustan Republican Association]] in north India. A number of Congress leaders from Bengal, especially [[Subhash Chandra Bose]], were accused by the British Government of having links with the organisation during this time.\n\nThe Samiti's violent and radical philosophy revived in the 1930s, when it was involved in the [[Kakori conspiracy]], the [[Chittagong armoury raid]], and other actions against the administration in British-occupied India.\n\nShortly after its inception, the organisation became the focus of an extensive police and intelligence operation which led to the founding of the [[Special Branch|Special branch]] of the [[Calcutta Police]]. Notable officers who led the police and intelligence operations against the ''Samiti'' at various times included [[Sir Robert Nathan]], [[Sir Harold Stuart]], [[Sir Charles Stevenson-Moore]] and [[Sir Charles Tegart]]. The threat posed by the activities of the ''Samiti'' in Bengal during [[World War I]], along with the threat of a [[Ghadar mutiny|Ghadarite uprising in Punjab]], led to the passage of [[Defence of India Act 1915]]. These measures enabled the arrest, internment, transportation and execution of a number of revolutionaries linked to the organisation, which crushed the East Bengal Branch. In the aftermath of the war, the [[Rowlatt committee]] recommended extending the Defence of India Act (as the [[Rowlatt Act]]) to thwart any possible revival of the ''Samiti'' in Bengal and the Ghadarite movement in Punjab. After the war, the activities of the party led to the implementation of the [[Bengal Criminal Law Amendment]] in the early 1920s, which reinstated the powers of incarceration and detention from the Defence of India Act. However, the ''Anushilan Samiti'' gradually disseminated into the Gandhian movement. Some of its members left for the Indian National Congress then led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], while others identified more closely with [[Communism]]. The ''Jugantar'' branch formally dissolved in 1938. In independent India, the party in West Bengal evolved into the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]], while the Eastern Branch later evolved into the ''[[Shramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal]]'' (Workers and Peasants Socialist Party) in present-day [[Bangladesh]].\n\n==Background==\nThe growth of the Indian middle class during the 19th century led to a growing sense of Indian identity<ref name=Mitra63>{{Harvnb|Mitra|2006|p=63}}</ref> that fed a rising tide of nationalism in India in the last decades of the 1800s.<ref name=Desai30>{{Harvnb|Desai|2005|p=30}}</ref> The creation of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1885 by [[A.O.

The Samiti's program emphasized physical training, training its recruits with daggers and lathis (bamboo staffs used as weapons).

An atmosphere of fear severely affected morale in both the police and courts.<ref name=\"Popplewell201\">{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=201}}</ref> In August 1914, Jugantar seized a large amount of arms and ammunition from the [[Rodda company arms heist|Rodda company]], a Calcutta arms dealer, and used them in robberies in Calcutta for the next two years. In 1915, only six revolutionaries were successfully tried.\n\nBoth the February 1915 plot and a December 1915 plot were thwarted by British intelligence. Jatin and a number of fellow revolutionaries were killed in a firefight with police at [[Balasore]], in present-day Orissa, which brought Jugantar to a temporary end. The [[Defence of India Act 1915]] led to widespread arrests, internments, deportations and executions of members of the revolutionary movement. By March 1916, widespread arrests helped Bengal police crush the [[Dacca Anushilan Samiti]] in Calcutta.<ref name=\"Popplewell210\">{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=210}}</ref> Regulation III and the Defence of India Act were enforced throughout Bengal in August 1916.

In response to this, many leaders of the revolutionary movement went underground in the 1920s and fled Bengal to other British territories, particularly Burma.\"</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Post World War I}}After the war===\n{{See also|Kakori conspiracy|Hindustan Socialist Republican Association}}\nThe first non-cooperation movement, the [[Rowlatt Satyagraha]]s led by Gandhi, was active from 1919 to 1922. It received widespread support from prominent members of the Indian independence movement. In Bengal, Jugantar agreed to a request by [[Chittaranjan Das]] (a respected leader of the Indian National Congress) to refrain from violence. Although Anushilan Samiti did not adhere to the agreement, it sponsored no major actions between 1920 and 1922. During the next few years, Jugantar and the Samiti became active again. The resurgence of radical nationalism linked to the Samiti during the 1920s led to the passage of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance in 1924. The act restored extraordinary powers of detention to the police; by 1927 more than 200 suspects were imprisoned under the act, including [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], curtailing the resurgence of nationalist violence in Bengal.<ref name=\"Hees2010p171-172\" /> Branches of Jugantar formed in Chittagong and Dhaka, in present-day Bangladesh. The Chittagong branch, led by [[Surya Sen]], robbed the Chittagong office of the Assam-Bengal Railway in December 1923. In January 1924 a young Bengali, Gopi Mohan Saha, shot dead a European he mistook for Calcutta police commissioner [[Charles Tegart]]. The assassin was praised by the Bengali press and, to Gandhi's chagrin, proclaimed a martyr by the Bengal branch of the Congress. Around this time, Jugantar became closely associated with the [[Calcutta Corporation]], headed by Das and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], and terrorists (and ex-terrorists) became significant factors in local Bengali government.\n\nIn 1923 another group linked to Anushilan Samiti, the Hindustan Republican Association, was founded in Benares by [[Sachindranath Sanyal]] and [[Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee]], helping to radicalise north India. It soon had branches from Calcutta to [[Lahore]]. A series of successful dacoities in Uttar Pradesh were followed by a train robbery in Kakori, and subsequent investigations and two trials broke the organization. Several years later, it was reborn as the [[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association]] (HSRA).\n\nIn 1927, the [[Indian National Congress]] came out in favour of independence from Britain. Bengal had quietened over a four-year period, and the government released most of those interned under the Act of 1925 despite an unsuccessful attempt to forge an alliance between Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti. Some younger radicals struck out in new directions, and many (young and old) took part in Congress activities such as the 1928 anti-[[Simon Commission]] protests. Congress leader [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] died of injuries received when police broke up a Lahore protest march in October, and [[Bhagat Singh]] and other members of the HSRA avenged his death in December; Singh also later bombed the legislative assembly. He and other HSRA members were arrested, and three went on a hunger strike in jail; Bengali bomb-maker [[Jatindra Nath Das]] persisted in his strike until his death in September 1929. The Calcutta Corporation passed a condolence resolution after his death, as did Congress when Bhagat Singh was executed.\n\n==={{anchor|Last phase}}Final phase===\n{{See also|Chittagong armoury raid|Benoy Basu|Dinesh Gupta|Badal Gupta}}\n[[File:Surya Sen before 1934.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|alt=Photo of a serious-looking man|[[Surya Sen]], Jugantar leader and mastermind of the [[Chittagong armoury raid|Chittagong raid]].]]\nAs the Congress-led movement picked up its pace during the early 1930s, some former revolutionaries identified with the Gandhian political movement and became influential Congressmen (notably [[Surendra Mohan Ghose]]). Many Bengali Congressmen also maintained links with the Samiti. Simultaneously with the nonviolent protests of the Gandhi-led [[Salt March]], in April 1930, a group led by [[Surya Sen]] raided the Chittagong Armoury. In 1930 eleven British officials were killed, notably during the Writer's Building raid of December 1930 by [[Benoy Basu]], [[Dinesh Gupta]] and [[Badal Gupta]]. Three successive district magistrates in [[Midnapore]] were assassinated, and dozens of other actions were carried out during the first half of the decade. By 1931 a record 92 violent incidents were recorded, including the murders of the British magistrates of [[Tippera]] and Midnapore.<ref name=\"Chowdhry2000p138\">{{Harvnb|Chowdhry|2000|p=138}}</ref> However, soon afterwards, in 1934, the revolutionary movement in Bengal ended.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=3|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Benoy Krishna Basu.jpg\n| image2 = Badal gupta.jpg\n| image3 = Dinesh Gupta 1.jpg\n| footer = <div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Benoy Basu]], [[Badal Gupta]], and [[Dinesh Gupta]] were noted for launching an attack on the Secretariat Building - the [[Writers' Building]] in the [[B.B.D.

During the mass detentions of the 1930s surrounding the civil-disobedience movement, many members joined Congress. Jugantar was formally dissolved in 1938; many former members continued to act together under Surendra Mohan Ghose, who was a liaison between other Congress politicians and Aurobindo Ghose in Pondicherry. During the late 1930s, Marxist-leaning members of the Samiti in the CSP announced the formation of the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (RSP).\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Structure===\nAnushilan Samiti and Jugantar were organised on different lines, reflecting their divergence. The Samiti was centrally organised, with a rigid discipline and vertical hierarchy. Jugantar was more loosely organised as an alliance of groups under local leaders that occasionally coordinated their actions. The prototype of Jugantar's organisation was Barin Ghosh's organisation set up in 1907, in the run-up to the Manicktala conspiracy.  It sought to emulate the model of Russian revolutionaries described by Frost.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} The regulations of the central Dhaka organization of the Samiti were written down, and reproduced and summarised in government reports.\n\nAccording to one estimate, the Dacca Anushilan Samiti at one point had 500 branches, mostly in the eastern districts of Bengal, and 20,000 members. Branches were opened later in the western districts, [[Bihar]], and the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]]. Shelters for absconders were established in Assam and in two farms in Tripura. Organisational documents show a primary division between the two active leaders, Barin Ghosh and Upendranath Bannerjee, and the rank-and-file. Higher leaders such as Aurobindo were supposed to be known only to the active leaders. Past members of the Samiti asserted that the groups were interconnected with a vast web of secret societies throughout British India. However, historian [[Peter Heehs]] concluded that the links between provinces were limited to contacts between a few individuals like Aurobindo who was familiar with leaders and movements in Western India, and that relationships among the different revolutionary groups were more often competitive than co-operative.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}  An internal document of circa 1908 written by [[Pulin Behari Das]] describes the division of the organisation in Bengal, which largely followed British administrative divisions.\n\n===Cadre===\nSamiti membership was predominantly made up of Hindus, at least initially, which was ascribed to the religious oath of initiation being unacceptable to Muslims. Each member was assigned to one or more of three roles: collection of funds, implementation of planned actions and propaganda. In practice, however, the fundamental division was between \"military\u2019\u2019 work and \u2018\u2018civil\u2019\u2019 work. Dals (teams) consisting of five or ten members led by a ''dalpati'' (team leader) were grouped together in local Samiti led by ''adhyakshas'' (executive officers) and other officers. These reported to district officers appointed by and responsible to the central Dhaka organization, commanded by Pulin Das and those who deputised for him during his periods of imprisonment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}  Samitis were divided into four functional groups: violence, organisation, keepers of arms, and householders. Communications were carried by special couriers and written in secret code. These practices and others were inspired by literary sources and were partly a concession to the desire of young men to act out romantic drama. Less is known about the Jugantar network, which took the place of the Manicktala society after the [[Alipore bomb case]]. It faced divisions similar to the Samiti. Historian [[Leonard A. Gordon|Leonard Gordon]] notes that at least in the period between 1910 and 1915, the dals in the Jugantar network were separate units, led by a dada (lit: elder brother). The dada was also [[guru]], teaching those under his command practical skills, revolutionary ideology, and strategy. Gordon suggests that the dada system developed out of pre-existing social structures in rural Bengal. Dadas both co-operated and competed with each other for men, money, and material.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nMany members of the Samiti came from upper castes. By 1918, nearly 90% of the revolutionaries killed or convicted were [[Brahmin]]s, [[Kayastha]]s or [[Vaishya]]s.<ref name=\"Sarkar2014p107\" /> As the Samiti spread its influence to other parts of the country, particularly north India, it began to draw in people of other religions and of varying religious commitments. For example, many who joined the Hindustan Republican Socialist Association were [[Marxist]]s and many were militant [[atheist]]s.<ref name=\"Chowdhry2000p138\" />  By the late 1930s, members with a more secular outlook were beginning to participate. Some components of the Samiti also included prominent participation from women, including [[Pritilata Waddedar]] who led a Jugantar attack during the [[Chittagong Armoury raid]], and [[Kalpana Dutta]] who manufactured bombs at Chittagong.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/bollywood-revolutionary-bengal-revisiting-the-chittagong-uprising-1930-34/ |title=Bollywood & Revolutionary Bengal: Revisiting the Chittagong Uprising (1930-34) |website=[[History Workshop]]}}</ref>\n\n==Ideologies==\n\n===Indian philosophies===\nThe Samiti was influenced by the writings of the Bengali nationalist author [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]]. The name of the organisation, Anushilan, is derived from Bankim's works espousing hard work and spartan life. Bankim's cultural and martial nationalism, exemplified in [[Anandamath]],{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} along with his reinterpretation of the [[Bhagavat Gita]], were strong influences on the strain of nationalism that inspired the early societies that later became Anushilan Samiti.<ref name=\"Sisson1988p83\">{{Harvnb|Ray|1988|p=83|ps=: \"To explain the direct reason for the conversions to revolutionary terrorism, one must turn to the intellectual origins of the movement.

The \"Rules of Membership\" in the Dacca library strongly recommended reading his books.<ref name=\"Sisson1988p84\" /> These books emphasised \"Strong muscles and nerves of steel\", which some historians consider to be strongly influenced by the Hindu [[Shakta Philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} This interest in physical improvement and proto-national spirit among young Bengalis was driven by an effort to break away from the stereotype of effeminacy that the British had imposed on the Bengalis.

A minority broke away from the Samiti and joined the [[Communist Consolidation]], and later the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI). The majority of the Anushilan Marxists were hesitant to join the Communist Party, however, since they distrusted the political lines formulated by the [[Communist International]].<ref name=\"Saha, Murari Mohan 2001. p. 20-21\">Saha, Murari Mohan (ed.), ''Documents of the Revolutionary Socialist Party: Volume One 1938\u20131947''.

Notable officers who led the police and intelligence operations against them at various times included [[Sir Robert Nathan]], [[Sir Harold Stuart]], [[Sir Charles Stevenson-Moore]] and [[Sir Charles Tegart]].\n\nThe [[Criminal Investigations Department|CIDs]] of Bengal and the provinces of Eastern Bengal and Assam were founded in response to the revolutionary movement led by the Samiti.<ref name=\"Popplewell104\" /> By 1908, political crime duties took the services of one deputy Superintendent of Police, 52 Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors, and nearly 720 constables. Foreseeing a rise in the strength of the revolutionary movement, [[Sir Harold Stuart]] (then [[Secretary of State for India]]) implemented plans for secret service to fight the menace posed by the Samiti.<ref name=\"Popplewell105\">{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=105}}</ref> A Political Crime branch of the C.I.D. (known as the \"Special Department\") was developed in September 1909, staffed by 23 officers and 45 men. The government of India allocated Rs 2,227,000 for the Bengal Police alone in the reforms of 1909-1910.<ref name=\"Popplewell105\" />\n\nBy 1908 a Special Officer for Political Crime was appointed from the Bengal Police, with the Special Branch of Police working under him.

Daly.<ref name=\"Popplewell105\" /> Godfrey Denham, then Assistant Superintendent of Police, served under the Special Officer.<ref name=\"Popplewell105\" /> Denham was credited with uncovering the Manicktala safe house of the Samiti, raiding it in May 1908, which ultimately led to the Manicktala conspiracy case. This case led to further expansion of the Special Branch in Bengal. The CID in Eastern Bengal and Assam (EBA) were founded in 1906 and expanded from 1909 onwards. However, the EBA police's access to informers and secret agents remained difficult.<ref name=\"Popplewell105to107\">{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|pp=105\u2013107}}</ref> In EBA, a civil servant, H.L. Salkeld, uncovered the eastern branch of Anushilan Samiti, producing a four-volume report and placing 68 suspects under surveillance.<ref name=\"Popplewell108\" /> However the Samiti evaded detailed intrusion by adopting the model of Russian revolutionaries. Until 1909, the police were unclear whether they were dealing with a single organisation or with a conglomeration of independent groups.<ref name=\"Popplewell108\" />\n\nThe [[visit of King George V to India]] in 1911 catalyzed improvements in police equipment and staffing in Bengal and EBA. In 1912, the political branch of the Bengal CID was renamed the Intelligence Branch, staffed with 50 officers and 127 men. The branch had separate sections dealing with explosives, assassinations, and robberies.<ref name=\"Popplewell114\" /> It was headed by [[Charles Tegart]], who built up a network of agents and informers to infiltrate the Samiti.<ref name=\"Popplewell114\" /> Tegart would meet his agents under cover of darkness, at times disguising himself as a [[pathan]] or [[Pashtun diaspora|kabuliwallah]].<ref name=\"Popplewell114\" /> Assisting Denham and Petrie, Tegart led the investigation in the aftermath of the [[Dalhi-Lahore Conspiracy]] and identified [[Chandernagore]] as the main hub for the Samiti.<ref name=\"Popplewell114\" /> Tegart remained in the Bengal police until at least the 1930s, earning notoriety amongst the Samiti for his work, and was subjected to a number of assassination attempts. In 1924, Ernest Day, an Englishman, was shot dead by [[Gopinath Saha]] at [[Chowringhee Road]] in Calcutta, due to being mistaken for Tegart. In 1930, a bomb was thrown into Tegart's car at [[Dalhousie Square]] but Tegart managed to shoot the revolutionary and escaped unhurt. His efficient curbing of the revolutionary movement earned praise from [[Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] and he was awarded the King's medal. In 1937 Tegart was sent to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], then in the throes of [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|the Arab Revolt]], to advise the Inspector General on security.<ref name=\"BritishSpies\">{{cite web|title=Londonderry born imperial policeman remembered|url=http://sluggerotoole.com/2012/09/10/londonderry-born-imperial-policeman-remembered|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal Law Amendment 1908===\nIn its fight against the Raj, the Samiti{{'}}s members who turned [[approver]]s (i.e. gave evidence against their colleagues) and the Bengal Police staff who were investigating the Samiti were consistently targeted. A number of assassinations were carried out of approvers who had agreed to act as crown witnesses. In 1909 Naren Gossain, crown witness for the prosecution in [[Alipore bomb case]], was shot dead within [[Alipore Jail]] by [[Satyendranath Bose]] and Kanai Lal Dutt. Ashutosh Biswas, an advocate of Calcutta High Court in charge of prosecution of Gossain murder case, was shot dead within Calcutta High Court in 1909. In 1910, Shamsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Bengal Police responsible for investigating the [[Alipore bomb case]], was shot dead on the steps of Calcutta High Court. The failures of a number of prosecutions of violence linked to the Samiti under the Criminal Procedures Act of 1898 led to a special act that provided for crimes of nationalist violence to be tried by a special tribunal composed of three high-court judges. In December 1908 the Criminal Law amendments were passed under the terms of Regulation III of 1818, with the goal of suppressing associations formed for seditious conspiracies.<ref name=\"Riddick93\">{{Harvnb|Riddick|2006|p=93}}</ref> The act was first applied to deport nine Bengali revolutionaries to [[Mandalay prison]] in 1908.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Despite these measures however, the high standards of evidence demanded by the [[Calcutta High Court]], insufficient investigations by police, and at times outright fabrication of evidence, led to persistent failures to tame nationalist violence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Horniman|1984|p=42}} [There are] records of cases during the years from 1908 to 1914 which were abortive ... due to the usual faults of police work in India\u2014the hankering~after approvers and confessions, to be obtained by any means, good or bad; the concoction of a little evidence to make a bad case good- or a good case better; and the suppression of facts which fail to fit the theory.</ref> The police forces felt unable to deal with the operations of secretive nationalist organisations, leading to demands for special powers.

The act received universal support from Indian non-officiating members in the Governor General's council and from moderate leaders within the Indian political movement. The British war effort had received popular support within India and the act received support on the understanding that the measures enacted were necessary in the war situation. These measures enabled the arrest, internment, transportation, and execution of a number of revolutionaries linked to the organisation, which crushed the East Bengal branch of the Samiti. Its application led to 46 executions, as well as 64 life sentences given to revolutionaries in Bengal and Punjab in the Lahore Conspiracy Trial and Benares Conspiracy Trial, and in tribunals in Bengal,<ref name=\"Bates118\" /> effectively crushing the revolutionary movement. By March 1916, widespread arrests had helped Bengal Police crush the [[Dhaka Anushilan Samiti]] in Calcutta.<ref name=\"Popplewell210\" /> The power of preventive detention was used extensively in Bengal, and revolutionary violence in Bengal plummeted to 10 incidents in 1917.<ref name=\"Bates118\" /> By the end of the war there were over 800 detainees under the act in Bengal under the act. However, indiscriminate application of the act made it increasingly unpopular with the Indian public.\n\n===Rowlatt act===\nThe 1915 act was designed to expire in 1919, and the [[Rowlatt Committee]] was appointed to recommend measures to continue to suppress the revolutionary movement. The committee recommended an extension of the provisions of the Defence of India Act for a further three years with the removal of [[habeas corpus]] provisions. However this was met with universal opposition by the Indian members of the Viceroy's council, as well as the population in general, and Gandhi called the proposed act \"The Black Bills\". [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]] left the Viceroy's council in protest, after having warned the council of the danger of enacting such an unpopular bill. Nevertheless, the recommendations were enacted in the [[Rowlatt Bills]]. Gandhi then led a protest, the [[Rowlatt Satyagraha]], one of the first civil disobedience movements that would become the [[Indian independence movement]]. The protests included [[hartal]]s in Delhi, public protests in Punjab, and other protest movements across India. In Punjab, the protests culminated in the [[Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre]] in April 1919. After nearly three years of agitation, the government finally repealed the Rowlatt act and its component sister acts.\n\n===Bengal Criminal Law Amendment===\n{{Main|Bengal Criminal Law Amendment}}\nA resurgence of radical nationalism linked to the Samiti after 1922 led to the implementation of the [[Bengal Criminal Law Amendment]] in 1924, which reinstated the powers of incarceration and detention from the Defence of India Act. The act re-introduced extraordinary powers of detention to the police, and by 1927 more than 200 suspects had been imprisoned, including [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The implementation of the act successfully curtailed a resurgence in nationalist violence in Bengal, at a time when the Hindustan Republican Association was rising in the United Provinces.<ref name=\"Hees2010p171-172\">{{Harvnb|Heehs|2010|pp=171\u2013172}} \"The activity and influence of the Bengal terrorists led to the passage in 1924 of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, extended the next year as an Act. This again gave the police extraordinary powers, and between 1924 and 1927 almost 200 suspects were imprisoned, among them Subhas Bose. Acts of terrorism in Bengal dropped off, but an Anushilan-linked group in the United Provinces [the Hindustan Republican Association] grew to some importance.\"</ref>\n\nAfter the 1920s, the Anushilan Samiti gradually dissolved into the Gandhian movement. Some of its members left for the Indian National Congress, then led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], while others identified more closely with [[Communism]]. The Jugantar branch formally dissolved in 1938. In independent India, the party in West Bengal evolved into the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]], while the Eastern Branch later evolved into the [[Sramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal]] (Workers and Peasants Socialist Party) in present-day [[Bangladesh]].\n\n==Influence==\n\n===Revolutionary nationalism===\nThe nationalist publication ''[[Jugantar Patrika|Jugantar]]'', which served as the organ of the Samiti, inspired fanatical loyalty among its readers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sanyal|2014|p=89}} \"The ''Jugantar'' newspaper served as the propaganda vehicle for a loose congregation of revolutionaries led by individuals like Jain Banerjee and Barin Ghose who drew inspiration from  ...

Its message was aimed at elite politically conscious readers and was essentially a critique of British rule in India and justification of political violence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sanyal|2014|pp=90\u201391}} \"[Sanyal translates from ''Jugantar'':] \"In a country where the ruling power relies on brute force to oppress its subjects, it is impossible to bring about Revolution or a change in rulers through moral strength. In such a situation, subjects too must rely on brute force.\" ... The ''Jugantar'' challenged the legitimacy of British rule ... [its] position thus amounted to a fundamental ''critique'' of the British government ... By 1907 the paper was selling 7000 copies, a figure that went up to 20,000 soon after. The ''Jugantar'' ideology was basically addressed to an elite audience that was young, literate and politically radicalized.\"</ref> Several young men who joined the Samiti credited ''Jugantar'' with influencing their decisions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The editor of the paper, [[Bhupendranath Datta]], was arrested and sentenced to one year's rigorous imprisonment in 1907.<ref name=Sanyal2014p91-92>{{Harvnb|Sanyal|2014|pp=91\u201392}} \"Bhupendranath Dutt, the editor and proprietor of the ''Jugantar'' was arrested in July 1907 and charged under section 124 A ...

The paper did nothing to tone down the rhetoric in its future editions.\"</ref> The Samiti responded by attempting to assassinate Douglas Kingsford, who presided over the trial,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and ''Jugantar'' responded with defiant editorials.<ref name=Sanyal2014p91-92/> ''Jugantar'' was repeatedly prosecuted, leaving it in financial ruins by 1908. However, the prosecutions brought the paper more publicity and helped disseminate the Samiti''<nowiki/>'''s ideology of revolutionary nationalism. Historian Shukla Sanyal has commented that revolutionary terrorism as an ideology began to win at least tacit support amongst a significant populace at this time.<ref name=Sanyal2014p93/>\n<!-- HRSA -->\n\n[[Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]], the founder of the Hindu nationalist organisation [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), was an alumnus of the Anushilan Samiti. He was sent to Calcutta by [[B. S. Moonje]] in 1910 to study medicine, and to learn techniques of violent nationalism from secret revolutionary organizations in Bengal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jaffrelot|1996|p=33}}</ref> There he lived with independence activist [[Shyam Sundar Chakravarty]],<ref>M. L. Verma ''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas'' (Part-2) p.466</ref> and had contacts with revolutionaries like [[Ram Prasad Bismil]].\n\n===Indian independence movement===\nJames Popplewell, writing in 1995, noted that the Raj perceived the Samiti in its early days as a serious threat to its rule.<ref name=\"Popplewell109\">{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=109}}</ref>  However, historian Sumit Sarkar noted that the Samiti never mustered enough support to offer an urban rebellion or a guerrilla campaign. Both Peter Heehs and Sumit Sarkar have noted that the Samiti called for complete independence over 20 years before the Congress adopted this as its aim.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} A number of landmark events early in the Indian independence movement, including the [[Hindu\u2013German Conspiracy|revolutionary conspiracies of World War I]], involved the Samiti, as noted in the [[Rowlatt report]]. Later the ascendant left-wing of the Congress, particularly [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], was suspected of having links with the Samiti.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Heehs argued that the actions of the revolutionary nationalists exemplified by the Samiti forced the government to parley more seriously with the leaders of the legitimate movement, and that Gandhi was always aware of this. \"At the Round Table Conference of 1931, the apostle of non-violence declared that he held 'no brief for the terrorists', but added that if the government refused to work with him, it would have the terrorists to deal with. The only way to 'say good-bye to terrorism' was 'to work the Congress for all it is worth'\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Heehs|2010|p=174}}</ref>\n\n===Social influences===\n{{See also|Raja Subodh Mallik|National Council of Education}}\nThe founders of the Samiti were among the leading luminaries of Bengal at the time, advocating for social change in ways far removed from the violent nationalist works that identified the Samiti in later years. The young men of Bengal were among the most active in the [[Swadeshi movement]], prompting [[Robert Warrand Carlyle|R.W. Carlyle]] to prohibit the participation of students in political meetings on the threat of withdrawal of funding and grants.<ref name=\"Heehs2008p93\">{{Harvnb|Heehs|2008|p=93}}</ref> Bengali intellectuals were already calling for indigenous schools and colleges to replace British institutions,<ref name=\"Heehs2008p93\" /> and seeking to build indigenous institutions. [[Surendranath Tagore]], of the [[Tagore family|Tagore family of Calcutta]] financed the establishment of Indian-owned banks and insurance companies. The 1906 Congress session in Calcutta established the [[National Council of Education]] as a nationalist agency to promote Indian institutions with their own independent curriculum designed to provide skills in technical and technological education that its founders felt would be necessary for building indigenous industries. With the financial backing of [[Subodh Chandra Mallik]], the [[Bengal National College]] (which later grew to be [[Jadavpur University]]) was established with Aurobindo as Principal.<ref name=\"Heehs2008p93\" /> Aurobindo participated in the Indian National Congress at the time. He used his platform in the Congress to present the Samiti as a conglomeration of youth clubs, even as the government raised fears that it was a revolutionary nationalist organisation. During his time as Principal, Aurobindo started the nationalist publications ''Jugantar'', ''Karmayogin'' and ''[[Bande Mataram]]''.<ref name=\"Heehs2008p93\" /> The student's mess at the college was frequented by students of East Bengal who belonged to the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti, and was known to be a hotbed of revolutionary nationalism, which was uncontrolled or even encouraged by the college.<ref>{{Harvnb|Samanta|1995|p=303}}</ref> Students of the college who later rose to prominence in the Indian revolutionary movement include [[M. N. Roy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The Samiti{{'}}s ideologies further influenced patriotic nationalism. [[Sumit Sarkar]] notes that revolutionary terrorism resulted in \"a wealth of patriotic songs\" and \"a new interest in regional and local history and folk traditions, the scientific works of [[Jagadish Chandra Bose|J. C. Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray|P. C. Ray]], and the Calcutta school of painting founded by [[Abanindranath Tagore]]\".<ref name=\"Sarkar2014p106\" />\n\n===Communism in India===\n{{Main|Socialism in India}}\n{{See also|M. N.

Roy]], one of the founding fathers of [[Communist Party of India|Indian Communism]] as well as the [[Mexican Communist Party]]. He was a member of the [[Comintern]].]]\nThrough the 1920s and 1930s, many members of the Samiti began identifying with Communism and leftist ideologies. Many of them studied Marxist\u2013Leninist literature while serving long jail sentences. A minority section broke away from the Anushilan movement and joined the [[Communist Consolidation]], and later the Communist Party of India. Former Jugantar leader Narendranath Bhattacharya, now known as [[M. N. Roy]], became an influential member of the [[Communist International]], helping to found the Communist Party of India. The majority of the Anushilanite Marxists hesitated to join the Communist Party.<ref name=\"Saha, Murari Mohan 2001. p. 20-21\" /> Instead, they joined the [[Congress Socialist Party]] (CSP), but kept a separate identity within the party as the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP).<ref>Saha, Murari Mohan (ed.), ''Documents of the Revolutionary Socialist Party: Volume One 1938\u20131947''. Agartala: Lokayata Chetana Bikash Society, 2001. p. 35-37</ref> The RSP held a strong influence in parts of Bengal. The party sent two parliamentarians to the 1952 [[Lok Sabha]] elections, both previously Samiti members. In 1969, RSP sympathizers in [[East Pakistan]] formed the [[Shramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal]] (SKSD). RSP and SKSD have maintained close ties ever since. The RSP is currently a minor partner in the [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]], which ruled the Indian state of West Bengal for 34 uninterrupted years. It also holds influence in South India, notably in parts of [[Kerala]]. The [[SUCI]], another left-wing party with a presence in Bengal, was founded in 1948 by Anushilan members.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe revolutionaries of the Samiti became household names in Bengal. Many of these educated and youthful men were widely admired and romanticised throughout India.<ref name=\"Chowdhry2000p138\" /> ''[[Ekbar biday de Ma ghure ashi]]'' (Bid me farewell, mother), a 1908 song written by Bengali folk poet Pitambar Das that describes the execution of [[Khudiram Bose]],{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} was popular in Bengal decades after Bose's death.<ref name=\"Sarkar2014p106\" /> The railway station where Bose was arrested is now named Khudiram Bose Pusa Railway Station in his honour.\n\nThe 1926 nationalist novel ''Pather Dabi'' (Right of the way) by Bengali author [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]] tells the story of a secret revolutionary nationalist organisation fighting the Raj. The protagonist of the novel, Sabyasachi, is believed to have been modelled after [[Rash Behari Bose]], while the revolutionary organisation is thought to have been influenced by the Bengali Samiti. The novel was banned by The Raj as \"seditious\", but acquired wild popularity. It formed the basis of a 1977 Bengali language film, ''Sabyasachi'', with [[Uttam Kumar]] playing the lead role of the protagonist.\n\n''[[Do and Die]]'' is a historical account of the Chittagong armoury raid published in 2000 by Indian author Manini Chatterjee. It was awarded the [[Rabindra Puraskar]], the highest literary award in Bengal. The book formed the basis of ''[[Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey]]'' (We Play with Our Lives), a 2010 [[Bollywood]] film with [[Abhishek Bachchan]] playing the role of Surya Sen.\n<!--Jugantar pamphlets -->\n\nA marble plaque marks the building in Calcutta where the Samiti was founded. A plaque at the site of Barin Ghose's country house (in present-day [[Ultadanga]]) marks the site where Ghosh and his group was arrested in the [[Alipore bomb case]]. Many of the Samiti's members are known in India and abroad, and are commemorated in different forms. A number of Calcutta suburbs are today named after revolutionaries and nationalists of the Samiti. Grey Street, where Aurobindo Ghosh's press office stood, is today named Aurobido Sarani (Aurobindo Avenue). Dalhousie Square was renamed [[B.B.D Bag]], named after Benoy, Badal, and Dinesh who raided the [[Writer's Building]] in 1926. Mononga lane, the site of [[Rodda & Co. heist]], houses the busts of Anukul Mukherjee, Srish Chandra Mitra, Haridas Dutta, and Bipin Bihary Ganguly who participated in the heist. Chashakhand, a location 15&nbsp;km east of Balasore where [[Bagha Jatin]] and his group made their last stand against Tegart's forces, commemorates the battlefield in Jatin's honour.  The locality of [[Baghajatin]] in [[Kolkata]] is named after Jatin.
