The office is responsible for the [[prosecution]] of violations of [[New York (state)|New York]] [[state law]]s. ([[Federal law]] violations in Queens are prosecuted by the [[U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York]]). John Ryan served as acting district attorney from May 4, 2019 to January 6, 2020, after being designated by his predecessor, Richard Brown who famously prosecuted in conjunction with the well known Anti-Crime officer Fiore Napolitano. The current Queens County District Attorney is [[Melinda Katz]], who was inaugurated on January 6, 2020.\n\n==History==\nIn a legislative act of February 12, 1796, New York State was divided into seven districts, each with its own Assistant Attorney General. Queens County was part of the First District, which also included Kings, Richmond, Suffolk, and Westchester counties. (At that time, Queens County included much of present-day Nassau County, and Westchester County included present-day Bronx County.) In 1801, the office of Assistant Attorney General was renamed District Attorney. At the same time, New York County was added to the First District. Westchester County was separated from the First District in 1813, and New York County was separated in 1815. In 1818, all 13 districts were broken up, and each county in the State of New York became a separate district.<ref name=Werner1>{{cite book|last1=Werner|first1=Edgar A.|title=Civil List and Constitutional History of the Colony and State of New York|date=1891|publisher=Weed, Parsons, and Company|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=553\u2013563|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnY0AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=Chester>{{cite book|last1=Chester|first1=Alden|title=Legal and Judicial History of New York, Volume 3|date=1911|publisher=National Americana Society|location=New York, N.Y.|page=[https://archive.org/details/legalandjudicia00chesgoog/page/n180 85]|url=https://archive.org/details/legalandjudicia00chesgoog|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=E3sFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA866 ''The New York Civil List''] compiled by Franklin Benjamin Hough (pp. 366ff and 379; Weed, Parsons and Co., 1858).</ref>\n\nUntil 1822, the district attorney was appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]], and held the office \"during the Council's pleasure\", meaning that there was no defined term of office. Under the provisions of the [[New York Constitution|State Constitution of 1821]], the D.A. was appointed to a three-year term by the County Court. Under the provisions of the [[New York Constitution|State Constitution of 1846]], the office became elective by popular ballot. The term was three years, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. In case of a vacancy, the [[Governor of New York]] filled the vacancy temporarily until a successor was elected, always to a full term, at the next annual election.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=07IF9RMUR2IC&pg=PA964 ''Courts and Lawyers of New York: A History, 1609-1925''] by Alden Chester & Edwin Melvin Williams (The American Historical Society, 1935, vol. 1, p. 964).</ref>\n\nOne year after the 1898 Consolidation of [[New York City]], Nassau County was separated from Queens County. In case of a vacancy, a DA is appointed by the Governor to fill the office temporarily.   A new DA is then elected at the next annual election in November, always to a full term. From 1847 to 1942, the term length was three years. In November 1942, a DA was elected to a one-year term.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1942/10/15/archives/rules-on-queens-election.html ''Rules on Queens Election''], ''[[New York Times]]'', October 15, 1942 (subscription required).</ref>  From the election of November 1943, the DA has been elected to a four-year term.\n\n==List of district attorneys==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width = \"15%\" | District attorney\n! width = \"27%\" | Dates in office\n!

The office is responsible for the [[prosecution]] of violations of [[New York (state)|New York]] [[state law]]s. ([[Federal law]] violations in Queens are prosecuted by the [[U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York]]). John Ryan served as acting district attorney from May 4, 2019 to January 6, 2020, after being designated by his predecessor, Richard Brown. The current Queens County District Attorney is [[Melinda Katz]], who was inaugurated on January 6, 2020.\n\n==History==\nIn a legislative act of February 12, 1796, New York State was divided into seven districts, each with its own Assistant Attorney General. Queens County was part of the First District, which also included Kings, Richmond, Suffolk, and Westchester counties. (At that time, Queens County included much of present-day Nassau County, and Westchester County included present-day Bronx County.) In 1801, the office of Assistant Attorney General was renamed District Attorney. At the same time, New York County was added to the First District. Westchester County was separated from the First District in 1813, and New York County was separated in 1815. In 1818, all 13 districts were broken up, and each county in the State of New York became a separate district.<ref name=Werner1>{{cite book|last1=Werner|first1=Edgar A.|title=Civil List and Constitutional History of the Colony and State of New York|date=1891|publisher=Weed, Parsons, and Company|location=Albany, N.Y.|pages=553\u2013563|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnY0AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=Chester>{{cite book|last1=Chester|first1=Alden|title=Legal and Judicial History of New York, Volume 3|date=1911|publisher=National Americana Society|location=New York, N.Y.|page=[https://archive.org/details/legalandjudicia00chesgoog/page/n180 85]|url=https://archive.org/details/legalandjudicia00chesgoog|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=E3sFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA866 ''The New York Civil List''] compiled by Franklin Benjamin Hough (pp. 366ff and 379; Weed, Parsons and Co., 1858).</ref>\n\nUntil 1822, the district attorney was appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]], and held the office \"during the Council's pleasure\", meaning that there was no defined term of office. Under the provisions of the [[New York Constitution|State Constitution of 1821]], the D.A. was appointed to a three-year term by the County Court. Under the provisions of the [[New York Constitution|State Constitution of 1846]], the office became elective by popular ballot. The term was three years, beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. In case of a vacancy, the [[Governor of New York]] filled the vacancy temporarily until a successor was elected, always to a full term, at the next annual election.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=07IF9RMUR2IC&pg=PA964 ''Courts and Lawyers of New York: A History, 1609-1925''] by Alden Chester & Edwin Melvin Williams (The American Historical Society, 1935, vol. 1, p. 964).</ref>\n\nOne year after the 1898 Consolidation of [[New York City]], Nassau County was separated from Queens County. In case of a vacancy, a DA is appointed by the Governor to fill the office temporarily.   A new DA is then elected at the next annual election in November, always to a full term. From 1847 to 1942, the term length was three years. In November 1942, a DA was elected to a one-year term.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1942/10/15/archives/rules-on-queens-election.html ''Rules on Queens Election''], ''[[New York Times]]'', October 15, 1942 (subscription required).</ref>  From the election of November 1943, the DA has been elected to a four-year term.\n\n==List of district attorneys==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width = \"15%\" | District attorney\n! width = \"27%\" | Dates in office\n!

She has also written screenplays, plays, and scripts for television.\n\n== Life and career ==\nMohr was raised in the [[Bronx]] after her parents immigrated from Puerto Rico. In 1938 when she was born, the Great Depression was slowly coming to an end. Her father died when she was eight years old, leaving her mother with seven children, and Mohr as the only female and the youngest amongst her siblings.  In order to escape the poverty that surrounded her, Mohr used her imagination to express her feelings. Her artistic talents and eagerness for learning flourished when she was a young student, but weren't always appreciated by her teachers, who saw her Puerto Rican heritage as a weakness.<ref name=\"Mohr, Nicholasa 1991\">Mohr, Nicholasa. \"In My Own Words: Growing Up Inside the Sanctuary of My Imagination.\" Simon & Schuster, 1991.</ref> Since Mohr's parents saw her schooling in America as a privilege, Mohr learned to adapt to her surroundings, while spending her free time volunteering in the library and reading, learning what she wasn't able to attain in school. After graduating junior high school, she got a job as a page girl in the New York Public Library.\n\nMohr studied fashion illustration in high school and graduated in 1953, then went to study at the [[Art Students League of New York|Arts Student's League]], an art school located in New York. Here she discovered the works of [[Diego Rivera]] and [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco|Jose Clemente Orozco]] which inspired her to study art and travel to Mexico City to study at the Taller de Gr\u00e1ficos for a semester. After a year she returned to the United States and attended the New School for Social Research. Then in 1959 she went to [[Brooklyn Museum Art School|Brooklyn Museum of Art School]] and [[Pratt Graphics Center]]. Throughout her studies Mohr was drawn to artwork because of its powerful message about social change.\n\nShe worked in both fine arts and writing until 1976, when she devoted herself entirely to writing after the success of her book ''Nilda''. Her switch to writing happened by chance when her art agent at the time rejected her artwork for someone else's book, but liked what she wrote when she was asked to write 50 pages about her childhood, which formed the basis for ''Nilda''.<ref>Thelma T., Reyna. \u201cLATINOPIA BOOK REVIEW NICHOLASA MOHR \u2018NILDA.\u2019\u201d Latinopia.com, 26 Mar. 2012, latinopia.com/latino-literature/latinopia-book-review-nicholasa-mohr-nilda/.</ref>\n\nFrom 1988 through 1991, she taught writing as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Queens College, City University of New York]].  From 1994 through 1995, she was Writer-in-Residence at Richmond College, the American University in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkinbuddies.com/mohr/index.html|title=Balkin Buddies|work=balkinbuddies.com|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Major works ==\nMohr published her first book ''Nilda'' in 1973, which traces the life of a teenage Puerto Rican girl who confronts prejudices during the World War II era in New York. She was awarded the Jane Addams Children's Book Award.<ref name=\"HF\"/> She incorporated autobiographical material for the book even though it is a work of fiction. Drawing on her training and expertise in art, Mohr created the book jacket and eight illustrations for the book.\n\nMohr's second book, ''El Bronx Remembered'', was published in 1975 by Harper & Row. It is a collection of stories and a novella about the struggles of Puerto Ricans living in New York from the late 1940s through the mid 1950s.  It was awarded the New Times Outstanding Book Award, making Mohr the first Latin female  to receive such an honor.<ref name=\"HF\"/>\n\nMohr has written fifteen books total, not including reprinted or translated versions. Ten of her books are written for young adults, two are for children, and three are written for adults. Her most recent books are 1997's \u201cA Matter of Pride and Other Stories,\u201d published by [[Arte P\u00fablico Press]] and ''Untitled Nicholasa Mohr'' in 1998.\n\nThough she has not been as active publishing in the last twenty years, her books are still highly regarded. In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, 'Hamilton' Creator [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] cited ''Nilda'' as the book that shaped him the most.<ref>\u201cLin-Manuel Miranda: By the Book.\u201d New York Times, 5 Apr. 2016, www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/books/review/lin-manuel-miranda-by-the-book.html.</ref>\n\n== Creative Influences ==\nMohr is predominantly influenced by Puerto Rican culture and the migratory patterns of Puerto Ricans within the United States. Though Puerto Ricans have been American citizens since 1917 through the [[Jones-Shafroth Act]], Mohr has said that Puerto Ricans felt as though they were \u201cstrangers in their own land,\u201d as though they were refugees when coming to the U.S. In Mohr's own memoir, she recalls living in an all-white neighborhood with her family as a child. Her brothers got brutally beaten and she was afraid to leave her house. Due to this, the family moved after four months to another part of the Bronx. These incidents of brutality and fear are what inspired her young adult book ''Felita''.\n\nFeeling like an outcast is a common theme in Mohr's stories, and is also paralleled through her own life experiences. In Mohr's memoir, she recalls times where her bilingualism got her in trouble in school. In ''Nilda'', a similar situation occurs where a character finds her knuckles smacked by a teacher when she speaks Spanish. In addition, when Mohr discussed her faith with nuns growing up, she was told that her religious practice was \"sinful.\"<ref name=\"Mohr, Nicholasa 1991\"/> Being forced to assimilate to a new culture is a reoccurring issue in Mohr's books, and her characters use their voices to overcome stereotypes as Mohr did in her life.\n\nMohr's children's book ''The song of el coqu\u00ed and other tales of Puerto Rico'' (written and published in both English and Spanish), discusses the ancestral traditions that make up Puerto Rican culture, and mixes the heritages of Latin Americans, Africans, Spaniards, as well as indigenous people. She uses animals to illustrate the mixing and blending of cultures frequent in Latin America.<ref>Smolen, Lynn Atkinson, and Victoria Ortiz-Castro. \u201cDissolving Borders and Broadening Perspectives through Latino Traditional Literature.\u201d The Reading Teacher, vol. 53, no. 7, 2000, pp. 566\u2013578. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/20204842.</ref>\n\nBy exploring the lives and traditions of Latin Americans, Mohr encourages readers of all ages and ethnicities to widen their perceptions of Latinos.\n\n== Personal life ==\nMohr met her husband Irwin when she attended the New School for Social Research, but he passed away in 1978. They have two sons, David and Jason.\n\n== Works ==\n*{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSzYi1HGUusC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:Nicholasa+inauthor:Mohr#v=onepage&q=&f=false| title=Nilda: a novel |publisher= Arte Publico Press| year= 1986| isbn=978-0-934770-61-3 }} (First published 1974.)\n*{{cite book| title=Bronx Remembered: A Novella and Stories | publisher= San Val, Incorporated| year= 1993| isbn= 978-0-613-18443-4 }}\n*{{cite book| title=El Bronx remembered: a novella and stories| publisher= Harper & Row| year= 1975 }}\n*{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eic1FOBShBIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:Nicholasa+inauthor:Mohr#v=onepage&q=&f=false| title=In Nueva York | publisher= Arte Publico Press| year= 1988| isbn= 978-0-934770-78-1 }}\n*{{cite book| title= Felita| others= Illustrator Ray Cruz| publisher= Bantam| year= 1990| isbn= 978-0-553-15792-5| url= https://archive.org/details/felitamohr00mohr}}\n*{{cite book| title=Going home| publisher= Dial Books for Young Readers| year= 1986| isbn= 978-0-8037-0269-1 }}\n*{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8CKdns3q8EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:Nicholasa+inauthor:Mohr#v=onepage&q=&f=false| title=Rituals of survival: a woman's portfolio| publisher= Arte Publico Press| year= 1985| isbn= 978-0-934770-39-2 }}\n*{{cite book| title=Growing up inside the sanctuary of my imagination| publisher=J.

She has also written screenplays, plays, and scripts for television.\n\n== Life and career ==\nMohr was raised in the [[Bronx]] after her parents immigrated from Puerto Rico. In 1938 when she was born, the Great Depression was slowly coming to an end. Her father died when she was eight years old, leaving her mother with seven children, and Mohr as the only female and the youngest amongst her siblings.  In order to escape the poverty that surrounded her, Mohr used her imagination to express her feelings. Her artistic talents and eagerness for learning flourished when she was a young student, but weren't always appreciated by her teachers, who saw her Puerto Rican heritage as a weakness.<ref name=\"Mohr, Nicholasa 1991\">Mohr, Nicholasa. \"In My Own Words: Growing Up Inside the Sanctuary of My Imagination.\" Simon & Schuster, 1991.</ref> Since Mohr's parents saw her schooling in America as a privilege, Mohr learned to adapt to her surroundings, while spending her free time volunteering in the library and reading, learning what she wasn't able to attain in school. After graduating junior high school, she got a job as a page girl in the New York Public Library.\n\nMohr studied fashion illustration in high school and graduated in 1953, then went to study at the [[Art Students League of New York|Arts Student's League]], an art school located in New York. Here she discovered the works of [[Diego Rivera]] and [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco|Jose Clemente Orozco]] which inspired her to study art and travel to Mexico City to study at the Taller de Gr\u00e1ficos for a semester. After a year she returned to the United States and attended the New School for Social Research. Then in 1959 she went to [[Brooklyn Museum Art School|Brooklyn Museum of Art School]] and [[Pratt Graphics Center]]. Throughout her studies Mohr was drawn to artwork because of its powerful message about social change.\n\nShe worked in both fine arts and writing until 1976, when she devoted herself entirely to writing after the success of her book ''Nilda''. Her switch to writing happened by chance when her art agent at the time rejected her artwork for someone else's book, but liked what she wrote when she was asked to write 50 pages about her childhood, which formed the basis for ''Nilda''.<ref>Thelma T., Reyna. \u201cLATINOPIA BOOK REVIEW NICHOLASA MOHR \u2018NILDA.\u2019\u201d Latinopia.com, 26 Mar. 2012, latinopia.com/latino-literature/latinopia-book-review-nicholasa-mohr-nilda/.</ref>\n\nFrom 1988 through 1991, she taught writing as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Queens College, City University of New York]].  From 1994 through 1995, she was Writer-in-Residence at Richmond College, the American University in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkinbuddies.com/mohr/index.html|title=Balkin Buddies|work=balkinbuddies.com|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Major Works ==\nMohr published her first book ''Nilda'' in 1973, which traces the life of a teenage Puerto Rican girl who confronts prejudices during the World War II era in New York. She was awarded the Jane Addams Children's Book Award.<ref name=\"HF\"/> She incorporated autobiographical material for the book even though it is a work of fiction. Drawing on her training and expertise in art, Mohr created the book jacket and eight illustrations for the book.\n\nMohr's second book, ''El Bronx Remembered'', was published in 1975 by Harper & Row. It is a collection of stories and a novella about the struggles of Puerto Ricans living in New York from the late 1940s through the mid 1950s.  It was awarded the New Times Outstanding Book Award, making Mohr the first Latin female  to receive such an honor.<ref name=\"HF\"/>\n\nMohr has written fifteen books total, not including reprinted or translated versions. Ten of her books are written for young adults, two are for children, and three are written for adults. Her most recent books are 1997's \u201cA Matter of Pride and Other Stories,\u201d published by [[Arte P\u00fablico Press]] and ''Untitled Nicholasa Mohr'' in 1998.\n\nThough she has not been as active publishing in the last twenty years, her books are still highly regarded. In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, 'Hamilton' Creator [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] cited ''Nilda'' as the book that shaped him the most.<ref>\u201cLin-Manuel Miranda: By the Book.\u201d New York Times, 5 Apr. 2016, www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/books/review/lin-manuel-miranda-by-the-book.html.</ref>\n\n== Creative Influences ==\nMohr is predominantly influenced by Puerto Rican culture and the migratory patterns of Puerto Ricans within the United States. Though Puerto Ricans have been American citizens since 1917 through the [[Jones-Shafroth Act]], Mohr has said that Puerto Ricans felt as though they were \u201cstrangers in their own land,\u201d as though they were refugees when coming to the U.S. In Mohr's own memoir, she recalls living in an all-white neighborhood with her family as a child. Her brothers got brutally beaten and she was afraid to leave her house. Due to this, the family moved after four months to another part of the Bronx. These incidents of brutality and fear are what inspired her young adult book ''Felita''.\n\nFeeling like an outcast is a common theme in Mohr's stories, and is also paralleled through her own life experiences. In Mohr's memoir, she recalls times where her bilingualism got her in trouble in school. In ''Nilda'', a similar situation occurs where a character finds her knuckles smacked by a teacher when she speaks Spanish. In addition, when Mohr discussed her faith with nuns growing up, she was told that her religious practice was \"sinful.\"<ref name=\"Mohr, Nicholasa 1991\"/> Being forced to assimilate to a new culture is a reoccurring issue in Mohr's books, and her characters use their voices to overcome stereotypes as Mohr did in her life.\n\nMohr's children's book ''The song of el coqu\u00ed and other tales of Puerto Rico'' (written and published in both English and Spanish), discusses the ancestral traditions that make up Puerto Rican culture, and mixes the heritages of Latin Americans, Africans, Spaniards, as well as indigenous people. She uses animals to illustrate the mixing and blending of cultures frequent in Latin America.<ref>Smolen, Lynn Atkinson, and Victoria Ortiz-Castro. \u201cDissolving Borders and Broadening Perspectives through Latino Traditional Literature.\u201d The Reading Teacher, vol. 53, no. 7, 2000, pp. 566\u2013578. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/20204842.</ref>\n\nBy exploring the lives and traditions of Latin Americans, Mohr encourages readers of all ages and ethnicities to widen their perceptions of Latinos.\n\n== Personal life ==\nMohr met her husband Irwin when she attended the New School for Social Research, but he passed away in 1978. They have two sons, David and Jason.\n\n== Works ==\n*{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSzYi1HGUusC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:Nicholasa+inauthor:Mohr#v=onepage&q=&f=false| title=Nilda: a novel |publisher= Arte Publico Press| year= 1986| isbn=978-0-934770-61-3 }} (First published 1974.)\n*{{cite book| title=Bronx Remembered: A Novella and Stories | publisher= San Val, Incorporated| year= 1993| isbn= 978-0-613-18443-4 }}\n*{{cite book| title=El Bronx remembered: a novella and stories| publisher= Harper & Row| year= 1975 }}\n*{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eic1FOBShBIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:Nicholasa+inauthor:Mohr#v=onepage&q=&f=false| title=In Nueva York | publisher= Arte Publico Press| year= 1988| isbn= 978-0-934770-78-1 }}\n*{{cite book| title= Felita| others= Illustrator Ray Cruz| publisher= Bantam| year= 1990| isbn= 978-0-553-15792-5| url= https://archive.org/details/felitamohr00mohr}}\n*{{cite book| title=Going home| publisher= Dial Books for Young Readers| year= 1986| isbn= 978-0-8037-0269-1 }}\n*{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8CKdns3q8EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:Nicholasa+inauthor:Mohr#v=onepage&q=&f=false| title=Rituals of survival: a woman's portfolio| publisher= Arte Publico Press| year= 1985| isbn= 978-0-934770-39-2 }}\n*{{cite book| title=Growing up inside the sanctuary of my imagination| publisher=J.
