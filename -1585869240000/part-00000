In German, a carillon is also called a ''Glockenspiel''; while the [[percussion instrument]] called a \"[[glockenspiel]]\" by English speakers is often called a ''carillon'' in French.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:1294-Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|The Hemony carillon of the [[Zuiderkerk (Amsterdam)|Zuiderkerk]] in [[Amsterdam]] was installed in 1656]]\nIn medieval times, swinging bells were first used as a way of notifying people of imminent church services, and for such as fires, storms, wars and other secular events.\n\nHowever, the use of bells to play melodic musical compositions originated in the 16th century in the [[Low Countries]]. The first carillon was in [[Flanders]], where a \"fool\" performed music on the bells of [[Oudenaarde Town Hall]] in 1510 by using a baton keyboard.\n\nMajor figures in the evolution of the modern carillon were [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] working in the 17th century. They are credited as being the greatest carillon bell founders in the history of the [[Low Countries]]. They developed the carillon, in collaboration with [[Jacob van Eyck]], into a full-fledged musical instrument by casting the first tuned carillon in 1644, which was installed in [[Zutphen]]'s [[Wijnhuistoren]] tower.\n\n==Musical characteristics==\n[[File:Carillon of PeterAndPaulCathedral 1.JPG|thumb|Carillon bells, [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]], [[St. Petersburg]]]]\n[[File:Carillonneur playing the 56-bell carillon at the Plummer Building, Rochester, Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Carillonneur playing the 56-bell carillon at the [[Plummer Building]], [[Rochester, Minnesota]]]]\n[[File:BIG 117025309040611.jpg|thumb|upright|Carillonneur demonstrating using the sides of the hands to strike the clavier (keyboard).]]\nThe [http://www.carillon.org/eng/fs_orga.htm World Carillon Federation] defines a carillon as \"A musical instrument composed of tuned [[bronze]] bells which are played from a baton [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. Only those carillons having at least 23 bells may be taken into consideration.\"<ref>Quoted from: Guild of Carillonneurs in North America GCNA</ref>\n\nThe [http://www.gcna.org Guild of Carillonneurs in North America GCNA] defines a carillon as \"a musical instrument consisting of at least two octaves of carillon bells arranged in [[chromatic]] series and played from a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] permitting control of expression through variation of touch. A carillon bell is a cast [[bronze]] cup-shaped bell whose partial tones are in such harmonious relationship to each other as to permit many such bells to be sounded together in varied chords with harmonious and concordant effect.\" The GCNA defines a \"traditional carillon\" as one played from a carillon mechanical (not electrified) baton keyboard,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gcna.org/mechanism.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928220333/http://gcna.org/mechanism.html |archive-date=2013-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and a \"non-traditional carillon\" as a musical instrument with bells, but played by automated mechanical or electro-mechanical means, or from an electrical or electronic keyboard.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gcna.org/carillons.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928232906/http://gcna.org/carillons.html |archive-date=2013-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSince each note is produced by an individual bell, a carillon's [[Range (music)|musical range]] is determined by the number of bells it has. Different names are assigned to instruments based on the number of bells they comprise:\n* Carillons with between 23 and 27 bells are referred to as ''two-[[octave]] carillons''. Players of these instruments often use music arranged specifically for their limited range of notes.\n* A ''concert carillon'' has a range of at least four octaves (47 bells). This is sometimes referred to as the \"standard-sized\" carillon.\nThe [[Riverside Church|Riverside Carillon]] in New York City has the largest tuned carillon bell in the world, which sounds C<sub>2</sub> (two octaves below [[middle C]]).\n\nTravelling or mobile carillons are not placed in a tower, but can be transported. Some of them can even be played indoors\u2014in a concert hall or church\u2014like the mobile carillon of [[Frank Steijns]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.franksteijns.com/ | title = Frank Ste\u0133ns}}.</ref>\n\nPoorly tuned bells often give an \"out of tune\" impression and also can be out of tune with themselves. This is due to the unusual [[harmonic]] characteristics of [[foundry]] bells, which have strong overtones above and below the [[fundamental frequency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hibberts.co.uk/tuning.htm|title=The Sound of Bells \u2013 Overview of tuning|website=Hibberts.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThere is no standard pitch range for the carillon. In general, a concert carillon will have a minimum of 48 bells. The range of any given instrument usually depends on funds available for the fabrication and installation of the instrument: more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. Older carillons can be transposing instruments, generally transposing upward. Most modern instruments sound at concert pitch. A carillon [[Musical keyboard|clavier]] has both a manual and a pedal keyboard.\n\n==Carillon music==\nCarillon music is typically written on two staves. Notes written in the bass clef are generally played by the feet. Notes written in the treble clef are played with the hands. Pedals range from the lowest note (the [[bourdon (bell)|bourdon]]) and may continue up to two and half octaves. In the North American Standard keyboard, all notes can be played on the manual.\n\nBecause of the acoustic peculiarities of a carillon bell (the prominence of the minor third, and the lack of damping of sound), music written for other instruments needs to be arranged specifically for the carillon.\n\nThe combination of carillon and other instruments, while possible, is generally not a happy marriage. The carillon is generally far too loud to perform with most other concert instruments. The great exceptions to this are some late twentieth- and early twenty-first century compositions involving electronic media and carillon. In these compositions, sound amplification is able to match the extreme dynamic range of the carillon and, in the case of sensitive composers, even the most delicate effects are possible. Brass music is often heard together with a (traveling) carillon.\n\n==Carillonneurs==\nThe carillonneur or carillonist is the title of the [[musician]] who plays the carillon. The carillonneur usually sits in a cabin beneath the bells and plays with the fifth (little) finger pressed down with a loosely closed fist, on a series of baton-like keys arranged in the same pattern as a piano keyboard. The batons are almost never played with the fingers as one does a piano, though this is sometimes used as a special carillon playing technique. The keys activate levers and wires that connect directly to the bells' clappers; thus, as with a piano, the carillonneur can vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to the key. In addition to the manual keys, the heavier bells are also played with a [[pedal keyboard]]. These notes can either be played with the hands or the feet.\n\n===Carillon schools===\nThe world's first international carillon school, the [[Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\"]], is in [[Mechelen]], [[Belgium]], where the study of campanology originated. Students from all over the world come to study campanology here. Other carillon schools include the [[Netherlands Carillon School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hku.nl/web/English/English/Bachelors/BachelorOfMusic/Carillon.htm |title=Utrecht School of the Arts, Faculty of Music |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018141634/http://www.hku.nl/web/English/English/Bachelors/BachelorOfMusic/Carillon.htm | archive-date=2012-10-18 }}</ref> in [[Amersfoort]], [[Netherlands]].\n\nIn North America, one can study the carillon at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] (which is home to two of only twenty-three grand carillons in the world), the [[University of Florida]], the [[University of Denver]]'s Lamont School of Music, and [[Missouri State University]], all of which offer complete courses of study. One can also take private lessons at many carillon locations, and there are universities that offer limited credit for carillon performance, such as [[Clemson University]], the [[University of Kansas]], [[Iowa State University]], [[Grand Valley State University]], [[Marquette University]] and the [[University of Rochester]].\n\nThe [[George Cadbury]] Carillon School was opened in 2006 and is the only carillon school in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Indiana State University | url = http://www.music.iastate.edu/carillon/summerseries/2008/Summer2008.php | title = Carillon Summer series | year = 2008 | access-date = 2009-12-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100504143907/http://www.music.iastate.edu/carillon/summerseries/2008/Summer2008.php | archive-date = 2010-05-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAnother international carillon school, the Scandinavian Carillon School<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locus-dei.dk/kms/ |title=KMS |publisher=Locus Dei |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731135548/http://www.locus-dei.dk/kms/ |archivedate=2007-07-31 }}</ref> in [[L\u00f8gumkloster]], Denmark, was established in 1979.

In German, a carillon is also called a ''Glockenspiel''; while the [[percussion instrument]] called a \"[[glockenspiel]]\" by English speakers is often called a ''carillon'' in French.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:1294-Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|The Hemony carillon of the [[Zuiderkerk (Amsterdam)|Zuiderkerk]] in [[Amsterdam]] was installed in 1656]]\nIn medieval times, swinging bells were first used as a way of notifying people of imminent church services, and for such as fires, storms, wars and other secular events.\n\nHowever, the use of bells to play melodic musical compositions originated in the 16th century in the [[Low Countries]]. The first carillon was in [[Flanders]], where a \"fool\" performed music on the bells of [[Oudenaarde Town Hall]] in 1510 by using a baton keyboard.\n\nMajor figures in the evolution of the modern carillon were [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] working in the 17th century. They are credited as being the greatest carillon bell founders in the history of the [[Low Countries]]. They developed the carillon, in collaboration with [[Jacob van Eyck]], into a full-fledged musical instrument by casting the first tuned carillon in 1644, which was installed in [[Zutphen]]'s [[Wijnhuistoren]] tower.\n\n==Musical characteristics==\n[[File:Carillon of PeterAndPaulCathedral 1.JPG|thumb|Carillon bells, [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]], [[St. Petersburg]]]]\n[[File:Carillonneur playing the 56-bell carillon at the Plummer Building, Rochester, Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Carillonneur playing the 56-bell carillon at the [[Plummer Building]], [[Rochester, Minnesota]]]]\n[[File:BIG 117025309040611.jpg|thumb|upright|Carillonneur demonstrating using the sides of the hands to strike the clavier (keyboard).]]\nThe [http://www.carillon.org/eng/fs_orga.htm World Carillon Federation] defines a carillon as \"A musical instrument composed of tuned [[bronze]] bells which are played from a baton [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. Only those carillons having at least 23 bells may be taken into consideration.\"<ref>Quoted from: Guild of Carillonneurs in North America GCNA</ref>\n\nThe [http://www.gcna.org Guild of Carillonneurs in North America GCNA] defines a carillon as \"a musical instrument consisting of at least two octaves of carillon bells arranged in [[chromatic]] series and played from a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] permitting control of expression through variation of touch. A carillon bell is a cast [[bronze]] cup-shaped bell whose partial tones are in such harmonious relationship to each other as to permit many such bells to be sounded together in varied chords with harmonious and concordant effect.\" The GCNA defines a \"traditional carillon\" as one played from a carillon mechanical (not electrified) baton keyboard,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gcna.org/mechanism.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928220333/http://gcna.org/mechanism.html |archive-date=2013-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and a \"non-traditional carillon\" as a musical instrument with bells, but played by automated mechanical or electro-mechanical means, or from an electrical or electronic keyboard.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gcna.org/carillons.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928232906/http://gcna.org/carillons.html |archive-date=2013-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSince each note is produced by an individual bell, a carillon's [[Range (music)|musical range]] is determined by the number of bells it has. Different names are assigned to instruments based on the number of bells they comprise:\n* Carillons with between 23 and 27 bells are referred to as ''two-[[octave]] carillons''. Players of these instruments often use music arranged specifically for their limited range of notes.\n* A ''concert carillon'' has a range of at least four octaves (47 bells). This is sometimes referred to as the \"standard-sized\" carillon.\nThe [[Riverside Church|Riverside Carillon]] in New York City has the largest tuned carillon bell in the world, which sounds C<sub>2</sub> (two octaves below [[middle C]]).\n\nTravelling or mobile carillons are not placed in a tower, but can be transported. Some of them can even be played indoors\u2014in a concert hall or church\u2014like the mobile carillon of [[Frank Steijns]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.franksteijns.com/ | title = Frank Ste\u0133ns}}.</ref>\n\nPoorly tuned bells often give an \"out of tune\" impression and also can be out of tune with themselves. This is due to the unusual [[harmonic]] characteristics of [[foundry]] bells, which have strong overtones above and below the [[fundamental frequency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hibberts.co.uk/tuning.htm|title=The Sound of Bells \u2013 Overview of tuning|website=Hibberts.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThere is no standard pitch range for the carillon. In general, a concert carillon will have a minimum of 48 bells. The range of any given instrument usually depends on funds available for the fabrication and installation of the instrument: more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. Older carillons can be transposing instruments, generally transposing upward. Most modern instruments sound at concert pitch. A carillon [[Musical keyboard|clavier]] has both a manual and a pedal keyboard.\n\n==Carillon music==\nCarillon music is typically written on two staves. Notes written in the bass clef are generally played by the feet. Notes written in the treble clef are played with the hands. Pedals range from the lowest note (the [[bourdon (bell)|bourdon]]) and may continue up to two and half octaves. In the North American Standard keyboard, all notes can be played on the manual.\n\nBecause of the acoustic peculiarities of a carillon bell (the prominence of the minor third, and the lack of damping of sound), music written for other instruments needs to be arranged specifically for the carillon.\n\nThe combination of carillon and other instruments, while possible, is generally not a happy marriage. The carillon is generally far too loud to perform with most other concert instruments. The great exceptions to this are some late twentieth- and early twenty-first century compositions involving electronic media and carillon. In these compositions, sound amplification is able to match the extreme dynamic range of the carillon and, in the case of sensitive composers, even the most delicate effects are possible. Brass music is often heard together with a (traveling) carillon.\n\n==Carillonneurs==\nThe carillonneur or carillonist is the title of the [[musician]] who plays the carillon. The carillonneur usually sits in a cabin beneath the bells and plays with the fifth (little) finger pressed down with a loosely closed fist, on a series of baton-like keys arranged in the same pattern as a piano keyboard. The batons are almost never played with the fingers as one does a piano, though this is sometimes used as a special carillon playing technique. The keys activate levers and wires that connect directly to the bells' clappers; thus, as with a piano, the carillonneur can vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to the key. In addition to the manual keys, the heavier bells are also played with a [[pedal keyboard]].

Both major parties, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Whig Party (US)|Whig Party]], organized as rivals for roughly 20 years, lost critical voter support. The Whig Party disintegrated over the slavery issue even as Northern voters, strongly opposing the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], shifted sharply against Democrats. The elected majority temporarily coalesced as the [[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|Opposition Party]]. This transitional party included Whigs, [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] members, [[Know Nothing|American Party]] members or Know Nothings, the [[People's Party (United States, 1854\u20131860)|People's Party]] of Indiana, [[Anti-Nebraska movement|Anti-Nebraska]] candidates, a few disaffected Northern Democrats, and members of the nascent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which soon would amalgamate most of these factions, becoming the new rival to the Democrats.\n\nCandidates opposed to the Democratic Party won widely in the North through November 1854. The American Party, ignoring slavery and opposing immigration particularly by Catholics from [[Ireland]] and [[Germany]], won seats from both major parties, but to the net loss of Democrats, in New England and the South from November 1854 into 1855.\n\nCongress had passed the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in May 1854 after aggressive sponsorship by the Pierce Administration and Democrats led by Illinois Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]], including an outspoken contingent of radical pro-slavery legislators. The Act repealed the 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] and triggered the [[Bleeding Kansas]] conflict. With widely foreseen risks and immediately negative results, the Act publicly discredited the Democratic Party, fueling new partisan and sectional rancor. It created violent uncertainty on the frontier by abruptly making slavery potentially legal in territories originally comprising the northern portion of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and attractive to contemporary settlers. Settlers were expected to determine the status of slavery locally. This idea appealed to Democratic politicians and to some voters in its shape and intent, but proved unworkable in Kansas where the status of slavery would be closely disputed between more numerous settlers from the North and geographically closer settlers from the South. Even some Southern voters who kjkv dbfrgfhrgv fbvhfbfh vhhbalfv ahfclva v hailvhbhfc bjsalfhvbsn vhb.sdn v albvhjbvlahbfhvfb hbvhlv vasndfbhbffd fbdhf ahdbhdvhvl hcbvds fbvf jvbd vdhsdcbjD dhvbvlsvnblhjbv bvlbn fjdbc was politically reckless, and that attempting to push slavery by law and force into territories where settlers predictably were unlikely to want it endangered its continued legal protection anywhere, even in the South. These fears proved prescient.\n\nThe election of the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] was the lengthiest and most contentious in history. More than 21 Representatives vied for the post. After two months and 133 ballots, American Party Representative Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts, who was also a Free Soiler, defeated Democrat [[William Aiken Jr.|William Aiken]] of South Carolina both by plurality and a margin of three votes.<ref>{{cite book | first=Allan | last=Nevins | url= | title=Ordeal of the Union, Volume II: A House Dividing 1852-1857 | location=New York | year=1947 | pages=413\u2013415 | isbn= }}</ref>\n\n==Election summaries==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n| colspan=10 | [[File:34th Congress United States House of Representatives.svg|center|frameless|440x440px]]\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n!

Both major parties, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Whig Party (US)|Whig Party]], organized as rivals for roughly 20 years, lost critical voter support. The Whig Party disintegrated over the slavery issue even as Northern voters, strongly opposing the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], shifted sharply against Democrats. The elected majority temporarily coalesced as the [[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|Opposition Party]]. This transitional party included Whigs, [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] members, [[Know Nothing|American Party]] members or Know Nothings, the [[People's Party (United States, 1854\u20131860)|People's Party]] of Indiana, [[Anti-Nebraska movement|Anti-Nebraska]] candidates, a few disaffected Northern Democrats, and members of the nascent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which soon would amalgamate most of these factions, becoming the new rival to the Democrats.\n\nCandidates opposed to the Democratic Party won widely in the North through November 1854. The American Party, ignoring slavery and opposing immigration particularly by Catholics from [[Ireland]] and [[Germany]], won seats from both major parties, but to the net loss of Democrats, in New England and the South from November 1854 into 1855.\n\nCongress had passed the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in May 1854 after aggressive sponsorship by the Pierce Administration and Democrats led by Illinois Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]], including an outspoken contingent of radical pro-slavery legislators. The Act repealed the 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] and triggered the [[Bleeding Kansas]] conflict. With widely foreseen risks and immediately negative results, the Act publicly discredited the Democratic Party, fueling new partisan and sectional rancor. It created violent uncertainty on the frontier by abruptly making slavery potentially legal in territories originally comprising the northern portion of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and attractive to contemporary settlers. Settlers were expected to determine the status of slavery locally. This idea appealed to Democratic politicians and to some voters in its shape and intent, but proved unworkable in Kansas where the status of slavery would be closely disputed between more numerous settlers from the North and geographically closer settlers from the South.

These fears proved prescient.\n\nThe election of the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] was the lengthiest and most contentious in history.

Since then, Boston's suburbs have been moving out further westward, especially after the construction of [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] and [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]]. The Worcester region now marks the western periphery of the Boston-Worcester-Providence (MA-RI-NH) U.S. Census [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA), or [[Greater Boston]].

''History of Worcester, Massachusetts'', pp. 22\u201323. Worcester: Charles Hersey.</ref>  In 1673 English settlers [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and [[Daniel Gookin]] led an expedition to Quinsigamond to establish a new Christian Indian \"praying town\" and identify a new location for an English settlement. On July 13, 1674, Gookin obtained a deed to eight square miles of land in Quinsigamond from the Nipmuc people and English traders and settlers began to inhabit the region.<ref name=Indian>{{cite web|title= Hassanamisco Indian Museum History|publisher=Hassanamisco Indian Museum|year=2013 |url=http://nipmucmuseum.org/history |accessdate=December 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1675, [[King Philip's War]] broke out throughout New England with the Nipmuc Indians coming to the aid of Indian leader [[Metacomet|King Philip]]. The English settlers completely abandoned the Quinsigamond area and the empty buildings were burned by the Indian forces. The town was again abandoned during [[Queen Anne's War]] in 1702.<ref name=\"Indian\" />   Finally in 1713, Worcester was permanently resettled for a third time by [[Jonas Rice]].<ref name=\"WSA\">Worcester Society of Antiquity (1903).

However, the manufacturing industry in Worcester would not begin to thrive until the opening of the [[Blackstone Canal]] in 1828 and the opening of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Worcester and Boston Railroad]] in 1835.

Worcester felt the national trends of movement away from historic urban centers. The city's population would drop over 20% from 1950 to 1980.  In the mid-20th century large [[urban renewal]] projects were undertaken to try and reverse the city's decline.

The river courses underground through the center of the city, and emerges at the foot of College Hill. It then flows south through Quinsigamond Village and into Millbury. Worcester is the beginning of the [[Blackstone Valley]] that frames the river. The [[Blackstone Canal]] was once an important waterway connecting Worcester to Providence and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], but the canal fell into disuse at the end of the 19th century and was mostly covered up.

Massachusetts' geographic location, jutting out into the [[North Atlantic]], makes the city very prone to [[Nor'easter]] weather systems that can dump heavy snow on the region.\n\nWhile rare, the city has had its share of extreme weather. On September 21, 1938, the city was hit by the brutal [[New England Hurricane of 1938]]. Fifteen years later, Worcester was hit by a [[1953 Worcester tornado|tornado]] that killed 94 people.

A [[city council]] acts as the legislative body, and the council-appointed manager handles the traditional day-to-day chief executive functions.\n\nCity councilors can run as either a representative of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives the greatest number of votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if they do not want to be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.\n\nWorcester's first [[charter]], which went into effect in 1848, established a Mayor/[[Bicameralism|Bicameral]] form of government. Together, the two chambers \u2014 the 11-member Board of [[alderman|Aldermen]] and the 30-member Common Council \u2014 were vested with complete legislative powers. The mayor handled all administrative departments, though appointments to those departments had to be approved by the two-chamber City Council.\n\nSeeking to replace the 1848 charter, Worcester voters in November 1947 approved a change to [[Government of Massachusetts#Form of government: city vs. town|Plan E municipal government]]. In effect from January 1949 until November 1985, this charter (as outlined in chapter 43 of the Massachusetts General Laws) established City Council/City Manager government. This type of governance, with modifications, has survived to the present day.\n\nInitially, Plan E government in Worcester was organized as a 9-member council (all at-large), a ceremonial mayor elected from the council by the councilors, and a council-appointed city manager. The manager oversees the daily administration of the city, makes all appointments to city offices, and can be removed at any time by a majority vote of the Council. The mayor chairs the city council and the school committee, and does not have the power to veto any vote.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf | title=Considering Worcester's Charter | date=April 20, 1999 | publisher=Worcester Regional Research Bureau | accessdate=June 17, 2004|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616175906/http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf |archivedate = June 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1949 through 1959, elections were by the [[single transferable vote]]. Voters repealed that system in November 1960. Despite [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] elections, two groups alternated in control of council: the local Democratic Party and a [[Slate (elections)|slate]] known as the Citizens' Plan E Association (CEA). CEA members included the Republican Party leadership and other groups not affiliated with the regular Democratic Party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Santucci|first=Jack|date=April 2018|title=Evidence of a winning-cohesion tradeoff under multi-winner ranked-choice voting|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=52|pages=128\u2013138|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2017.11.003|issn=0261-3794|url=http://osf.io/qjtwn/}}</ref>\n[[File:WorcesterMA Downtown.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Worcester, with [[Worcester City Hall and Common|City Hall]] (1898) at right]]\n\nIn 1983, Worcester voters again decided to change the city charter. This \"Home Rule\" charter (named for the method of adoption of the charter) is similar to Plan E, the major changes being to the structure of the council and the election of the mayor. The 9-member Council became 11, 6 at-large and 1 from each city district. The mayor is chosen by popular election, but must also run and win as an at-large councilor.\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:Massachusetts Vietnam Memorial-entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Massachusetts Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, erected in 2002]]\n[[File:LincolnSquareWorcesterMApostcard.jpg|thumb|right|Lincoln Square c. 1912]]\nWorcester's history of [[social progressivism]] includes a number of [[temperance movement in Massachusetts|temperance]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movements.

[[Edward Everett Hale]].\n\nThe area was already home to [[Lucy Stone]], [[Eli Thayer]], and [[Samuel May, Jr]]. They were joined in their political activities by networks of related Quaker families such as the Earles and the Chases, whose organizing efforts were crucial to the anti-slavery cause in central Massachusetts and throughout New England.\n\nAnarchist [[Emma Goldman]] and two others opened an ice cream shop in 1892. \"It was spring and not yet warm,\" Goldman later wrote, \"but the coffee I brewed, our sandwiches, and dainty dishes were beginning to be appreciated.

Klansmen in sheets and hoods, new Knights awaiting a mass induction ceremony, and supporters swelled the crowd to 15,000. The KKK had hired more than 400 \"husky guards\", but when the rally ended around midnight, a riot broke out. Klansmen's cars were stoned and burned, and their windows smashed. KKK members were pulled from their cars and beaten. Klansmen called for police protection, but the situation raged out of control for most of the night. The violence after the \"Klanvocation\" had the desired effect: Membership fell off, and no further public Klan meetings were held in Worcester.<ref name=\"klanvocation\">{{cite web|title=Ku Klux Clan Rallies in Worcester: October 19, 1924|url=http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=302|website=Mass Moments|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Waring Stoddard|Robert Stoddard]], owner of ''The Telegram and Gazette'', was one of the founders of the [[John Birch Society]].\n\nSixties era radical [[Abbie Hoffman]] was born in Worcester in 1936 and spent more than half of his life in the city.\n{| class=wikitable\n! colspan = 6 | Voter registration and party enrollment as of October 19, 2016 \u2013 Worcester<ref>{{cite web|title = The Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Enrollment Breakdown as of October 19, 2016 (pg 18) | publisher = Massachusetts Elections Division | format = PDF | accessdate = January 25, 2017 | url = http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/enrollment_counts_20161019.pdf}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

The first Catholics came to Worcester in 1826. They were chiefly Irish immigrants brought to America by the builders of the Blackstone canal. As time went on and the number of Catholics increased, the community petitioned Bishop Fenwick to send them a priest. In response to this appeal, the bishop appointed the Reverend James Fitton to visit the Catholics of Worcester in 1834. Catholic mass was first offered in the city in an old stone building on Front Street. The foundation of Christ's Church, the first Catholic church in Worcester (now St. John's), was laid on July 6, 1834.<ref>F.P.

Worcester is bordered by the towns of [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], [[Grafton, Massachusetts|Grafton]], [[Holden, Massachusetts|Holden]], [[Leicester, Massachusetts|Leicester]], [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]], [[Paxton, Massachusetts|Paxton]], [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]], and [[West Boylston, Massachusetts|West Boylston]].\n\nWorcester is known as the ''Heart of the Commonwealth,'' because of its proximity to the center of Massachusetts. The city is about {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of [[Boston]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], and {{convert|38|mi|km}} northwest of [[Providence, Rhode Island]].\n\nThe [[Blackstone River]] forms in the center of Worcester by the confluence of the Middle River and Mill Brook. The river courses underground through the center of the city, and emerges at the foot of College Hill. It then flows south through Quinsigamond Village and into Millbury. Worcester is the beginning of the [[Blackstone Valley]] that frames the river. The [[Blackstone Canal]] was once an important waterway connecting Worcester to Providence and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], but the canal fell into disuse at the end of the 19th century and was mostly covered up. In recent years, local organizations, including the Canal District Business Association, have proposed restoring the canal and creating a Blackstone Valley [[National Park]].<ref name=blackstone>{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Jones-D'Agostino |title=Worcester's Canal District Banks On National Park Designation|url=http://www.golocalworcester.com/news/canal-district-boosters-push-for-national-historic-park/ |publisher=GoLocalWorcester|date=September 3, 2013|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref>  In November 2018, the administration of [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Charlie Baker]] announced a $400,000 grant to streetscape improvements in the Canal District.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baker-Polito Administration Announces $400K MassWorks Award for Worcester|website=www.mass.gov|url=https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-announces-400k-massworks-award-for-worcester|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=December 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWorcester is one of many cities claimed, like [[Rome]], [[List of cities claimed to be built on seven hills|to be found on seven hills]]: Airport Hill, Bancroft Hill, Belmont Hill (Bell Hill), [[Grafton Hill]], Green Hill, Pakachoag Hill and Vernon Hill. However, Worcester has more than seven hills including Indian Hill, Newton Hill, Poet's Hill, and Wigwam Hill.\n\nWorcester has many ponds and two prominent lakes: [[Indian Lake (Massachusetts)|Indian Lake]] and [[Lake Quinsigamond]]. Lake Quinsigamond (also known as ''Long Pond'') stretches four miles across the Worcester and Shrewsbury border and is a very popular [[rowing (sport)|competitive rowing]] and boating destination.\n\n===Climate===\nWorcester's [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb'') is typical of [[New England]]. The weather changes rapidly owing to the confluence of warm, humid air from the southwest; cool, dry air from the north; and the moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Summers are typically warm and humid, while winters are cold, windy, and snowy. Snow typically falls from the second half of November into early April,<ref name = NOAA/> with occasional falls in October; May snow is much rarer.

On September 21, 1938, the city was hit by the brutal [[New England Hurricane of 1938]]. Fifteen years later, Worcester was hit by a [[1953 Worcester tornado|tornado]] that killed 94 people. The deadliest tornado in New England history, it damaged a large part of the city and surrounding towns.

A [[city council]] acts as the legislative body, and the council-appointed manager handles the traditional day-to-day chief executive functions.\n\nCity councilors can run as either a representative of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives the greatest number of votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if they do not want to be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.\n\nWorcester's first [[charter]], which went into effect in 1848, established a Mayor/[[Bicameralism|Bicameral]] form of government. Together, the two chambers \u2014 the 11-member Board of [[alderman|Aldermen]] and the 30-member Common Council \u2014 were vested with complete legislative powers. The mayor handled all administrative departments, though appointments to those departments had to be approved by the two-chamber City Council.\n\nSeeking to replace the 1848 charter, Worcester voters in November 1947 approved a change to [[Government of Massachusetts#Form of government: city vs. town|Plan E municipal government]]. In effect from January 1949 until November 1985, this charter (as outlined in chapter 43 of the Massachusetts General Laws) established City Council/City Manager government. This type of governance, with modifications, has survived to the present day.\n\nInitially, Plan E government in Worcester was organized as a 9-member council (all at-large), a ceremonial mayor elected from the council by the councilors, and a council-appointed city manager. The manager oversees the daily administration of the city, makes all appointments to city offices, and can be removed at any time by a majority vote of the Council. The mayor chairs the city council and the school committee, and does not have the power to veto any vote.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf | title=Considering Worcester's Charter | date=April 20, 1999 | publisher=Worcester Regional Research Bureau | accessdate=June 17, 2004|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616175906/http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf |archivedate = June 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1949 through 1959, elections were by the [[single transferable vote]]. Voters repealed that system in November 1960. Despite [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] elections, two groups alternated in control of council: the local Democratic Party and a [[Slate (elections)|slate]] known as the Citizens' Plan E Association (CEA). CEA members included the Republican Party leadership and other groups not affiliated with the regular Democratic Party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Santucci|first=Jack|date=April 2018|title=Evidence of a winning-cohesion tradeoff under multi-winner ranked-choice voting|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=52|pages=128\u2013138|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2017.11.003|issn=0261-3794|url=http://osf.io/qjtwn/}}</ref>\n[[File:WorcesterMA Downtown.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Worcester, with [[Worcester City Hall and Common|City Hall]] (1898) at right]]\n\nIn 1983, Worcester voters again decided to change the city charter.

More boating clubs and races followed, and soon many colleges (local, national, and international) held regattas, such as the [[Eastern Sprints]], on the lake. Beginning in 1895, local high schools held crew races on the lake. In 1952, the lake played host to the National Olympic rowing trials.\n\nIn 2002, the Jesse Burkett Little League all-stars team went all the way to the [[Little League World Series]].

The first Catholics came to Worcester in 1826. They were chiefly Irish immigrants brought to America by the builders of the Blackstone canal. As time went on and the number of Catholics increased, the community petitioned Bishop Fenwick to send them a priest. In response to this appeal, the bishop appointed the Reverend James Fitton to visit the Catholics of Worcester in 1834. Catholic mass was first offered in the city in an old stone building on Front Street. The foundation of Christ's Church, the first Catholic church in Worcester (now St. John's), was laid on July 6, 1834.<ref>F.P.

Chaim Hugo Lewin (1891-1944), her father, like his brother Hermann Zvi Lewin (1878-1976), had fought in the [[First World War]], emerging from military service as a highly decorated former officer.<ref name=RDlautCE/>   Her mother, born Erna Rosenbaun (1893-1944), came originally from [[Halberstadt]] in central Germany.<ref name=ERlautGeni>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Erna-Lewin/6000000022551649691 |title=Erna Lewin (Rosenbaum)|publisher=geni.com|author=Michael Hermann Leiserowitz (compiler) |accessdate= 1 April 2020}}</ref>  Rachel grew up in a traditional [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] family, albeit in a family that would at the time have been considered well integrated into German society more generally.   She attended a government secondary school (''\"Lyzeum\"''), while also receiving a parallel religious education at a Jewish religious school.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n===The Hitler difference===\nRachel would later look back on an idyllic childhood, prematurely ended when the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler government]] [[Machtergreifung|took power]] in January 1933 and lost no time in [[Gleichschaltung|transforming Germany]] into a [[one-party|one-]][[Nazi Party|party]] [[Enabling Act of 1933|dictatorship]].   [[Antisemitism]], hitherto a chilling mantra served up by noisy populist street-politicians, became a core underpinning of government strategy.   After March 1933, when Rachel was still aged only twelve, the slightly older boy who had become a friend (and admirer) was no longer permitted to come to the house.   Her mother explained that this was because she was Jewish and he was not.   From then on, she was required to sit in the back row of her class at school.   Six months later her parents received a letter stating simply that she was not on course to reach her targets.   She was switched to a middle school where harassment continued:  she would later recall being denied permission to visit the toilet when the need arose.  She decided that she would no longer attend the school.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=RDlautNK>{{cite web |url=https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.zeitzeugen-gespraech-geschichte-wider-das-vergessen.43477ad7-aa18-48c5-bc57-e7a1ea0d804b.html |work=Zeitzeugen-Gespr\u00e4ch |title=Geschichte wider das Vergessen |author= Natalie Kanter |date=17 January 2014 |publisher=Stuttgarter Nachrichten Verlagsgesellschaft mbH |accessdate= 31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Apprenticeship===\nIn 1935 she embarked on an apprenticeship for work as a seamstress.  In March 1936 she concluded that the intensification  of [[Nuremberg Laws|antisemitic legislation]] meant that she could expect no future in Germany.   She joined a [[Zionism|Zionist]] youth group:  between May 1936 and November 1938 she lived in [[Hamburg]] where the focus of her life was on [[Hakhshara|preparing for emigration]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], which since [[Mandate for Palestine|1920]] had been administered, for most purposes, as though a component territory of the [[British empire]].<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=RDlautGCJZ/>   [[Hamburg]] was an economically dynamic city with a long mercantile tradition which over the years had made it more open to ethnic and cultural diversity more cosmopolitan than [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in the east.   So, initially, she found it, a reassuring sense of belonging being strengthened by the fact that she was one of a group of 27 young people all staying at the same Hamburg address at one end of the \"Klosterallee\" (street) and all preparing actively for emigration to [[Palestine]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n===\"Poland Action\"===\nOn 28 October 1938 a member of the group called Wolfgang Drechsler, whom one source describes as Rachel Lewin's boyfriend, was arrested and swiftly deported.<ref name=\":1\"/>   This was part of the so-called [[Polenaktion|Poland Action]] which involved the arrest and deportation of approximately 17,000 Polish Jews who were stripped of any cash or other valuables and then placed on trains which transported them to the Polish border.<ref name=Polenaktion>{{cite web|title=Die Abschiebung polnischer Juden aus dem Deutschen Reich 1938/1939 und ihre \u00dcberlieferung|work=Gedenkbuch:  Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933-1945 |date=28 February 2020 |url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/zwangsausweisung.html.de?page=1 |publisher= Bundesarchiv, Koblenz |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>   The experience led Rachel Lewin to quit the \"Klosterallee\" group and move in with her mother's elder sister, Flora Rosenbaum, who taught at the [[:de:Talmud Tora Schule|Talmud Tora School]] in Hamburg's [[:de:Grindel (Hamburg)|Grindel district]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n===\"Pogrom night\"===\nTwo weeks later came [[Kristallnacht|Pogrom Night (often identified in English language sources as \"Kristallnacht\")]], during which, over in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], her parents' property was destroyed or plundered<ref name=RDlautCE/> in a national government-directed anti-Jewish pogrom.   Rachel Lewin slept through the night untroubled in her aunt's house.   The next morning, however, she witnessed Jews being beaten up and chased through the Hamburg streets by [[Sturmabteilung|Nazi paramilitaries]].   Unsure what was going on, she pushed her way through the crowd gathering at the newsstand on which newspapers were piled up, showing photographs of the overnight campaign of arson, looting and bloodshed.   The news vendor, whom till now had always seemed a friendly soul, spotted her, and giving a fair rendering of the Berlin dialect snarled, \"So, little Jew, do you too want to see how your synagogues burned?\"{{efn |\"Na, Judje, willste auch sehen, wie deine Synagogen brannten?\".<ref name=\":1\"/>}} The memory of that morning would never leave her.   When she returned to her aunt's house, her aunt was able to tell her more about what had happened.   Most of the teachers and some of the students at the [[:de:Grindel (Hamburg)|Grindel]] [[:de:Talmud Tora Schule|Talmud Tora School]] at which Flora Rosenbaum taught had already been arrested.  Desperately worried about her family, Rachel Lewin managed to contact her father who ordered her to come home.   When she reached [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] she found her parents living with her younger brother, Abraham, in the small apartment to which they had been forced to move.   Abraham had been so traumatised by the violence and destruction he had witnessed that he had acquired a sudden and severe speech impediment.   Meanwhile, her father carried the recent scars of a serious head injury which, she learned, had been inflicted using the handle of an oven.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n===Escape===\n[[Kristallnacht|Pogrom Night]] convinced Rachel Lewin that she needed to leave [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and emigrate to  [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] even if she had to do it alone.   (Her Hamburg [[Hakhshara]] group had by now been smashed by the authorities.)   In [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] there were frantic discussions within the family.   Her father thought it unrealistic to leave the country.   They had never been prosperous and now most of what they had previously owned had been destroyed or stolen.   Even rich people by this time faced prohibitively high and frequently arbitrary \"emigration taxes\" if wishing to emigrate using official channels.   From the south-east of Germany there were now organised underground groups devoted to smuggling victims of political or race persecution across the border to [[Czechoslovakia]], but [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] was nowhere near Czechoslovakia and it seems in any case unlikely that the Lewins would have had the relevant contacts.   Rachel's mother, in particular, was already in failing health and considered herself more German than Jewish.   Things could not go on getting worse for ever.   Rachel's parents, and in particular her mother, found it unthinkable that the situation would not in the future improve for Jews in Hitler's Germany.<ref name=\":1\"/>   It is not clear how Rachel Lewin made her way from [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] to [[Trieste]], which had been an [[Treaty of London (1915)|Italian city]] since [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|approximately 1920]].   She left Germany, according to one source, on 20 April 1939.<ref name=RLlautBZ>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.rilke-realschule-rot-eine-zeitzeugin-als-geschichtslehrerin.d6f4da35-172f-4377-a615-c4c1c00bb8f6.html|title=Eine Zeitzeugin als Geschichtslehrerin|author=Bernd Zeyer|date=13 December 2017|work=Der J\u00fcdin Rachel Dror gelang es, den Holocaust zu \u00fcberleben.

Chaim Hugo Lewin (1891-1944), her father, like his brother Hermann Zvi Lewin (1878-1976), had fought in the [[First World War]], emerging from military service as a highly decorated former officer.<ref name=RDlautCE/>   Her mother, born Erna Rosenbaun (1893-1944), came originally from [[Halberstadt]] in central Germany.<ref name=ERlautGeni>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Erna-Lewin/6000000022551649691 |title=Erna Lewin (Rosenbaum)|publisher=geni.com|author=Michael Hermann Leiserowitz (compiler) |accessdate= 1 April 2020}}</ref>  Rachel grew up in a traditional [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] family, albeit in a family that would at the time have been considered well integrated into German society more generally.   She attended a government secondary school (''\"Lyzeum\"''), while also receiving a parallel religious education at a Jewish religious school.<ref name=\":1\"/>   \n\n===The Hitler difference===\nRachel would later look back on an idyllic childhood, prematurely ended when the [[Nazi Germany |Hitler government]] [[Machtergreifung |took power]] in January 1933 and lost no time in [[Gleichschaltung |transforming Germany]] into a [[one-party|one-]][[Nazi Party |party]] [[Enabling Act of 1933 |dictatorship]].   [[Antisemitism]], hitherto a chilling mantra served up by noisy populist street-politicians, became a core underpinning of government strategy.   After March 1933, when Rachel was still aged only twelve, the slightly older boy who had become a friend (and admirer) was no longer permitted to come to the house.   Her mother explained that this was because she was Jewish and he was not.   From then on, she was required to sit in the back row of her class at school.   Six months later her parents received a letter stating simply that she was not on course to reach her targets.   She was switched to a middle school where harassment continued:  she would later recall being denied permission to visit the toilet when the need arose.  She decided that she would no longer attend the school.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=RDlautNK>{{cite web |url=https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.zeitzeugen-gespraech-geschichte-wider-das-vergessen.43477ad7-aa18-48c5-bc57-e7a1ea0d804b.html |work=Zeitzeugen-Gespr\u00e4ch |title=Geschichte wider das Vergessen |author= Natalie Kanter |date=17 January 2014 |publisher=Stuttgarter Nachrichten Verlagsgesellschaft mbH |accessdate= 31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Apprenticeship===\nIn 1935 she embarked on an apprenticeship for work as a seamstress.  In March 1936 she concluded that the intensification  of [[Nuremberg Laws|antisemitic legislation]] meant that she could expect no future in Germany.   She joined a [[Zionism |Zionist]] youth group:  between May 1936 and November 1938 she lived in [[Hamburg]] where the focus of her life was on [[Hakhshara|preparing for emigration]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], which since [[Mandate for Palestine|1920]] had been administered, for most purposes, as though a component territory of the [[British empire]].<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=RDlautGCJZ/>   [[Hamburg]] was an economically dynamic city with a long mercantile tradition which over the years had made it more open to ethnic and cultural diversity more cosmopolitan than [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in the east.   So, initially, she found it, a reassuring sense of belonging being strengthened by the fact that she was one of a group of 27 young people all staying at the same Hamburg address at one end of the \"Klosterallee\" (street) and all preparing actively for emigration to [[Palestine]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n===\"Poland Action\"===\nOn 28 October 1938 a member of the group called Wolfgang Drechsler, whom one source describes as Rachel Lewin's boyfriend, was arrested and swiftly deported.<ref name=\":1\"/>   This was part of the so-called [[Polenaktion|Poland Action]] which involved the arrest and deportation of approximately 17,000 Polish Jews who were stripped of any cash or other valuables and then placed on trains which transported them to the Polish border.<ref name=Polenaktion>{{cite web|title=Die Abschiebung polnischer Juden aus dem Deutschen Reich 1938/1939 und ihre \u00dcberlieferung|work=Gedenkbuch:  Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933-1945 |date=28 February 2020 |url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/zwangsausweisung.html.de?page=1 |publisher= Bundesarchiv, Koblenz |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>   The experience led Rachel Lewin to quit the \"Klosterallee\" group and move in with her mother's elder sister, Flora Rosenbaum, who taught at the [[:de:Talmud Tora Schule|Talmud Tora School]] in Hamburg's [[:de:Grindel (Hamburg)|Grindel district]].<ref name=\":1\"/> \n\n===\"Pogrom night\"===\nTwo weeks later came [[Kristallnacht|Pogrom Night (often identified in English language sources as \"Kristallnacht\")]], during which, over in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], her parents' property was destroyed or plundered<ref name=RDlautCE/> in a national government-directed anti-Jewish pogrom.   Rachel Lewin slept through the night untroubled in her aunt's house.   The next morning, however, she witnessed Jews being beaten up and chased through the Hamburg streets by [[Sturmabteilung|Nazi paramilitaries]].   Unsure what was going on, she pushed her way through the crowd gathering at the newsstand on which newspapers were piled up, showing photographs of the overnight campaign of arson, looting and bloodshed.   The news vendor, whom till now had always seemed a friendly soul, spotted her, and giving a fair rendering of the Berlin dialect snarled, \"So, little Jew, do you too want to see how your synagogues burned?\"{{efn |\"Na, Judje, willste auch sehen, wie deine Synagogen brannten?\".<ref name=\":1\"/>}} The memory of that morning would never leave her.   When she returned to her aunt's house, her aunt was able to tell her more about what had happened.   Most of the teachers and some of the students at the [[:de:Grindel (Hamburg)|Grindel]] [[:de:Talmud Tora Schule|Talmud Tora School]] at which Flora Rosenbaum taught had already been arrested.  Desperately worried about her family, Rachel Lewin managed to contact her father who ordered her to come home.   When she reached [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] she found her parents living with her younger brother, Abraham, in the small apartment to which they had been forced to move.   Abraham had been so traumatised by the violence and destruction he had witnessed that he had acquired a sudden and severe speech impediment.   Meanwhile her father carried the recent scars of a serious head injury which, she learned, had been inflicted using the handle of an oven.<ref name=\":1\"/> \n\n===Escape===\n[[Kristallnacht|Pogrom Night]] convinced Rachel Lewin that she needed to leave [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and emigrate to  [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] even if she had to do it alone.   (Her Hamburg [[Hakhshara]] group had by now been smashed by the authorities.)   In [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] there were frantic discussions within the family.   Her father thought it unrealistic to leave the country.   They had never been prosperous and now most of what they had previously owned had been destroyed or stolen.   Even rich people by this time faced prohibitively high and frequently arbitrary \"emigration taxes\" if wishing to emigrate using official channels.   From the south-east of Germany there were now organised underground groups devoted to smuggling victims of political or race persecution across the border to [[Czechoslovakia]], but [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] was nowhere near Czechoslovakia and it seems in any case unlikely that the Lewins would have had the relevant contacts.   Rachel's mother, in particular, was already in failing health and considered herself more German than Jewish.   Things could not go on getting worse for ever.   Rachel's parents, and in particular her mother, found it unthinkable that the situation would not in the future improve for Jews in Hitler's Germany.<ref name=\":1\"/>   It is not clear how Rachel Lewin made her way from [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] to [[Trieste]], which had been an [[Treaty of London (1915)|Italian city]] since [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|approximately 1920]].

In 2007 the conference voted to disallow any team from having a bye before the league championship game, returning the game to its traditional Thanksgiving weekend spot.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, the game was played every year in Birmingham, with Alabama winning 34 games and Auburn 19. Four games were played in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], with each team winning two.<ref name=wsfa>Staff (2016) [http://www.wsfa.com/story/13540936/the-iron-bowl-wins-and-losses-through-the-years \"The Iron Bowl\u2014wins and losses through the years\"] [[WSFA]] website</ref> Since 2000, the games have been played at [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] every odd-numbered year and at [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] every even-numbered year.\n\nThe rivalry has long been one of the most heated collegiate rivalries in the country. For many years, the two schools were the only Alabama colleges in what is now [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division{{nbsp}}I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS)]]. Together, they account for 33 SEC titles, 25 with Alabama and eight with Auburn. Both are among the winningest programs in major college football history; Alabama has won 17 national championships and is fifth all-time total wins among Division{{nbsp}}I FBS schools while Auburn is 13th with two national championships. The two schools have been fixtures on national television for the better part of the last four decades, and the season-ending clash has been nationally televised for all but one year since the late 1970s, the lone exception being 1993, when Auburn was barred from live TV due to NCAA sanctions.\n\nBetween them, one of the two teams played in the final five [[BCS National Championship Game]]s, with Alabama winning in 2009, 2011, and 2012 and Auburn winning in 2010 and losing in 2013. Alabama has also made the four-team field of the successor to the BCS, the [[College Football Playoff]], in each of its first five editions, losing in a semifinal in 2014, winning the [[College Football Playoff National Championship|title game]] in 2015 and 2017, and losing the title game in 2016 and 2018. Auburn has yet to participate in a playoff game.{{refn|group=n|The years mentioned in this passage are college football seasons. Under both the BCS and CFP systems, the championship game is held in January of the calendar year following the season.}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe contest became the extension of a bitter political debate which took place in the Alabama State Legislature regarding the location of the new land-grant college under the state's application under the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862]] during the [[Reconstruction Era|Civil War Reconstruction Era]]. The state legislature, influenced by a heavy contingent of representatives who were University of Alabama alumni, pushed to sell the land scripts of 240,000 acres acquired from the Morrill Act or have any new land holdings held in conjunction with the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. The debate lasted over four years, until Lee County and the [[Auburn, Alabama|City of Auburn]] won the location of the new university in 1872, after donating more than a hundred acres and the remaining buildings and property of the East Alabama Male College.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/auburnhistory/oldsouth.htm |title=The Old South, Civil War, and Reconstruction |work=oldsouth.com |publisher=Auburn Education| accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> At the time of the Auburn decision the state legislature and governorship was controlled by [[Radical Republicans]] such as \"[[Scalawag]]\" Southern Republicans and [[Freedman]] African-Americans. By 1874, former Confederate and \"[[Redeemers|Redeemer]]\" forces from the Democratic Party gradually overturned the Radicals' control of the legislature. The Democrats then attempted to overturn most legislation passed during the Reconstruction Period, including the founding of the new land-grant college at Auburn.\n\nDuring the 1870s, Auburn (then named the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama) which received no appropriated funds from the state, was on the edge of financial collapse. Collapse of Auburn meant that the University of Alabama could assume the remaining land scripts, thus profiting from the closure of the new land-grant college. After its closure and burning during the Civil War, the University of Alabama would reopen in 1871 and in 1880 the U.S. Congress granted the university 40,000 acres (162 km\u00b2) of coal land in partial compensation for $250,000 in war damages.<ref name=\"Wolf\">{{cite book |last1=Wolf |first1=Suzanne Rau |title=The University of Alabama: A Pictorial History |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |isbn=0-8173-0119-4}}</ref> \"By 1877, competition between the University of Alabama and the Agricultural & Mechanical College for patronage had intensified. In January, Auburn President [[Isaac T. Tichenor|Isaac Tichenor]], reported to the board of trustees that Alabama had reduced its tuition and lowered its graduation standards. Tichenor responded by requesting that the board drop tuition and create a boarding department to further lower expenses.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/auburnhistory/newsouth.htm |title=The New South |work=oldsouth.com |publisher=Auburn Education| accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> \n[[File:Iron bowl feb 1893.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The very first Iron Bowl\u2014Feb 22, 1893]]\n\nAlabama and Auburn played their first football game in Lakeview Park in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], on February 22, 1893. Auburn won 32\u201322, before an estimated crowd of 5,000. Alabama considered the game to be the final matchup of the 1892 season while Auburn recorded it as the first matchup of 1893.\n\nIn 1902, a bill was introduced into both houses of the U.S. Congress to fund the creation of a \"School of Mines and Mining Engineering\" at each land-grant college. Under the provision of the bill, each participating land-grant college would receive $5,000 annually with $500 each additional year for 10 years. The University of Alabama secretly sent Professor Dr. Eugene Smith to lobby against passage of the bill or to amend the bill to allow other universities to participate in the federal program. Auburn responded by sending Professor C.C. Thach to D.C. to lobby with the Association of Land-Grant Colleges for a compromise to allow passage of the bill. The bill would later fail to receive passage.<ref name=\"1902 API Board Minutes\">{{cite web |title=1902 Board Minutes of Alabama Polytechnic University |url=http://content.lib.auburn.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/bot/id/7372/rec/55 |website=Auburn University Digital Library |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nDuring the 1907 state legislature session, a debate surfaced to move the land-grant college from Auburn to Birmingham. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/auburnhistory/progressive_era.htm|title=Auburn University Digital Library|website=diglib.auburn.edu}}</ref> Meanwhile, tensions carried over to the football rivalry when, after both the 1906 and 1907 contests, Auburn head coach [[Mike Donahue]] threatened to cancel the series if Alabama head coach [[J.

By the time all these matters were resolved, it was too late to play in 1908.<ref name=IB1907/>\n\nThe first attempt to resume the series came only months after the 7\u20137 tie in 1907. The two schools, which ended the series because of a $34 dispute in the game contract, tried to save the series in 1908. In late September, Auburn agreed to accept a compromise contract as suggested by Alabama, and Alabama agreed to meet Auburn's demands on players and per diem. All that remained was the selection of a date. Auburn offered four possible dates to play. Before a reply was made, two of the dates passed and it was too late to change dates of other games. There were still two chances to play, including November 21 when Alabama had a game schedule with Haskell Institute, an Indian school, and November 28 (the Saturday after Thanksgiving that year). Alabama would not cancel the Haskell game, honoring its contract. That ruled out the 21st, and the Auburn Board of Trustees refused to change its long-standing rule prohibiting football games after Thanksgiving. The Auburn\u2013Alabama series had stopped.<ref>https://www.al.com/ironbowl/2010/11/iron_bowl_history_the_missing.html</ref>\n\nDuring the 1930s and into the 1940s while the football rivalry was in hiatus, Auburn under the leadership of President [[Luther Duncan|Duncan]], became the administrative home for several [[New Deal coalition|New Deal]] agencies: the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]], the [[Soil Conservation Service]], and the [[Resettlement Administration]]. The federal Government funding flowing into Auburn soon drew the ire of the University of Alabama trustees and their partisans in the Alabama Legislature. President Duncan was able to influence the placement of these agencies at Auburn due to his support for Governor [[Bibb Graves]]. \nBoth the president and the governor supported the New Deal faction of the Democratic Party in Alabama. Graves was well connected in Washington D.C. with [[President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and often lobbied in D.C. on \"plum-tree-shaking expeditions\". Meanwhile, Duncan with his connections in the Alabama Farm Bureau and as the director of the Extension Service exercised great control over the organized farm vote. By the mid 1940s, the Democratic Party was splintering in Alabama, with the rise of the [[Dixiecrats]] and those who remained loyal to the national party. One of the most out spoken critics of Auburn was publisher [http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2061 Harry Ayers], who would later endorse Harry Truman in 1945. In 1940 Duncan had successfully opposed Ayers' candidacy as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, which deeply offended the publisher. The Anniston editor had been a long-time advocate of consolidating Auburn and Alabama, \"so that Auburn would become the dangling tail of a Tuscaloosa kite\". In August, 1942, President Duncan wrote to Raymond Paty, the newly-appointed president of the University of Alabama, that the relationship between their two schools was \"of such magnitude and gravity\" that he had given the question more attention than any other problem he faced as president. He urged Paty that Auburn and Alabama should agree upon a funding formula that would give each institution the same appropriation per in-state student, an idea which worked against the University of Alabama's self-image as the state's capstone university.<ref name=\"diglib.auburn.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/auburnhistory/depression.htm|title=Auburn University Digital Library|website=diglib.auburn.edu}}</ref>\n\nAuburn wanted to renew the football series in 1944. This time, Alabama said no. Alabama's Board of Trustees was against the resumption, saying that an Auburn\u2013Alabama rivalry would lead to an overemphasis of football in Alabama and an unhealthy increase in rumor and rancor between the two schools. The Board also said an intrastate rivalry would make it impossible for either school to hire coaches of \"high character and proven ability\" because they would be afraid of beating the cross-state rival every year. After 1944, several legislative attempts were made to force the two schools to play again, but all attempts failed. The Legislature did, however, pass several resolutions calling on the two schools to play each other. Those resolutions were rejected by both schools.<ref>https://www.al.com/ironbowl/2010/11/iron_bowl_history_the_missing.html</ref>\n\nDuring a 1945 legislative session, the University of Alabama's report to the commission (Alabama Educational Survey Commission) argued that the Tuscaloosa school had well-established and broad responsibilities for higher education in the state. Four times in Alabama history, higher education responsibilities had been delegated to other institutions. In three of the four cases, this occurred under a state government established during the Reconstruction period: creation of the normal schools, higher education for blacks, and establishment of the land-grant college at Auburn. The fourth case was the [[University of Montevallo|state women's college at Montevallo]]. In each case, this was argued to have resulted from \"the illogic inherent in the evolution of a democratic government\". The Alabama report drew a sharp response from then Auburn President [[Luther Duncan]], who said that he had never seen \"a bolder, more deliberate, more vicious, or more deceptive document\". He predicted that if the friends of Auburn and Montevallo did not rise up to combat \"this evil monster\", it would consume them \"just like the doctrine of Hitler\".

Bill|GI Bill]] had inundated Auburn (then officially named the Alabama Polytechnic Institute), with students\u2014doubling enrollment twice between 1944 and 1948. With the increased enrollment, it was now obvious that Auburn would never \"become so weak that{{nbsp}}... it could be absorbed\" by the University of Alabama.<ref name=\"diglib.auburn.edu\"/>\n\nIn March 1947, the Auburn Board of Trustees, with Governor [[Jim Folsom]] in attendance, unanimously approved the following resolution, \"Whereas, The Alabama Polytechnic Institute and the University of Alabama are important educational institutions of the State of Alabama and are maintained and operated by the people of the State; and Whereas, many years ago athletic relationship between the Alabama Polytechnic Institute and the University of Alabama was discontinued; and Whereas, intercollegiate rivalry between the two institutions would be conducive to a better understanding among students of both schools and would tend to promote interest in athletic engagements in Alabama, therefore Be It Resolved by the Board of Trustees of Alabama Polytechnic Institute in meeting assembled, that the President of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, through its Athletic Director, make necessary negotiation with the Director of Athletics of the University of Alabama to resume athletic competition between the two institutions at the earliest possible date, and that a copy of this resolution be furnished to the President and Athletic Director of the University of Alabama.\" The Governor then suggested that the game be played not later than the first Saturday in December of 1947.<ref>http://content.lib.auburn.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/bot/id/8950/rec/111</ref>\nAlso during 1947, the Alabama House of Representatives passed a resolution encouraging both universities to \"make possible the inauguration of a full athletic program between the two schools\".<ref>{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.coloradotigers.com/concourse/traditions_ironbowl.htm | title=The Auburn\u2013Alabama Rivalry, \"The Iron Bowl\" | publisher=Rocky Mountain Auburn Club | accessdate=December 4, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821050549/http://www.coloradotigers.com/concourse/traditions_ironbowl.htm | archivedate=August 21, 2007 }}</ref> But the resolution did not have the effect of law, the schools still could not agree, the Legislature threatened to withhold state funding. In April 1948, Alabama president John Gallalee and Auburn president Ralph B. Draughon met and agreed to renew the series in 1948 and for the following 1949 season.<ref>https://www.al.com/ironbowl/2010/11/iron_bowl_history_the_missing.html</ref>\n\nIt was agreed that the games would be played as a neutral site series in Birmingham. Legion Field held 47,000 fans in 1948, dwarfing both Tuscaloosa's Denny Stadium (31,000) and Auburn Stadium (15,000; expanded to 21,500 and renamed Cliff Hare Stadium in 1949).<ref>https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/well-play-89-in-auburn-how-pat-dye-helped-break-birminghams-40-year-iron-bowl-stranglehold.html</ref> Also it is believed Alabama refused to travel to Auburn, citing poor roads and the small size of [[Jordan-Hare Stadium|Hare Stadium]].

Auburn was in the process of expanding Jordan-Hare Stadium from 72,169 seats to 85,214 for the 1987 season, so the old arguments that the on-campus facilities were not large enough for the Iron Bowl wouldn't hold up much longer. Legion Field by the mid-1980s had a capacity of 75,808. (Alabama's Bryant-Denny Stadium then seated a little over 60,000, but expanded to 70,123 in 1988.)<ref>https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/well-play-89-in-auburn-how-pat-dye-helped-break-birminghams-40-year-iron-bowl-stranglehold.html</ref> By this time, Auburn fans began feeling chagrin at playing all Iron Bowl games at Legion Field. Despite the equal allotment of tickets, Auburn fans insisted that Legion Field was not a neutral site. Not only was Legion Field just 45 minutes east of Tuscaloosa, but the stadium had long been associated with Alabama football. Well into the 1980s, Alabama played most of its important games in Birmingham\u2014most of Alabama's \"home\" football history from the 1920s to the 1980s actually took place at Legion Field. For this reason, Auburn began lobbying to make the Iron Bowl a \"home-and-home\" series. Upon [[Pat Dye]]'s hiring as Auburn head football coach and athletics director in 1981, Dye met with his longtime mentor, Alabama head coach and athletic director [[Bear Bryant]]. \"When I saw Coach Bryant when I first got to Auburn, the first thing he said to me, very first thing, he said, 'Well, I guess you're going to want to take that game to Auburn,'\" Dye recalled. \"I said, 'We're going to take it to Auburn.' He said, 'Well, we've got a contract through 88.'{{{nbsp}}... I said, 'Well, we'll play 89 in Auburn.'\" Dye knew he had legal grounds to move the Iron Bowl to Auburn, based on the language in the contractual agreement between the two schools, but he was smart enough to not bring it up while Bryant was still alive, let alone still coaching.<ref>https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/well-play-89-in-auburn-how-pat-dye-helped-break-birminghams-40-year-iron-bowl-stranglehold.html</ref> \n\nIn the late 80s, the schools agreed that Auburn could play their home games for the Iron Bowl at Jordan-Hare starting in 1989 (with the exception of 1991) and Alabama would continue to play its \"home\" games at Legion Field. On December 2, 1989, Alabama came to \"the Plains\" for the first time ever as a sellout crowd witnessed Auburn win its first true \"home\" game of the series, 30\u201320 over an Alabama team that entered the game undefeated and ranked No.{{nbsp}}2 in the country.\n\nAlabama continued to hold its home games for the rivalry at Legion Field. In 1998, Alabama expanded [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] to a capacity of 83,818, narrowly eclipsing Legion Field. Alabama moved their home games in the series to Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium in 2000. That year, Auburn came to Tuscaloosa for the first time since 1901 and won in a defensive struggle, 9\u20130. A new attendance record for the Iron Bowl was set in 2006 as the latest expansion to Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium increased its capacity to 92,138. The record was reset again in 2010, after another expansion to Alabama's Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium, when a crowd of 101,821 witnessed a 28\u201327 Auburn victory.\n\n===Broadcasters===\n\n{{see also|Alabama Crimson Tide football#Media|SEC on CBS#Notable_personalities|List of ESPN College Football on ABC personalities|List of ESPN College Football broadcast teams}}\n\nIn 2009 and 2010 [[SEC on CBS|CBS Sports]] and the two universities arranged to have the game played in an exclusive time slot on the Friday following Thanksgiving.

The game is traditionally played on [[American football on Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving weekend]]. In 1993, the schools agreed to move the game up to the week before Thanksgiving to give themselves a bye for a potential [[SEC Championship Game]] berth. In 2007 the conference voted to disallow any team from having a bye before the league championship game, returning the game to its traditional Thanksgiving weekend spot.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, the game was played every year in Birmingham, with Alabama winning 34 games and Auburn 19. Four games were played in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], with each team winning two.<ref name=wsfa>Staff (2016) [http://www.wsfa.com/story/13540936/the-iron-bowl-wins-and-losses-through-the-years \"The Iron Bowl\u2014wins and losses through the years\"] [[WSFA]] website</ref> Since 2000, the games have been played at [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] every odd-numbered year and at [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] every even-numbered year.\n\nThe rivalry has long been one of the most heated collegiate rivalries in the country. For many years, the two schools were the only Alabama colleges in what is now [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division{{nbsp}}I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS)]]. Together, they account for 33 SEC titles, 25 with Alabama and eight with Auburn. Both are among the winningest programs in major college football history; Alabama has won 17 national championships and is fifth all-time total wins among Division{{nbsp}}I FBS schools while Auburn is 13th with two national championships. The two schools have been fixtures on national television for the better part of the last four decades, and the season-ending clash has been nationally televised for all but one year since the late 1970s, the lone exception being 1993, when Auburn was barred from live TV due to NCAA sanctions.\n\nBetween them, one of the two teams played in the final five [[BCS National Championship Game]]s, with Alabama winning in 2009, 2011, and 2012 and Auburn winning in 2010 and losing in 2013. Alabama has also made the four-team field of the successor to the BCS, the [[College Football Playoff]], in each of its first five editions, losing in a semifinal in 2014, winning the [[College Football Playoff National Championship|title game]] in 2015 and 2017, and losing the title game in 2016 and 2018. Auburn has yet to participate in a playoff game.{{refn|group=n|The years mentioned in this passage are college football seasons. Under both the BCS and CFP systems, the championship game is held in January of the calendar year following the season.}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe contest became the extension of a bitter political debate which took place in the Alabama State Legislature regarding the location of the new land-grant college under the state's application under the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862]] during the [[Reconstruction Era|Civil War Reconstruction Era]]. The state legislature, influenced by a heavy contingent of representatives who were University of Alabama alumni, pushed to sell the land scripts of 240,000 acres acquired from the Morrill Act or have any new land holdings held in conjunction with the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. The debate lasted over four years, until Lee County and the [[Auburn, Alabama|City of Auburn]] won the location of the new university in 1872, after donating more than a hundred acres and the remaining buildings and property of the East Alabama Male College.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/auburnhistory/oldsouth.htm |title=The Old South, Civil War, and Reconstruction |work=oldsouth.com |publisher=Auburn Education| accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> At the time of the Auburn decision the state legislature and governorship was controlled by [[Radical Republicans]] such as \"[[Scalawag]]\" Southern Republicans and [[Freedman]] African-Americans. By 1874, former Confederate and \"[[Redeemers|Redeemer]]\" forces from the Democratic Party gradually overturned the Radicals' control of the legislature. The Democrats then attempted to overturn most legislation passed during the Reconstruction Period, including the founding of the new land-grant college at Auburn.\n\nDuring the 1870s, Auburn (then named the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama) which received no appropriated funds from the state, was on the edge of financial collapse. Collapse of Auburn meant that the University of Alabama could assume the remaining land scripts, thus profiting from the closure of the new land-grant college. After its closure and burning during the Civil War, the University of Alabama would reopen in 1871 and in 1880 the U.S. Congress granted the university 40,000 acres (162 km\u00b2) of coal land in partial compensation for $250,000 in war damages.<ref name=\"Wolf\">{{cite book |last1=Wolf |first1=Suzanne Rau |title=The University of Alabama: A Pictorial History |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |isbn=0-8173-0119-4}}</ref> \"By 1877, competition between the University of Alabama and the Agricultural & Mechanical College for patronage had intensified. In January, Auburn President [[Isaac T. Tichenor|Isaac Tichenor]], reported to the board of trustees that Alabama had reduced its tuition and lowered its graduation standards. Tichenor responded by requesting that the board drop tuition and create a boarding department to further lower expenses.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/auburnhistory/newsouth.htm |title=The New South |work=oldsouth.com |publisher=Auburn Education| accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> \n[[File:Iron bowl feb 1893.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The very first Iron Bowl\u2014Feb 22, 1893]]\n\nAlabama and Auburn played their first football game in Lakeview Park in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], on February 22, 1893. Auburn won 32\u201322, before an estimated crowd of 5,000. Alabama considered the game to be the final matchup of the 1892 season while Auburn recorded it as the first matchup of 1893.\n\nIn 1902, a bill was introduced into both houses of the U.S. Congress to fund the creation of a \"School of Mines and Mining Engineering\" at each land-grant college. Under the provision of the bill, each participating land-grant college would receive $5,000 annually with $500 each additional year for 10 years. The University of Alabama secretly sent Professor Dr. Eugene Smith to lobby against passage of the bill or to amend the bill to allow other universities to participate in the federal program. Auburn responded by sending Professor C.C. Thach to D.C. to lobby with the Association of Land-Grant Colleges for a compromise to allow passage of the bill. The bill would later fail to receive passage.<ref name=\"1902 API Board Minutes\">{{cite web |title=1902 Board Minutes of Alabama Polytechnic University |url=http://content.lib.auburn.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/bot/id/7372/rec/55 |website=Auburn University Digital Library |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nDuring the 1907 state legislature session, a debate surfaced to move the land-grant college from Auburn to Birmingham. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/auburnhistory/progressive_era.htm|title=Auburn University Digital Library|website=diglib.auburn.edu}}</ref> Meanwhile, tensions carried over to the football rivalry when, after both the 1906 and 1907 contests, Auburn head coach [[Mike Donahue]] threatened to cancel the series if Alabama head coach [[J. W. H. Pollard|\"Doc\" Pollard]] continued employing his elaborate formations and shifts.<ref>Groom, 2000, p. 16.</ref> The series was suspended after the 1907 game. The Alabama\u2013Auburn series was originally thought to have been discontinued in response to violence both on the field and among fans during and after the 1907 game.<ref name=IB1907>{{cite book |title=Alabama Showdown |last=Norman |first=Geoffrey |year=1986 |publisher=Kensington Publishing Company |isbn=0-8217-2157-7 |pages=48\u201350}}</ref> Other sources say the game was canceled due to a disagreement between the schools on how much [[per diem]] to allow players for the trip to Birmingham, how many players each school should bring, and where to find officials. By the time all these matters were resolved, it was too late to play in 1908.<ref name=IB1907/>\n\nThe first attempt to resume the series came only months after the 7\u20137 tie in 1907. The two schools, which ended the series because of a $34 dispute in the game contract, tried to save the series in 1908. In late September, Auburn agreed to accept a compromise contract as suggested by Alabama, and Alabama agreed to meet Auburn's demands on players and per diem. All that remained was the selection of a date. Auburn offered four possible dates to play. Before a reply was made, two of the dates passed and it was too late to change dates of other games. There were still two chances to play, including November 21 when Alabama had a game schedule with Haskell Institute, an Indian school, and November 28 (the Saturday after Thanksgiving that year). Alabama would not cancel the Haskell game, honoring its contract. That ruled out the 21st, and the Auburn Board of Trustees refused to change its long-standing rule prohibiting football games after Thanksgiving. The Auburn\u2013Alabama series had stopped.<ref>https://www.al.com/ironbowl/2010/11/iron_bowl_history_the_missing.html</ref>\n\nDuring the 1930s and into the 1940s while the football rivalry was in hiatus, Auburn under the leadership of President [[Luther Duncan|Duncan]], became the administrative home for several [[New Deal coalition|New Deal]] agencies: the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]], the [[Soil Conservation Service]], and the [[Resettlement Administration]]. The federal Government funding flowing into Auburn soon drew the ire of the University of Alabama trustees and their partisans in the Alabama Legislature. President Duncan was able to influence the placement of these agencies at Auburn due to his support for Governor [[Bibb Graves]]. \nBoth the president and the governor supported the New Deal faction of the Democratic Party in Alabama. Graves was well connected in Washington D.C. with [[President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and often lobbied in D.C. on \"plum-tree-shaking expeditions\". Meanwhile, Duncan with his connections in the Alabama Farm Bureau and as the director of the Extension Service exercised great control over the organized farm vote. By the mid 1940s, the Democratic Party was splintering in Alabama, with the rise of the [[Dixiecrats]] and those who remained loyal to the national party. One of the most out spoken critics of Auburn was publisher [http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2061 Harry Ayers], who would later endorse Harry Truman in 1945. In 1940 Duncan had successfully opposed Ayers' candidacy as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, which deeply offended the publisher. The Anniston editor had been a long-time advocate of consolidating Auburn and Alabama, \"so that Auburn would become the dangling tail of a Tuscaloosa kite\". In August, 1942, President Duncan wrote to Raymond Paty, the newly-appointed president of the University of Alabama, that the relationship between their two schools was \"of such magnitude and gravity\" that he had given the question more attention than any other problem he faced as president. He urged Paty that Auburn and Alabama should agree upon a funding formula that would give each institution the same appropriation per in-state student, an idea which worked against the University of Alabama's self-image as the state's capstone university.<ref name=\"diglib.auburn.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/auburnhistory/depression.htm|title=Auburn University Digital Library|website=diglib.auburn.edu}}</ref>\n\nAuburn wanted to renew the football series in 1944. This time, Alabama said no. Alabama's Board of Trustees was against the resumption, saying that an Auburn\u2013Alabama rivalry would lead to an overemphasis of football in Alabama and an unhealthy increase in rumor and rancor between the two schools. The Board also said an intrastate rivalry would make it impossible for either school to hire coaches of \"high character and proven ability\" because they would be afraid of beating the cross-state rival every year. After 1944, several legislative attempts were made to force the two schools to play again, but all attempts failed. The Legislature did, however, pass several resolutions calling on the two schools to play each other. Those resolutions were rejected by both schools.<ref>https://www.al.com/ironbowl/2010/11/iron_bowl_history_the_missing.html</ref>\n\nDuring a 1945 legislative session, the University of Alabama's report to the commission (Alabama Educational Survey Commission) argued that the Tuscaloosa school had well-established and broad responsibilities for higher education in the state. Four times in Alabama history, higher education responsibilities had been delegated to other institutions. In three of the four cases, this occurred under a state government established during the Reconstruction period: creation of the normal schools, higher education for blacks, and establishment of the land-grant college at Auburn. The fourth case was the [[University of Montevallo|state women's college at Montevallo]]. In each case, this was argued to have resulted from \"the illogic inherent in the evolution of a democratic government\". The Alabama report drew a sharp response from then Auburn President [[Luther Duncan]], who said that he had never seen \"a bolder, more deliberate, more vicious, or more deceptive document\". He predicted that if the friends of Auburn and Montevallo did not rise up to combat \"this evil monster\", it would consume them \"just like the doctrine of Hitler\".

Bill|GI Bill]] had inundated Auburn (then officially named the Alabama Polytechnic Institute), with students\u2014doubling enrollment twice between 1944 and 1948. With the increased enrollment, it was now obvious that Auburn would never \"become so weak that{{nbsp}}... it could be absorbed\" by the University of Alabama.<ref name=\"diglib.auburn.edu\"/>\n\nIn March 1947, the Auburn Board of Trustees, with Governor [[Jim Folsom]] in attendance, unanimously approved the following resolution, \"Whereas, The Alabama Polytechnic Institute and the University of Alabama are important educational institutions of the State of Alabama and are maintained and operated by the people of the State; and Whereas, many years ago athletic relationship between the Alabama Polytechnic Institute and the University of Alabama was discontinued; and Whereas, intercollegiate rivalry between the two institutions would be conducive to a better understanding among students of both schools and would tend to promote interest in athletic engagements in Alabama, therefore Be It Resolved by the Board of Trustees of Alabama Polytechnic Institute in meeting assembled, that the President of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, through its Athletic Director, make necessary negotiation with the Director of Athletics of the University of Alabama to resume athletic competition between the two institutions at the earliest possible date, and that a copy of this resolution be furnished to the President and Athletic Director of the University of Alabama.\" The Governor then suggested that the game be played not later than the first Saturday in December of 1947.<ref>http://content.lib.auburn.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/bot/id/8950/rec/111</ref>\nAlso during 1947, the Alabama House of Representatives passed a resolution encouraging both universities to \"make possible the inauguration of a full athletic program between the two schools\".<ref>{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.coloradotigers.com/concourse/traditions_ironbowl.htm | title=The Auburn\u2013Alabama Rivalry, \"The Iron Bowl\" | publisher=Rocky Mountain Auburn Club | accessdate=December 4, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821050549/http://www.coloradotigers.com/concourse/traditions_ironbowl.htm | archivedate=August 21, 2007 }}</ref> But the resolution did not have the effect of law, the schools still could not agree, the Legislature threatened to withhold state funding. In April 1948, Alabama president John Gallalee and Auburn president Ralph B. Draughon met and agreed to renew the series in 1948 and for the following 1949 season.<ref>https://www.al.com/ironbowl/2010/11/iron_bowl_history_the_missing.html</ref>\n\nIt was agreed that the games would be played as a neutral site series in Birmingham. Legion Field held 47,000 fans in 1948, dwarfing both Tuscaloosa's Denny Stadium (31,000) and Auburn Stadium (15,000; expanded to 21,500 and renamed Cliff Hare Stadium in 1949).<ref>https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/well-play-89-in-auburn-how-pat-dye-helped-break-birminghams-40-year-iron-bowl-stranglehold.html</ref> Also it is believed Alabama refused to travel to Auburn, citing poor roads and the small size of [[Jordan-Hare Stadium|Hare Stadium]].

Auburn was in the process of expanding Jordan-Hare Stadium from 72,169 seats to 85,214 for the 1987 season, so the old arguments that the on-campus facilities were not large enough for the Iron Bowl wouldn't hold up much longer. Legion Field by the mid-1980s had a capacity of 75,808. (Alabama's Bryant-Denny Stadium then seated a little over 60,000, but expanded to 70,123 in 1988.)<ref>https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/well-play-89-in-auburn-how-pat-dye-helped-break-birminghams-40-year-iron-bowl-stranglehold.html</ref> By this time, Auburn fans began feeling chagrin at playing all Iron Bowl games at Legion Field. Despite the equal allotment of tickets, Auburn fans insisted that Legion Field was not a neutral site. Not only was Legion Field just 45 minutes east of Tuscaloosa, but the stadium had long been associated with Alabama football. Well into the 1980s, Alabama played most of its important games in Birmingham\u2014most of Alabama's \"home\" football history from the 1920s to the 1980s actually took place at Legion Field. For this reason, Auburn began lobbying to make the Iron Bowl a \"home-and-home\" series. Upon [[Pat Dye]]'s hiring as Auburn head football coach and athletics director in 1981, Dye met with his longtime mentor, Alabama head coach and athletic director [[Bear Bryant]]. \"When I saw Coach Bryant when I first got to Auburn, the first thing he said to me, very first thing, he said, 'Well, I guess you're going to want to take that game to Auburn,'\" Dye recalled. \"I said, 'We're going to take it to Auburn.' He said, 'Well, we've got a contract through 88.'{{{nbsp}}... I said, 'Well, we'll play 89 in Auburn.'\" Dye knew he had legal grounds to move the Iron Bowl to Auburn, based on the language in the contractual agreement between the two schools, but he was smart enough to not bring it up while Bryant was still alive, let alone still coaching.<ref>https://www.al.com/sports/2019/11/well-play-89-in-auburn-how-pat-dye-helped-break-birminghams-40-year-iron-bowl-stranglehold.html</ref> \n\nIn the late 80s, the schools agreed that Auburn could play their home games for the Iron Bowl at Jordan-Hare starting in 1989 (with the exception of 1991) and Alabama would continue to play its \"home\" games at Legion Field. On December 2, 1989, Alabama came to \"the Plains\" for the first time ever as a sellout crowd witnessed Auburn win its first true \"home\" game of the series, 30\u201320 over an Alabama team that entered the game undefeated and ranked No.{{nbsp}}2 in the country.\n\nAlabama continued to hold its home games for the rivalry at Legion Field. In 1998, Alabama expanded [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] to a capacity of 83,818, narrowly eclipsing Legion Field. Alabama moved their home games in the series to Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium in 2000. That year, Auburn came to Tuscaloosa for the first time since 1901 and won in a defensive struggle, 9\u20130. A new attendance record for the Iron Bowl was set in 2006 as the latest expansion to Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium increased its capacity to 92,138. The record was reset again in 2010, after another expansion to Alabama's Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium, when a crowd of 101,821 witnessed a 28\u201327 Auburn victory.\n\n===Broadcasters===\n\n{{see also|Alabama Crimson Tide football#Media|SEC on CBS#Notable_personalities|List of ESPN College Football on ABC personalities|List of ESPN College Football broadcast teams}}\n\nIn 2009 and 2010 [[SEC on CBS|CBS Sports]] and the two universities arranged to have the game played in an exclusive time slot on the Friday following Thanksgiving.
