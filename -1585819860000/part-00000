She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012), which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]''(2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", where all crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer though she personally favoured the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl\". She has appeared two times in ''[[Forbes]]''' Celebrity 100 of India (2017 and 2019).\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar is a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012), which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]''(2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", where all crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer though she personally favored the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl\". She has appeared two times in ''[[Forbes]]''' Celebrity 100 of India (2017 and 2019).\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar is a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

However, children were assumed to remain with the male head of the household.<ref name=Hendry /> In contemporary Japan, children are more likely to live with single mothers than single fathers; in 2013, 7.4% of children were living in single-mother households; only 1.3% live with their fathers.<ref name=\"Cabinet Office 1-1\" />\n\nWhen divorce was granted under equal measures to both sexes under the post-war constitution, divorce rates steadily increased.<ref name=Hendry />\n\nIn 2015, Article 733 of Japan\u2019s Civil Code that states that women cannot remarry 6 months after divorce was reduced to 100 days. The 6 month ban on remarriage for women was previously aiming to \"avoid uncertainty regarding the identity of the legally presumed father of any child born in that time period\". Under article 772, presumes that after a divorce, a child born 300 days after divorce is the legal child of the previous husband. A ruling issued on December 16, 2015, the Supreme Court of Japan ruled that in light of the new 100 days before women's remarriage law, so that there is no confusion over the paternity of a child born to a woman who remarried, any child born after 200 days of remarriage is the legal child of the current husband.\n\nThe Ministry of Japan revealed the outline of an amendment for the Civil Code of Japan on February 18, 2016. This amendment shortens the women's remarriage period to 100 days and allows any woman who is not pregnant during the divorce to remarry immediately after divorce.<ref>Umeda, S. (2016, February 26).

Wives could not legally arrange for a divorce, but options included joining convents, such as at [[Kamakura]], where men were not permitted to go, thus assuring a permanent separation.<ref name=Hendry />\n\nUnder the Meiji system, however, the law limited grounds for divorce to seven events: sterility, adultery, disobedience to the parents-in-law, loquacity, larceny, jealousy, and disease. However, the law offered a protection for divorcees by guaranteeing a wife could not be sent away if she had nowhere else to go.<ref name=Hendry /> Furthermore, the law allowed a woman to request a divorce, so long as she was accompanied by a male relative and could prove desertion or imprisonment of the husband, profligacy, or mental or physical illness.<ref name=Hendry />\n\nBy 1898, cruelty was added to the grounds for a woman to divorce; the law also allowed divorce through mutual agreement of the husband and wife. However, children were assumed to remain with the male head of the household.<ref name=Hendry /> In contemporary Japan, children are more likely to live with single mothers than single fathers; in 2013, 7.4% of children were living in single-mother households; only 1.3% live with their fathers.<ref name=\"Cabinet Office 1-1\" />\n\nWhen divorce was granted under equal measures to both sexes under the post-war constitution, divorce rates steadily increased.<ref name=Hendry />\n\nIn 2015, Article 733 of Japan\u2019s Civil Code that states that women cannot remarry 6 months after divorce was reduced to 100 days. The 6 month ban on remarriage for women was previously aiming to \"avoid uncertainty regarding the identity of the legally presumed father of any child born in that time period\". Under article 772, presumes that after a divorce, a child born 300 days after divorce is the legal child of the previous husband. A ruling issued on December 16, 2015, the Supreme Court of Japan ruled that in light of the new 100 days before women's remarriage law, so that there is no confusion over the paternity of a child born to a woman who remarried, any child born after 200 days of remarriage is the legal child of the current husband.\n\nThe Ministry of Japan revealed the outline of an amendment for the Civil Code of Japan on February 18, 2016. This amendment shortens the women's remarriage period to 100 days and allows any woman who is not pregnant during the divorce to remarry immediately after divorce.<ref>Umeda, S. (2016, February 26).
