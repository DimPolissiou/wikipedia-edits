The operative word most associated with it is \"innovation\" {{harv|Metzer|2009|loc=3}}. Its leading feature is a \"linguistic plurality\", which is to say that no one [[music genre]] ever assumed a dominant position {{harv|Morgan|1984|loc=443}}.\n\n{{quote|Inherent within musical modernism is the conviction that music is not a static phenomenon defined by timeless truths and classical principles, but rather something which is intrinsically historical and developmental. ''While belief in musical progress or in the principle of innovation is not new or unique to modernism, such values are particularly important within modernist aesthetic stances.''|Edward {{harvtxt|Campbell|2010|loc=37}} [emphasis added]}} Examples include the celebration of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s rejection of [[tonality]] in chromatic [[atonality|post-tonal]] and [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] works and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s move away from [[meter (music)|metrical]] [[rhythm]] {{harv|Campbell|2010|loc=37}}.\n\n==Definitions==\n\nMusicologist [[Carl Dahlhaus]] describes modernism as: <blockquote>an obvious point of historical [[:wikt:discontinuity|discontinuity]]&nbsp;... The \"breakthrough\" of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]], and [[Debussy]] implies a profound historical transformation&nbsp;... If we were to search for a name to convey the breakaway mood of the 1890s (a mood symbolized musically by the opening bars of Strauss's ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'') but without imposing a fictitious unity of style on the age, we could do worse than revert to [[Hermann Bahr]]'s term \"modernism\" and speak of a stylistically open-ended \"modernist music\" extending (with some latitude) from 1890 to the beginnings of our own twentieth-century modern music in 1910. {{harv|Dahlhaus|1989|loc=334}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Eero Tarasti]] defines musical modernism directly in terms of \"the dissolution of the traditional tonality and transformation of the very foundations of tonal language, searching for new models in atonalism, polytonalism or other forms of altered tonality\", which took place around the turn of the century {{harv|Tarasti|1979|loc=272}}.\n\n[[Daniel Albright]] proposes a definition of musical modernism as, \"a testing of the limits of aesthetic construction\" and presents the following modernist techniques or styles {{harv|Albright|2004|loc=11}}:\n*[[Expressionist music|Expressionism]]\n*[[New Objectivity#Music|New Objectivity]]\n*[[Hyperrealism (music)|Hyperrealism]]\n*[[Absolute music|Abstractionism]]\n*[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]]\n*Neobarbarism (formless energy)\n*[[Futurism (music)|Futurism]]\n*Mythic method (cultivation of the prehistoric past)\n\n==Periodization==\n{{See also|Postmodern music}}\nSome writers regard musical modernism as an historical period or era extending from about 1890 to 1930, and apply the term \"[[postmodernism (music)|postmodernism]]\" to the period or era after 1930 ({{harvnb|K\u00e1rolyi|1994|loc=135}}; {{harvnb|Meyer|1994|loc=331\u2013332}}). For Dahlhaus (quoted above), the purest form was over by 1910, but other historians consider modernism to end with one or the other of the two world wars {{harv|Albright|2004|loc=13}}. \n\nOther writers assert that modernism is not attached to any historical period, but rather is \"an ''attitude'' of the composer; a living construct that can evolve with the times\" {{harv|McHard|2008|loc=14}}.\n\n==Jazz==\n{{Further|Bebop}}\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\nAccording to [[jazz]] drummer and bandleader [[Kenny Clarke]], [[bebop]] was initially referred to as \"modern jazz\" by himself and his contemporaries before it was co-opted to the name \"bebop\" by other writers {{harv|Du Noyer|2003|loc=130}}.\n\n==Popular music==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2014}}\nCultural studies professor Andrew Goodwin writes that \"given the confusion of the terms, the identification of postmodern texts has ranged across an extraordinarily divergent, and incoherent profusion of textual instances ... Secondly, there are debates within popular music about pastiche and authenticity. 'Modernism' means something quite different within each of these two fields ... This confusion is obvious in an early formative attempt to understand [[rock music]] in postmodern terms\" {{harv|Goodwin |2006|loc=441}}. Goodwin argues that instances of modernism in [[popular music]] are generally not cited because \"it ''undermines'' the postmodern thesis of cultural fusion, in its explicit effort to preserve a bourgeois notion of Art in opposition to mainstream, 'commercial' rock and [[pop music|pop]]\" {{harv|Goodwin |2006|loc=446}}.\n\nModernism in popular music had been named as early as the late 1950s when burgeoning [[Los Angeles]] [[rock and roll]] radio station [[KRLA]] started dubbing their air space \"Modern Radio/Los Angeles\". Author [[Domenic Priore]] believes that: \"the concept of Modernism was bound up in the very construction of the Greater Los Angeles area, at a time when the city was just beginning to come into its own as an international, cultural center\" {{harv|Priore|2005|loc=16}}. Some examples which soon followed include the elaborately arranged \"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\" by [[Ike & Tina Turner]] (1966) and \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" by [[the Beach Boys]] (1966). Desiring \"a taste of Modern, avant-garde [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]\" for the latter's recording, group member and song co-writer [[Brian Wilson]] considered the music \"advanced rhythm and blues\", but received criticism from his bandmates, who derided the track for being \"too Modern\" during its making {{harv|Priore|2005|loc=16, 20, 48}}.\n\n[[Art rock]] and [[progressive rock]] artists such as [[the Velvet Underground]], [[Henry Cow]], [[Soft Machine]], and [[Hatfield and the North]] would later exhibit modernist aspirations {{harv|Goodwin |2006|loc=446}}, although Goodwin posits that progressive rock should be considered \"anathema\" to postmodernism {{harv|Goodwin |2006|loc=444}}.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Avant-garde music]]\n* [[Experimental music]]\n* [[Internet Archive]]\n* [[History of music]]\n*[[List of modernist composers]]\n* [[Musopen]]\n* [[Neoconservative postmodernism]]\n* [[Open Goldberg Variations]]\n* [[Philosophy of music]]\n* [[Public domain music]]\n* [[Surrealist music]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|50em|normalfont=yes}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Albright|2004}}|reference=Albright, Daniel. 2004.

The operative word most associated with it is \"innovation\" {{harv|Metzer|2009|loc=3}}. Its leading feature is a \"linguistic plurality\", which is to say that no one [[music genre]] ever assumed a dominant position {{harv|Morgan|1984|loc=443}}.\n\n{{quote|Inherent within musical modernism is the conviction that music is not a static phenomenon defined by timeless truths and classical principles, but rather something which is intrinsically historical and developmental. ''While belief in musical progress or in the principle of innovation is not new or unique to modernism, such values are particularly important within modernist aesthetic stances.''|Edward {{harvtxt|Campbell|2010|loc=37}} [emphasis added]}} Examples include the celebration of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s rejection of [[tonality]] in chromatic [[atonality|post-tonal]] and [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] works and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s move away from [[meter (music)|metrical]] [[rhythm]] {{harv|Campbell|2010|loc=37}}.\n\n==Definitions==\n\nMusicologist [[Carl Dahlhaus]] describes modernism as: <blockquote>an obvious point of historical [[:wikt:discontinuity|discontinuity]]&nbsp;... The \"breakthrough\" of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]], and [[Debussy]] implies a profound historical transformation&nbsp;... If we were to search for a name to convey the breakaway mood of the 1890s (a mood symbolized musically by the opening bars of Strauss's ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'') but without imposing a fictitious unity of style on the age, we could do worse than revert to [[Hermann Bahr]]'s term \"modernism\" and speak of a stylistically open-ended \"modernist music\" extending (with some latitude) from 1890 to the beginnings of our own twentieth-century modern music in 1910. {{harv|Dahlhaus|1989|loc=334}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Eero Tarasti]] defines musical modernism directly in terms of \"the dissolution of the traditional tonality and transformation of the very foundations of tonal language, searching for new models in atonalism, polytonalism or other forms of altered tonality\", which took place around the turn of the century {{harv|Tarasti|1979|loc=272}}.\n\n[[Daniel Albright]] proposes a definition of musical modernism as, \"a testing of the limits of aesthetic construction\" and presents the following modernist techniques or styles {{harv|Albright|2004|loc=11}}:\n*[[Expressionist music|Expressionism]]\n*[[New Objectivity#Music|New Objectivity]]\n*[[Hyperrealism (music)|Hyperrealism]]\n*[[Absolute music|Abstractionism]]\n*[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]]\n*Neobarbarism (formless energy)\n*[[Futurism (music)|Futurism]]\n*Mythic method (cultivation of the prehistoric past)\n\n==Periodization==\n{{See also|Postmodern music}}\nSome writers regard musical modernism as an historical period or era extending from about 1890 to 1930, and apply the term \"[[postmodernism (music)|postmodernism]]\" to the period or era after 1930 ({{harvnb|K\u00e1rolyi|1994|loc=135}}; {{harvnb|Meyer|1994|loc=331\u2013332}}). For Dahlhaus (quoted above), the purest form was over by 1910, but other historians consider modernism to end with one or the other of the two world wars {{harv|Albright|2004|loc=13}}. \n\nOther writers assert that modernism is not attached to any historical period, but rather is \"an ''attitude'' of the composer; a living construct that can evolve with the times\" {{harv|McHard|2008|loc=14}}.\n\n==Jazz==\n{{Further|Bebop}}\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\nAccording to [[jazz]] drummer and bandleader [[Kenny Clarke]], [[bebop]] was initially referred to as \"modern jazz\" by himself and his contemporaries before it was co-opted to the name \"bebop\" by other writers {{harv|Du Noyer|2003|loc=130}}.\n\n==Popular music==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2014}}\nCultural studies professor Andrew Goodwin writes that \"given the confusion of the terms, the identification of postmodern texts has ranged across an extraordinarily divergent, and incoherent profusion of textual instances ... Secondly, there are debates within popular music about pastiche and authenticity. 'Modernism' means something quite different within each of these two fields ... This confusion is obvious in an early formative attempt to understand [[rock music]] in postmodern terms\" {{harv|Goodwin |2006|loc=441}}. Goodwin argues that instances of modernism in [[popular music]] are generally not cited because \"it ''undermines'' the postmodern thesis of cultural fusion, in its explicit effort to preserve a bourgeois notion of Art in opposition to mainstream, 'commercial' rock and [[pop music|pop]]\" {{harv|Goodwin |2006|loc=446}}.\n\nModernism in popular music had been named as early as the late 1950s when burgeoning [[Los Angeles]] [[rock and roll]] radio station [[KRLA]] started dubbing their air space \"Modern Radio/Los Angeles\". Author [[Domenic Priore]] believes that: \"the concept of Modernism was bound up in the very construction of the Greater Los Angeles area, at a time when the city was just beginning to come into its own as an international, cultural center\" {{harv|Priore|2005|loc=16}}. Some examples which soon followed include the elaborately arranged \"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\" by [[Ike & Tina Turner]] (1966) and \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" by [[the Beach Boys]] (1966). Desiring \"a taste of Modern, avant-garde [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]\" for the latter's recording, group member and song co-writer [[Brian Wilson]] considered the music \"advanced rhythm and blues\", but received criticism from his bandmates, who derided the track for being \"too Modern\" during its making {{harv|Priore|2005|loc=16, 20, 48}}.\n\n[[Art rock]] and [[progressive rock]] artists such as [[the Velvet Underground]], [[Henry Cow]], [[Soft Machine]], and [[Hatfield and the North]] would later exhibit modernist aspirations {{harv|Goodwin |2006|loc=446}}, although Goodwin posits that progressive rock should be considered \"anathema\" to postmodernism {{harv|Goodwin |2006|loc=444}}.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Avant-garde music]]\n* [[Experimental music]]\n* [[Internet Archive]]\n* [[History of music]]\n*[[List of modernist composers]]\n* [[Musopen]]\n* [[Neoconservative postmodernism]]\n* [[Open Goldberg Variations]]\n* [[Philosophy of music]]\n* [[Public domain music]]\n* [[Surrealist music]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|50em|normalfont=yes}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Albright|2004}}|reference=Albright, Daniel. 2004.

Observational research can involve a combination of [[space exploration]], predominantly with [[robotic spacecraft]] missions using [[remote sensing]], and comparative, experimental work in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical component involves considerable [[computer simulation]] and mathematical modelling.\n\nPlanetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments of universities or research centres, though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide. There are several major conferences each year, and a wide range of [[academic journal|peer-reviewed journals]]. Some planetary scientists work at private research centres and often initiate partnership research tasks.\n\n==History==\nThe history of planetary science may be said to have begun with the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], who is reported by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] as saying <blockquote>The ordered worlds are boundless and differ in size, and that in some there is neither sun nor moon, but that in others, both are greater than with us, and yet with others more in number. And that the intervals between the ordered worlds are unequal, here more and there less, and that some increase, others flourish and others decay, and here they come into being and there they are eclipsed. But that they are destroyed by colliding with one another.

In this sense, the original planetary astronomer would be [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who discovered the four largest moons of [[Jupiter]], the mountains on the [[Moon]], and first observed the [[rings of Saturn]], all objects of intense later study. Galileo's study of the lunar mountains in 1609 also began the study of extraterrestrial landscapes: his observation \"that the Moon certainly does not possess a smooth and polished surface\" suggested that it and other worlds might appear \"just like the face of the Earth itself\".<ref name=\"Taylor1994b\">{{cite journal\n|last=Taylor\n|first=Stuart Ross\n|date=1994\n|title=Silent upon a peak in Darien\n|journal=Nature\n|volume=369\n|issue=6477\n|pages=196\u20137\n|bibcode=1994Natur.369..196T\n|doi=10.1038/369196a0\n}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in telescope construction and instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased identification of the atmospheric and surface details of the planets. The Moon was initially the most heavily studied, as it always exhibited details on its surface, due to its proximity to the Earth, and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological knowledge. In this scientific process, the main instruments were astronomical [[optical telescope]]s (and later [[radio telescopes]]) and finally robotic exploratory [[space probe|spacecraft]].\n\nThe Solar System has now been relatively well-studied, and a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system exists. However, there are large numbers of unsolved questions,<ref name=\"SternPlanetarySoc09\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001956/|title=Ten Things I Wish We Really Knew In Planetary Science|last=Stern|first=Alan|accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref> and the rate of new discoveries is very high, partly due to the large number of interplanetary spacecraft currently exploring the Solar System.\n\n==Disciplines==\nPlanetary science studies observational and theoretical astronomy, geology (exogeology), atmospheric science, and an emerging subspecialty in [[planetary ocean]]s<!-- this redirect seems to be to just one Solar System liquid body, but the source is a more general discussion of extraterrestrial planetary oceans -->.<ref>[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aada02/pdf Is Extraterrestrial Life Suppressed on Subsurface Ocean Worlds due to the Paucity of Bioessential Elements?], The Astronomical Journal, 156:151, October 2018.</ref>\n\n===Planetary astronomy===\nThis is an observational science.

This category includes the study of paleohydrological features (paleochannels, paleolakes).<ref>{{Citation|last=Lefort|first=Alexandra|title=Inverted Channel|date=2015|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms|pages=1048\u20131052|editor-last=Hargitai|editor-first=Henrik|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-3134-3_202|isbn=978-1-4614-3133-6|last2=Williams|first2=Rebecca|last3=Korteniemi|first3=Jarmo|editor2-last=Kereszturi|editor2-first=\u00c1kos}}</ref> \n\nThe history of a planetary surface can be deciphered by mapping features from top to bottom according to their [[Law of superposition|deposition sequence]], as first determined on terrestrial [[stratum|strata]] by [[Nicolas Steno]]. For example, [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic mapping]] prepared the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts for the field geology they would encounter on their lunar missions. Overlapping sequences were identified on images taken by the [[Lunar Orbiter program]], and these were used to prepare a lunar [[stratigraphic column]] and [[geologic map|geological map]] of the Moon.\n{{further|Geology of the Moon}}\n\n====Cosmochemistry, geochemistry and petrology====\n{{main|Cosmochemistry|Geochemistry|Petrology}}\n\nOne of the main problems when generating hypotheses on the formation and evolution of objects in the Solar System is the lack of samples that can be analysed in the laboratory, where a large suite of tools are available and the full body of knowledge derived from terrestrial geology can be brought to bear. Direct samples from the Moon, [[asteroid]]s and [[Mars]] are present on Earth, removed from their parent bodies and delivered as [[meteorite]]s. Some of these have suffered contamination from the [[oxidise|oxidising]] effect of Earth's atmosphere and the infiltration of the [[biosphere]], but those meteorites collected in the last few decades from [[Antarctica]] are almost entirely pristine.\n\nThe different types of meteorites that originate from the [[asteroid belt]] cover almost all parts of the structure of [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] bodies: meteorites even exist that come from the core-mantle boundary ([[pallasite]]s). The combination of geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made it possible to trace the [[HED meteorite]]s back to a specific asteroid in the main belt, [[4 Vesta]].\n\nThe comparatively few known [[Martian meteorites]] have provided insight into the geochemical composition of the Martian crust, although the unavoidable lack of information about their points of origin on the diverse Martian surface has meant that they do not provide more detailed constraints on theories of the evolution of the Martian [[lithosphere]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.uwyo.edu |title = UW - Laramie, Wyoming &#124; University of Wyoming}}</ref> As of July 24, 2013 65 samples of Martian meteorites have been discovered on Earth. Many were found in either Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.\n\nDuring the Apollo era, in the [[Apollo program]], 384 kilograms of [[lunar sample]]s were collected and transported to the Earth, and 3 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme|Luna]] robots also delivered [[regolith]] samples from the Moon. These samples provide the most comprehensive record of the composition of any Solar System body beside the Earth. The numbers of lunar meteorites are growing quickly in the last few years \u2013<ref>{curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/lmc/lmcintro.pdf}</ref> as of\nApril 2008 there are 54 meteorites that have been officially classified as lunar.\nEleven of these are from the US Antarctic meteorite collection, 6 are from the Japanese\nAntarctic meteorite collection, and the other 37 are from hot desert localities in Africa,\nAustralia, and the Middle East. The total mass of recognized lunar meteorites is close to\n50&nbsp;kg.\n\n====Geophysics====\n{{main|Geophysics|Space physics}}\nSpace probes made it possible to collect data in not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.\n\nMeasuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [[gravity field]]s of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [[lunar maria]] were measured through lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], beneath the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Nectaris and Humorum basins.\n[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|right|thumb|The [[solar wind]] is deflected by the magnetosphere (not to scale)]]\nIf a planet's [[magnetic field]] is sufficiently strong, its interaction with the solar wind forms a [[magnetosphere]] around a planet. Early space probes discovered the gross dimensions of the terrestrial magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.\n\nGeophysics includes [[seismology]] and [[tectonophysics]], [[geophysical fluid dynamics]], [[mineral physics]], [[geodynamics]], [[mathematical geophysics]], and [[geophysical surveying]].\n\n{{anchor|planetary geodesy}}<!-- used by incoming redirect -->\nPlanetary [[geodesy]], (also known as planetary geodetics) deals with the measurement and representation of the planets of the Solar System, their [[gravitation]]al fields and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]] in three-dimensional, time-varying space. The science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences. The shape of the Earth is to a large extent the result of its rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geologic processes such as the collision of plates and of [[Volcano|vulcanism]], resisted by the Earth's [[gravity]] field. These principles can be applied to the solid surface of Earth ([[orogeny]]; Few mountains are higher than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}, few deep sea trenches deeper than that because quite simply, a mountain as tall as, for example, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}, would develop so much [[pressure]] at its base, due to gravity, that the rock there would become [[plastic]], and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in a geologically insignificant time. Some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides Earth. For instance on Mars, whose surface gravity is much less, the largest volcano, [[Olympus Mons]], is {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} high at its peak, a height that could not be maintained on Earth. The Earth [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. Therefore, the Mars geoid is essentially the figure of Mars abstracted from its topographic features. [[Surveying]] and [[map]]ping are two important fields of application of geodesy.\n\n===Atmospheric science===\n{{main|Atmospheric science|Global climate model}}\n[[File:Jupiter.jpg|right|thumb|Cloud bands clearly visible on [[Jupiter]]. ]]\nThe [[atmosphere]] is an important transitional zone between the solid planetary surface and the higher rarefied [[Ionisation|ionizing]] and radiation belts. Not all planets have atmospheres: their existence depends on the mass of the planet, and the planet's distance from the Sun&nbsp;\u2014 too distant and frozen atmospheres occur. Besides the four [[gas giant]] planets, almost all of the [[terrestrial planets]] ([[Earth's atmosphere|Earth]], [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus]], and [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars]]) have significant atmospheres. Two moons have significant atmospheres: [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Atmosphere of Triton|Triton]]. A tenuous atmosphere exists around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].\n\nThe effects of the [[Planet#Rotation|rotation rate]] of a planet about its axis can be seen in atmospheric streams and currents. Seen from space, these features show as bands and eddies in the cloud system, and are particularly visible on Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n==Comparative planetary science==\n\n{{main|Comparative planetary science}}\n\nPlanetary science frequently makes use of the method of comparison to give a greater understanding of the object of study. This can involve comparing the dense atmospheres of Earth and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the evolution of outer Solar System objects at different distances from the Sun, or the geomorphology of the surfaces of the terrestrial planets, to give only a few examples.\n\nThe main comparison that can be made is to features on the Earth, as it is much more accessible and allows a much greater range of measurements to be made. Earth analogue studies are particularly common in planetary geology, geomorphology, and also in atmospheric science.\n\nThe use of terrestrial analogues was first described by Gilbert (1886).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms|date=2015|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=978-1-4614-3133-6|editor-last=Hargitai|editor-first=Henrik|location=New York, NY|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-3134-3|editor-last2=Kereszturi|editor-first2=\u00c1kos}}</ref>\n\n==Professional activity==\n\n===Journals===\n*''[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]]''\n*''[[Earth, Moon, and Planets]]''\n*''[[Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta]]''\n*''[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]''\n*''[[Journal of Geophysical Research|Journal of Geophysical Research\u2014Planets]]''\n*''[[Meteoritics and Planetary Science]]''\n*''[[Planetary and Space Science]]''\n\n===Professional bodies===\n* [[Division for Planetary Sciences]] (DPS) of the [[American Astronomical Society]]\n* [[American Geophysical Union]]\n* [[Meteoritical Society]]\n* [[Europlanet]]\n\n===Major conferences===\n* [[Lunar and Planetary Science Conference]] (LPSC), organized by the [[Lunar and Planetary Institute]] in Houston.

Observational research can involve a combination of [[space exploration]], predominantly with [[robotic spacecraft]] missions using [[remote sensing]], and comparative, experimental work in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical component involves considerable [[computer simulation]] and mathematical modelling.\n\nPlanetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments of universities or research centres, though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide. There are several major conferences each year, and a wide range of [[academic journal|peer-reviewed journals]]. Some planetary scientists work at private research centres and often initiate partnership research tasks.\n\n==History==\nThe history of planetary science may be said to have begun with the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], who is reported by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] as saying <blockquote>The ordered worlds are boundless and differ in size, and that in some there is neither sun nor moon, but that in others, both are greater than with us, and yet with others more in number. And that the intervals between the ordered worlds are unequal, here more and there less, and that some increase, others flourish and others decay, and here they come into being and there they are eclipsed. But that they are destroyed by colliding with one another. And that some ordered worlds are bare of animals and plants and all water.<ref name=\"Philosophumena\">{{cite book|last=Hippolytus (Antipope) |author2=Origen |others=Translation by Francis Legge, F.S.A.|title=Philosophumena|publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge|location=Original from Harvard University.|date=1921|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lrDy9nn1doC&printsec=titlepage|accessdate=22 May 2009|type=Digitized 9 May 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn more modern times, planetary science began in astronomy, from studies of the unresolved planets. In this sense, the original planetary astronomer would be [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who discovered the four largest moons of [[Jupiter]], the mountains on the [[Moon]], and first observed the [[rings of Saturn]], all objects of intense later study. Galileo's study of the lunar mountains in 1609 also began the study of extraterrestrial landscapes: his observation \"that the Moon certainly does not possess a smooth and polished surface\" suggested that it and other worlds might appear \"just like the face of the Earth itself\".<ref name=\"Taylor1994b\">{{cite journal\n|last=Taylor\n|first=Stuart Ross\n|date=1994\n|title=Silent upon a peak in Darien\n|journal=Nature\n|volume=369\n|issue=6477\n|pages=196\u20137\n|bibcode=1994Natur.369..196T\n|doi=10.1038/369196a0\n}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in telescope construction and instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased identification of the atmospheric and surface details of the planets. The Moon was initially the most heavily studied, as it always exhibited details on its surface, due to its proximity to the Earth, and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological knowledge. In this scientific process, the main instruments were astronomical [[optical telescope]]s (and later [[radio telescopes]]) and finally robotic exploratory [[space probe|spacecraft]].\n\nThe Solar System has now been relatively well-studied, and a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system exists. However, there are large numbers of unsolved questions,<ref name=\"SternPlanetarySoc09\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001956/|title=Ten Things I Wish We Really Knew In Planetary Science|last=Stern|first=Alan|accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref> and the rate of new discoveries is very high, partly due to the large number of interplanetary spacecraft currently exploring the Solar System.\n\n==Disciplines==\nPlanetary science studies observational and theoretical astronomy, geology (exogeology), atmospheric science, and an emerging subspecialty in [[planetary ocean]]s<!-- this redirect seems to be to just one Solar System liquid body, but the source is a more general discussion of extraterrestrial planetary oceans -->.<ref>[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aada02/pdf Is Extraterrestrial Life Suppressed on Subsurface Ocean Worlds due to the Paucity of Bioessential Elements?], The Astronomical Journal, 156:151, October 2018.</ref>\n\n===Planetary astronomy===\nThis is both an observational and a theoretical science. Observational researchers are predominantly concerned with the study of the small bodies of the Solar System: those that are observed by telescopes, both optical and radio, so that characteristics of these bodies such as shape, spin, surface materials and weathering are determined, and the history of their formation and evolution can be understood.\n\nTheoretical planetary astronomy is concerned with [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]: the application of the principles of [[celestial mechanics]] to the Solar System and [[extrasolar planet]]ary systems.

This category includes the study of paleohydrological features (paleochannels, paleolakes).<ref>{{Citation|last=Lefort|first=Alexandra|title=Inverted Channel|date=2015|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms|pages=1048\u20131052|editor-last=Hargitai|editor-first=Henrik|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-3134-3_202|isbn=978-1-4614-3133-6|last2=Williams|first2=Rebecca|last3=Korteniemi|first3=Jarmo|editor2-last=Kereszturi|editor2-first=\u00c1kos}}</ref> \n\nThe history of a planetary surface can be deciphered by mapping features from top to bottom according to their [[Law of superposition|deposition sequence]], as first determined on terrestrial [[stratum|strata]] by [[Nicolas Steno]]. For example, [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic mapping]] prepared the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts for the field geology they would encounter on their lunar missions. Overlapping sequences were identified on images taken by the [[Lunar Orbiter program]], and these were used to prepare a lunar [[stratigraphic column]] and [[geologic map|geological map]] of the Moon.\n{{further|Geology of the Moon}}\n\n====Cosmochemistry, geochemistry and petrology====\n{{main|Cosmochemistry|Geochemistry|Petrology}}\n\nOne of the main problems when generating hypotheses on the formation and evolution of objects in the Solar System is the lack of samples that can be analysed in the laboratory, where a large suite of tools are available and the full body of knowledge derived from terrestrial geology can be brought to bear. Direct samples from the Moon, [[asteroid]]s and [[Mars]] are present on Earth, removed from their parent bodies and delivered as [[meteorite]]s. Some of these have suffered contamination from the [[oxidise|oxidising]] effect of Earth's atmosphere and the infiltration of the [[biosphere]], but those meteorites collected in the last few decades from [[Antarctica]] are almost entirely pristine.\n\nThe different types of meteorites that originate from the [[asteroid belt]] cover almost all parts of the structure of [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] bodies: meteorites even exist that come from the core-mantle boundary ([[pallasite]]s). The combination of geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made it possible to trace the [[HED meteorite]]s back to a specific asteroid in the main belt, [[4 Vesta]].\n\nThe comparatively few known [[Martian meteorites]] have provided insight into the geochemical composition of the Martian crust, although the unavoidable lack of information about their points of origin on the diverse Martian surface has meant that they do not provide more detailed constraints on theories of the evolution of the Martian [[lithosphere]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.uwyo.edu |title = UW - Laramie, Wyoming &#124; University of Wyoming}}</ref> As of July 24, 2013 65 samples of Martian meteorites have been discovered on Earth. Many were found in either Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.\n\nDuring the Apollo era, in the [[Apollo program]], 384 kilograms of [[lunar sample]]s were collected and transported to the Earth, and 3 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme|Luna]] robots also delivered [[regolith]] samples from the Moon. These samples provide the most comprehensive record of the composition of any Solar System body beside the Earth. The numbers of lunar meteorites are growing quickly in the last few years \u2013<ref>{curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/lmc/lmcintro.pdf}</ref> as of\nApril 2008 there are 54 meteorites that have been officially classified as lunar.\nEleven of these are from the US Antarctic meteorite collection, 6 are from the Japanese\nAntarctic meteorite collection, and the other 37 are from hot desert localities in Africa,\nAustralia, and the Middle East. The total mass of recognized lunar meteorites is close to\n50&nbsp;kg.\n\n====Geophysics====\n{{main|Geophysics|Space physics}}\nSpace probes made it possible to collect data in not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.\n\nMeasuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [[gravity field]]s of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [[lunar maria]] were measured through lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], beneath the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Nectaris and Humorum basins.\n[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|right|thumb|The [[solar wind]] is deflected by the magnetosphere (not to scale)]]\nIf a planet's [[magnetic field]] is sufficiently strong, its interaction with the solar wind forms a [[magnetosphere]] around a planet. Early space probes discovered the gross dimensions of the terrestrial magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.\n\nGeophysics includes [[seismology]] and [[tectonophysics]], [[geophysical fluid dynamics]], [[mineral physics]], [[geodynamics]], [[mathematical geophysics]], and [[geophysical surveying]].\n\n{{anchor|planetary geodesy}}<!-- used by incoming redirect -->\nPlanetary [[geodesy]], (also known as planetary geodetics) deals with the measurement and representation of the planets of the Solar System, their [[gravitation]]al fields and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]] in three-dimensional, time-varying space. The science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences. The shape of the Earth is to a large extent the result of its rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geologic processes such as the collision of plates and of [[Volcano|vulcanism]], resisted by the Earth's [[gravity]] field. These principles can be applied to the solid surface of Earth ([[orogeny]]; Few mountains are higher than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}, few deep sea trenches deeper than that because quite simply, a mountain as tall as, for example, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}, would develop so much [[pressure]] at its base, due to gravity, that the rock there would become [[plastic]], and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in a geologically insignificant time. Some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides Earth. For instance on Mars, whose surface gravity is much less, the largest volcano, [[Olympus Mons]], is {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} high at its peak, a height that could not be maintained on Earth. The Earth [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. Therefore, the Mars geoid is essentially the figure of Mars abstracted from its topographic features. [[Surveying]] and [[map]]ping are two important fields of application of geodesy.\n\n===Atmospheric science===\n{{main|Atmospheric science|Global climate model}}\n[[File:Jupiter.jpg|right|thumb|Cloud bands clearly visible on [[Jupiter]]. ]]\nThe [[atmosphere]] is an important transitional zone between the solid planetary surface and the higher rarefied [[Ionisation|ionizing]] and radiation belts. Not all planets have atmospheres: their existence depends on the mass of the planet, and the planet's distance from the Sun&nbsp;\u2014 too distant and frozen atmospheres occur. Besides the four [[gas giant]] planets, almost all of the [[terrestrial planets]] ([[Earth's atmosphere|Earth]], [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus]], and [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars]]) have significant atmospheres. Two moons have significant atmospheres: [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Atmosphere of Triton|Triton]]. A tenuous atmosphere exists around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].\n\nThe effects of the [[Planet#Rotation|rotation rate]] of a planet about its axis can be seen in atmospheric streams and currents. Seen from space, these features show as bands and eddies in the cloud system, and are particularly visible on Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n==Comparative planetary science==\n\n{{main|Comparative planetary science}}\n\nPlanetary science frequently makes use of the method of comparison to give a greater understanding of the object of study. This can involve comparing the dense atmospheres of Earth and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the evolution of outer Solar System objects at different distances from the Sun, or the geomorphology of the surfaces of the terrestrial planets, to give only a few examples.\n\nThe main comparison that can be made is to features on the Earth, as it is much more accessible and allows a much greater range of measurements to be made. Earth analogue studies are particularly common in planetary geology, geomorphology, and also in atmospheric science.\n\nThe use of terrestrial analogues was first described by Gilbert (1886).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms|date=2015|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=978-1-4614-3133-6|editor-last=Hargitai|editor-first=Henrik|location=New York, NY|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-3134-3|editor-last2=Kereszturi|editor-first2=\u00c1kos}}</ref>\n\n==Professional activity==\n\n===Journals===\n*''[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]]''\n*''[[Earth, Moon, and Planets]]''\n*''[[Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta]]''\n*''[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]''\n*''[[Journal of Geophysical Research|Journal of Geophysical Research\u2014Planets]]''\n*''[[Meteoritics and Planetary Science]]''\n*''[[Planetary and Space Science]]''\n\n===Professional bodies===\n* [[Division for Planetary Sciences]] (DPS) of the [[American Astronomical Society]]\n* [[American Geophysical Union]]\n* [[Meteoritical Society]]\n* [[Europlanet]]\n\n===Major conferences===\n* [[Lunar and Planetary Science Conference]] (LPSC), organized by the [[Lunar and Planetary Institute]] in Houston.

The driver loaded the excavator backwards and neglected to tuck the boom so the maximum height was actually 17 feet, 9 inches above the roadway. The pedestrian bridge, which had just been inspected in the month prior to the accident and found to be structurally sound, had a vertical clearance of 16 feet.

An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].\n\nAfter war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. \n\nHis death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    \n\nA reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}\n\n==Biographical==\n[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]\nJohn Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  \n\nThe Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}\n\nIn 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children. Seven survived into adulthood Ann (1616-1701), Elizabeth (1619-1643), John (1621-1642), William (died 1675), Ruth (1628-1687), Mary (1630-1689), and [[Richard_Hampden|Richard]] (1631-1695), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[William III of England|William III]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hampden |url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Hampden-Patriae-Pater/6000000003266399664 |website=Geni.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> In 1640, he married Letitia Knollys (1591-1666); they had no children.   \n\n==Career==\nIn 1610, he graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; as legal training was then considered part of a gentleman's education, he attended the [[Inner Temple]] from 1613 to 1615. \n\nThe Hampden family were [[Puritan]]s, a term then used for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the [[Church of England]]. It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  \n[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]\nHe financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629. The [[2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1626 Parliament]] refused taxes without an agreement to [[Impeachment_in_the_United_Kingdom|impeach]] Charles' favourite, the [[George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a military commander notorious for inefficiency, combined with extravagance; only his assassination in August 1628 prevented a second attempt.{{sfn|Ferris|Hunneyball|2010}} \n\nRather than comply, Charles dissolved Parliament, and imposed a forced loan; over 70 individuals were jailed for not contributing, including Hampden's cousin, Sir Edmund Hampden.{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} Like many others, Hampden also refused to subscribe; and reducing the income from the loans. Charles was forced to call a [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]] in March 1627, which resulted in \"a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King\", including Selden, Coke, [[John Pym]] and a young [[Oliver Cromwell]].{{sfn|Hostettler|1997|p=127}} released to attend the [[3rd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I|1628 Parliament]], he supported [[John Pym]] and others in the Parliamentary attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other.{{efn|This view was summarised by Hampden in the debate on the [[Petition of Right]]; \"Here is 1, an innovation of religion suspected; is it not high time to take it to heart and acquaint his Majesty? 2ly, alteration of government; can you forbear when it goes no less than the subversion of the whole state? 3ly, hemmed in with enemies; is it now a time to be silent, and not to show to his Majesty that a man that has so much power uses none of it to help us?

''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9\u201316</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.\n\n===Committee work===\nDuring these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.\n\nWhen the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).\n\n===Short Parliament===\nIn the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.\n\n===Long Parliament===\nIn the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.\n\nHampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.\n\n===Debate on episcopacy===\n[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]\n\nThere was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.\n\nNo serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:\n*an attack upon religion and\n*an attack upon the fundamental laws.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.\n\n==English Civil War==\n\nWhen the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642\u20131644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.\n\nBut it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]\n\nOn the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\".

Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford.

During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265.

Hampden''', circa June 1595 \u2013  24 June 1643, was an English landowner and politician, whose opposition to arbitrary taxes imposed by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] made him a national figure. An ally of [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] leader [[John Pym]], and cousin to [[Oliver Cromwell]], he was one of the [[Five Members]] whose attempted arrest in January 1642 sparked the [[First English Civil War]].\n\nAfter war began in August 1642, Hampden raised an infantry regiment, and died of wounds received at the [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]] on 18 June 1643. His loss was considered a serious blow, largely because he was one of the few Parliamentary leaders able to hold the different factions together. \n\nHis death in 1643 meant he avoided the bitter internal debates later in the war, the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, and establishment of [[The Protectorate]]. As a result, he is considered a less complex figure than either Cromwell, or even Pym; in 1841, his statue was erected in the [[Palace of Westminster]], to represent the Parliamentary cause.{{efn|The Royalist chosen was another moderate, [[Lucius_Cary,_2nd_Viscount_Falkland|Viscount Falkland]], killed at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] three months later.}}    \n\nA reputation for honest, principled, and patriotic opposition to arbitrary rule also made him a popular figure in [[North America]]. Prior to the 1774 [[American Revolution]], [[Benjamin_Franklin|Franklin]] and [[John_Adams|Adams]] were among those who referenced him to justify their cause.{{sfn|Jansson|2009|pp=11-12}}\n\n==Biographical==\n[[File:Gt Hampden Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great_and_Little_Hampden|Great Hampden church]], where Hampden and other family members were baptised, and later buried]]\nJohn Hampden was born around June 1595, probably in [[London]], eldest son of William Hampden, (1570-1597), and Elizabeth Cromwell, (1574-1664); he had a younger brother, Richard, 1596 to 1659.{{sfn|Thompson|2010}}  \n\nThe Hampden family had been established in [[Buckinghamshire]] for many years; William was a lawyer, and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Looe]] in 1593.{{sfn|WJJ|1981}} He died in April 1597; his cousin, William Hampden of Ennington, was appointed executor, but became involved in a bitter legal dispute with Elizabeth.{{sfn|Russell|2008}}\n\nIn 1619, John married Elizabeth Symeon, and prior to her death in 1631, they had nine children.

It covered a variety of [[Christian_theology|doctrines]], of which [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] such as Hampden were the most prominent; it connected him to a network that included [[Richard_Knightley_(died_1639)|Sir Richard Knightley]], [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[John_Preston_(priest)|John Preston]].{{sfn|Russell|2008}} \n\nIn 1621, Hampden was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]], a [[Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs|rotten borough]] in [[Cornwall]]. This is thought to have been through the influence of the local magnate, [[John_Arundell_(born_1576)|John Arundell]]; a good example of the complexity of the period, Arundell opposed [[Ship Money]] in 1636, but held [[Pendennis Castle]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] until 1646.{{sfn|Duffin|Hunneyball|2010}}  \n[[File:John Pym.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Pym]]; Hampden joined his attack on [[Roger Maynwaring]] and [[Robert Sibthorpe]] in 1628]]\nHe financed the cost of restoring Parliamentary representation to [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] in 1624, a seat he held until 1629.

''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 9\u201316</ref> But it is hardly possible that even resistance to ship money would have so distinguished him but for the mingled massiveness and modesty of his character, his dislike of all pretences in himself or others, his brave contempt of danger, and his charitable readiness to shield others as far as possible from the evil consequences of their actions. Nor was he wanting in that skill which enabled him to influence men towards the ends at which he aimed, and which was spoken of as subtlety by those who disliked his ends.\n\n===Committee work===\nDuring these first parliaments Hampden did not, so far as we know, speak in public debate, but he was increasingly employed in [[committee]] work, for which he seems to have had a special aptitude. In 1626 he took an active part in the preparation of the charges against [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. In January 1627 he was bound over to answer at the council board for his refusal to pay the forced loan.  Later in the year he was committed to the gatehouse, and then sent into confinement in [[Hampshire]], from which he was liberated just before the meeting of the third parliament of the reign, in which he once more rendered useful but unobtrusive assistance to his leaders.\n\nWhen the breach came in 1629 Hampden was found corresponding with the imprisoned Eliot, discussing with him the prospects of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Hampden was one of the persons to whom the [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] granted land in [[Connecticut]] in what was then referred to as the [[Saybrook Colony]] and today as [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]]. While some claim there is no foundation but anecdote that Hampden attempted emigration to the colonies with Cromwell, others assert that Cromwell and other future architects of the English Civil War, including Hampden, may have been close to moving to America in the 1630s. The author [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] points out that, \"Even in the 1770s, residents of [[Old Saybrook]] still talked about which prominent [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarian]] was to have had which town lot.\"<ref>Alfred A. Young, \"English Plebeian Culture an 18th Century American Radicalism\" in Margret Jacob and James Jacob, eds., \"The Origin of Anglo-American Radicalism\" 9New Jersey, Humanitarian Press International, 19910 Page 195,</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1637, however, that his resistance to the payment of ship money gained him wide fame. Seven out of the twelve judges sided against him, but the connection between the rights of property and the parliamentary system became firmly established in the popular mind. The tax had been justified, says Clarendon, who expresses his admiration at Hampden's \"rare temper and modesty\" at this crisis, \"upon such grounds and reasons as every standerby was able to swear was not law\" (''Hist''. i. 150,  vii. 82).\n\n===Short Parliament===\nIn the Short Parliament that started on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House in the debate on 4 May in its opposition to the grant of twelve subsidies in return for the surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the [[Scotland|Scots]]. During the eventful months which followed, when [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his [[Bishops' Wars|Scottish war]], rumour has much to tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.\n\n===Long Parliament===\nIn the [[Long Parliament]], though Hampden was by no means a frequent speaker, it is possible to trace his course with sufficient distinctness. His power consisted in his personal influence, and as a debater rather than as an orator.  \"He was not a man of many words,\" says Clarendon, \"and rarely began the discourse or made the first entrance upon any business that was assumed, but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate and observed how the House was likely to be inclined, took up the argument and shortly and clearly and craftily so stated it that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired; and if he found he could not do that, he never was without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future\" (''Hist''. iii. 31). Unwearied in attendance upon committees, he was in all things ready to second Pym, whom he plainly regarded as his leader.\n\nHampden was one of the eight managers of Strafford's prosecution. Like Pym, he was in favour of the more legal and regular procedure by [[impeachment]] rather than by [[attainder]], which at the later stage was supported by the majority of the Commons; and through his influence a compromise was effected by which, while an attainder was subsequently adopted, Strafford's counsel were heard as in the case of an impeachment, and thus a serious breach between the two Houses, which threatened to cause the breakdown of the whole proceedings, was averted.\n\n===Debate on episcopacy===\n[[File:John Hampden Statue.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Hampden in Market Square, [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire]]\n\nThere was another point on which there was no agreement. A large minority wished to retain [[episcopacy]], and to keep the [[Book of Common Prayer]] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is not that he was a theoretical [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the [[bishop]]s had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the [[Puritans]] as verging on [[Papacy]] that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked.  Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon [[monarchy]], and, when the majority of the [[House of Lords]] arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.\n\nNo serious importance therefore can be attached to the offers of advancement made from time to time to Hampden and his friends. Charles would gladly have given them office if they had been ready to desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, connected with such events as the \"Incident\", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the [[Grand Remonstrance]], and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the [[Five Members]] (the others being [[John Pym]], [[Arthur Haselrig]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[William Strode]]) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.  Those conditions were:\n*an attack upon religion and\n*an attack upon the fundamental laws.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Hampden fully believed that both those conditions were fulfilled at the opening of 1642.\n\n==English Civil War==\n\nWhen the [[English Civil War]] began, Hampden was appointed a member of the [[ Committee of Safety (England) #1642\u20131644 | Committee of Safety]], levied a [[regiment]] of Buckinghamshire men for the parliamentary cause, and in his capacity of deputy-lieutenant carried out the parliamentary [[Militia Ordinance]] in the county. In the earlier operations of the war he bore himself gallantly and well. He took no actual part in the [[Battle of Edgehill]] (23 October 1642). His troops in the rear,  however, arrested [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]'s charge at [[Kineton]], and he urged Essex to renew the attack here, and also after the disaster at [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]]. In the spring of 1643, Hampden's regiment took part in the [[siege of Reading]], which surrendered on 27 April. Although Essex intended to advance on the King's headquarters at Oxford, he remained at Reading because of widespread sickness in the army, a shortage of cavalry and to await a paymaster with funds to pay his troops. In early June 1643 he moved his army to Thame making his headquarters there on 10 June.\n\nBut it is not on his skill as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his distinction lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy.  He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises.  In the formation of the confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part.  His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field but he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the execution of orders of which they disapprove.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Hampden's monument, Chalgrove.jpg|thumb|Hampden's Monument, [[Chalgrove]]. A monument to John Hampden, who was mortally wounded 550 yards north of here in 1643 whilst fighting in the English Civil War on [[Battle of Chalgrove Field|Chalgrove Field]]]]\n\nOn the night of 17 June 1643, [[Prince Rupert]] sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in overwhelming two of Essex's small garrison outposts at [[Postcombe]] and [[Chinnor]]. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] in pursuit of Rupert, with the intention of delaying him long enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at [[Chalgrove]] to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the [[River Thame]] at [[Chiselhampton]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chalgrove Field]], Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding<ref>Britannica 1911 (article \"HAMPDEN, JOHN\") \"two carbine balls\".

Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge.\" An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from [[tetanus|lockjaw]] arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system'.<ref>Frederick George Lee, The History, description and antiquities of the Prebendal Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Thame in the county and diocese of Oxford.

During the preceding winter, Hampden had associated himself with John Pym's \"Middle Group\" in Parliament, which opposed any peace moves to the King except on favorable terms. At the same time he had worked to moderate the militancy of the parliamentary \"War Party\". Although Hampden was privately critical of Essex for not aggressively attacking after avoiding defeat at Edgehill and the standoff at [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], he remained publicly loyal and helped Essex resist the criticisms of the War Party. His death took with it a key link between the factions. Hearing of his death, the Member of Parliament [[Anthony Nicholl]] pronounced: \"Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and faithful friend.\"<ref>\"Selected Readings in English History\". p. 265.

The Symposium resolved that a monument of martyrs should be erected in I\u011fd\u0131r and a cemetery for martyrs should be established in Oba Village in order to eternalise the memories of more than one million Turks that fell in Eastern Anatolia and to give a similar answer to those declaring 24 April as a genocide day and to the monuments erected in many places of the world for the alleged genocide perpetrated against the Armenians.\"<ref name=\"ErmeniSorunu\">\"[http://www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/english/massacres/igdir.html Igdir Genocide Monument and Museum].\"</ref>\n\nIt was opened on October 5, 1999 by Turkish Minister of State [[Ramazan Mirzao\u011flu]].

The upper structure consists of five upright swords, their points touching to resemble Mount Ararat. On the hilt of the swords are a series of reliefs. Beneath the monument are a series of rooms intended to house a museum. The granite for the monument's swords was brought from China and other materials, such as marble, granite, and ceramics, were brought from other regions of Turkey.<ref name=\"ErmeniSorunu\"/>\n\nIts construction is explained as a counter-argument by the Turks that Armenians also perpetrated massacres against Turks.<ref>[[Tessa Hofmann|Hofmann, Tessa]]. \"[http://www.armenian.ch/asa/Docs/faae02.pdf Armenians in Turkey: A Critical Assessment of the situation of the Armenian Minority in the Turkish Republic].\" Forum of Armenian Associations in Europe.

The Symposium resolved that a monument of martyrs should be erected in I\u011fd\u0131r and a cemetery for martyrs should be established in Oba Village in order to eternalise the memories of more than one million Turks that fell in Eastern Anatolia and to give a similar answer to those declaring 24 April as a genocide day and to the monuments erected in many places of the world for the alleged genocide perpetrated against the Armenians.\"<ref name=\"ErmeniSorunu\">\"[http://www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/english/massacres/igdir.html Igdir Genocide Monument and Museum].\"</ref>\n\nIt was opened on October 5, 1999 by Turkish Minister of State [[Ramazan Mirzao\u011flu]]. Its height from ground level is 43.5 metres. The monument's design contains symbols related to Turkish self-identity, history, and legends. The upper structure consists of five upright swords, their points touching to resemble Mount Ararat. On the hilt of the swords are a series of reliefs. Beneath the monument are a series of rooms intended to house a museum. The granite for the monument's swords was brought from China and other materials, such as marble, granite, and ceramics, were brought from other regions of Turkey.<ref name=\"ErmeniSorunu\"/>\n\nIts construction is explained as a counter-argument by the Turks that Armenians also perpetrated massacres against Turks.<ref>[[Tessa Hofmann|Hofmann, Tessa]]. \"[http://www.armenian.ch/asa/Docs/faae02.pdf Armenians in Turkey: A Critical Assessment of the situation of the Armenian Minority in the Turkish Republic].\" Forum of Armenian Associations in Europe.

The rising agricultural production and the opening of a border gate with [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] in 1992 have enabled the town to be livelier and wealthier than its neighbours in the generally impoverished eastern Turkey. There are many cafes and restaurants. The best-known dish is a meat stew called ''bozba\u015f''.<ref>\"S\u00fcrmeli \u00c7ukurda I\u011fd\u0131r\", Ziya Zakir Acar, 2002</ref>\n[[File:I\u011fd\u0131rdan A\u011fr\u0131 Da\u011f\u0131.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mount Ararat]] as seen from I\u011fd\u0131r]]\n\n==Media==\nI\u011fd\u0131r has 12 local daily and weekly newspapers.<ref>Her Y\u00f6n\u00fcyle I\u011fd\u0131r\", Ziya Zakir Acar, 2004</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2011}} The most prominent of these is ''Ye\u015fil I\u011fd\u0131r'' which has been published since 1 September 1955.\n\n==Economy==\nThe main economic activities in I\u011fd\u0131r are the commerce of agricultural and animal products.<ref name=islamans/>\n\nThe city of I\u011fd\u0131r is located between [[Kars Province|Kars]] and [[A\u011fr\u0131 province|A\u011fr\u0131]].
