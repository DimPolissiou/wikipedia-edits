It remained the largest and most influential body in wrestling until the mid-1980s by which time most of the original member promotions went out of business as a result of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'s [[Black Saturday (professional wrestling)|national expansion]]. \n\nIn September 1993, the largest remaining member promotion, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), left the NWA for the second and final time.<ref name=BleacherReport>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1009147-abandoned-the-history-of-the-wcw-international-heavyweight-championship|title=Abandoned: The History of the WCW International Heavyweight Championship|last=Schadler|first=Kyle|date=January 4, 2012|accessdate=December 29, 2019|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref> The NWA would continue as a loose coalition of independent promotions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JrGwTebNiUIC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=nwa+a+shell+of+it's+former+self&source=bl&ots=vqplzj1-mN&sig=ACfU3U08bzV-wlQS9yU5-By6Mwi2eQJQJA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwisv7LcobbnAhXUbMAKHYcVDNsQ6AEwB3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=nwa+a+shell+of+it's+former+self&f=false|title=The Rise & Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling|first=Thom|last=Loverro|date=May 22, 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|via=Google Books}}</ref> with [[Impact Wrestling|NWA: Total Nonstop Action]] (NWA:TNA) given exclusivity over its [[NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight]] and [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|Tag Team]] championships from June 2002 to May 2007.<ref name=\"The History of TNA: Year 1\">{{cite video|title=The History of TNA: Year 1|medium=DVD|publisher=TNA Home Video|date=2006}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, the NWA discontinued its memberships and started licensing its brand to wrestling promotions.<ref name=\"PWInsider.com\">{{cite web|title=NWA Lawsuit Settled, Promotion to Transfer to New Corporation|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/70396/nwa-lawsuit-settled-promotion-to-transfer-to-new-corporation.html|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref> As of 2019, the NWA is no longer a governing body and has since become a singular wrestling promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/report-nwa-roh-no-longer-working-together-nick-aldis-no-longer-advertised-summer-supercard|title=Report: NWA & ROH No Longer Working Together; Nick Aldis Not Advertised For Summer Supercard|accessdate=August 4, 2019|work=Fightful}}</ref><ref>{{cite |url=https://lastwordonprowrestling.com/2019/07/24/nwa-looking-to-join-weekly-tv-line-up/|title=NWA Looking To Join Weekly TV Line Up |publisher=Last Word on Wrestling|host=Jamie Greer|date=July 24, 2019|time=01:11:50|access-date=July 19, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite |url=https://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/nwa-tapings-planned-series-show/|title=NWA Announces First TV Tapings For Planned Series|date=August 7, 2019|access-date=August 13, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2020}}\n===Formation===\n\nBefore the NWA was founded, many regional [[professional wrestling promotion#professional wrestling promotions|professional wrestling promotions]] existed across North America with each promoting its own world champion. However, none of them had backing or recognition outside of their own respective geographic areas.\n\nIn 1948, [[Paul \"Pinkie\" George]], a promoter from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], founded the original version of the National Wrestling Alliance with the backing of five other promoters: [[Al Haft]], Tony Strecher, [[Harry Light]], [[Orville Brown]], and [[Sam Muchnick]]. The concept of the NWA was to consolidate the championships of these regional companies into one true world championship of professional wrestling, whose holder would be recognized worldwide. This newly formed NWA Board of Directors decided on Brown to be the first-ever [[NWA World Heavyweight Champion]].<ref name=sa8>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.8)</ref>\n\n[[File:NWA Professional Wrestling Territories.png|330px|thumb|The extinct [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories#NWA territory system|NWA territory system]] in North America]]\nNWA member promotions were divided up into [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories#territories|territories]] that each promoter would \"own\" and operate while the NWA President's territory usually served as the main territory of the entire alliance. Having a territory meant that no other NWA member promotion could promote wrestling in that area unless special arrangements were made between the promoters involved. Reportedly, threats of violence or physical retaliation were used against any promoter (and/or talent) who disregarded the territory system. If any NWA member promotion broke the rules, it faced expulsion and thus risked missing out on having nationally known wrestlers appear on their local shows. Promotions that were not members of the NWA were often labeled \"outlaw,\" and while they didn't have to adhere to NWA rules, they were still subject to members' retaliation if they tried to invade territories.\n\nEach territory received periodic guest visits from the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. The champion did not have a \"home territory\" as such, but instead traveled from territory to territory, defending the title against the top stars of each territory. Many NWA member promotions would build-up to the appearance of the NWA World Heavyweight Champion weeks or months in advance, making the local world title matches that much more special, and the shows they headlined more lucrative. In addition, each NWA member promotion usually produced a TV show that aired in their territory only, meaning that the local fans only saw the world champion when he came to their area and not year-round.\n\nWrestlers from one territory could come into another territory (often the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#heels|heels]] or \"bad guys\") and run an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#angle|angle]] or two with its top local [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#faces|faces]] (\"good guys\"). If the local fans ever got tired of a wrestler, the wrestler could go to a whole new territory and perform the same act for new audiences who would think the act was brand-new. This storyline was often advanced in the territory from which the wrestler was departing as a result of an especially highly promoted \"loser leaves town\" match.\n\nFor most NWA member promotions, the benefits of membership were well worth the dues and the rules.\n\nIn 1949, [[Lou Thesz]] was the [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)#National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion|National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion]] when a deal was made to unify his title with Orville Brown\u2019s [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. On November 1, 1949, with just weeks before the scheduled bout, Brown was involved in an automobile accident that ended his career, and he was forced to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacate]] the [[Professional wrestling championship|championship]]. The NWA then awarded the unified titles to the No. 1 contender, Thesz.\n\n===As a Governing Body===\n====1950s====\n\nIn 1950, [[Sam Muchnick]], one of the original promoters of the NWA and Thesz\u2019s booker, was named the new NWA President, a position to which he was unanimously re-elected and held until 1960, making him one of the longest-tenured presidents in the organization\u2019s history.\n\nFollowing the advent of [[television]], professional wrestling matches began to be aired nationally during this time, reaching a larger fanbase than ever before. This was a time of enormous growth for professional wrestling, as rising demand and national expansion made it a much more popular and lucrative form of entertainment than in decades previous. This was called a \"Golden Age\" for the wrestling industry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=101}}</ref><ref name=sex,lies>{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=10}}</ref> From 1948 to 1955, each of the three major television networks broadcast wrestling shows; the largest supporter being the [[DuMont Television Network]].<ref name=sex,lies/>\n\nUp through 1956, during Thesz\u2019s first reign as NWA World Heavyweight Champion, the title was further unified with several more previously competing world titles including the American Wrestling Alliance\u2019s heavyweight title in [[Boston]] and the California World Heavyweight title from [[Baron Michele Leone]] in [[Los Angeles]]. As NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Thesz became the closest any wrestler had been to be the [[Undisputed championship|undisputed]] world heavyweight wrestling champion since [[Danno O'Mahony]] in 1936. This legitimized the NWA's claim that its title was a \"unified world title\" and its lineage continues to this day.\n\n[[File:1953 St.Paul Armory Wrestling Program - Lou Thesz.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Lou Thesz]]]] With Thesz as unified world champion, Muchnick as NWA President, and the power of television\u2019s reach, the NWA became the dominant governing body in pro wrestling during this time. Nearly every major wrestling promotion across the country joined the NWA in order to gain access to the treasure chest that was the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, who was universally recognized as the industry's premier star.\n\nThe NWA\u2019s presence in [[Japan]] was established in 1953, when Japanese wrestler/promoter [[Rikidozan]] founded the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance]], (JWA) which quickly became the main promotion in Japan later that year the [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre]] became the NWA territory in [[Mexico]].\n\nThe NWA experienced their first major challenge in 1956 when allegations were made that the NWA was an illegal monopoly blocking competition. An extensive investigation led by the [[US Department of Justice]] resulted in the infamous NWA Consent Decree of 1956 (''The U.S. v. National Wrestling Alliance''). Sam Muchnick had strong political connections and was able to negotiate the consent decree which prevented the investigation from ultimately resulting in the dissolution of the NWA. The judgment marked the end to the Justice Department's concerns with the National Wrestling Alliance.<ref>United States vs. National Wrestling Alliance http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/consentdecree.html</ref>\n\nOther challenges soon appeared in the late-1950s. There were disputes over the number of dates wrestled by the champion in various parts of the country. There were also competing factions who wanted to replace Thesz as champion with different wrestlers, such as [[Verne Gagne]].\n\nIt was during this time that several promoters found reasons to leave the organization, managing to find niches in the United States. The first break within the organization occurred in 1957 when [[Montreal]] promoter [[Eddie Quinn]] walked out of the August NWA meeting in St. Louis. Quinn had fallen out with Muchnick over a number of issues. At the time Quinn walked out, a wrestler of his named [[\u00c9douard Carpentier]] was involved in an angle where he and Lou Thesz were both being presented around the NWA as world champion after Carpentier had a disputed win over Thesz on June 14, 1957.<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBios/carpentier.html|title=Canadian Hall of Fame: Edouard Carpentier|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=April 30, 2008}}</ref> The original idea was to build the \"disputed\" NWA World Heavyweight Championship title into a high-profile rematch. When Quinn left the NWA, Muchnick announced that Carpentier had never been an official champion and had no claim on the title. Afterward, Quinn saw the financial possibilities in the Carpentier situation and began to negotiate with NWA member promotions that continued to recognize Carpentier as champion. He offered to have Carpentier lose a title match to their prospective champion thus giving them a legitimate claim on the world title if they decided to break away from the NWA. While some took up Quinn\u2019s offer, and title switches took place in those territories, none would match the impact of the title change in Nebraska. Verne Gagne became world champion when he defeated Carpentier in Omaha on August 9, 1958 for what would become the [[World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version)|World Heavyweight Championship of Omaha]].\n\nAs the 1950s came to an close, professional wrestling had lost its high ratings, and producers, realizing that they had overexposed it, soon dropped most wrestling shows from their lineups.<ref name=sex,lies-pg11>{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=11}}</ref> The remaining televised wrestling promoters had small, local [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows, which network producers placed as late-night fillers rather than signature programming.<ref name=sex,lies-pg13>{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|last=Assael|first=Shaun|page=13}}</ref> Promoters started using localized television as a weapon for eliminating the competition by purchasing airtime from rival territories, effectively putting some of them out of business.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=103}}</ref>\n\n====1960s====\n\n[[File:Verne Gagne 1964.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Verne Gagne]]]]\nChallenges continued for the NWA as it entered the 1960s. After defeating Carpentier in Omaha, Verne Gagne tried for two years to work things out with the NWA. Finally settling on breaking away from the NWA, the Minneapolis territory (as it was known) gave a \"story-line only\" edict to the NWA in May 1960: Unless [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)#Pat O'Connor|Pat O'Connor]], the NWA\u2019s world champion at the time, defended his title against Gagne in 90 days, then Gagne would become the recognized [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship#AWA World Heavyweight Champion|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] by default. Gagne\u2019s new [[American Wrestling Association]] unilaterally recognized O\u2019Connor as the first AWA world champion. There was never any intention of such a match taking place, and ninety days later, on August 16, 1960, the AWA recognized Gagne as the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion. The AWA would go on to be a dominant professional wrestling organization throughout the 1960s.\n\nIn the same month of 1960, Sam Muchnick stepped aside as NWA President. Three NWA Presidents followed over the next three years: [[Frank Tunney]] from the [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] promotion in the [[Toronto]] territory (1960-1961), [[Fred Kohler (wrestling promoter)#Fred Kohler|Fred Kohler]], owner of [[Fred Kohler Enterprises]] promotion in the [[Chicago]] territory and producer of the popular [[DuMont Television Network]] program ''[[Wrestling From Marigold]]'' (1961-1962), and [[Doc Sarpolis]] from the [[Western States Sports]] promotion in the [[Amarillo]] territory (1962-1963). During all three administrations, Muchnick served as the NWA\u2019s executive secretary.\n\nOn January 24, 1963, at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto, Lou Thesz defeated [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] in a one-fall match and was declared NWA World Heavyweight Champion for the third and final time (official). However, after the event, [[Vincent J. McMahon]] and [[Toots Mondt]] from the [[Capital Wrestling Corporation]] promotion in the Northeast territory refused to recognize the title change since Thesz as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion was not a strong draw in their territory. They then withdrew CWC from the NWA.<ref name=won2011>{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=July 20, 2011|title=NWA World Heavyweight Championship}}</ref> As a result, McMahon and Mondt formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now [[WWE]]) with Rogers as its first [[WWE Championship#world champion|world champion]] in April 1963. Although both Gagne and McMahon promoted their own world champions, their promotions continued to have representatives on the NWA Board of Directors and regularly exchanged talent with NWA promotions during this time.\n\nConsequently, Sam Muchnick was unanimously re-installed as NWA President in 1963 and held the office until 1975, thus contributing a total of 25 years as the industry's most influential promoter.  During his second reign, Muchnick maintained the NWA\u2019s position as wrestling's top power while he also displayed an uncanny eye for scouting future talent.\n\n====1970s====\n\nAs pro wrestling's popularity declined in the 1970s, Sam Muchnick\u2019s second reign as NWA President would prove beneficial for the organization\u2019s future. Muchnick scouted new talent through the rest of his tenure, grooming eventual champions such as [[Harley Race]], [[Dory Funk Jr.]], [[Terry Funk]], [[Ric Flair]], [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and many others in the process.  Moreover, he expanded the NWA globally by inking agreements with territories in [[Mexico]], the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], and the [[Caribbean]].\n\n[[File:Gordon Solie 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Gordon Solie]]]]\nThe [[WWE|WWWF]] quietly rejoined the NWA in 1971 after their biggest draw, [[Bruno Sammartino]], left the promotion. While still an NWA member in 1979, they changed their name from World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) to World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nIn 1972, the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance|JWA\u2019s]] two top draws [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] and [[Antonio Inoki]] left to form their own promotions, [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) respectively. As a result, the JWA soon folded. AJPW became an NWA member upon its inception in 1973 and NJPW was also a member of the NWA at various points starting in 1975.\n\nBy the end of his tenure, Muchnick reportedly declared [[Atlanta, Georgia]] as the \u201cleading wrestling city\u201d for its \u201cdrawing capacity and near-capacity crowds at the City Auditorium or the Omni every Friday.\u201d<ref name=Sporskeeda>{{cite web|url= https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/georgia-championship-wrestling-gcw-the-holy-grail-of-wrestling-television-programs|title= Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), the Holy Grail of Wrestling Television Programs|last=Mileur|first=Ray|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=December 30, 2019|work=Sportskeeda}}</ref> Once Muchnick\u2019s second term ended, [[Fritz Von Erich]] (1975-1976), [[Eddie Graham]] (1976-1978), and [[Bob Geigel]] (1978-1980) would fill the role as NWA President for the remainder of the decade. However, it was Muchnick\u2019s declaration that would pay in dividends for the NWA when they made Atlanta their home base.\n\nWhile the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (WWWF/WWF) both faltered during the 1970s, the NWA once again took over as the top promotion and gained huge dominance with their program, [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], which would become the first nationally broadcast wrestling program on cable television, or more specifically the [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS Network]], in 1979. They brought in [[Gordon Solie]], dubbed \u201cThe Walter Cronkite of Professional Wrestling,\u201d from former NWA President Eddie Graham\u2019s Championship Wrestling from Florida territory to be lead commentator and host.<ref name=Sporskeeda/>\n\n====1980s====\n\nThe 1980s would prove not only to be a major turning point for the NWA but for the entire professional wrestling industry itself.\n\nVideotape trading and [[cable television]] paved the way for the eventual death of the NWA's inter-regional business model, as fans could now see for themselves the plot holes and inconsistencies between the different regional storylines. Also, the presence of stars like [[Ric Flair]] on TV every week made their special appearances in each region less of a draw.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years of mostly success, the NWA's territory system was dying.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png|title=WrestlingTerritories.png|author=|work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums :: Freakin' Awesome Wrestling Forum :: (w)Rest of Wrestling|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe WWF left the NWA for good in 1983. [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] (who bought the WWF from his father in 1982) saw the dying territory system as an opportunity to turn his family's Northeastern United States territory into the first truly national promotion. McMahon worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States, angering other promoters and disrupting the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions not seen since its inception.\n\n[[Image:Ric Flair in Seoul, South Korea.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Ric Flair]]]]\nIn 1983, [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] and the NWA created its primary [[supercard]], [[Starrcade]], the first to be broadcast via [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit networks]] and regarded as their flagship event of the year on [[Thanksgiving Day]].\n\nOn Saturday, July 14, 1984, in what would become known as [[Black Saturday (professional wrestling)|Black Saturday]], McMahon bought NWA member [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) and merged it into the WWF, with the WWF taking over GCW's long-time TV slot on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] which had been home to GCW\u2019s flagship weekly program, ''World Championship Wrestling'', for 12 years.<ref>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.61)</ref> McMahon's purchase led to a longstanding rivalry between himself and WTBS owner [[Ted Turner]], who would later enter the professional wrestling promotion business by the end of the decade. This moved proved disastrous for the already established GCW audience and the new WWE/GCW program\u2019s ratings plummeted. Losing money on the deal and desperately looking for help, McMahon turned to Jim Barnett, who directed him to NWA President [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]], the owner of [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP), who then bought the ''World Championship Wrestling'' program from McMahon for $1 million (US) and returned NWA programming to TBS.\n\nWrestling promotions across the United States feared being forced into bankruptcy by the WWF. They began to unify and conglomerate under more centralized leadership rather than continue independently. Competing promotions aired better talent and attempted to regain their audiences.\n\nDuring this time, various NWA promoters and Verne Gagne\u2019s AWA attempted to co-promote shows under the [[Pro Wrestling USA]] brand to combat the national WWF threat. It didn\u2019t last long as disputes over control, power, and revenue led the brand to fall apart, leaving it with the AWA to own the timeslot on [[ESPN]] for AWA programming.\n\nIn early 1985, [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) was becoming the center of the entire NWA. After the WWF gained huge dominance with Wrestlemania, Crockett responded by successfully acquiring time slots on TBS.<ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs2-can.html End of an era on TBS: Crockett, Flair and 'The Clashes']</ref> JCP decided to unify certain NWA territories and \"go national\" itself. Accordingly, [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]] began buying out some of the other NWA member promotions or, in some cases, allowed them to quietly fold and moved into those territories. JCP controlled many NWA territories and limited championship matches to performers under contract with JCP thus making titles exclusive to the promotion. JCP continued to buy out NWA promotions between 1986 and 1987 as well.\n\nIn February 1986, promoter [[Fritz Von Erich]] withdrew Dallas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) from the NWA in a bid to become a national promotion. Abroad, [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL), [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) all seceded from the NWA in the mid-1980s.\n\n[[File:Ted Turner LF.JPG|200px|left|thumb|[[Ted Turner]]]]\nBy this time, the top three national promotions were WWF, NWA, and AWA. With NWA\u2019s [[Starrcade]], WWF\u2019s [[WrestleMania]], and AWA\u2019s [[SuperClash]], the professional wrestling industry entered what became known as the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|\u201cWrestling Boom\u201d or \u201cGolden Age.\u201d]]. All three also had network television programs and were now in direct competition with each other.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the position of NWA President would go back and forth between [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] of Jim Crockett Promotions based in Charlotte, North Carolina (1980-1982, 1985-1986, 1987-1991), and [[Bob Geigel]] of [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]] based in Kansas City, Missouri (1982-1985, 1986-1987). As Geigel began his third term as NWA President, he would sell his promotion to Jim Crockett, Jr. By the time 1987 rolled around, and Geigel\u2019s final term ended when Crockett\u2019s third and final term began, Crockett\u2019s promotion had begun acquiring many territories and attempted to make the NWA a full national promotion. Geigel bought his promotion back, left the NWA and went on to create his own competing governing body: World Wrestling Alliance. It was too little, too late as the World Wrestling Alliance would fold by 1989.\n\nAfter WWF\u2019s massive [[WrestleMania III]] event in 1987, the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view, [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]], on Thanksgiving night to compete directly with NWA\u2019s Starrcade event, and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event. In order to prevent such a problem, Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around [[Christmas Day]], mostly in the days following, beginning in 1988. The WWF then scheduled their first [[Royal Rumble]] event in January 1988 to counterprogram against the NWA\u2019s [[Bunkhouse Stampede]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.org/articles/art53968.asp|title=The Royal Rumble - Wrestling}}</ref> The Royal Rumble originally aired on the USA cable networks the first year before finally transitioning to pay-per-view in subsequent years. The NWA responded by creating [[Clash of the Champions]] on TBS to compete against [[WrestleMania IV]]. The WWF also became an international success at this time.\n\nBy 1988, Jim Crockett Promotions was facing bankruptcy. JCP\u2019s ambition to have NWA compete directly with the WWF led to more detriment than success. Along with the acquisition spree, JCP failed to consistently match the WWF's ambitious marketing, TV production values, and merchandising. This left no viable option other than selling. On October 11, 1988, under the direction of owner [[Ted Turner]], TBS, which had replaced the WWF with JCP, bought the assets of JCP and renamed it [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) after the popular TV show on TBS.<ref name=eb60>{{cite book|author=Eric Bischoff|title=Eric Bischoff: Controversy Creates Cash|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/controversycreat00bisc/page/60 60]|isbn=1-4165-2729-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/controversycreat00bisc/page/60}}</ref>  Originally incorporated by TBS as the Universal Wrestling Corporation, Turner promised fans that WCW would be the athlete-oriented style of the NWA. The sale was completed on November 2, 1988, with a television taping of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|NWA World Championship Wrestling]]'' that very same date in WCW's hometown of Atlanta.<ref name=\"First date\">{{cite web|url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/jcp88.htm|title=JCP 1973|accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n\nTurner\u2019s NWA/WCW continued to challenge McMahon's monopoly of the sport. Turner promised a more athletic approach to the product, making [[Ric Flair]] the promotion's marquee wrestler and giving young stars big storylines and championship opportunities. With the backing of Turner\u2019s money, NWA/WCW grew into a national promotion as JCP had originally intended. WCW, like JCP before it, became the main NWA territory. Still a member of the NWA, WCW toured the entire country instead of staying within a confined territory. NWA/WCW would not only compete with the WWF on the national level, but it was about to compete with the WWF on the international level as well.\n\n====1990s====\n\nIn January 1991, WCW officially began to recognize a WCW World Champion, with Ric Flair, who had just defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, as the first title holder. Ric Flair was simultaneously recognized as the World champion of both the NWA and WCW until he left WCW over a dispute with WCW president [[Jim Herd]] (with the actual title belt in his possession) to join the [[WWE|WWF]]. Upon leaving, Flair was immediately stripped of the WCW World title but continued to be recognized as the NWA World champion, causing the separation of the WCW and NWA titles. He was officially stripped of the NWA World title upon his arrival in the WWF a few months later. Afterwards, the NWA World title lay dormant for a year until [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] hosted a tournament to crown a new champion. In September 1993, WCW withdrew completely from the NWA and despite Flair's possession of the physical belt made no mention of the NWA name on air after the split.\n\nIn August 1994, [[Philadelphia]]-based Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) withdrew their membership from the NWA in somewhat surprising fashion. As one of the most popular independent promotions of the early 1990s, they hosted a tournament to crown a new NWA World Heavyweight Champion after WCW had withdrawn from the NWA. The finals of the tournament saw [[Shane Douglas]] defeat [[2 Cold Scorpio]] for the world title. In a surprising turn, Douglas threw the title belt to the ground, claiming that he did not want to be the champion of a promotion that died \"seven years before\" (when JCP became WCW). Shane then grabbed the ECW Heavyweight Championship belt and declared himself the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Champion]]. ECW owner [[Tod Gordon]] then renamed the company to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and officially withdrew ECW from the NWA.\n\nAfter the secession of WCW in 1993, the NWA was not what it once was. Through the mid to late 1990s, the organization was left with a small collection of independent promotions during the peak of the [[Monday Night Wars]] between WCW and the WWF. In order to have joined the NWA, a promoter must have been operating for at least one year in a territory uncontested by any other NWA member, and their application had to be approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors \u2014 with some exceptions.\n\nIn 1998, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (now World Wrestling Entertainment) reached an agreement to use the likeness of the NWA world title and other titles, the NWA branding and its history, initially to create what was known as the NWA invasion storyline.<ref name=\"NWA Invasion\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewrestlinginsomniac.com/2015/04/the-1998-nwa-invasion-of-wwe.html|title=The 1998 NWA Invasion of the WWE|last=Labbe|first=Michael J.|language=en|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref> It was later claimed that WWE still owned the rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/former-president-claims-nwa-is-wwe-property/|title=Former President Claims NWA is WWE Property|website=Online World of Wrestling|language=en-US|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> (The sale of the NWA to [[Billy Corgan]] in 2017 was completed without any claims made by WWE).<ref name=PurchaseUpdate/> The NWA received international television publicity during this time of the late 1990s, however the storyline was considered a failure due to low viewer interests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/974859-pro-wrestling-jim-cornette-and-the-1998-nwa-invasion-of-the-wwf|title=Pro Wrestling: Jim Cornette and the 1998 NWA Invasion of the WWF|last=Blankenship|first=Hands of Stone|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ringthedamnbell.wordpress.com/2018/08/22/well-that-didnt-work-nwa-invades-wwf/|title=Well That Didn\u2019t Work: NWA Invades WWF|last=Editor|date=August 22, 2018|website=Ring the Damn Bell|language=en|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====2000s====\n\nIn June 2002, [[Jeff Jarrett|Jeff]] and [[Jerry Jarrett]] launched [[Impact Wrestling|NWA: Total Nonstop Action]] (NWA:TNA), a new promotion that aired a weekly, two-hour pay-per-view series. Due to the terms of TNA's agreement with the NWA, and despite not actually being an NWA member, NWA:TNA was given creative control over the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team championships. In 2004, having been rebranded as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), the promotion launched a weekly television program, ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'', but continued to use the NWA titles until the relationship ended in 2007.\n\nThe NWA established the [[NWA Hall of Fame]], an American [[professional wrestling]] [[hall of fame]], in 2005 to honor select wrestling personalities, mostly alumni of the NWA.\n\nIn August 2005, the presidency of the NWA was dissolved and the duties of the office assumed by the Board of Directors, following the resignation of Ernie Todd (NWA: Canadian Wrestling Federation). It was announced on the NWA's website on Monday, October 10, 2005, that NWA legal counsel Bob Trobich would become its new [[Executive director|Executive Director]].\n\nIn January 2008, Colours TV on [[Dish Network]] and the NWA announced that they would begin airing an hour-long show entitled ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'', featuring the NWA's current lineup of stars in action. The show was hosted by David Marquez (with [[Rob Conway]] co-hosting the first four episodes) with match commentary by announcers Todd Kenneley, Kris Kloss and Rick Otazu. Ten episodes were shown before re-runs began. All the matches were taped at the [[Plaza Hotel & Casino|Plaza Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In January 2009, ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'' started airing new episodes, this time the tapings took place in Hollywood California.\n\nOn July 12, 2010, NWA Pro Wrestling, Inc. and [[KDOC-TV]] [[Los Angeles]] announced a partnership in producing National Wrestling Alliance branded television programming beginning September 2010. ''[[Championship Wrestling from Hollywood|NWA: Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]] (CWFH)'' would premiered on September 17, 2010.\n\nIn April 2012, North Carolina businessman and NWA Carolinas promoter David Baucom took over as the Executive Director after the resignation of Trobich.\n\n===Under Bruce Tharpe (2012-2016)===\n\nIn August 2012, International Wrestling Corp, LLC, a holding company run by Houston-based attorney and wrestling promoter R. Bruce Tharpe, sued Trobich, Baucom, the NWA, and its then-parent company, Trobich's Pro Wrestling Organization LLC, claiming insurance fraud regarding the NWA's liability insurance policy. A settlement was negotiated that transferred the rights to the NWA name and trademarks from Trobich's company to Tharpe's.<ref name=\"PWInsider.com\"/> The new organization moved from a membership model to a licensing model,<ref name=CorganPurchase/> which caused many promotions to immediately cut ties with the NWA, including [[Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]].

The group operated a [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories|territory system]] which  sanctioned various [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championships]], recognized one world champion, participated in talent exchanges, and collectively protected the territorial integrity of member promotions. Prior to the 1960s it acted as the sole governing body for most of professional wrestling. It remained the largest and most influential body in wrestling until the mid-1980s by which time most of the original member promotions went out of business as a result of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'s [[Black Saturday (professional wrestling)|national expansion]]. \n\nIn September 1993, the largest remaining member promotion, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), left the NWA for the second and final time.<ref name=BleacherReport>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1009147-abandoned-the-history-of-the-wcw-international-heavyweight-championship|title=Abandoned: The History of the WCW International Heavyweight Championship|last=Schadler|first=Kyle|date=January 4, 2012|accessdate=December 29, 2019|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref> The NWA would continue as a loose coalition of independent promotions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JrGwTebNiUIC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=nwa+a+shell+of+it's+former+self&source=bl&ots=vqplzj1-mN&sig=ACfU3U08bzV-wlQS9yU5-By6Mwi2eQJQJA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwisv7LcobbnAhXUbMAKHYcVDNsQ6AEwB3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=nwa+a+shell+of+it's+former+self&f=false|title=The Rise & Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling|first=Thom|last=Loverro|date=May 22, 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|via=Google Books}}</ref> with [[Impact Wrestling|NWA: Total Nonstop Action]] (NWA:TNA) given exclusivity over its [[NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight]] and [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|Tag Team]] championships from June 2002 to May 2007.<ref name=\"The History of TNA: Year 1\">{{cite video|title=The History of TNA: Year 1|medium=DVD|publisher=TNA Home Video|date=2006}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, the NWA discontinued its memberships and started licensing its brand to wrestling promotions.<ref name=\"PWInsider.com\">{{cite web|title=NWA Lawsuit Settled, Promotion to Transfer to New Corporation|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/70396/nwa-lawsuit-settled-promotion-to-transfer-to-new-corporation.html|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref> As of 2019, the NWA is no longer a governing body and has since become a singular wrestling promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/report-nwa-roh-no-longer-working-together-nick-aldis-no-longer-advertised-summer-supercard|title=Report: NWA & ROH No Longer Working Together; Nick Aldis Not Advertised For Summer Supercard|accessdate=August 4, 2019|work=Fightful}}</ref><ref>{{cite |url=https://lastwordonprowrestling.com/2019/07/24/nwa-looking-to-join-weekly-tv-line-up/|title=NWA Looking To Join Weekly TV Line Up |publisher=Last Word on Wrestling|host=Jamie Greer|date=July 24, 2019|time=01:11:50|access-date=July 19, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite |url=https://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/nwa-tapings-planned-series-show/|title=NWA Announces First TV Tapings For Planned Series|date=August 7, 2019|access-date=August 13, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2020}}\n===Formation===\n\nBefore the NWA was founded, many regional [[professional wrestling promotion#professional wrestling promotions|professional wrestling promotions]] existed across North America with each promoting its own world champion. However, none of them had backing or recognition outside of their own respective geographic areas.\n\nIn 1948, [[Paul \"Pinkie\" George]], a promoter from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], founded the original version of the National Wrestling Alliance with the backing of five other promoters: [[Al Haft]], Tony Strecher, [[Harry Light]], [[Orville Brown]], and [[Sam Muchnick]]. The concept of the NWA was to consolidate the championships of these regional companies into one true world championship of professional wrestling, whose holder would be recognized worldwide. This newly formed NWA Board of Directors decided on Brown to be the first-ever [[NWA World Heavyweight Champion]].<ref name=sa8>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.8)</ref>\n\n[[File:NWA Professional Wrestling Territories.png|330px|thumb|The extinct [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories#NWA territory system|NWA territory system]] in North America]]\nNWA member promotions were divided up into [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories#territories|territories]] that each promoter would \"own\" and operate while the NWA President's territory usually served as the main territory of the entire alliance. Having a territory meant that no other NWA member promotion could promote wrestling in that area unless special arrangements were made between the promoters involved. Reportedly, threats of violence or physical retaliation were used against any promoter (and/or talent) who disregarded the territory system. If any NWA member promotion broke the rules, it faced expulsion and thus risked missing out on having nationally known wrestlers appear on their local shows. Promotions that were not members of the NWA were often labeled \"outlaw,\" and while they didn't have to adhere to NWA rules, they were still subject to members' retaliation if they tried to invade territories.\n\nEach territory received periodic guest visits from the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. The champion did not have a \"home territory\" as such, but instead traveled from territory to territory, defending the title against the top stars of each territory. Many NWA member promotions would build-up to the appearance of the NWA World Heavyweight Champion weeks or months in advance, making the local world title matches that much more special, and the shows they headlined more lucrative. In addition, each NWA member promotion usually produced a TV show that aired in their territory only, meaning that the local fans only saw the world champion when he came to their area and not year-round.\n\nWrestlers from one territory could come into another territory (often the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#heels|heels]] or \"bad guys\") and run an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#angle|angle]] or two with its top local [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#faces|faces]] (\"good guys\"). If the local fans ever got tired of a wrestler, the wrestler could go to a whole new territory and perform the same act for new audiences who would think the act was brand-new. This storyline was often advanced in the territory from which the wrestler was departing as a result of an especially highly promoted \"loser leaves town\" match.\n\nFor most NWA member promotions, the benefits of membership were well worth the dues and the rules.\n\nIn 1949, [[Lou Thesz]] was the [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)#National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion|National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion]] when a deal was made to unify his title with Orville Brown\u2019s [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. On November 1, 1949, with just weeks before the scheduled bout, Brown was involved in an automobile accident that ended his career, and he was forced to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacate]] the [[Professional wrestling championship|championship]]. The NWA then awarded the unified titles to the No. 1 contender, Thesz.\n\n===As a Governing Body===\n====1950s====\n\nIn 1950, [[Sam Muchnick]], one of the original promoters of the NWA and Thesz\u2019s booker, was named the new NWA President, a position to which he was unanimously re-elected and held until 1960, making him one of the longest-tenured presidents in the organization\u2019s history.\n\nFollowing the advent of [[television]], professional wrestling matches began to be aired nationally during this time, reaching a larger fanbase than ever before. This was a time of enormous growth for professional wrestling, as rising demand and national expansion made it a much more popular and lucrative form of entertainment than in decades previous. This was called a \"Golden Age\" for the wrestling industry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=101}}</ref><ref name=sex,lies>{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=10}}</ref> From 1948 to 1955, each of the three major television networks broadcast wrestling shows; the largest supporter being the [[DuMont Television Network]].<ref name=sex,lies/>\n\nUp through 1956, during Thesz\u2019s first reign as NWA World Heavyweight Champion, the title was further unified with several more previously competing world titles including the American Wrestling Alliance\u2019s heavyweight title in [[Boston]] and the California World Heavyweight title from [[Baron Michele Leone]] in [[Los Angeles]]. As NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Thesz became the closest any wrestler had been to be the [[Undisputed championship|undisputed]] world heavyweight wrestling champion since [[Danno O'Mahony]] in 1936. This legitimized the NWA's claim that its title was a \"unified world title\" and its lineage continues to this day.\n\n[[File:1953 St.Paul Armory Wrestling Program - Lou Thesz.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Lou Thesz]]]] With Thesz as unified world champion, Muchnick as NWA President, and the power of television\u2019s reach, the NWA became the dominant governing body in pro wrestling during this time. Nearly every major wrestling promotion across the country joined the NWA in order to gain access to the treasure chest that was the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, who was universally recognized as the industry's premier star.\n\nThe NWA\u2019s presence in [[Japan]] was established in 1953, when Japanese wrestler/promoter [[Rikidozan]] founded the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance]], (JWA) which quickly became the main promotion in Japan later that year the [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre]] became the NWA territory in [[Mexico]].\n\nThe NWA experienced their first major challenge in 1956 when allegations were made that the NWA was an illegal monopoly blocking competition. An extensive investigation led by the [[US Department of Justice]] resulted in the infamous NWA Consent Decree of 1956 (''The U.S. v. National Wrestling Alliance''). Sam Muchnick had strong political connections and was able to negotiate the consent decree which prevented the investigation from ultimately resulting in the dissolution of the NWA. The judgment marked the end to the Justice Department's concerns with the National Wrestling Alliance.<ref>United States vs. National Wrestling Alliance http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/consentdecree.html</ref>\n\nOther challenges soon appeared in the late-1950s. There were disputes over the number of dates wrestled by the champion in various parts of the country. There were also competing factions who wanted to replace Thesz as champion with different wrestlers, such as [[Verne Gagne]].\n\nIt was during this time that several promoters found reasons to leave the organization, managing to find niches in the United States. The first break within the organization occurred in 1957 when [[Montreal]] promoter [[Eddie Quinn]] walked out of the August NWA meeting in St. Louis. Quinn had fallen out with Muchnick over a number of issues. At the time Quinn walked out, a wrestler of his named [[\u00c9douard Carpentier]] was involved in an angle where he and Lou Thesz were both being presented around the NWA as world champion after Carpentier had a disputed win over Thesz on June 14, 1957.<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBios/carpentier.html|title=Canadian Hall of Fame: Edouard Carpentier|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=April 30, 2008}}</ref> The original idea was to build the \"disputed\" NWA World Heavyweight Championship title into a high-profile rematch. When Quinn left the NWA, Muchnick announced that Carpentier had never been an official champion and had no claim on the title. Afterward, Quinn saw the financial possibilities in the Carpentier situation and began to negotiate with NWA member promotions that continued to recognize Carpentier as champion. He offered to have Carpentier lose a title match to their prospective champion thus giving them a legitimate claim on the world title if they decided to break away from the NWA. While some took up Quinn\u2019s offer, and title switches took place in those territories, none would match the impact of the title change in Nebraska. Verne Gagne became world champion when he defeated Carpentier in Omaha on August 9, 1958 for what would become the [[World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version)|World Heavyweight Championship of Omaha]].\n\nAs the 1950s came to an close, professional wrestling had lost its high ratings, and producers, realizing that they had overexposed it, soon dropped most wrestling shows from their lineups.<ref name=sex,lies-pg11>{{cite book|last=Assael|first=Shaun|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|page=11}}</ref> The remaining televised wrestling promoters had small, local [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows, which network producers placed as late-night fillers rather than signature programming.<ref name=sex,lies-pg13>{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|last=Assael|first=Shaun|page=13}}</ref> Promoters started using localized television as a weapon for eliminating the competition by purchasing airtime from rival territories, effectively putting some of them out of business.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=103}}</ref>\n\n====1960s====\n\n[[File:Verne Gagne 1964.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Verne Gagne]]]]\nChallenges continued for the NWA as it entered the 1960s. After defeating Carpentier in Omaha, Verne Gagne tried for two years to work things out with the NWA. Finally settling on breaking away from the NWA, the Minneapolis territory (as it was known) gave a \"story-line only\" edict to the NWA in May 1960: Unless [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)#Pat O'Connor|Pat O'Connor]], the NWA\u2019s world champion at the time, defended his title against Gagne in 90 days, then Gagne would become the recognized [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship#AWA World Heavyweight Champion|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] by default. Gagne\u2019s new [[American Wrestling Association]] unilaterally recognized O\u2019Connor as the first AWA world champion. There was never any intention of such a match taking place, and ninety days later, on August 16, 1960, the AWA recognized Gagne as the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion. The AWA would go on to be a dominant professional wrestling organization throughout the 1960s.\n\nIn the same month of 1960, Sam Muchnick stepped aside as NWA President. Three NWA Presidents followed over the next three years: [[Frank Tunney]] from the [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] promotion in the [[Toronto]] territory (1960-1961), [[Fred Kohler (wrestling promoter)#Fred Kohler|Fred Kohler]], owner of [[Fred Kohler Enterprises]] promotion in the [[Chicago]] territory and producer of the popular [[DuMont Television Network]] program ''[[Wrestling From Marigold]]'' (1961-1962), and [[Doc Sarpolis]] from the [[Western States Sports]] promotion in the [[Amarillo]] territory (1962-1963). During all three administrations, Muchnick served as the NWA\u2019s executive secretary.\n\nOn January 24, 1963, at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto, Lou Thesz defeated [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] in a one-fall match and was declared NWA World Heavyweight Champion for the third and final time (official). However, after the event, [[Vincent J. McMahon]] and [[Toots Mondt]] from the [[Capital Wrestling Corporation]] promotion in the Northeast territory refused to recognize the title change since Thesz as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion was not a strong draw in their territory. They then withdrew CWC from the NWA.<ref name=won2011>{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=July 20, 2011|title=NWA World Heavyweight Championship}}</ref> As a result, McMahon and Mondt formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now [[WWE]]) with Rogers as its first [[WWE Championship#world champion|world champion]] in April 1963. Although both Gagne and McMahon promoted their own world champions, their promotions continued to have representatives on the NWA Board of Directors and regularly exchanged talent with NWA promotions during this time.\n\nConsequently, Sam Muchnick was unanimously re-installed as NWA President in 1963 and held the office until 1975, thus contributing a total of 25 years as the industry's most influential promoter.  During his second reign, Muchnick maintained the NWA\u2019s position as wrestling's top power while he also displayed an uncanny eye for scouting future talent.\n\n====1970s====\n\nAs pro wrestling's popularity declined in the 1970s, Sam Muchnick\u2019s second reign as NWA President would prove beneficial for the organization\u2019s future. Muchnick scouted new talent through the rest of his tenure, grooming eventual champions such as [[Harley Race]], [[Dory Funk Jr.]], [[Terry Funk]], [[Ric Flair]], [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and many others in the process.  Moreover, he expanded the NWA globally by inking agreements with territories in [[Mexico]], the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], and the [[Caribbean]].\n\n[[File:Gordon Solie 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Gordon Solie]]]]\nThe [[WWE|WWWF]] quietly rejoined the NWA in 1971 after their biggest draw, [[Bruno Sammartino]], left the promotion. While still an NWA member in 1979, they changed their name from World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) to World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nIn 1972, the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance|JWA\u2019s]] two top draws [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] and [[Antonio Inoki]] left to form their own promotions, [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) respectively. As a result, the JWA soon folded. AJPW became an NWA member upon its inception in 1973 and NJPW was also a member of the NWA at various points starting in 1975.\n\nBy the end of his tenure, Muchnick reportedly declared [[Atlanta, Georgia]] as the \u201cleading wrestling city\u201d for its \u201cdrawing capacity and near-capacity crowds at the City Auditorium or the Omni every Friday.\u201d<ref name=Sporskeeda>{{cite web|url= https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/georgia-championship-wrestling-gcw-the-holy-grail-of-wrestling-television-programs|title= Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), the Holy Grail of Wrestling Television Programs|last=Mileur|first=Ray|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=December 30, 2019|work=Sportskeeda}}</ref> Once Muchnick\u2019s second term ended, [[Fritz Von Erich]] (1975-1976), [[Eddie Graham]] (1976-1978), and [[Bob Geigel]] (1978-1980) would fill the role as NWA President for the remainder of the decade. However, it was Muchnick\u2019s declaration that would pay in dividends for the NWA when they made Atlanta their home base.\n\nWhile the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (WWWF/WWF) both faltered during the 1970s, the NWA once again took over as the top promotion and gained huge dominance with their program, [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], which would become the first nationally broadcast wrestling program on cable television, or more specifically the [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS Network]], in 1979. They brought in [[Gordon Solie]], dubbed \u201cThe Walter Cronkite of Professional Wrestling,\u201d from former NWA President Eddie Graham\u2019s Championship Wrestling from Florida territory to be lead commentator and host.<ref name=Sporskeeda/>\n\n====1980s====\n\nThe 1980s would prove not only to be a major turning point for the NWA but for the entire professional wrestling industry itself.\n\nVideotape trading and [[cable television]] paved the way for the eventual death of the NWA's inter-regional business model, as fans could now see for themselves the plot holes and inconsistencies between the different regional storylines. Also, the presence of stars like [[Ric Flair]] on TV every week made their special appearances in each region less of a draw.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years of mostly success, the NWA's territory system was dying.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw8hS9psIsI/TX2U4tyXq7I/AAAAAAAAAGo/pYb5ZvDMbOg/s1600/WrestlingTerritories.png|title=WrestlingTerritories.png|author=|work=Freakin' Awesome Network Forums :: Freakin' Awesome Wrestling Forum :: (w)Rest of Wrestling|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe WWF left the NWA for good in 1983. [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] (who bought the WWF from his father in 1982) saw the dying territory system as an opportunity to turn his family's Northeastern United States territory into the first truly national promotion. McMahon worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States, angering other promoters and disrupting the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions not seen since its inception.\n\n[[Image:Ric Flair in Seoul, South Korea.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Ric Flair]]]]\nIn 1983, [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] and the NWA created its primary [[supercard]], [[Starrcade]], the first to be broadcast via [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit networks]] and regarded as their flagship event of the year on [[Thanksgiving Day]].\n\nOn Saturday, July 14, 1984, in what would become known as [[Black Saturday (professional wrestling)|Black Saturday]], McMahon bought NWA member [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) and merged it into the WWF, with the WWF taking over GCW's long-time TV slot on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] which had been home to GCW\u2019s flagship weekly program, ''World Championship Wrestling'', for 12 years.<ref>Shaun Assael. ''Sex, Lies, & Headlocks'' (p.61)</ref> McMahon's purchase led to a longstanding rivalry between himself and WTBS owner [[Ted Turner]], who would later enter the professional wrestling promotion business by the end of the decade. This moved proved disastrous for the already established GCW audience and the new WWE/GCW program\u2019s ratings plummeted. Losing money on the deal and desperately looking for help, McMahon turned to Jim Barnett, who directed him to NWA President [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]], the owner of [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP), who then bought the ''World Championship Wrestling'' program from McMahon for $1 million (US) and returned NWA programming to TBS.\n\nWrestling promotions across the United States feared being forced into bankruptcy by the WWF. They began to unify and conglomerate under more centralized leadership rather than continue independently. Competing promotions aired better talent and attempted to regain their audiences.\n\nDuring this time, various NWA promoters and Verne Gagne\u2019s AWA attempted to co-promote shows under the [[Pro Wrestling USA]] brand to combat the national WWF threat. It didn\u2019t last long as disputes over control, power, and revenue led the brand to fall apart, leaving it with the AWA to own the timeslot on [[ESPN]] for AWA programming.\n\nIn early 1985, [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) was becoming the center of the entire NWA. After the WWF gained huge dominance with Wrestlemania, Crockett responded by successfully acquiring time slots on TBS.<ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tbs2-can.html End of an era on TBS: Crockett, Flair and 'The Clashes']</ref> JCP decided to unify certain NWA territories and \"go national\" itself. Accordingly, [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]] began buying out some of the other NWA member promotions or, in some cases, allowed them to quietly fold and moved into those territories. JCP controlled many NWA territories and limited championship matches to performers under contract with JCP thus making titles exclusive to the promotion. JCP continued to buy out NWA promotions between 1986 and 1987 as well.\n\nIn February 1986, promoter [[Fritz Von Erich]] withdrew Dallas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) from the NWA in a bid to become a national promotion. Abroad, [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL), [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), and [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) all seceded from the NWA in the mid-1980s.\n\n[[File:Ted Turner LF.JPG|200px|left|thumb|[[Ted Turner]]]]\nBy this time, the top three national promotions were WWF, NWA, and AWA. With NWA\u2019s [[Starrcade]], WWF\u2019s [[WrestleMania]], and AWA\u2019s [[SuperClash]], the professional wrestling industry entered what became known as the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|\u201cWrestling Boom\u201d or \u201cGolden Age.\u201d]]. All three also had network television programs and were now in direct competition with each other.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the position of NWA President would go back and forth between [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] of Jim Crockett Promotions based in Charlotte, North Carolina (1980-1982, 1985-1986, 1987-1991), and [[Bob Geigel]] of [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]] based in Kansas City, Missouri (1982-1985, 1986-1987). As Geigel began his third term as NWA President, he would sell his promotion to Jim Crockett, Jr. By the time 1987 rolled around, and Geigel\u2019s final term ended when Crockett\u2019s third and final term began, Crockett\u2019s promotion had begun acquiring many territories and attempted to make the NWA a full national promotion. Geigel bought his promotion back, left the NWA and went on to create his own competing governing body: World Wrestling Alliance. It was too little, too late as the World Wrestling Alliance would fold by 1989.\n\nAfter WWF\u2019s massive [[WrestleMania III]] event in 1987, the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view, [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]], on Thanksgiving night to compete directly with NWA\u2019s Starrcade event, and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event. In order to prevent such a problem, Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around [[Christmas Day]], mostly in the days following, beginning in 1988. The WWF then scheduled their first [[Royal Rumble]] event in January 1988 to counterprogram against the NWA\u2019s [[Bunkhouse Stampede]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.org/articles/art53968.asp|title=The Royal Rumble - Wrestling}}</ref> The Royal Rumble originally aired on the USA cable networks the first year before finally transitioning to pay-per-view in subsequent years. The NWA responded by creating [[Clash of the Champions]] on TBS to compete against [[WrestleMania IV]]. The WWF also became an international success at this time.\n\nBy 1988, Jim Crockett Promotions was facing bankruptcy. JCP\u2019s ambition to have NWA compete directly with the WWF led to more detriment than success. Along with the acquisition spree, JCP failed to consistently match the WWF's ambitious marketing, TV production values, and merchandising. This left no viable option other than selling. On October 11, 1988, under the direction of owner [[Ted Turner]], TBS, which had replaced the WWF with JCP, bought the assets of JCP and renamed it [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) after the popular TV show on TBS.<ref name=eb60>{{cite book|author=Eric Bischoff|title=Eric Bischoff: Controversy Creates Cash|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/controversycreat00bisc/page/60 60]|isbn=1-4165-2729-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/controversycreat00bisc/page/60}}</ref>  Originally incorporated by TBS as the Universal Wrestling Corporation, Turner promised fans that WCW would be the athlete-oriented style of the NWA. The sale was completed on November 2, 1988, with a television taping of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|NWA World Championship Wrestling]]'' that very same date in WCW's hometown of Atlanta.<ref name=\"First date\">{{cite web|url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/jcp88.htm|title=JCP 1973|accessdate=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n\nTurner\u2019s NWA/WCW continued to challenge McMahon's monopoly of the sport. Turner promised a more athletic approach to the product, making [[Ric Flair]] the promotion's marquee wrestler and giving young stars big storylines and championship opportunities. With the backing of Turner\u2019s money, NWA/WCW grew into a national promotion as JCP had originally intended. WCW, like JCP before it, became the main NWA territory. Still a member of the NWA, WCW toured the entire country instead of staying within a confined territory. NWA/WCW would not only compete with the WWF on the national level, but it was about to compete with the WWF on the international level as well.\n\n====1990s====\n\nIn January 1991, WCW officially began to recognize a WCW World Champion, with Ric Flair, who had just defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, as the first title holder. Ric Flair was simultaneously recognized as the World champion of both the NWA and WCW until he left WCW over a dispute with WCW president [[Jim Herd]] (with the actual title belt in his possession) to join the [[WWE|WWF]]. Upon leaving, Flair was immediately stripped of the WCW World title but continued to be recognized as the NWA World champion, causing the separation of the WCW and NWA titles. He was officially stripped of the NWA World title upon his arrival in the WWF a few months later. Afterwards, the NWA World title lay dormant for a year until [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] hosted a tournament to crown a new champion. In September 1993, WCW withdrew completely from the NWA and despite Flair's possession of the physical belt made no mention of the NWA name on air after the split.\n\nIn August 1994, [[Philadelphia]]-based Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) withdrew their membership from the NWA in somewhat surprising fashion. As one of the most popular independent promotions of the early 1990s, they hosted a tournament to crown a new NWA World Heavyweight Champion after WCW had withdrawn from the NWA. The finals of the tournament saw [[Shane Douglas]] defeat [[2 Cold Scorpio]] for the world title. In a surprising turn, Douglas threw the title belt to the ground, claiming that he did not want to be the champion of a promotion that died \"seven years before\" (when JCP became WCW). Shane then grabbed the ECW Heavyweight Championship belt and declared himself the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Champion]]. ECW owner [[Tod Gordon]] then renamed the company to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and officially withdrew ECW from the NWA.\n\nAfter the secession of WCW in 1993, the NWA was not what it once was. Through the mid to late 1990s, the organization was left with a small collection of independent promotions during the peak of the [[Monday Night Wars]] between WCW and the WWF. In order to have joined the NWA, a promoter must have been operating for at least one year in a territory uncontested by any other NWA member, and their application had to be approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors \u2014 with some exceptions.\n\nIn 1998, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (now World Wrestling Entertainment) reached an agreement to use the likeness of the NWA world title and other titles, the NWA branding and its history, initially to create what was known as the NWA invasion storyline.<ref name=\"NWA Invasion\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewrestlinginsomniac.com/2015/04/the-1998-nwa-invasion-of-wwe.html|title=The 1998 NWA Invasion of the WWE|last=Labbe|first=Michael J.|language=en|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref> It was later claimed that WWE still owned the rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/former-president-claims-nwa-is-wwe-property/|title=Former President Claims NWA is WWE Property|website=Online World of Wrestling|language=en-US|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> (The sale of the NWA to [[Billy Corgan]] in 2017 was completed without any claims made by WWE).<ref name=PurchaseUpdate/> The NWA received international television publicity during this time of the late 1990s, however the storyline was considered a failure due to low viewer interests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/974859-pro-wrestling-jim-cornette-and-the-1998-nwa-invasion-of-the-wwf|title=Pro Wrestling: Jim Cornette and the 1998 NWA Invasion of the WWF|last=Blankenship|first=Hands of Stone|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ringthedamnbell.wordpress.com/2018/08/22/well-that-didnt-work-nwa-invades-wwf/|title=Well That Didn\u2019t Work: NWA Invades WWF|last=Editor|date=August 22, 2018|website=Ring the Damn Bell|language=en|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====2000s====\n\nIn June 2002, [[Jeff Jarrett|Jeff]] and [[Jerry Jarrett]] launched [[Impact Wrestling|NWA: Total Nonstop Action]] (NWA:TNA), a new promotion that aired a weekly, two-hour pay-per-view series. Due to the terms of TNA's agreement with the NWA, and despite not actually being an NWA member, NWA:TNA was given creative control over the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team championships. In 2004, having been rebranded as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), the promotion launched a weekly television program, ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'', but continued to use the NWA titles until the relationship ended in 2007.\n\nThe NWA established the [[NWA Hall of Fame]], an American [[professional wrestling]] [[hall of fame]], in 2005 to honor select wrestling personalities, mostly alumni of the NWA.\n\nIn August 2005, the presidency of the NWA was dissolved and the duties of the office assumed by the Board of Directors, following the resignation of Ernie Todd (NWA: Canadian Wrestling Federation). It was announced on the NWA's website on Monday, October 10, 2005, that NWA legal counsel Bob Trobich would become its new [[Executive director|Executive Director]].\n\nIn January 2008, Colours TV on [[Dish Network]] and the NWA announced that they would begin airing an hour-long show entitled ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'', featuring the NWA's current lineup of stars in action. The show was hosted by David Marquez (with [[Rob Conway]] co-hosting the first four episodes) with match commentary by announcers Todd Kenneley, Kris Kloss and Rick Otazu. Ten episodes were shown before re-runs began. All the matches were taped at the [[Plaza Hotel & Casino|Plaza Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. In January 2009, ''NWA Wrestling Showcase'' started airing new episodes, this time the tapings took place in Hollywood California.\n\nOn July 12, 2010, NWA Pro Wrestling, Inc. and [[KDOC-TV]] [[Los Angeles]] announced a partnership in producing National Wrestling Alliance branded television programming beginning September 2010. ''[[Championship Wrestling from Hollywood|NWA: Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]] (CWFH)'' would premiered on September 17, 2010.\n\nIn April 2012, North Carolina businessman and NWA Carolinas promoter David Baucom took over as the Executive Director after the resignation of Trobich.\n\n===Under Bruce Tharpe (2012-2016)===\n\nIn August 2012, International Wrestling Corp, LLC, a holding company run by Houston-based attorney and wrestling promoter R.

A settlement was negotiated that transferred the rights to the NWA name and trademarks from Trobich's company to Tharpe's.<ref name=\"PWInsider.com\"/> The new organization moved from a membership model to a licensing model,<ref name=CorganPurchase/> which caused many promotions to immediately cut ties with the NWA, including [[Championship Wrestling from Hollywood]].

The Lord Advocate read a prepared statement to the chamber setting out the narrative of the Crown case and explaining her reasoning for deciding to prosecute. She is recorded in the official transcript of her address as saying that she was \"disappointed\" with the result, and that she \"was of the clear opinion that the evidence that was made available to the court was sufficient to put before the jury to allow it the opportunity to decide on the case against Sinclair\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copfs.gov.uk/news/releases/2007/09/lord-advocates-statement-parliament |title=Lord Advocate's Statement to Parliament &#124; Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service |publisher=Copfs.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn response, on 26 September 2007, the then [[Lord Justice General]], [[Arthur Campbell Hamilton, Lord Hamilton|Lord Hamilton]], took the unprecedented move of publicly criticising the Lord Advocate's decision to address the [[Scottish Parliament]] on the case.

GOE was created in 1982 and has around 200 operatives. Although a police unit, the GOE is employed worldwide, similar to the French [[GIGN]] , the German [[GSG 9]] , British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] , Portuguese GIOE ((Republican National Guard/GNR's version)) and the Famous  [[Delta Force]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1978, ''Quinta das \u00c1guas Livres'' in [[Sintra]] was acquired and the construction works of the infrastructures necessary to organise the instruction activities and to accommodate the distinct elements that would form a future operational group began.\nAlongside, also began studies regarding the creation of the GOE and, with the co-operation of the [[United Kingdom|British]] government, thanks to the efforts of [[Mota Pinto]]'s government, elements of the [[Special Air Service|22nd Special Air Service Regiment (SAS)]] came to [[Portugal]] to train and start the formation of a [[police]] group able to conduct [[anti-terrorist]] missions.\n\nOn March 29, 1982, the first ''COE \u2013 Curso de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais'' (Special Operations Course) began (not to be mistaken with [[Special Operations Troops Centre|CTOE's]] COE). The course ended on November 18 of the same year; the unit was considered to be totally operational and with an intervention capability since the end of 1982, although it was formally created in 1979. As a result of that approach between the British SAS and the Portuguese GOE, the pictures of the first agents are hard to distinguish between British and Portuguese since their uniforms, equipment and weaponry are identical. Later, GOE, still maintaining a strong relationship with the SAS, also began training with the US [[Delta Force]], Germany's [[GSG 9]], Spain's [[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] Anti-Terrorist units, Ireland's [[Garda Emergency Response Unit|Garda ERU]], and [[Israel]]i Anti-Terrorist units. GOE is also part of the European [[ATLAS Network]].\n\nGOE's capabilities were put to the test in June, 1983, when [[1983 Turkish embassy attack in Lisbon|Armenian commandos]], using rented cars, invaded the residence of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] ambassador and wounded a PSP officer who was part of the embassy's security team, holding the rest of the people there hostage. The Prime-Minister, [[Mario Soares]], gave the green light to GOE to storm the building. Before this could be attempted, the terrorists accidentally blew themselves up, resulting in 5 dead terrorists and 2 casualties (the charg\u00e9 d'affaires' wife and a policeman).<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/31/weekinreview/the-world-a-new-armenian-death-mission.html The New York Times, July 31, 1983. A New Armenian Death Mission.]</ref>\n\nSince that moment, the missions assigned to the unit became more diverse and demanding. After 1991, GOE operational elements, together with ex-operators, began missions of protection of diplomatic representatives and installations in foreign countries where there are unstable situations or armed conflicts.\nThe level of operators deployed to those scenarios depends of the situation. GOE also intervenes if the evacuation of Portuguese citizens is needed: in 1992 in [[Luanda]] ([[Angola]]), in 1991 and 1997 in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (former Zaire) and in other countries like [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Algeria]], [[Macau]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and, in 2011, in [[Egypt]].\n\nIn those missions, they had to face attempts of forced entry into the diplomatic delegations by armed militants; the most serious being the missions that happened in 1997 in [[Zaire]] and in 1998 in Guinea; in the latter a [[grenade]] was launched into the embassy building where the security team was. In 2005 they were sent to [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iraq]] to protect the Portuguese embassies and personnel in both countries. Some were also sent into [[Timor-Leste]] in 2006.\n\nSince 2006, the unit has the support of police elements from the famous Intervention Corps (''Corpo de Interven\u00e7\u00e3o'', [[riot police]] unit) in the security of the Portuguese Embassies in Iraq and East-Timor. In August 2008 they were also assigned to end a robbery with hostages taking place in a [[Campolide, Lisbon]] branch of the Portuguese bank [[Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo]], involving two illegal immigrant armed robbers with Brazilian citizenship and six hostages,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNXliC6Im7k&NR=1 Assaltantes do BES s\u00e3o Brasileiros ilegais], [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal]], [[youtube.com]]</ref> successfully taking out one of the robbers with a sniper shot to the heart, and injuring the other with one shot through the jaw. All hostages were released, four of them shortly after the beginning of the negotiations, while the other two were held until the end. This intervention was generally considered very successful.\n\n==Missions==\n[[File:Emblema do Curso de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais.png|thumb|250px|Special operations badge]]\n* [[Counter-terrorism]]\n* Hostage rescue\n* High-risk arrest warrants and searches\n* VIP protection\n* Embassy and diplomatic security in dangerous countries\n* Evacuation of Portuguese citizens from war-torn countries\n\n==Weapons==\nGOE officers may use a variety of firearms to complete missions.\n\nSidearms, mostly in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, are issued such as the:\n* [[Glock 17]] \n* [[Glock 19]]\n* [[SIG Sauer P226]]\n* [[SIG Sauer P228]]\n* [[SIG Sauer P230]] \n* [[SIG Sauer Pro series|SIG Sauer SP2022]] \n* [[Desert Eagle]] in [[.357 Magnum]]\n\nSub-machine guns are often deployed, notably the [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] and the [[FN P90]], and [[Heckler & Koch G36]] rifles in normal, compact and short variants are also stocked in the GOE armory.\n\nFor snipers, the [[Heckler & Koch PSG1]] and [[SIG SG 550]] rifles are their choice when conducting sniping missions.\n\n==Command==\nThe unit is organized as follows:\n*Command\n*Support Services\n*UEI (''Unidade Especial de Interven\u00e7\u00e3o'') - Special Intervention Unit, consisting of:\n**Command\n**Three GOI (''Grupos Operacionais de Interven\u00e7\u00e3o'') - Intervention Operational Group (1st, 2nd and 3rd), each commanded by an officer and includes 20 to 25 elements\n**One GOT (''Grupo Operacional T\u00e9cnico'') - Technical Operational Group (4th) responsible for instruction, handling explosives, police dogs and other technical instruments, such as cameras and night vision devices.\n\n==Macau GOE==\n\n{{main|Grupo de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais (Macau)}}\n\nAs one of the past Portuguese colonies, [[Macau]] set up their special police unit in 1993 with the same name of Grupo de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais.\n\nLike the Hong Kong [[Special Duties Unit]] trained by the British [[Special Air Service]], the Macau GOE works and trains similar to the Portuguese GOE, in which they respond to terrorism acts and engage heavily armed criminals in the Macau territory.\n\nThe Macau counterpart use similar armaments compared to the original GOE, such as the: \n* [[SIG Sauer P226]]\n* [[SIG Sauer P228]]\n* [[Glock 19]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch G36]]\n\nBut they also use some small arms unique to the Portuguese GOE, such as the:\n* [[Br\u00fcgger & Thomet MP9]]\n* [[SIG SG 550|SIG SG 552]] \n* [[Franchi SPAS-15]] \n* [[SIG Sauer SSG 3000]]\n\nThey also use: \n* Smith & Wesson 37&nbsp;mm gas launchers\n* [[Baton (law enforcement)|long batons]] \n* [[Flash-ball]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of special law enforcement units|List of police tactical units]]\n* [[ATLAS

In August 2008 they were also assigned to end a robbery with hostages taking place in a [[Campolide, Lisbon]] branch of the Portuguese bank [[Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo]], involving two illegal immigrant armed robbers with Brazilian citizenship and six hostages,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNXliC6Im7k&NR=1 Assaltantes do BES s\u00e3o Brasileiros ilegais], [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal]], [[youtube.com]]</ref> successfully taking out one of the robbers with a sniper shot to the heart, and injuring the other with one shot through the jaw.

The airport is located within [[Stockholm County]] and the province of [[Uppland]]. It is the largest airport in Sweden and the third-largest airport in the [[List of the largest airports in the Nordic countries|Nordic countries]]. The airport is the major gateway to international air travel for large parts of Sweden. Arlanda Airport was used by close to 27 million passengers in 2017, with 21.2 million international passengers and 5.5 million domestic.<ref name=\"statistics\">{{cite web|url=https://www.swedavia.se/om-swedavia/statistik/|title=Swedavia Airports - Statistics|last=|first=|date=|work=svedavia.se|accessdate=8 Jan 2016}}</ref>\n\nStockholm Arlanda Airport is the larger of Stockholm's two airports. The other, [[Stockholm Bromma Airport|Stockholm\u2013Bromma]], is located north-west of the city's centre but can be used only by a small number of smaller aircraft. The smaller airports in [[Nyk\u00f6ping]] and [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]] are both located around {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} away from the Swedish capital. Stockholm Arlanda serves as a major hub for [[Scandinavian Airlines]] and [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Inaugural of Arlanda Airport (1).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|King Gustaf VI Adolf]] presiding over the ceremony which officially inaugurated Stockholm\u2013Arlanda Airport (1 April 1962)]]\nThe airport was first used in 1959 but only for practice flights. It opened for limited civil traffic in 1960, and in 1962 the official opening ceremony took place. It was used from the start for intercontinental traffic because the runway at Bromma was too short. Scandinavian Airlines started using [[Douglas DC-8]]s on North American routes. The airport was also used very early by [[Pan American World Airways]]. The name ''Arlanda'' was decided after a competition prior to the airport opening. It is derived from Arland, an old name for the parish [[\u00c4rlinghundra]] (now Husby-\u00c4rlinghundra in [[M\u00e4rsta]]) where the airport is situated. The '-a' was added in analogy with other Swedish place names ending with -landa and also plays on the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] verb \"landa\", which means \"to land\". The 1960s and 1970s saw increases in traffic with scheduled traffic and charter traffic. The [[Boeing 747]] jumbojet started to be used in the 1970s, both on one-stop scheduled flights to New York and on weekend nonstop charters to the Canary Islands. Domestic flights to Gothenburg, Malm\u00f6, Lule\u00e5 and Kiruna were operated by SAS [[DC-9]]s from Arlanda since they were considered too noisy to be used at downtown Bromma. The rest of domestic traffic operated out of Bromma and all international traffic out of Arlanda.\n\nIn 1983 the domestic traffic operated by [[Linjeflyg]] moved from Bromma to Arlanda, using the terminal now known as Terminal 4. In 1990 two new domestic terminals called \"Domestic 2 and 3\" were built south of the first domestic terminal. In 1992 the terminal 2 was partly abandoned because of traffic decrease. It started to be used for international traffic the year after, and the main domestic and international terminals were renumbered into 4 and 5. The third runway was built between 1998 and 2002. However, a recession in 2002 delayed its opening until 2003. At that time protests were raised by people living under its [[flight path]] in the municipality of [[Upplands V\u00e4sby]]. Traffic has recovered since and is now showing healthy increases but the third runway is only used during peak hours for environmental reasons. In September 2010 the first [[Airbus A380]] superjumbo landed at the airport.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/blogs/dizzy/pages/a380-at-arlanda-15-sept.aspx Business Jet news blog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012015408/http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/blogs/dizzy/pages/a380-at-arlanda-15-sept.aspx |date=12 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn early 2014, [[Swedavia]] announced plans for further expansions of the airport terminal complex, including the construction of an additional pier for Terminal 5 in order to better accommodate larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8 and address forecasts of rising passenger numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedavia.se/arlanda/om-stockholm-arlanda-airport/om-flygplatsen/nyheter/historisk-satsning-pa-arlanda/|title=Historisk satsning p\u00e5 Arlanda|work=swedavia.se|accessdate=26 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426221518/http://www.swedavia.se/arlanda/om-stockholm-arlanda-airport/om-flygplatsen/nyheter/historisk-satsning-pa-arlanda/|archivedate=26 April 2015}}</ref> The plans were approved by the Environmental Court of Appeals in December 2014, and construction was scheduled to commence in the spring of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/allt-om-resor/arlanda-satsar-13-miljarder-pa-lyft/|title=Arlanda satsar 13 miljarder p\u00e5 lyft|work=Expressen|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Corona pandemic 2020]], a majority of the flights were cancelled. Swedish authorities advised against all non-essential travel inside and out of Sweden. [[SAS Group|SAS]] decided to from 6 April 2020 fly only four domestic departures and four domestic arrivals from Arlanda, plus some international<ref>[https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/sas-fortsatter-trafikera-kiruna-och-lulea SAS beh\u00e5ller ett inrikesflyg \u2013 forts\u00e4tter trafikera fyra orter]</ref> while Norwegian cancelled all flights from Arlanda except to Oslo.<ref>[https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/norrbotten/norwegian-staller-in-alla-inrikesflyg Norwegian st\u00e4ller in alla inrikesflyg]</ref> Terminal 2, 3 and 4 closed and terminal 5 handled all passengers during this period.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Arlanda Terminal 2.JPG|thumb|Terminal 2]]\n[[File:Check-In at Stockholm Arlanda.jpg|thumb|Check-In at Terminal 2]]\n[[File:Arlanda Skycity shopping.jpg|thumb|Shopping and restaurant area in Sky City between terminals 4 and 5]]\n[[File:ARNterm5.jpg|thumb|Terminal 5]]\n[[File:Stockholm-Arlanda Airport Terminal 5 c.jpg|thumbnail|Terminal 5 check-in area]]\n\n===Runways===\nArlanda has three [[runway]]s: Runway 1 (01L/19R), Runway 2 (08/26) and Runway 3 (01R/19L). Runway 1 is {{Convert|3301|m|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"lfv.se\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lfv.se/sv/FPC/IAIP/AD/AD2T/ESSA/|title=ESSA \u2013 STOCKHOLM/Arlanda \u2013 www.lfv.se|work=lfv.se|accessdate=26 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220170923/http://www.lfv.se/sv/FPC/IAIP/AD/AD2T/ESSA/|archivedate=20 February 2015}}</ref> long and can handle take-offs and landings of the heaviest aircraft in use today. Runways 2 and 3 are {{Convert|2500|m|0|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=\"lfv.se\"/> As indicated, runways 1 and 3 are parallel runways that can be operated independently of one another. Runways 1 and 3 are equipped with [[CAT IIIa|CAT III]] systems for instrument landings.<ref name=\"lfv.se\"/> The airport can handle simultaneous take offs and landings using runways 1 and 3 at the same time. Simultaneous aircraft takeoffs and landings can be performed in [[instrument meteorological conditions]] (IMC). Runway 3 (01R/19L) is reached from the main terminal area via [[taxiway bridge]]s constructed to be able to handle the heaviest and largest airplanes in traffic. Since runway 3 (01R/19L) is located at a distance from the terminals a deicing area is placed close to the runway to avoid too long time between deicing and take off in winter conditions. Another deicing area is located in connection with the southern ramp area close to take off positions at runway 01L. There are high speed taxiway exits from all runways, except runway 08, to enable aircraft to exit the runways quickly after landing. That increases runway capacity during rush hours. Use of parallel taxiways around the terminal area separates arriving and departing traffic. Arlanda can handle all aircraft types in service including the [[Airbus A380]].\n\n===Terminals===\nThe airport has four terminals. Terminals 2 and 5 are used for international flights. Domestic flights are in Terminals 3 and 4. The new central building, Arlanda North, opened in late 2003, connecting terminal 5 with the newly built Pier F. All international flights handled by [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]] and its [[Star Alliance]] partners use the new central building. An Arlanda South building, connecting terminals 2, 3 and 4 was also planned, but construction is currently suspended for lack of funds. In the terminal areas and the shopping area \"Sky City\" there are restaurants, shopping facilities, bars etc. to cater to the needs for passengers and visitors to the airport. There are hotels both at the airport in connection with the terminals and in its surroundings. There are also conference facilities at the airport.\n\n====Terminal 2 \u2013 International (Arlanda South)====\n:*Terminal 2 (gates 61\u201372) was initially built in 1990 for use by SAS as a domestic terminal. The terminal was designed to enable short turnaround times for aircraft, increased efficiency, and short walking distances, then without security checks and with most passengers having only hand luggage, allowed to show up 10 minutes before departure. It had double walk bridges designed for both doors of MD-80. However, SAS decided to leave the terminal because of decreases in passenger traffic on domestic routes. For a while the terminal was used by other airlines like Transwede Airways for both domestic and international services, but the terminal is now used only for international flights. Security checks, a larger luggage claim area, more shops and restaurants have had to be added over the years, making the terminal fairly small. However, in 2013 it was extended with a new floor level, which now has restaurants and a lounge. Terminal 2 has 8 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges.\n:*As of 29 May 2012, Norwegian relocated its international flights from Terminal 2 to Terminal 5 ousting Air France and Czech Airlines to Terminal 2.\n:*In April 2013, British Airways and Finnair relocated to the newly-renovated Terminal 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swedavia inviger nya Terminal 2 p\u00e5 Arlanda|url=http://www.swedavia.se/arlanda/om-stockholm-arlanda-airport/om-flygplatsen/nyheter/swedavia-inviger-nya-terminal-2-pa-arlanda-/|publisher=Swedavia|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=23 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508220219/http://www.swedavia.se/arlanda/om-stockholm-arlanda-airport/om-flygplatsen/nyheter/swedavia-inviger-nya-terminal-2-pa-arlanda-/|archivedate=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n;Terminal 3 \u2013 Regional domestic (Arlanda South)\n:*Terminal 3 (gates 51\u201359) was built in 1990 for regional aircraft. There is a caf\u00e9 there. People walk outdoors from the gates and board the planes with airstairs. Access is through terminal 2, with a 200 m walking distance. As with terminal 2, it was built without security checks, which were added after [[9/11|2001]]. There has been a decline in passenger numbers for smaller connections in Sweden.\n\n====Terminal 4 \u2013 Domestic (Arlanda South)====\n:*Terminal 4, formerly '''Inrikes 1''' (gates 30\u201344) was originally designed for the Swedish domestic carrier [[Linjeflyg]], and initiated in 1983. [[Linjeflyg]] and [[Scandinavian Airlines]] moved all operations from Stockholm\u2013Bromma Airport to the new terminal at [[Arlanda]] in 1984. That was made to assemble the domestic and international departures between [[Scandinavian Airlines]] and [[Linjeflyg]]. Because of increasing popularity, the terminal soon got too small. For that reason, Inrikes 2 was set up for [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]], who moved all domestic flights from Inrikes 1 to the new terminal in 1990.\n:*Because of a recession in Swedish economy [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]] moved back in 1992 and again the two carriers shared the terminal. Also in 1992 the terminal got a new name, Terminal 4. Since 1999 the terminal has had its own express station for high-speed trains, connecting the terminal with Stockholm Central Station and Terminal 5. In 2006, the terminal underwent a major renovation, the first since it was built in 1983.\n\n====Terminal 5 \u2013 International (Arlanda North)====\n:*Terminal 5 (gates 1\u201324 & F26\u2013F69) is the largest of the passenger terminals at the airport and in use for international flights. All intercontinental flights and other international flights, except those in terminal 2, operate from terminal 5. The terminal has three piers equipped with 31 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges. There are also a number of remote aircraft parking positions serving the terminal. Terminal 5 has restaurants, bars and shopping areas. The first stage of the terminal was inaugurated in 1976. Terminal 5 has since been expanded with a new passenger pier F. By 2040 terminal 5 will be expanded with another pier, pier G, which will help the airport accommodate 40 million passengers compared with the 25 million today. The new pier will be designed to handle bigger aircraft models such as the [[Airbus A380]].<ref>https://www.worldconstructionnetwork.com/news/ramboll-selected-as-design-partner-for-new-pier-at-stockholm-arlanda-airport</ref><ref>https://www.swedavia.com/arlanda/development-plans/#gref</ref> In addition to the scheduled services listed, all charter flights are handled at Terminal 5. The terminal is (like terminal 4 and Sky City) connected to Stockholm Central station by high-speed trains.\n\n===Cargo facilities===\nStockholm Arlanda has extensive cargo flight activity. There is a cargo area with cargo terminals and cargo transit facilities in the southern part of the airport area. The cargo area is labeled \"Cargo City\" with warehouses operated by Cargo Center,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cargocenter.se/ |title=Cargo Center |publisher=Cargocenter.se |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref> DHL, Swedish postal service (Posten) and Spirit Air Cargo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritaircargohandling.com/ |title=Spirit Air Cargo |publisher=Spiritaircargohandling.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref> A large part of mail and express parcels from Sweden is handled through the facilities at the airport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bewator.com/se/applications/posten_arlanda/ |title=Bra logistik och h\u00f6g s\u00e4kerhet g\u00f6r Posten till en stark akt\u00f6r |publisher=Bewator.com |accessdate=2013-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116150829/http://www.bewator.com/se/applications/posten_arlanda/ |archivedate=2013-01-16 }}</ref> SAS Cargo has its cargo operation east of the passenger terminals close to the SAS hangars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arlanda.net/Foretag/Foretag-pa-Arlanda/SAS-Cargo-Terminal/ |title=SAS Cargo Terminal |publisher=Arlanda.net |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2013-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904084053/http://www.arlanda.net/Foretag/Foretag-pa-Arlanda/SAS-Cargo-Terminal/ |archivedate=2011-09-04 }}</ref>\n\nDedicated scheduled cargo flights are operated by Korean Air with Boeing 747 cargo aircraft, as well as [[Lufthansa Cargo]] and [[Turkish Airlines]]. DHL, FedEx and UPS operate express freight services at the airport. West Air Sweden and Amapola operate shorter cargo sectors. A number of airlines operate ad hoc cargo flights with various equipment. Outsize cargo is frequently hauled with the [[Antonov An-124|Antonov 124]] and similar cargo planes.

During heavy snowfall at least one runway stays open but in bad weather condition there may be delays even if flight operations continue at all times. Not just runways need to be cleared, aprons and aircraft parking areas need snow clearing as well. It is an advantage that there are three runways allowing two open runways when one is cleared at lighter snowfall. The airport has a total of 250 000 m<sup>2</sup> to clear from snow and ice, at the same time as the aircraft continue taking off and landing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information-about/About-the-airport/Filmer/World-class-snow-removal-at-Stockholm-Arlanda/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527170248/http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information-about/About-the-airport/Filmer/World-class-snow-removal-at-Stockholm-Arlanda/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-05-27 |title=World-class snow removal at Stockholm Arlanda |publisher=Arlanda.se |accessdate=2013-04-13 }}</ref> During the colder half of the year Stockholm Arlanda has about 65 seasonally hired snow removal staff. Together with permanent staff, they form a team of 100 people who provide snow removal services. Special routes are planned for sweeping teams, which clear each route at intervals of 35 to 45 minutes. The sweeping teams are directed via radio from the air traffic control tower. When snow removal is completed on each runway the surface is tested by a friction vehicle, which measures friction value. The airport announces the friction value, and then it is each pilot who decides whether the value is sufficient for a landing. The friction value determines how often a runway must be ploughed and treated with antiskid agent.<ref name=\"snowrem\" />\n\n==Aircraft hangars and maintenance facilities==\n[[File:TUIflyNordic767-300ERinArlandahangarl1200.JPG|thumb|Boeing 767-300ER in TUI fly Nordic hangar at Arlanda]]\n[[SAS Technical Services]], [[TUI fly Nordic]] and Priority Aero Maintenance.<ref name=\"priority.aero\"/> have large aircraft hangars and maintenance facilities at the airport. SAS Technical Services is headquartered at Arlanda and has hangar facilities suitable for widebody aircraft up to the size of Boeing 747-400s. The first part of the hangar complex was built to handle SAS' fleet of DC-8s. There are a number of positions on each side of the building initially built to handle the type. The hangar space are nowa used mostly for Boeing 737s and A320s. The Boeing 747 hangar was inaugurated at the time when Scandinavian Airlines received their first Boeing 747s in the beginning of the 70s. It is large enough to handle a Boeing 747 and two 737 sized airplanes at the same time. The offices of [[SAS Technical Services]] are situated in connection with the hangars. In the early days of the airport these hangars provided heavy maintenance for members of the KSSU group,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afiklmem.com/AFIKLMEM/en/g_page_tabs/GlobalSolutions/BoeingAircrafts/GlobalSolutions_BoeingAircrafts_747.html |title=Air France KLM Group |publisher=Afiklmem.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref> which included KLM, SAS, Swissair and UTA. A number of other airlines, such as Thai Airways International, also maintained their aircraft in those hangars. Now the main user is Scandinavian Airlines. TUI fly Nordic has a hangar able to handle their largest aircraft, the Boeing 787-9.  Priority Aero Maintenance has its facilities in the eastern part of the airport. They provide heavy aircraft maintenance for a number of aircraft including MD-80, a common type to be overhauled by the company.\n\nThere is also a hangar in the southern part of the airport, built by the former Swedish domestic airline [[Linjeflyg]].

There innovative system uses a series of wells, linked to a large underground aquifer. The water from the underground source is plumbed up and into the facilities air system, which controls the temperature of the air coming from the vents. In the summertime, the underground water remains cooler than the surface. That allows the terminals to be cooled off without using extra energy that an air conditioner would require. Then, in the winter months, the underground water remains warmer than the surface. The water is then plumbed to a control/heating unit, which uses biofuel to heat the water to a temperature appropriate for warming up the buildings.\n\nThe heated water is also used to heat pads of cement on the ramp and near the large hangar doors. Ut is a very efficient way to keep the doors and ramps clear of ice. After the water is run through the system, it is then all replaced back into the aquifer to be used again. The unique aquifer system is one of Arlanda's most defining environmentally friendly designs.<ref>Swedavia. (2012).

The airport is located within [[Stockholm County]] and the province of [[Uppland]]. It is the largest airport in Sweden and the third-largest airport in the [[List of the largest airports in the Nordic countries|Nordic countries]]. The airport is the major gateway to international air travel for large parts of Sweden. Arlanda Airport was used by close to 27 million passengers in 2017, with 21.2 million international passengers and 5.5 million domestic.<ref name=\"statistics\">{{cite web|url=https://www.swedavia.se/om-swedavia/statistik/|title=Swedavia Airports - Statistics|last=|first=|date=|work=svedavia.se|accessdate=8 Jan 2016}}</ref>\n\nStockholm Arlanda Airport is the larger of Stockholm's two airports. The other, [[Stockholm Bromma Airport|Stockholm\u2013Bromma]], is located north-west of the city's centre but can be used only by a small number of smaller aircraft. The smaller airports in [[Nyk\u00f6ping]] and [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]] are both located around {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} away from the Swedish capital. Stockholm Arlanda serves as a major hub for [[Scandinavian Airlines]] and [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Inaugural of Arlanda Airport (1).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|King Gustaf VI Adolf]] presiding over the ceremony which officially inaugurated Stockholm\u2013Arlanda Airport (1 April 1962)]]\nThe airport was first used in 1959 but only for practice flights. It opened for limited civil traffic in 1960, and in 1962 the official opening ceremony took place. It was used from the start for intercontinental traffic because the runway at Bromma was too short. Scandinavian Airlines started using [[Douglas DC-8]]s on North American routes. The airport was also used very early by [[Pan American World Airways]]. The name ''Arlanda'' was decided after a competition prior to the airport opening. It is derived from Arland, an old name for the parish [[\u00c4rlinghundra]] (now Husby-\u00c4rlinghundra in [[M\u00e4rsta]]) where the airport is situated. The '-a' was added in analogy with other Swedish place names ending with -landa and also plays on the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] verb \"landa\", which means \"to land\". The 1960s and 1970s saw increases in traffic with scheduled traffic and charter traffic. The [[Boeing 747]] jumbojet started to be used in the 1970s, both on one-stop scheduled flights to New York and on weekend nonstop charters to the Canary Islands. Domestic flights to Gothenburg, Malm\u00f6, Lule\u00e5 and Kiruna were operated by SAS [[DC-9]]s from Arlanda since they were considered too noisy to be used at downtown Bromma. The rest of domestic traffic operated out of Bromma and all international traffic out of Arlanda.\n\nIn 1983 the domestic traffic operated by [[Linjeflyg]] moved from Bromma to Arlanda, using the terminal now known as Terminal 4. In 1990 two new domestic terminals called \"Domestic 2 and 3\" were built south of the first domestic terminal. In 1992 the terminal 2 was partly abandoned because of traffic decrease. It started to be used for international traffic the year after, and the main domestic and international terminals were renumbered into 4 and 5. The third runway was built between 1998 and 2002. However, a recession in 2002 delayed its opening until 2003. At that time protests were raised by people living under its [[flight path]] in the municipality of [[Upplands V\u00e4sby]]. Traffic has recovered since and is now showing healthy increases but the third runway is only used during peak hours for environmental reasons. In September 2010 the first [[Airbus A380]] superjumbo landed at the airport.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/blogs/dizzy/pages/a380-at-arlanda-15-sept.aspx Business Jet news blog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012015408/http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/blogs/dizzy/pages/a380-at-arlanda-15-sept.aspx |date=12 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn early 2014, [[Swedavia]] announced plans for further expansions of the airport terminal complex, including the construction of an additional pier for Terminal 5 in order to better accommodate larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8 and address forecasts of rising passenger numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedavia.se/arlanda/om-stockholm-arlanda-airport/om-flygplatsen/nyheter/historisk-satsning-pa-arlanda/|title=Historisk satsning p\u00e5 Arlanda|work=swedavia.se|accessdate=26 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426221518/http://www.swedavia.se/arlanda/om-stockholm-arlanda-airport/om-flygplatsen/nyheter/historisk-satsning-pa-arlanda/|archivedate=26 April 2015}}</ref> The plans were approved by the Environmental Court of Appeals in December 2014, and construction was scheduled to commence in the spring of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/allt-om-resor/arlanda-satsar-13-miljarder-pa-lyft/|title=Arlanda satsar 13 miljarder p\u00e5 lyft|work=Expressen|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Corona pandemic 2020]], a majority of the flights were cancelled.

Runways 2 and 3 are {{Convert|2500|m|0|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=\"lfv.se\"/> As indicated, runways 1 and 3 are parallel runways that can be operated independently of one another. Runways 1 and 3 are equipped with [[CAT IIIa|CAT III]] systems for instrument landings.<ref name=\"lfv.se\"/> The airport can handle simultaneous take offs and landings using runways 1 and 3 at the same time. Simultaneous aircraft takeoffs and landings can be performed in [[instrument meteorological conditions]] (IMC). Runway 3 (01R/19L) is reached from the main terminal area via [[taxiway bridge]]s constructed to be able to handle the heaviest and largest airplanes in traffic. Since runway 3 (01R/19L) is located at a distance from the terminals a deicing area is placed close to the runway to avoid too long time between deicing and take off in winter conditions. Another deicing area is located in connection with the southern ramp area close to take off positions at runway 01L. There are high speed taxiway exits from all runways, except runway 08, to enable aircraft to exit the runways quickly after landing. That increases runway capacity during rush hours. Use of parallel taxiways around the terminal area separates arriving and departing traffic. Arlanda can handle all aircraft types in service including the [[Airbus A380]].\n\n===Terminals===\nThe airport has four terminals. Terminals 2 and 5 are used for international flights. Domestic flights are in Terminals 3 and 4. The new central building, Arlanda North, opened in late 2003, connecting terminal 5 with the newly built Pier F. All international flights handled by [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]] and its [[Star Alliance]] partners use the new central building. An Arlanda South building, connecting terminals 2, 3 and 4 was also planned, but construction is currently suspended for lack of funds. In the terminal areas and the shopping area \"Sky City\" there are restaurants, shopping facilities, bars etc. to cater to the needs for passengers and visitors to the airport. There are hotels both at the airport in connection with the terminals and in its surroundings. There are also conference facilities at the airport.\n\n====Terminal 2 \u2013 International (Arlanda South)====\n:*Terminal 2 (gates 61\u201372) was initially built in 1990 for use by SAS as a domestic terminal. The terminal was designed to enable short turnaround times for aircraft, increased efficiency, and short walking distances, then without security checks and with most passengers having only hand luggage, allowed to show up 10 minutes before departure. It had double walk bridges designed for both doors of MD-80. However, SAS decided to leave the terminal because of decreases in passenger traffic on domestic routes. For a while the terminal was used by other airlines like Transwede Airways for both domestic and international services, but the terminal is now used only for international flights. Security checks, a larger luggage claim area, more shops and restaurants have had to be added over the years, making the terminal fairly small. However, in 2013 it was extended with a new floor level, which now has restaurants and a lounge. Terminal 2 has 8 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges.\n:*As of 29 May 2012, Norwegian relocated its international flights from Terminal 2 to Terminal 5 ousting Air France and Czech Airlines to Terminal 2.\n:*In April 2013, British Airways and Finnair relocated to the newly-renovated Terminal 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swedavia inviger nya Terminal 2 p\u00e5 Arlanda|url=http://www.swedavia.se/arlanda/om-stockholm-arlanda-airport/om-flygplatsen/nyheter/swedavia-inviger-nya-terminal-2-pa-arlanda-/|publisher=Swedavia|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=23 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508220219/http://www.swedavia.se/arlanda/om-stockholm-arlanda-airport/om-flygplatsen/nyheter/swedavia-inviger-nya-terminal-2-pa-arlanda-/|archivedate=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n;Terminal 3 \u2013 Regional domestic (Arlanda South)\n:*Terminal 3 (gates 51\u201359) was built in 1990 for regional aircraft. There is a caf\u00e9 there. People walk outdoors from the gates and board the planes with airstairs. Access is through terminal 2, with a 200 m walking distance. As with terminal 2, it was built without security checks, which were added after [[9/11|2001]]. There has been a decline in passenger numbers for smaller connections in Sweden.\n\n====Terminal 4 \u2013 Domestic (Arlanda South)====\n:*Terminal 4, formerly '''Inrikes 1''' (gates 30\u201344) was originally designed for the Swedish domestic carrier [[Linjeflyg]], and initiated in 1983. [[Linjeflyg]] and [[Scandinavian Airlines]] moved all operations from Stockholm\u2013Bromma Airport to the new terminal at [[Arlanda]] in 1984. That was made to assemble the domestic and international departures between [[Scandinavian Airlines]] and [[Linjeflyg]]. Because of increasing popularity, the terminal soon got too small. For that reason, Inrikes 2 was set up for [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]], who moved all domestic flights from Inrikes 1 to the new terminal in 1990.\n:*Because of a recession in Swedish economy [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]] moved back in 1992 and again the two carriers shared the terminal. Also in 1992 the terminal got a new name, Terminal 4. Since 1999 the terminal has had its own express station for high-speed trains, connecting the terminal with Stockholm Central Station and Terminal 5. In 2006, the terminal underwent a major renovation, the first since it was built in 1983.\n\n====Terminal 5 \u2013 International (Arlanda North)====\n:*Terminal 5 (gates 1\u201324 & F26\u2013F69) is the largest of the passenger terminals at the airport and in use for international flights. All intercontinental flights and other international flights, except those in terminal 2, operate from terminal 5. The terminal has three piers equipped with 31 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges. There are also a number of remote aircraft parking positions serving the terminal. Terminal 5 has restaurants, bars and shopping areas. The first stage of the terminal was inaugurated in 1976. Terminal 5 has since been expanded with a new passenger pier F. By 2040 terminal 5 will be expanded with another pier, pier G, which will help the airport accommodate 40 million passengers compared with the 25 million today. The new pier will be designed to handle bigger aircraft models such as the [[Airbus A380]].<ref>https://www.worldconstructionnetwork.com/news/ramboll-selected-as-design-partner-for-new-pier-at-stockholm-arlanda-airport</ref><ref>https://www.swedavia.com/arlanda/development-plans/#gref</ref> In addition to the scheduled services listed, all charter flights are handled at Terminal 5.

During heavy snowfall at least one runway stays open but in bad weather condition there may be delays even if flight operations continue at all times. Not just runways need to be cleared, aprons and aircraft parking areas need snow clearing as well. It is an advantage that there are three runways allowing two open runways when one is cleared at lighter snowfall. The airport has a total of 250 000 m<sup>2</sup> to clear from snow and ice, at the same time as the aircraft continue taking off and landing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information-about/About-the-airport/Filmer/World-class-snow-removal-at-Stockholm-Arlanda/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527170248/http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information-about/About-the-airport/Filmer/World-class-snow-removal-at-Stockholm-Arlanda/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-05-27 |title=World-class snow removal at Stockholm Arlanda |publisher=Arlanda.se |accessdate=2013-04-13 }}</ref> During the colder half of the year Stockholm Arlanda has about 65 seasonally hired snow removal staff. Together with permanent staff, they form a team of 100 people who provide snow removal services. Special routes are planned for sweeping teams, which clear each route at intervals of 35 to 45 minutes. The sweeping teams are directed via radio from the air traffic control tower. When snow removal is completed on each runway the surface is tested by a friction vehicle, which measures friction value. The airport announces the friction value, and then it is each pilot who decides whether the value is sufficient for a landing. The friction value determines how often a runway must be ploughed and treated with antiskid agent.<ref name=\"snowrem\" />\n\n==Aircraft hangars and maintenance facilities==\n[[File:TUIflyNordic767-300ERinArlandahangarl1200.JPG|thumb|Boeing 767-300ER in TUI fly Nordic hangar at Arlanda]]\n[[SAS Technical Services]], [[TUI fly Nordic]] and Priority Aero Maintenance.<ref name=\"priority.aero\"/> have large aircraft hangars and maintenance facilities at the airport. SAS Technical Services is headquartered at Arlanda and has hangar facilities suitable for widebody aircraft up to the size of Boeing 747-400s. The first part of the hangar complex was built to handle SAS' fleet of DC-8s. There are a number of positions on each side of the building initially built to handle the type. The hangar space are nowa used mostly for Boeing 737s and A320s. The Boeing 747 hangar was inaugurated at the time when Scandinavian Airlines received their first Boeing 747s in the beginning of the 70s. It is large enough to handle a Boeing 747 and two 737 sized airplanes at the same time. The offices of [[SAS Technical Services]] are situated in connection with the hangars. In the early days of the airport these hangars provided heavy maintenance for members of the KSSU group,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afiklmem.com/AFIKLMEM/en/g_page_tabs/GlobalSolutions/BoeingAircrafts/GlobalSolutions_BoeingAircrafts_747.html |title=Air France KLM Group |publisher=Afiklmem.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref> which included KLM, SAS, Swissair and UTA. A number of other airlines, such as Thai Airways International, also maintained their aircraft in those hangars. Now the main user is Scandinavian Airlines. TUI fly Nordic has a hangar able to handle their largest aircraft, the Boeing 787-9.  Priority Aero Maintenance has its facilities in the eastern part of the airport. They provide heavy aircraft maintenance for a number of aircraft including MD-80, a common type to be overhauled by the company.\n\nThere is also a hangar in the southern part of the airport, built by the former Swedish domestic airline [[Linjeflyg]]. It is used mainly by regional aircraft.\n\nHelicopter hangars and maintenance facilities are found at the very eastern part of the airport operated by Patria Helicopters.<ref name=\"swedishaviationgroup.com\"/>\n\n==VIP flights and services==\nArlanda, as the main airport serving the Swedish capital, is also used by VIP-flights<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information--services-to/Business/VIP-service/VIP-service-private-flight/ |title=VIP service for those travelling on their own private aircraft |publisher=Arlanda.se |accessdate=2013-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719074738/http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information--services-to/Business/VIP-service/VIP-service-private-flight/ |archivedate=2012-07-19 }}</ref> using [[business jets]].

SL is the public transport operator of Stockholm L\u00e4n, whilst UL is the public transport operator in Uppsala L\u00e4n. SL operates a few bus lines to and from Arlanda, the most popular line being route 583 to M\u00e4rsta railway station (from where SL commuter trains to Stockholm depart, for much cheaper than from Arlanda because of the exit fee charge there), which leaves every 10 minutes for the most of the day. ULs most popular line to Arlanda is route 801 to Uppsala, which leaves every 30 minutes between 04:00 and 01:00. There are a few additional departures during peak times.\n\n===Road===\nThe motorway [[European route E4|E4]] goes past the airport and connects Arlanda with central Stockholm as well as Uppsala and other cities further north.\nTerminal parking, short-term and long-term parking is available at the airport.

There innovative system uses a series of wells, linked to a large underground aquifer. The water from the underground source is plumbed up and into the facilities air system, which controls the temperature of the air coming from the vents. In the summertime, the underground water remains cooler than the surface. That allows the terminals to be cooled off without using extra energy that an air conditioner would require. Then, in the winter months, the underground water remains warmer than the surface. The water is then plumbed to a control/heating unit, which uses biofuel to heat the water to a temperature appropriate for warming up the buildings.\n\nThe heated water is also used to heat pads of cement on the ramp and near the large hangar doors. Ut is a very efficient way to keep the doors and ramps clear of ice. After the water is run through the system, it is then all replaced back into the aquifer to be used again. The unique aquifer system is one of Arlanda's most defining environmentally friendly designs.<ref>Swedavia. (2012).

They were developed during World War I, and originally issued to German artillery crews who needed a self-defense weapon, lighter than a rifle but more effective than a standard pistol. Today, machine pistols are considered a special purpose weapon with limited utility, and difficult for all but the best shooters to control.\n\nDuring World War I, the Austrians introduced the world's first machine pistol the [[Steyr M1912|''Steyr Repetierpistole'' M1912/P16]]. The Germans also experimented with machine pistols, by converting various types of semi-automatic pistols to full-auto, leading to the development of the first practical [[submachine gun]]. During World War II, machine pistol development was more or less ignored as the major powers were focused on mass-producing submachine guns. After the war, machine pistols development was limited and only a handful of manufacturers would develop new designs, with varying degrees of success.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Steyr M1912.jpg|thumb|left|The Steyr \"Repetierpistole M1912/P16\" was the world's first machine pistol.]]\n\n=== World War I ===\nDuring World War I, a machine pistol version of the Steyr M1912 called the [[Steyr M1912#Repetierpistole M1912/P16|''Repetierpistole M1912/P16'']] was produced.

It was issued to primarily German artillery crews who needed a self-defence weapon, lighter than a rifle but more effective than a standard pistol. It fired the newly developed [[9mm Parabellum]] pistol cartridge, which was designed for low recoil without sacrificing penetration and stopping power.

Although it was developed for use with security and special forces, the weapon was also accepted into service with the [[Czechoslovak Army]], as a personal sidearm for lower-ranking army staff, vehicle drivers, armoured vehicle personnel and special forces. The Skorpion's lower powered .32 ACP cartridge, coupled with a rate-of-fire limiting device housed in the grip (which allows a reasonable rate of 850 RPM with a relatively light bolt), also makes it easier to control in full-auto than the more common 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum designs. Currently the weapon is in use with the armed forces of several countries as a sidearm. The \u0160korpion was also licence-built in Yugoslavia, designated M84.\n\nThe [[Beretta M1951|Beretta M951R]], was based on the 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum Beretta M1951 pistol and produced during the 1960s in response to a request made by the Italian special forces.

It is a 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum, 18-round, double action only, select fire capable polymer frame pistol. It was the first polymer framed pistol, predating the [[Glock 17]]. The stock incorporates a semi-auto/three round burst selector. It will only fire a 3 round burst with the stock attached. Cyclic rounds per minute for the three-round bursts is 2,200 rpm.

The MP5K does not have a shoulder stock, and the bolt and receiver were shortened at the rear. The resultant lighter bolt led to a higher rate of fire than the standard MP5. The barrel, cocking handle and its cover were shortened and a vertical foregrip was used to replace the standard handguard. The barrel ends at the base of the front sight, which prevents the use of any sort of muzzle device.\n\n[[File:B93R.jpg|thumb|The 1970 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum [[Beretta 93R]], a selective-fire machine pistol designed for police and military use]] Another popular machine pistol using the three shot burst system is the 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum [[Beretta Model 93R]].

It offered extra firepower in a small package and is suited for [[concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry]] purposes such as VIP protection, or for [[Close Quarters Battle|close quarters maneuvers]] such as room-to-room searches. A selector switch and the foldable foregrip allows the pistol to fire three-round [[burst mode (firearm)|bursts]] with each pull of the trigger for a cyclic rate of 1100 rounds per minute.

Due to their small size, machine pistols are difficult for all but the best shooters to control. As a result, most machine pistols are fitted with an unwieldy detachable shoulder [[stock (firearm)|stock]]. Some, such as the [[Heckler & Koch VP70]], will only fire in semi-automatic unless the stock is attached, because the select-fire mechanism is incorporated into the stock. The VP70 also introduced a three-round-burst limiter to improve controllability. The [[Beretta 93R]] not only uses a detachable shoulder stock and a three-round-burst limiter, but also a folding forward hand-grip to improve controllability in full auto. The [[MAC-10]] and [[MAC-11]] use suppressors to reduce muzzle climb, while other designs use a combination of burst limiters, forward hand-grips, ported barrels and muzzle brakes.\n\n[[Gunsite]], a US firearms training facility, decided against teaching machine pistol firing when it was founded in 1976. Facility experts believed that it is \"a slob's weapon, useful only by half-trained or poorly motivated troops\"; they claimed that the machine pistol \"hits no harder than a pistol and is no more portable than a rifle.\" Nevertheless, even the critics from Gunsite concede that the machine pistol is useful for a few situations, such as boarding an enemy boat in low light or when repelling boarders in a naval situation. In the 1970s, International Association of Police Chiefs weapons researcher David Steele criticized the MAC-10's accuracy when he described the MAC series as \"fit only for combat in a phone booth\".<ref name=\"Lewis2011\">{{cite book|author=Jack Lewis|title=Assault Weapons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2AbzqChZBYC&pg=PA79|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|isbn=978-1-4402-2400-3|pages=79\u2013}}</ref>\n\nWalt Rauch notes that \"...&nbsp;despite the 50 to 70 years of bad press that has accrued to the concept of shooting a hand-held machine pistol\", in which critics contend that the weapon will \"spray bullets indiscriminately all over the area\", he believes that the 2000s-era models such as the Glock 18 are controllable and accurate in full-auto shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://remtek.com/arms/glock/model/9/18/ |title=GLOCK 18 |publisher=Remtek.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05|author =Rauch, Walt}}</ref> Leroy Thompson states that \"...machine pistols were reasonably good for use from within a vehicle or for issue to VIP [bodyguard] drivers to give them a marginally more effective weapon during an evacuation under fire\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thompson, Leroy |date=October 2010 |url=https://www.swatmag.com/articles/the_machine_pistol|title=The Machine Pistol \u2013 Why Does It Even Exist? |journal=S.W.A.T.

Despite the VP70's potential, it was never adopted by the ''Bundeswehr''.\n\n[[File:Hkmp5k.jpg|thumb|left|H&K MP5K]]\nIn 1976, a shortened machine pistol version of the 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] was introduced; the [[Heckler & Koch MP5#MP5K|MP5K]] (K from the German ''Kurz'' = \"short\") was designed for close quarters battle use by clandestine operations and special services. The MP5K does not have a shoulder stock, and the bolt and receiver were shortened at the rear. The resultant lighter bolt led to a higher rate of fire than the standard MP5. The barrel, cocking handle and its cover were shortened and a vertical foregrip was used to replace the standard handguard. The barrel ends at the base of the front sight, which prevents the use of any sort of muzzle device.\n\n[[File:B93R.jpg|thumb|The 1970 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum [[Beretta 93R]], a selective-fire machine pistol designed for police and military use]] Another popular machine pistol using the three shot burst system is the 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum [[Beretta Model 93R]]. Introduced in 1979 the Beretta Model 93R, a selective-fire machine pistol meant for police and military use. It offered extra firepower in a small package and is suited for [[concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry]] purposes such as VIP protection, or for [[Close Quarters Battle|close quarters maneuvers]] such as room-to-room searches. A selector switch and the foldable foregrip allows the pistol to fire three-round [[burst mode (firearm)|bursts]] with each pull of the trigger for a cyclic rate of 1100 rounds per minute. The designers limited it to three round bursts to make it be easier to control. A 20-round magazine and a metal shoulder stock may also be fitted.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hogg|first1=Ian V.|author2=John Weeks|title=Military small arms of the 20th century|edition=7th|year=2000|publisher= Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-87341-824-9|pages=63\u201364}}</ref>\n\nThe Stechkin APS made a comeback in the late 1970s, when Russian [[Spetsnaz]] special forces units in [[Afghanistan]] used the suppressor-equipped [[Stechkin APS#APB silent variant|APB variant]] for clandestine missions in enemy territory, such as during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]].\n\n[[File:COIM in Ancon 2010-07-19.JPG|thumb|left|Argentine special forces with a Micro UZI.]]\nThe 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum [[Uzi#Micro-Uzi|Micro Uzi]] is a scaled-down version of the [[Uzi submachine gun]], first introduced in 1983.

This machine pistol has a lever-type fire-control selector switch, installed on the left side, at the rear of the slide, serrated portion (selector lever in the bottom position for continuous fire, top setting for single fire). The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round capacity magazine and may be fired with or without a shoulder stock.

Introduced in 2001, the [[Heckler & Koch MP7]] is often called a machine pistol. The MP7 uses a short stroke piston gas system as used on H&K's G36 and HK416 assault rifles, in place of a blow-back system traditionally seen on machine pistols.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_2_49/ai_95680072/ |work=Guns Magazine |first=Charles Q. |last=Cutshaw |title=Heckler & Koch's cutting-edge compacts G36C and MP7 PDW: when less really is more |year=2003}}</ref> The MP7 uses 20-, 30- and 40-round magazines and fires [[4.6\u00d730mm]] ammunition which can penetrate soft body armor.

However, it is small enough to be carried in a pistol holster and so is also often referred to as a machine pistol.

Due to their small size, machine pistols are difficult for all but the best shooters to control. As a result, most machine pistols are fitted with an unwieldy detachable shoulder [[stock (firearm)|stock]]. Some, such as the [[Heckler & Koch VP70]], will only fire in semi-automatic unless the stock is attached, because the select-fire mechanism is incorporated into the stock. The VP70 also introduced a three-round-burst limiter to improve controllability. The [[Beretta 93R]] not only uses a detachable shoulder stock and a three-round-burst limiter, but also a folding forward hand-grip to improve controllability in full auto. The [[MAC-10]] and [[MAC-11]] use suppressors to reduce muzzle climb, while other designs use a combination of burst limiters, forward hand-grips, ported barrels and muzzle brakes.\n\n[[Gunsite]], a US firearms training facility, decided against teaching machine pistol firing when it was founded in 1976. Facility experts believed that it is \"a slob's weapon, useful only by half-trained or poorly motivated troops\"; they claimed that the machine pistol \"hits no harder than a pistol and is no more portable than a rifle.\" Nevertheless, even the critics from Gunsite concede that the machine pistol is useful for a few situations, such as boarding an enemy boat in low light or when repelling boarders in a naval situation. In the 1970s, International Association of Police Chiefs weapons researcher David Steele criticized the MAC-10's accuracy when he described the MAC series as \"fit only for combat in a phone booth\".<ref name=\"Lewis2011\">{{cite book|author=Jack Lewis|title=Assault Weapons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2AbzqChZBYC&pg=PA79|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|isbn=978-1-4402-2400-3|pages=79\u2013}}</ref>\n\nWalt Rauch notes that \"...&nbsp;despite the 50 to 70 years of bad press that has accrued to the concept of shooting a hand-held machine pistol\", in which critics contend that the weapon will \"spray bullets indiscriminately all over the area\", he believes that the 2000s-era models such as the Glock 18 are controllable and accurate in full-auto shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://remtek.com/arms/glock/model/9/18/ |title=GLOCK 18 |publisher=Remtek.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05|author =Rauch, Walt}}</ref> Leroy Thompson states that \"...machine pistols were reasonably good for use from within a vehicle or for issue to VIP [bodyguard] drivers to give them a marginally more effective weapon during an evacuation under fire\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thompson, Leroy |date=October 2010 |url=https://www.swatmag.com/articles/the_machine_pistol|title=The Machine Pistol \u2013 Why Does It Even Exist? |journal=S.W.A.T.

It is the only penguin found north of the [[equator]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/galapagos-penguin |title=World Wide Fund for Nature - Galapagos Penguin Facts |work= |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> The cool waters of the [[Humboldt Current|Humboldt]] and [[Cromwell Current]]s allow it to survive despite the tropical latitude. The Gal\u00e1pagos penguin is one of the [[banded penguin]]s, the other species of which live mostly on the coasts of Africa and mainland South America.\n\n==Description==\nThe average Gal\u00e1pagos penguin is {{convert|49|cm|in}} long and {{convert|2.5|kg|lbs}} in weight. It is the second smallest species of penguin, after the [[little penguin]]. Gal\u00e1pagos penguins have a black head with a white border running from behind the eye, around the black ear coverts and chin, to join on the throat. They have grey-black upperparts and whitish underparts, with two black bands across the breast, the lower band extending down the flanks to the thigh. Juveniles differ in having a wholly dark head, greyer on side and chin, and no breast band. Females are smaller than males.\n\n== Distribution ==\nNinety percent of Gal\u00e1pagos penguins live on [[Fernandina Island]] and the west coast of [[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Isabela Island]], in the western part of the archipelago, but small populations also occur on [[Santiago Island (Gal\u00e1pagos)|Santiago]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Island|Bartolom\u00e9]], northern [[Santa Cruz Island (Gal\u00e1pagos)|Santa Cruz]], and [[Floreana Island|Floreana]]. The northern tip of Isabela crosses the equator, meaning that some Gal\u00e1pagos penguins live in the northern hemisphere, the only penguins to do so.\n\n==Ecology and behavior==\nThe penguins are confined to the archipelago, foraging in the cool Cromwell Current during the day and returning to the land at night. They eat small schooling fish, mainly mullet and sardines, and sometimes crustaceans.

It is the only penguin found north of the [[equator]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/galapagos-penguin |title=World Wide Fund for Nature - Galapagos Penguin Facts |work= |publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> The cool waters of the [[Humboldt Current|Humboldt]] and [[Cromwell Current]]s allow it to survive despite the tropical latitude. The Gal\u00e1pagos penguin is one of the [[banded penguin]]s, the other species of which live mostly on the coasts of Africa and mainland South America.\n\n==Description==\nThe average Gal\u00e1pagos penguin is {{convert|49|cm|in}} long and {{convert|2.5|kg|lbs}} in weight. It is the second smallest species of penguin, after the [[little penguin]]. Gal\u00e1pagos penguins have a black head with a white border running from behind the eye, around the black ear coverts and chin, to join on the throat. They have grey-black upperparts and whitish underparts, with two black bands across the breast, the lower band extending down the flanks to the thigh. Juveniles differ in having a wholly dark head, greyer on side and chin, and no breast band. Females are smaller than males.\n\n== Distribution ==\nNinety percent of Gal\u00e1pagos penguins live on [[Fernandina Island]] and the west coast of [[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Isabela Island]], in the western part of the archipelago, but small populations also occur on [[Santiago Island (Gal\u00e1pagos)|Santiago]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Island|Bartolom\u00e9]], northern [[Santa Cruz Island (Gal\u00e1pagos)|Santa Cruz]], and [[Floreana Island|Floreana]]. The northern tip of Isabela crosses the equator, meaning that some Gal\u00e1pagos penguins live in the northern hemisphere, the only penguins to do so.\n\n==Ecology and behavior==\nThe penguins are confined to the archipelago, foraging in the cool Cromwell Current during the day and returning to the land at night. They eat small schooling fish, mainly mullet and sardines, and sometimes crustaceans. They normally range only a few kilometers from their breeding sites, depending on the cold, nutrient-rich currents to bring them food.\n\nAir temperatures in the Gal\u00e1pagos remain in the range {{Convert|15-28|C|F}}.
