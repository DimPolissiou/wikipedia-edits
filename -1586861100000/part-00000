Many historically high-profile bouts have been sanctioned by the organization with various legendary fighters having been recognised as WBC world champions. All four organizations recognise the legitimacy of each other and each have interwoven histories dating back several decades.\n\n==History==\nThe WBC was initially established by 11 countries: the United States, Puerto Rico, Argentina, United Kingdom, France, Mexico, the Philippines, Panama, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and Brazil. Representatives met in [[Mexico City]] on 14 February 1963, upon invitation of [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]], then [[President of Mexico]], to form an international organization to unify all commissions of the world to control the expansion of boxing.\n\nThe groups that historically had recognized several boxers as champions included the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] (NYSAC), the [[National Boxing Association]] (NBA) of the United States, the [[European Boxing Union]] (EBU) and the [[British Boxing Board of Control]] (BBBC); but for the most part, these groups lacked the all-encompassing 'international' status they claimed.{{Citation needed|reason=\"All-encompassing 'international' status\" needs to be defined clearly because it means a lot of nations from around the world, a claim that is not found in the next source.|date=April 2015}}\n\nToday, it has 161 member countries. The current WBC President is Mauricio Sulaim\u00e1n. Former Presidents include [[Luis Spota]] and Ramon G. Vel\u00e1zquez of Mexico, Justiniano N. Montano Jr. of the Philippines and [[Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n]] of Mexico from 1975 until his death in 2014.\n\n===Championship===\nThe WBC's green championship belt portrays the flags of all of the 161 member countries of the organization. All WBC world title belts look identical regardless of weight class; however, there are minor variations on the design for secondary and regionally themed titles within the same weight class.\n\nThe WBC has nine regional governing bodies affiliated with it, such as the [[North American Boxing Federation]] (NABF), the [[Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation]] (OPBF), the EBU and the [[Africa]]n Boxing Council (ABC).\n\nAlthough rivals, the WBC's relationship with other sanctioning bodies has improved over time and there have even been talks of unification with the WBA. Unification bouts between WBC and other organizations' champions are becoming more common in recent years. Throughout its history, the WBC has allowed some of its organization's champions to fight unification fights with champions of other organizations, although there were times it stepped in to prevent such fights. For many years, it also prevented its champions from holding the WBO belt. When a WBO-recognized champion wished to fight for a WBC championship, he had to abandon his WBO title first, without any special considerations. This, however, is no longer the case.\n\nIn 1983, following the death of [[Kim Duk-koo]] from injuries sustained in a 14-round fight against [[Ray Mancini]], the WBC took the unprecedented step of reducing the distance of its world championship bouts, from 15 rounds to 12\u2014a move other organizations soon followed (for boxers' safety).\n\nAmong those to have been recognized by the WBC as world champions are the undefeated and undisputed champion [[Terence Crawford]], [[Joe Calzaghe]], [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], [[Roy Jones Jr.]], [[Wilfred Ben\u00edtez]], [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], [[Thomas Hearns]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez]], [[H\u00e9ctor Camacho]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]], [[Rodrigo Valdez]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Juan Laporte]], [[F\u00e9lix Trinidad]], [[Edwin Rosario]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Alexis Arg\u00fcello]], [[Nigel Benn]], [[Lennox Lewis]], [[Vitali Klitschko]], [[\u00c9rik Morales]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Canelo \u00c1lvarez]], [[Tony Bellew]] and [[Mairis Briedis]].\n\nAt its discretion, the WBC may designate and recognize, upon a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] vote of its Board of Governors, one or more emeritus world champions in each weight class. Such a recognition is for life and is only bestowed upon present or past WBC world champions. The following boxers have earned the \"Emeritus Championship\" appellation throughout their careers: Lennox Lewis, Vitali Klitschko, Roy Jones Jr., Bernard Hopkins (Honorary Champion), [[Mikkel Kessler]], [[Sergio Mart\u00ednez (boxer)|Sergio Mart\u00ednez]], Floyd Mayweather Jr., [[Kostya Tszyu]], Manny Pacquiao, [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], \u00c9rik Morales, [[Toshiaki Nishioka]], [[Vic Darchinyan]], [[Edgar Sosa (boxer)|\u00c9dgar Sosa]] and Tony Bellew. During the WBC's 51st Convention in [[Bangkok]], Thailand, Floyd Mayweather Jr. was named \"Supreme Champion\", a designation that nobody before him has ever achieved.\n\nThe WBC bolstered the legitimacy of women's boxing by recognizing fighters such as [[Christy Martin (boxer)|Christy Martin]] and [[Lucia Rijker]] as contenders for female world titles in 16 weight divisions. The first WBC World Female Champion (on 30 May 2005) was the [[super bantamweight]] [[Jackie Nava]] from Mexico. With her former-champion father at ringside, [[Laila Ali]] won the [[super middleweight]] title on 11 June 2005.\n\n===Silver Championship===\nIn 2010, the WBC created a \"Silver Championship\", intended as a replacement for [[interim title]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxingscene.com/wbc-replace-interim-titles-with-silver-titles--26323 |title=WBC May Replace Interim-Titles with 'Silver Titles' |publisher=boxingscene.com}}</ref> [[Justin Savi]] was the first boxer to win a Silver title after defeating [[Cyril Thomas]] on 16 April 2010. Unlike its interim predecessor, a boxer holding the Silver title cannot automatically inherit a full world title vacated by the champion. The WBC continues to recognize interim and Silver Champions, as well as interim Silver Champions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/concepcion-narvaez-will-meet-for-interim-wbc-silver-belt-in-panama-207498|title=Concepcion-Narvaez will meet for interim WBC silver belt in Panama|work=Boxing News}}</ref> A year later, the WBC introduced Silver versions to its International titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/allotey-wins-wbc-international-silver-belt-104967|title=Allotey wins WBC International Silver belt|work=Boxing News}}</ref> As of 2020, there are Silver titles of the female world title, Youth World title, USNBC title, Latino title and also FECARBOX title.\n\n===Diamond Championship===\nIn September 2009, the WBC created its new \"Diamond Championship\" belt. This belt was created as an honorary championship exclusively to award the winner of a historic fight between two high-profile and elite boxers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightnews.com/?p=22319|title=WBC Diamond Belt Presentation|publisher=Fightnews|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>  The inaugural Diamond belt was awarded on 14 November 2009 to Manny Pacquiao, who won his 7th world title (in five different divisions) via a 12th-round technical knockout (TKO) over Miguel Cotto at [[welterweight]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], United States. Other holders of this title have included Mairis Briedis ([[Cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]]), Bernard Hopkins ([[light heavyweight]]), [[Callum Smith]] (super middleweight), Sergio Mart\u00ednez and Canelo \u00c1lvarez ([[middleweight]]), Floyd Mayweather Jr. ([[Light middleweight|super welterweight]]), [[Errol Spence Jr.]] (welterweight), [[Regis Prograis]] and [[Josh Taylor (boxer)|Josh Taylor]] ([[Light welterweight|super lightweight]]), [[Nonito Donaire]] (super bantamweight and [[bantamweight]]), [[L\u00e9o Santa Cruz]] ([[featherweight]]), [[Jean Pascal]] and [[Sergey Kovalev (boxer)|Sergey Kovalev]] (light heavyweight), [[Mikey Garcia]] (welterweight and super lightweight) and [[Jorge Linares]] ([[lightweight]]). Female Diamond champions have included [[Claressa Shields]] (middleweight), [[Amanda Serrano]] (super bantamweight), [[Ana Mar\u00eda Torres]] (bantamweight), Raja Amasheh ([[super flyweight]]), [[Ava Knight]] and Jessica Ch\u00e1vez ([[flyweight]]). Although this title can be defended, it is not a mandatory requirement. The title can also be vacated in the case of a fighter's long-term absence or retirement from boxing.\n\n===Eternal Championship===\nThe WBC Eternal Championship is an honorary title awarded to dominant champions that have never lost a world title and retired undefeated while having a solid number of successful title defenses. [[Jiselle Salandy]] was awarded the Eternal title as she defended the [[List of WBC female world champions#Super welterweight|WBC female super welterweight title]] five times before her death on 4 January 2009. On 12 December 2016, Vitali Klitschko was recognized as \"Eternal Champion\", as he had 10 successful [[List of WBC world champions#Heavyweight|WBC heavyweight title]] defenses during his career before his retirement in 2013 and was never knocked down throughout his career either.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn early 1998, [[Roy Jones Jr.]] announced that he was relinquishing his WBC light heavyweight title. In response, the WBC ordered a bout between [[Graciano Rocchigiani]] from Germany and the former champion [[Michael Nunn]] to fill the vacancy, sanctioning it as a world championship match. On 21 March 1998, Rocchigiani won the fight and a WBC belt; in the subsequent WBC rankings, he was listed as \"Light Heavyweight World Champion\".\n\nJones, however, had a change of heart and asked if the WBC would reinstate him as the champion. In a move that violated nearly a dozen of its own regulations, the WBC granted the reinstatement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Rocchigiani received a letter from the WBC advising that the publication of his name as champion was a typographical error and he had never been the official title holder.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nRocchigiani immediately filed a lawsuit against the WBC in a [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal court]], claiming that the organization's actions were both contrary to their own rules and injurious to his earning potential (due to diminished professional stature). On 7 May 2003, the judge ruled in Rocchigiani's favor, awarding him $30 million (U.S.) in damages and reinstating him as a former WBC champion (Rocchigiani had lost a bout since his WBC title match).\n\nThe following day, the WBC sought protection by filing for Chapter 11 [[bankruptcy]] (i.e., corporate debt restructuring) in Puerto Rico.  The organization spent the next 13 months trying to negotiate a 6-figure settlement with Rocchigiani, but the fighter at first rejected the proposal.\n\nOn 11 June 2004, the WBC announced it would enter Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation (i.e., business closing and total asset sell-off) proceedings, effectively threatening its existence.  This action prompted some in the boxing community to plead with Rocchigiani to settle the dispute, which he did in mid-July 2004. \n\n===Don King===\nMany in the boxing community have accused the WBC of bending its rules to suit the powerful boxing promoter [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]]. The journalist [[Jack Newfield]] wrote, \"...[WBC President Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n] became more King's junior partner than his independent regulator\".<ref name=Newfield>{{cite book|last=Newfield|first=Jack|title=Only In America|publisher=William & Morrow Co.|year=1995|location=New York, New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/onlyinamericalif00newf/page/141 141]|isbn=0-688-10123-2|url=https://archive.org/details/onlyinamericalif00newf/page/141}}</ref> Another journalist, Peter Heller, echoes that comment: \"Sulaim\u00e1n...became little more than an errand boy for Don King\".<ref name=Heller/> Heller quotes [[British people|British]] promoter [[Mickey Duff]] as saying, \"My complaint is that Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n is not happy his friend Don King is the biggest promoter in boxing.  Sulaim\u00e1n will only be happy when Don King is the ''only'' promoter in boxing.\"<ref name=Heller>{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Peter|title=Bad Intentions: The Mike Tyson Story|publisher=New American Library|year=1988|location=New York, New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/onlyinamericalif00newf/page/143 143]|isbn=0-688-10123-2|url=https://archive.org/details/onlyinamericalif00newf/page/143}}</ref>\n\nNewfield and Heller take issue with the following actions of the WBC:\n* When [[Leon Spinks]] won the WBA and WBC Heavyweight Championships from Muhammad Ali in 1978, the WBC stripped Leon Spinks of his title. Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n said the WBC did so because Spinks was signed for a rematch with Ali instead of fighting a Don King fighter, [[Ken Norton]]. Norton defended the WBC title against another Don King fighter, [[Larry Holmes]], who won the belt.<ref name=Newfield/>\n* In 1983, WBC Super Featherweight Champion [[Bobby Chacon]] was signed to fight [[Cornelius Boza-Edwards]], the WBC's [[mandatory challenger]] for his title. But, the promoter Don King wanted his fighter, H\u00e9ctor Camacho, to fight for the title. Although WBC rules said the mandatory challenger should receive a shot at the title, the WBC withdrew its sanction from the fight. It stripped Chacon of his title for refusing to fight Camacho.<ref name=Heller/>\n* Under WBC rules, a fighter is supposed to defend his title against a mandatory challenger at least once a year. For fighters controlled by Don King, this rule is often ignored. For instance, Alexis Arg\u00fcello and [[Carlos Z\u00e1rate Serna|Carlos Z\u00e1rate]] were allowed to ignore their obligations as WBC champions to their mandatory contenders.<ref name=Newfield/>\n* When WBC Super Featherweight Champion Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez wanted to fight top contender [[Roger Mayweather]] for a promoter other than Don King, the WBC withheld its sanction of the fight until Don King became promoter.<ref name=Newfield/>\n* When Mike Tyson lost to [[James Douglas (boxer)|James \"Buster\" Douglas]] during an IBF, WBC and WBA Heavyweight Championship defense, King convinced the WBC (along with the WBA) to withhold recognition of Douglas as heavyweight champion. King claimed that Tyson had won the fight by knocking Douglas down, after which the referee gave Douglas a \"[[long count]]\".<ref name=Newfield/> The referee, [[Octavio Meyran]], claims in an [[affidavit]] that King threatened to have the WBC withhold payment of his hotel bill if he did not support King's protest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sugar|first=Bert|title=In This Corner|journal= Boxing Illustrated|volume=32| issue =  8|page=4|date=October 1990|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Because of intense public pressure, both the WBA and WBC backed down and recognized Douglas as champion.\n* In 1992, the WBC threatened to strip [[Evander Holyfield]] of his title for defending it against [[Riddick Bowe]] instead of [[Donovan Ruddock|Razor Ruddock]]. Holyfield obtained a court order to stop the organization. In a taped deposition for the [[United States Senate]] Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Holyfield said that the WBC wanted him to defend his championship against Ruddock because Ruddock was managed by King.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heaney|first=John|title=The Senate Investigation: Much Ado About Nothing|journal= Boxing Illustrated|volume=35|issue=10|page=38|date=December 1992|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n* During the 1990s, the WBC did not allow its champions to engage in unification bouts with WBO champions. However, in 1993, the super middleweight showdown between WBC champion Nigel Benn and WBO champion [[Chris Eubank]], promoted by Don King, was recognized as a title unification fight by the WBC. The bout ended in a draw and each retained their respective titles.<ref>[[Nigel Benn vs. Chris Eubank]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2017}}\n* When Mike Tyson was released from prison in 1995, the WBC installed him as their #1 contender for their heavyweight championship.  Tyson had not fought in four years, but was promoted by Don King.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.secondsout.com/uk-boxing-news/uk-boxing-news/lewis-v-tyson-fallout-could-destroy-wbc |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019215824/http://www.secondsout.com/uk-boxing-news/uk-boxing-news/lewis-v-tyson-fallout-could-destroy-wbc |archive-date=2017-10-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* In 1993, Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, managed and promoted by Don King, received a majority draw against [[Pernell Whitaker]] in their WBC welterweight title fight in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. Virtually every ringside observer and boxing analyst had Whitaker winning at least 8 or 9 rounds of the 12-round fight and [[CompuBox]] statistics showed Whitaker outlanding Ch\u00e1vez by a wide margin. But two of the three judges had the fight scored even. The fight was promoted by King and two of the judges were not appointed by the state's boxing commission (in this case, Texas) like any other time; instead, they were appointed by the WBC. It had been reported that Don King had a hand in helping to secure the WBC judges for the fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1009908/index.htm |title=Oscar Time : It wasn't an award-winning performance, but Oscar De La Hoya took Pernell Whitaker's welterweight title|accessdate=28 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029212426/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1009908/index.htm |archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref> To this day, the resulting draw is considered one of the most controversial decisions ever.\n* In 2000, Ch\u00e1vez, still promoted by King, was made the mandatory challenger for Kostya Tszyu's WBC super lightweight title. Ch\u00e1vez did not appear to satisfy requirements for a mandatory challenger: he had not fought at super lightweight for two years, had recently lost to journeyman boxer [[Willy Wise]] and had not beaten a top contender since losing to [[Oscar De La Hoya]] for the first time in 1996.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* In 2005, the WBC stripped [[Javier Castillejo]] of his super welterweight title for fighting [[Fernando Vargas]] instead of [[Ricardo Mayorga]], a fighter promoted by Don King. The WBC qualified Mayorga for a shot at the super welterweight title although he had never fought at that weight limit and had lost two of his last three fights.{{citation needed|date=November

'''World Boxing Council ''' ('''WBC''') is one of four major organizations which sanctions [[professional boxing]] bouts, alongside the [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA), [[International Boxing Federation]] (IBF) and [[World Boxing Organization]] (WBO). Many historically high-profile bouts have been sanctioned by the organization with various legendary fighters having been recognised as WBC world champions. All four organizations recognise the legitimacy of each other and each have interwoven histories dating back several decades.\n\n==History==\nThe WBC was initially established by 11 countries: the United States, Puerto Rico, Argentina, United Kingdom, France, Mexico, the Philippines, Panama, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and Brazil. Representatives met in [[Mexico City]] on 14 February 1963, upon invitation of [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]], then [[President of Mexico]], to form an international organization to unify all commissions of the world to control the expansion of boxing.\n\nThe groups that historically had recognized several boxers as champions included the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] (NYSAC), the [[National Boxing Association]] (NBA) of the United States, the [[European Boxing Union]] (EBU) and the [[British Boxing Board of Control]] (BBBC); but for the most part, these groups lacked the all-encompassing 'international' status they claimed.{{Citation needed|reason=\"All-encompassing 'international' status\" needs to be defined clearly because it means a lot of nations from around the world, a claim that is not found in the next source.|date=April 2015}}\n\nToday, it has 161 member countries. The current WBC President is Mauricio Sulaim\u00e1n. Former Presidents include [[Luis Spota]] and Ramon G. Vel\u00e1zquez of Mexico, Justiniano N. Montano Jr. of the Philippines and [[Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n]] of Mexico from 1975 until his death in 2014.\n\n===Championship===\nThe WBC's green championship belt portrays the flags of all of the 161 member countries of the organization. All WBC world title belts look identical regardless of weight class; however, there are minor variations on the design for secondary and regionally themed titles within the same weight class.\n\nThe WBC has nine regional governing bodies affiliated with it, such as the [[North American Boxing Federation]] (NABF), the [[Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation]] (OPBF), the EBU and the [[Africa]]n Boxing Council (ABC).\n\nAlthough rivals, the WBC's relationship with other sanctioning bodies has improved over time and there have even been talks of unification with the WBA. Unification bouts between WBC and other organizations' champions are becoming more common in recent years. Throughout its history, the WBC has allowed some of its organization's champions to fight unification fights with champions of other organizations, although there were times it stepped in to prevent such fights. For many years, it also prevented its champions from holding the WBO belt. When a WBO-recognized champion wished to fight for a WBC championship, he had to abandon his WBO title first, without any special considerations. This, however, is no longer the case.\n\nIn 1983, following the death of [[Kim Duk-koo]] from injuries sustained in a 14-round fight against [[Ray Mancini]], the WBC took the unprecedented step of reducing the distance of its world championship bouts, from 15 rounds to 12\u2014a move other organizations soon followed (for boxers' safety).\n\nAmong those to have been recognized by the WBC as world champions are the undefeated and undisputed champion [[Terence Crawford]], [[Joe Calzaghe]], [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], [[Roy Jones Jr.]], [[Wilfred Ben\u00edtez]], [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], [[Thomas Hearns]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez]], [[H\u00e9ctor Camacho]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]], [[Rodrigo Valdez]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Juan Laporte]], [[F\u00e9lix Trinidad]], [[Edwin Rosario]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Alexis Arg\u00fcello]], [[Nigel Benn]], [[Lennox Lewis]], [[Vitali Klitschko]], [[\u00c9rik Morales]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Canelo \u00c1lvarez]], [[Tony Bellew]] and [[Mairis Briedis]].\n\nAt its discretion, the WBC may designate and recognize, upon a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] vote of its Board of Governors, one or more emeritus world champions in each weight class. Such a recognition is for life and is only bestowed upon present or past WBC world champions. The following boxers have earned the \"Emeritus Championship\" appellation throughout their careers: Lennox Lewis, Vitali Klitschko, Roy Jones Jr., Bernard Hopkins (Honorary Champion), [[Mikkel Kessler]], [[Sergio Mart\u00ednez (boxer)|Sergio Mart\u00ednez]], Floyd Mayweather Jr., [[Kostya Tszyu]], Manny Pacquiao, [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], \u00c9rik Morales, [[Toshiaki Nishioka]], [[Vic Darchinyan]], [[Edgar Sosa (boxer)|\u00c9dgar Sosa]] and Tony Bellew. During the WBC's 51st Convention in [[Bangkok]], Thailand, Floyd Mayweather Jr. was named \"Supreme Champion\", a designation that nobody before him has ever achieved.\n\nThe WBC bolstered the legitimacy of women's boxing by recognizing fighters such as [[Christy Martin (boxer)|Christy Martin]] and [[Lucia Rijker]] as contenders for female world titles in 16 weight divisions. The first WBC World Female Champion (on 30 May 2005) was the [[super bantamweight]] [[Jackie Nava]] from Mexico. With her former-champion father at ringside, [[Laila Ali]] won the [[super middleweight]] title on 11 June 2005.\n\n===Silver Championship===\nIn 2010, the WBC created a \"Silver Championship\", intended as a replacement for [[interim title]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxingscene.com/wbc-replace-interim-titles-with-silver-titles--26323 |title=WBC May Replace Interim-Titles with 'Silver Titles' |publisher=boxingscene.com}}</ref> [[Justin Savi]] was the first boxer to win a Silver title after defeating [[Cyril Thomas]] on 16 April 2010. Unlike its interim predecessor, a boxer holding the Silver title cannot automatically inherit a full world title vacated by the champion. The WBC continues to recognize interim and Silver Champions, as well as interim Silver Champions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/concepcion-narvaez-will-meet-for-interim-wbc-silver-belt-in-panama-207498|title=Concepcion-Narvaez will meet for interim WBC silver belt in Panama|work=Boxing News}}</ref> A year later, the WBC introduced Silver versions to its International titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/allotey-wins-wbc-international-silver-belt-104967|title=Allotey wins WBC International Silver belt|work=Boxing News}}</ref> As of 2020, there are Silver titles of the female world title, Youth World title, USNBC title, Latino title and also FECARBOX title.\n\n===Diamond Championship===\nIn September 2009, the WBC created its new \"Diamond Championship\" belt. This belt was created as an honorary championship exclusively to award the winner of a historic fight between two high-profile and elite boxers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightnews.com/?p=22319|title=WBC Diamond Belt Presentation|publisher=Fightnews|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>  The inaugural Diamond belt was awarded on 14 November 2009 to Manny Pacquiao, who won his 7th world title (in five different divisions) via a 12th-round technical knockout (TKO) over Miguel Cotto at [[welterweight]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], United States. Other holders of this title have included Mairis Briedis ([[Cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]]), Bernard Hopkins ([[light heavyweight]]), [[Callum Smith]] (super middleweight), Sergio Mart\u00ednez and Canelo \u00c1lvarez ([[middleweight]]), Floyd Mayweather Jr. ([[Light middleweight|super welterweight]]), [[Errol Spence Jr.]] (welterweight), [[Regis Prograis]] and [[Josh Taylor (boxer)|Josh Taylor]] ([[Light welterweight|super lightweight]]), [[Nonito Donaire]] (super bantamweight and [[bantamweight]]), [[L\u00e9o Santa Cruz]] ([[featherweight]]), [[Jean Pascal]] and [[Sergey Kovalev (boxer)|Sergey Kovalev]] (light heavyweight), [[Mikey Garcia]] (welterweight and super lightweight) and [[Jorge Linares]] ([[lightweight]]). Female Diamond champions have included [[Claressa Shields]] (middleweight), [[Amanda Serrano]] (super bantamweight), [[Ana Mar\u00eda Torres]] (bantamweight), Raja Amasheh ([[super flyweight]]), [[Ava Knight]] and Jessica Ch\u00e1vez ([[flyweight]]). Although this title can be defended, it is not a mandatory requirement. The title can also be vacated in the case of a fighter's long-term absence or retirement from boxing.\n\n===Eternal Championship===\nThe WBC Eternal Championship is an honorary title awarded to dominant champions that have never lost a world title and retired undefeated while having a solid number of successful title defenses. [[Jiselle Salandy]] was awarded the Eternal title as she defended the [[List of WBC female world champions#Super welterweight|WBC female super welterweight title]] five times before her death on 4 January 2009. On 12 December 2016, Vitali Klitschko was recognized as \"Eternal Champion\", as he had 10 successful [[List of WBC world champions#Heavyweight|WBC heavyweight title]] defenses during his career before his retirement in 2013 and was never knocked down throughout his career either.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn early 1998, [[Roy Jones Jr.]] announced that he was relinquishing his WBC light heavyweight title. In response, the WBC ordered a bout between [[Graciano Rocchigiani]] from Germany and the former champion [[Michael Nunn]] to fill the vacancy, sanctioning it as a world championship match. On 21 March 1998, Rocchigiani won the fight and a WBC belt; in the subsequent WBC rankings, he was listed as \"Light Heavyweight World Champion\".\n\nJones, however, had a change of heart and asked if the WBC would reinstate him as the champion. In a move that violated nearly a dozen of its own regulations, the WBC granted the reinstatement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Rocchigiani received a letter from the WBC advising that the publication of his name as champion was a typographical error and he had never been the official title holder.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nRocchigiani immediately filed a lawsuit against the WBC in a [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal court]], claiming that the organization's actions were both contrary to their own rules and injurious to his earning potential (due to diminished professional stature). On 7 May 2003, the judge ruled in Rocchigiani's favor, awarding him $30 million (U.S.) in damages and reinstating him as a former WBC champion (Rocchigiani had lost a bout since his WBC title match).\n\nThe following day, the WBC sought protection by filing for Chapter 11 [[bankruptcy]] (i.e., corporate debt restructuring) in Puerto Rico.  The organization spent the next 13 months trying to negotiate a 6-figure settlement with Rocchigiani, but the fighter at first rejected the proposal.\n\nOn 11 June 2004, the WBC announced it would enter Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation (i.e., business closing and total asset sell-off) proceedings, effectively threatening its existence.  This action prompted some in the boxing community to plead with Rocchigiani to settle the dispute, which he did in mid-July 2004. \n\n===Don King===\nMany in the boxing community have accused the WBC of bending its rules to suit the powerful boxing promoter [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]]. The journalist [[Jack Newfield]] wrote, \"...[WBC President Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n] became more King's junior partner than his independent regulator\".<ref name=Newfield>{{cite book|last=Newfield|first=Jack|title=Only In America|publisher=William & Morrow Co.|year=1995|location=New York, New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/onlyinamericalif00newf/page/141 141]|isbn=0-688-10123-2|url=https://archive.org/details/onlyinamericalif00newf/page/141}}</ref> Another journalist, Peter Heller, echoes that comment: \"Sulaim\u00e1n...became little more than an errand boy for Don King\".<ref name=Heller/> Heller quotes [[British people|British]] promoter [[Mickey Duff]] as saying, \"My complaint is that Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n is not happy his friend Don King is the biggest promoter in boxing.  Sulaim\u00e1n will only be happy when Don King is the ''only'' promoter in boxing.\"<ref name=Heller>{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Peter|title=Bad Intentions: The Mike Tyson Story|publisher=New American Library|year=1988|location=New York, New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/onlyinamericalif00newf/page/143 143]|isbn=0-688-10123-2|url=https://archive.org/details/onlyinamericalif00newf/page/143}}</ref>\n\nNewfield and Heller take issue with the following actions of the WBC:\n* When [[Leon Spinks]] won the WBA and WBC Heavyweight Championships from Muhammad Ali in 1978, the WBC stripped Leon Spinks of his title. Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n said the WBC did so because Spinks was signed for a rematch with Ali instead of fighting a Don King fighter, [[Ken Norton]]. Norton defended the WBC title against another Don King fighter, [[Larry Holmes]], who won the belt.<ref name=Newfield/>\n* In 1983, WBC Super Featherweight Champion [[Bobby Chacon]] was signed to fight [[Cornelius Boza-Edwards]], the WBC's [[mandatory challenger]] for his title. But, the promoter Don King wanted his fighter, H\u00e9ctor Camacho, to fight for the title. Although WBC rules said the mandatory challenger should receive a shot at the title, the WBC withdrew its sanction from the fight. It stripped Chacon of his title for refusing to fight Camacho.<ref name=Heller/>\n* Under WBC rules, a fighter is supposed to defend his title against a mandatory challenger at least once a year. For fighters controlled by Don King, this rule is often ignored. For instance, Alexis Arg\u00fcello and [[Carlos Z\u00e1rate Serna|Carlos Z\u00e1rate]] were allowed to ignore their obligations as WBC champions to their mandatory contenders.<ref name=Newfield/>\n* When WBC Super Featherweight Champion Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez wanted to fight top contender [[Roger Mayweather]] for a promoter other than Don King, the WBC withheld its sanction of the fight until Don King became promoter.<ref name=Newfield/>\n* When Mike Tyson lost to [[James Douglas (boxer)|James \"Buster\" Douglas]] during an IBF, WBC and WBA Heavyweight Championship defense, King convinced the WBC (along with the WBA) to withhold recognition of Douglas as heavyweight champion. King claimed that Tyson had won the fight by knocking Douglas down, after which the referee gave Douglas a \"[[long count]]\".<ref name=Newfield/> The referee, [[Octavio Meyran]], claims in an [[affidavit]] that King threatened to have the WBC withhold payment of his hotel bill if he did not support King's protest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sugar|first=Bert|title=In This Corner|journal= Boxing Illustrated|volume=32| issue =  8|page=4|date=October 1990|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Because of intense public pressure, both the WBA and WBC backed down and recognized Douglas as champion.\n* In 1992, the WBC threatened to strip [[Evander Holyfield]] of his title for defending it against [[Riddick Bowe]] instead of [[Donovan Ruddock|Razor Ruddock]]. Holyfield obtained a court order to stop the organization. In a taped deposition for the [[United States Senate]] Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Holyfield said that the WBC wanted him to defend his championship against Ruddock because Ruddock was managed by King.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heaney|first=John|title=The Senate Investigation: Much Ado About Nothing|journal= Boxing Illustrated|volume=35|issue=10|page=38|date=December 1992|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n* During the 1990s, the WBC did not allow its champions to engage in unification bouts with WBO champions. However, in 1993, the super middleweight showdown between WBC champion Nigel Benn and WBO champion [[Chris Eubank]], promoted by Don King, was recognized as a title unification fight by the WBC. The bout ended in a draw and each retained their respective titles.<ref>[[Nigel Benn vs. Chris Eubank]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2017}}\n* When Mike Tyson was released from prison in 1995, the WBC installed him as their #1 contender for their heavyweight championship.  Tyson had not fought in four years, but was promoted by Don King.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.secondsout.com/uk-boxing-news/uk-boxing-news/lewis-v-tyson-fallout-could-destroy-wbc |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019215824/http://www.secondsout.com/uk-boxing-news/uk-boxing-news/lewis-v-tyson-fallout-could-destroy-wbc |archive-date=2017-10-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* In 1993, Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, managed and promoted by Don King, received a majority draw against [[Pernell Whitaker]] in their WBC welterweight title fight in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. Virtually every ringside observer and boxing analyst had Whitaker winning at least 8 or 9 rounds of the 12-round fight and [[CompuBox]] statistics showed Whitaker outlanding Ch\u00e1vez by a wide margin. But two of the three judges had the fight scored even. The fight was promoted by King and two of the judges were not appointed by the state's boxing commission (in this case, Texas) like any other time; instead, they were appointed by the WBC. It had been reported that Don King had a hand in helping to secure the WBC judges for the fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1009908/index.htm |title=Oscar Time : It wasn't an award-winning performance, but Oscar De La Hoya took Pernell Whitaker's welterweight title|accessdate=28 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029212426/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1009908/index.htm |archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref> To this day, the resulting draw is considered one of the most controversial decisions ever.\n* In 2000, Ch\u00e1vez, still promoted by King, was made the mandatory challenger for Kostya Tszyu's WBC super lightweight title. Ch\u00e1vez did not appear to satisfy requirements for a mandatory challenger: he had not fought at super lightweight for two years, had recently lost to journeyman boxer [[Willy Wise]] and had not beaten a top contender since losing to [[Oscar De La Hoya]] for the first time in 1996.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* In 2005, the WBC stripped [[Javier Castillejo]] of his super welterweight title for fighting [[Fernando Vargas]] instead of [[Ricardo Mayorga]], a fighter promoted by Don King. The WBC qualified Mayorga for a shot at the super welterweight title although he had never fought at that weight limit and had lost two of his last three fights.{{citation needed|date=November

It has a diameter of 70&nbsp;cm and a wingspan of 1.7&nbsp;m.<ref name=\"rian\"/> It can gain a speed of Mach 2.8, and has a maximum range of 450&nbsp;km.[https://www.magzter.com/article/News/Geopolitics/Brahmos-Displays-Its-450-Km-Reach]{{ref|https://www.magzter.com/article/News/Geopolitics/Brahmos-Displays-Its-450-Km-Reach}} The ship-launched and land-based missiles can carry a 200&nbsp;kg [[warhead]], whereas the aircraft-launched variant (BrahMos A) can carry a 300&nbsp;kg warhead. It has a two-stage propulsion system, with a solid-propellant rocket for initial acceleration and a liquid-fuelled [[ramjet]] responsible for sustained supersonic cruise. Air-breathing ramjet propulsion is much more fuel-efficient than rocket propulsion, giving the BrahMos a longer range than a pure rocket-powered missile would achieve.<ref name=pru20a />\n\nThe high speed of the BrahMos likely gives it better target-penetration characteristics than lighter subsonic cruise-missiles, such as the [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]]. Being twice as heavy and almost four times as fast as the Tomahawk, the BrahMos has more than 32 times the on-cruise [[kinetic energy]] of a Tomahawk missile, although it carries only 3/5 the payload and a fraction of the range, which suggests that the missile was designed with a different tactical role. Its 2.8 mach speed means that it cannot be intercepted by some existing [[Missile Defense System|missile defence systems]] and its precision makes it lethal to water targets.<ref name=pru20a>{{cite news|title=India places two-billion-dollar order for Russian missiles|url=http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/20-08-2008/106153-russian_missiles-0/|accessdate=7 February 2013|newspaper=Pravda|date=20 August 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508040155/http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/20-08-2008/106153-russian_missiles-0/|archivedate=8 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlthough BrahMos was primarily an [[anti-ship missile]], the BrahMos Block III can also engage land-based targets.

It has a diameter of 70&nbsp;cm and a wingspan of 1.7&nbsp;m.<ref name=\"rian\"/> It can gain a speed of Mach 2.8, and has a maximum range of 450&nbsp;km.[https://www.magzter.com/article/News/Geopolitics/Brahmos-Displays-Its-450-Km-Reach]{{ref|https://www.magzter.com/article/News/Geopolitics/Brahmos-Displays-Its-450-Km-Reach}} The ship-launched and land-based missiles can carry a 200&nbsp;kg [[warhead]], whereas the aircraft-launched variant (BrahMos A) can carry a 300&nbsp;kg warhead. It has a two-stage propulsion system, with a solid-propellant rocket for initial acceleration and a liquid-fuelled [[ramjet]] responsible for sustained supersonic cruise. Air-breathing ramjet propulsion is much more fuel-efficient than rocket propulsion, giving the BrahMos a longer range than a pure rocket-powered missile would achieve.<ref name=pru20a />\n\nThe high speed of the BrahMos likely gives it better target-penetration characteristics than lighter subsonic cruise-missiles, such as the [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]]. Being twice as heavy and almost four times as fast as the Tomahawk, the BrahMos has more than 32 times the on-cruise [[kinetic energy]] of a Tomahawk missile, although it carries only 3/5 the payload and a fraction of the range, which suggests that the missile was designed with a different tactical role. Its 2.8 mach speed means that it cannot be intercepted by some existing [[Missile Defense System|missile defence systems]] and its precision makes it lethal to water targets.<ref name=pru20a>{{cite news|title=India places two-billion-dollar order for Russian missiles|url=http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/20-08-2008/106153-russian_missiles-0/|accessdate=7 February 2013|newspaper=Pravda|date=20 August 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508040155/http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/20-08-2008/106153-russian_missiles-0/|archivedate=8 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlthough BrahMos was primarily an [[anti-ship missile]], the BrahMos Block III can also engage land-based targets.
