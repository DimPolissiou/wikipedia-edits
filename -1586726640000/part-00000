It occurred between March 1813 and January 1814 on Malta and between February and May 1814 on Gozo, and the epidemic was officially declared to be over in September 1814. It resulted in approximately 4500 deaths, which was about 5% of the islands' population.\n\nThe plague outbreak had [[1812\u20131819 Ottoman plague epidemic|begun]] in [[Constantinople]] in 1812 and it spread to other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]] including [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]. The disease was imported to Malta from [[Alexandria]] on board the brigantine ''San Nicola'' in late March 1813. Some of its crew members had contracted the disease and died, and although the vessel and crew were quarantined, the disease spread to the local population since infected cargo from the vessel was stolen and sold in [[Valletta]]. The disease appeared in the city in mid-April, and the outbreak was severe by mid-May.\n\nThe British colonial government took strict measures in order to contain the plague, although this was done too late to prevent the outbreak from spreading in its early stages. The urban area around the [[Grand Harbour]] was isolated from the rest of the island, and settlements with high mortality rates were [[Cordon sanitaire|cordoned off]]. Violations of these regulations were met with harsh penalties including [[death penalty|death]], and several people were executed for concealing their infection. The outbreak was particularly severe in the capital Valletta and its suburb [[Floriana]], and in the villages of [[Birkirkara]], [[Qormi]] and [[\u017bebbu\u0121]].\n\nThe epidemic began to subside by late 1813 and it was believed to be over by January 1814. However, the disease was inadvertently introduced to [[Gozo]] through contaminated clothes in February, and another outbreak occurred in the village of [[Xag\u0127ra]].

The ''San Nicola'' (or ''St. Nicholas''), a Maltese [[brigantine]] flying the British flag,<ref name=\"tully-37\">{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=37}}</ref> had left Alexandria on 17 March 1813, and two of its crew members became sick a week after the vessel left port. The vessel arrived in Malta on 28 March, and it was quarantined in [[Marsamxett Harbour]] for two weeks. Health guards were sent to ensure that there was no communication between the ship and the shore.<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/> Two other ships which also arrived in Malta from Alexandria on 28 March, the British brigantine ''Nancy'' and the Spanish [[polacca]] ''Bella Maria'', also had cases of the plague on board. Two crew members from the ''Nancy'' were infected, while one crew member on the ''Bella Maria'' had died of the disease.<ref name=\"tully-37\"/>\n\nThe crew of the ''San Nicola'' were taken to the [[Lazzaretto of Manoel Island|Lazzaretto]] on nearby [[Manoel Island]] on 29 March, after they had taken standard precautions. On 1 April, the ship's captain Antonio Maria Mescara became sick, and a day later so did a servant who had looked after the two infected crew members on board the vessel. Mescara and the servant died on 7 April, and their corpses were examined, confirming suspicions that they died of the plague.

[[Fort Manoel]], which is located adjacent to the Lazzaretto, was converted into a depot where suspected cases of the plague were isolated. By late June 1813, the Lazzaretto had reached its capacity and it became crowded with patients, so no distinction was made between confirmed and suspected cases gathered close together in Fort Manoel. The fort therefore became one of the main focal points of the disease.<ref>{{harvnb|Tully|1821|pp=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\nTemporary hospitals were set up at other locations, including [[Villa Bighi]] in [[Kalkara]] (later the site of a naval hospital) and St Dominic's Convent in [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]].<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/> Huts known as ''barracche'' ({{lang-mt|barrakki}})<ref name=\"qormi23\">{{harvnb|Twitchell-Waas|2011|p=23}}</ref> were built in various locations, mostly as shelters for people evacuated from their homes or as hospitals. Others were used as guard rooms, market stalls and shops, an abattoir, offices (including a post office), stores and privies. The huts became very hot in the summer causing discomfort to their occupants, and on one occasion some of them collapsed in a thunderstorm.<ref name=\"phw1983\"/>\n\nMany ''barracche'' were built in the ditches of fortifications, including the main ditch of the [[Fortifications of Valletta|Valletta land front]], and the [[Floriana Lines]] ditches near Porta Sant'Anna and [[Porte des Bombes]]. Others were also built within Valletta and Floriana and at [[Ta' Xbiex]], Fort Manoel, Bighi, Birkirkara, Qormi, \u017bebbu\u0121 and outside the [[Cottonera Lines]] near Birgu. A temporary hospital consisting of 59 huts was built at [[Santa Venera]] in September 1813.<ref name=\"phw1983\"/>\n\n===Change of governor===\n[[File:Pitzamanos-Maitland.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], Governor from October 1813]]\n\nIn 1813, the British changed Malta's status from a protectorate to a crown colony, and the office of Civil Commissioner was replaced by that of a Governor.

The population was not allowed to go to the countryside or to the ports, and cotton fields were abandoned.<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/> On 10 September, movement from settlements with high mortality rates was restricted, and soldiers surrounded and cordoned off Qormi, \u017bebbu\u0121 and Birkirkara to prevent any inhabitants from leaving. Violations of this restriction were liable to the death penalty.<ref name=\"times2013-10-27\"/>\n\nThe mortality rate had decreased to 196 people in October, and by then the epidemic was on the decline.<ref name=\"correspondence\"/> On 13 November, Maitland ordered houses and shops in Valletta and Floriana to be purified under the supervision of doctors and the police for a period of 15 days. People who had concealed potentially infected objects were pardoned if they revealed their items to the police within 10 days. In December, the number of districts in Valletta was increased to 24, while Floriana was divided into 7 districts.<ref name=\"times2013-10-27\"/>\n\nThe situation had improved greatly by December 1813, and on 7 January 1814 the restrictions on Valletta were lifted. Restrictions on other towns and villages were removed in the following days,<ref>{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=64}}</ref> except in Qormi which remained isolated until early March. The outbreak was said to be over by the end of January.<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/> On 27 January, the ''barracche'' were dismantled and burnt.<ref name=\"phw1983\"/>\n\n==Outbreak in Gozo==\n[[File:Malte, Gozo, Xaghra.JPG|thumb|The [[Basilica of the Nativity of Our Lady, Xag\u0127ra|Xag\u0127ra parish church]], whose construction was delayed due to the epidemic<ref name=\"xaghrahistory\"/>]]\n\nWhile parts of Malta were devastated by the plague, there was no outbreak of the plague on the island of [[Gozo]] in 1813. Communication with mainland Malta was restricted when the outbreak occurred in Valletta, which initially prevented the disease from reaching Gozo. However, when restrictions were lifted upon the end of the epidemic in Malta, an outbreak in Gozo occurred,<ref>{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=71}}</ref> although it was much smaller than the one in Malta.\n\nIt is believed that the disease was imported to the island through infected clothing which had been concealed during the Malta epidemic. Angelo Galea, a Gozitan who was in Qormi at the time out the outbreak, hid a box of clothes (including an [[g\u0127onnella]])<ref name=\"visitgozo\"/> from the authorities and took them with him when he returned to Gozo in late February 1814. He died in his house in [[Xag\u0127ra]] on 22 February 1814, a couple of days after his arrival. Like the first case in Malta, it was not believed that he died of the plague and his funeral was held at the village's [[Basilica of the Nativity of Our Lady, Xag\u0127ra|parish church]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tully|1821|pp=73\u201374}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 February, Galea's daughter Rosa became ill and died soon afterwards at the hospital at [[Victoria, Gozo|Rabat]]. There were fears that the plague had reached Gozo, and within a few days a number of Xag\u0127ra residents died of the disease.<ref name=\"tully75\">{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=75}}</ref> An outbreak of fever was reported on 2 March 1814, and it was confirmed to be plague five days later.<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/>\n\n===Containment measures===\nOn 8 March, Maitland cut off all communication between the islands, and the military was sent to cordon off Xag\u0127ra to prevent the spread of the plague to the rest of Gozo.<ref name=\"tully75\"/> The disease was successfully contained within the village, resulting in Gozo having a much lower death toll than Malta.<ref name=\"tully76\">{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=76}}</ref> On 13 March, Joseph Said wandered out of his house in a state of [[delirium]] after being infected, and he was shot dead by the police.

It occurred between March 1813 and January 1814 on Malta and between February and May 1814 on Gozo, and the epidemic was officially declared to be over in September 1814. It resulted in approximately 4500 deaths, which was about 5% of the islands' population.\n\nThe plague outbreak had [[1812\u20131819 Ottoman plague epidemic|begun]] in [[Constantinople]] in 1812 and it spread to other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]] including [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]. The disease was imported to Malta from [[Alexandria]] on board the brigantine ''San Nicola'' in late March 1813. Some of its crew members had contracted the disease and died, and although the vessel and crew were quarantined, the disease spread to the local population since infected cargo from the vessel was stolen and sold in [[Valletta]]. The disease appeared in the city in mid-April, and the outbreak was severe by mid-May.\n\nThe British colonial government took strict measures in order to contain the plague, although this was done too late to prevent the outbreak from spreading in its early stages. The urban area around the [[Grand Harbour]] was isolated from the rest of the island, and settlements with high mortality rates were [[Cordon sanitaire|cordoned off]]. Violations of these regulations were met with harsh penalties including [[death penalty|death]], and several people were executed for concealing their infection. The outbreak was particularly severe in the capital Valletta and its suburb [[Floriana]], and in the villages of [[Birkirkara]], [[Qormi]] and [[\u017bebbu\u0121]].\n\nThe epidemic began to subside by late 1813 and it was believed to be over by January 1814. However, the disease was inadvertently introduced to [[Gozo]] through contaminated clothes in February, and another outbreak occurred in the village of [[Xag\u0127ra]].

The ''San Nicola'' (or ''St. Nicholas''), a Maltese [[brigantine]] flying the British flag,<ref name=\"tully-37\">{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=37}}</ref> had left Alexandria on 17 March 1813, and two of its crew members became sick a week after the vessel left port. The vessel arrived in Malta on 28 March, and it was quarantined in [[Marsamxett Harbour]] for two weeks. Health guards were sent to ensure that there was no communication between the ship and the shore.<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/> Two other ships which also arrived in Malta from Alexandria on 28 March, the British brigantine ''Nancy'' and the Spanish [[polacca]] ''Bella Maria'', also had cases of the plague on board. Two crew members from the ''Nancy'' were infected, while one crew member on the ''Bella Maria'' had died of the disease.<ref name=\"tully-37\"/>\n\nThe crew of the ''San Nicola'' were taken to the [[Lazzaretto of Manoel Island|Lazzaretto]] on nearby [[Manoel Island]] on 29 March, after they had taken standard precautions. On 1 April, the ship's captain Antonio Maria Mescara became sick, and a day later so did a servant who had looked after the two infected crew members on board the vessel. Mescara and the servant died on 7 April, and their corpses were examined, confirming suspicions that they died of the plague.

[[Fort Manoel]], which is located adjacent to the Lazzaretto, was converted into a depot where suspected cases of the plague were isolated. By late June 1813, the Lazzaretto had reached its capacity and it became crowded with patients, so no distinction was made between confirmed and suspected cases gathered close together in Fort Manoel. The fort therefore became one of the main focal points of the disease.<ref>{{harvnb|Tully|1821|pp=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\nTemporary hospitals were set up at other locations, including [[Villa Bighi]] in [[Kalkara]] (later the site of a naval hospital) and St Dominic's Convent in [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]].<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/> Huts known as ''barracche'' ({{lang-mt|barrakki}})<ref name=\"qormi23\">{{harvnb|Twitchell-Waas|2011|p=23}}</ref> were built in various locations, mostly as shelters for people evacuated from their homes or as hospitals. Others were used as guard rooms, market stalls and shops, an abattoir, offices (including a post office), stores and privies. The huts became very hot in the summer causing discomfort to their occupants, and on one occasion some of them collapsed in a thunderstorm.<ref name=\"phw1983\"/>\n\nMany ''barracche'' were built in the ditches of fortifications, including the main ditch of the [[Fortifications of Valletta|Valletta land front]], and the [[Floriana Lines]] ditches near Porta Sant'Anna and [[Porte des Bombes]]. Others were also built within Valletta and Floriana and at [[Ta' Xbiex]], Fort Manoel, Bighi, Birkirkara, Qormi, \u017bebbu\u0121 and outside the [[Cottonera Lines]] near Birgu. A temporary hospital consisting of 59 huts was built at [[Santa Venera]] in September 1813.<ref name=\"phw1983\"/>\n\n===Change of governor===\n[[File:Pitzamanos-Maitland.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], Governor from October 1813]]\n\nIn 1813, the British changed Malta's status from a protectorate to a crown colony, and the office of Civil Commissioner was replaced by that of a Governor. Oakes was offered the new position, but he declined on the grounds of his own poor health.<ref name=\"times2013-10-27\"/> There have been suggestions that Oakes' resignation was due to the plague outbreak,<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/> but a letter he wrote before the disease broke out already expressed his wishes to resign.<ref name=\"times2013-10-27\"/> The office of Governor was given to Sir [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]], who arrived in the islands on 3 October and assumed office two days later.<ref name=\"times2013-10-27\"/> Maitland took strict actions in order to eliminate the disease.<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/>\n\nRestrictive measures were also imposed in the villages in order to prevent the disease from spreading. The population was not allowed to go to the countryside or to the ports, and cotton fields were abandoned.<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/> On 10 September, movement from settlements with high mortality rates was restricted, and soldiers surrounded and cordoned off Qormi, \u017bebbu\u0121 and Birkirkara to prevent any inhabitants from leaving. Violations of this restriction were liable to the death penalty.<ref name=\"times2013-10-27\"/>\n\nThe mortality rate had decreased to 196 people in October, and by then the epidemic was on the decline.<ref name=\"correspondence\"/> On 13 November, Maitland ordered houses and shops in Valletta and Floriana to be purified under the supervision of doctors and the police for a period of 15 days. People who had concealed potentially infected objects were pardoned if they revealed their items to the police within 10 days. In December, the number of districts in Valletta was increased to 24, while Floriana was divided into 7 districts.<ref name=\"times2013-10-27\"/>\n\nThe situation had improved greatly by December 1813, and on 7 January 1814 the restrictions on Valletta were lifted. Restrictions on other towns and villages were removed in the following days,<ref>{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=64}}</ref> except in Qormi which remained isolated until early March. The outbreak was said to be over by the end of January.<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/> On 27 January, the ''barracche'' were dismantled and burnt.<ref name=\"phw1983\"/>\n\n==Outbreak in Gozo==\n[[File:Malte, Gozo, Xaghra.JPG|thumb|The [[Basilica of the Nativity of Our Lady, Xag\u0127ra|Xag\u0127ra parish church]], whose construction was delayed due to the epidemic<ref name=\"xaghrahistory\"/>]]\n\nWhile parts of Malta were devastated by the plague, there was no outbreak of the plague on the island of [[Gozo]] in 1813. Communication with mainland Malta was restricted when the outbreak occurred in Valletta, which initially prevented the disease from reaching Gozo. However, when restrictions were lifted upon the end of the epidemic in Malta, an outbreak in Gozo occurred,<ref>{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=71}}</ref> although it was much smaller than the one in Malta.\n\nIt is believed that the disease was imported to the island through infected clothing which had been concealed during the Malta epidemic. Angelo Galea, a Gozitan who was in Qormi at the time out the outbreak, hid a box of clothes (including an [[g\u0127onnella]])<ref name=\"visitgozo\"/> from the authorities and took them with him when he returned to Gozo in late February 1814. He died in his house in [[Xag\u0127ra]] on 22 February 1814, a couple of days after his arrival. Like the first case in Malta, it was not believed that he died of the plague and his funeral was held at the village's [[Basilica of the Nativity of Our Lady, Xag\u0127ra|parish church]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tully|1821|pp=73\u201374}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 February, Galea's daughter Rosa became ill and died soon afterwards at the hospital at [[Victoria, Gozo|Rabat]]. There were fears that the plague had reached Gozo, and within a few days a number of Xag\u0127ra residents died of the disease.<ref name=\"tully75\">{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=75}}</ref> An outbreak of fever was reported on 2 March 1814, and it was confirmed to be plague five days later.<ref name=\"times2013-05-19\"/>\n\n===Containment measures===\nOn 8 March, Maitland cut off all communication between the islands, and the military was sent to cordon off Xag\u0127ra to prevent the spread of the plague to the rest of Gozo.<ref name=\"tully75\"/> The disease was successfully contained within the village, resulting in Gozo having a much lower death toll than Malta.<ref name=\"tully76\">{{harvnb|Tully|1821|p=76}}</ref> On 13 March, Joseph Said wandered out of his house in a state of [[delirium]] after being infected, and he was shot dead by the police.
