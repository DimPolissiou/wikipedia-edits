In the fictional universe of ''Breaking Bad'', Los Pollos Hermanos is a [[front organization]] for [[Gus Fring]]'s meth manufacturing and distribution operation. The set used for the restaurant in the show was at a [[Twisters]] branch in [[South Valley, New Mexico]], and Twisters has seen an increase in business attributed to being associated with ''Breaking Bad''. Due to the shows' popularity, Los Pollos Hermanos has also appeared on numerous occasions and locations a real-life [[pop-up restaurant]].\n\n== In-universe history ==\nLos Pollos Hermanos was founded by Chilean nationals [[Gus Fring]] and [[Max Arciniega (Breaking Bad)|Max Arciniega]] in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/breaking-bad-hermanos-1798169493 |title=Breaking Bad: \u201cHermanos\u201d |last=Bowman |first=Donna |date=September 4, 2011 |website=[[The A.V.

Eventually Gus emigrated to the United States and opened branches primarily in [[New Mexico]], and the chain grew to have over a dozen locations throughout the [[American Southwest]]. Los Pollos Hermanos trucks were used to smuggle drugs manufactured by the show's fictional drug cartel across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. The company eventually became a subsidiary of fictional German shipping conglomerate, Madrigal Electromotive GmbH, whose connections Fring used to further increase the outreach of both his legal and illegal operations. After Fring's death at the hands of [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] and [[Hector Salamanca]], the chain was closed, with the flagship restaurant in Albuquerque reverting to Twisters, the same restaurant which is used as the filming set in real-life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.insider.com/netflix-el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-references-breakdown-2019-10 |title=30 details you may have missed in Netflix's 'Breaking Bad' movie |last=Acuna |first=Olivia Singh, Kirsten |date=October 18, 2019 |website=[[Insider (website)|Insider]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200418072122/https://www.insider.com/netflix-el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-references-breakdown-2019-10 |archive-date=April 18, 2020 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Real life history ==\n[[File:Breaking_Bad_Locations_(17351686340).jpg|thumb|left|The Twisters store in Albuquerque used for Los Pollos Hermanos during filming of ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nWhile ''Breaking Bad'' was still on air in 2013, Twisters claims to have received a 10% increase in revenue due to its association with ''Breaking Bad''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2013/02/26/a-breaking-bad-pilgrimage-to-twisters-the-real-los-pollos-hermanos-3515683/ |title=A Breaking Bad pilgrimage to the real Los Pollos Hermanos |last=Hooton |first=Christopher |date=February 26, 2013 |website=Metro |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102123504/https://metro.co.uk/2013/02/26/a-breaking-bad-pilgrimage-to-twisters-the-real-los-pollos-hermanos-3515683/ |archive-date=November 2, 2019 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> In 2014, a [[Cook County, Illinois]] man was arrested and charged with several crimes including the manufacturing of methamphetamine, and wore a Los Pollos Hermanos shirt in his mugshot.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://time.com/10549/breaking-bad-t-shirt-meth-lab-arrest/ |title=Guy Wearing Breaking Bad Shirt Busted for Meth Lab |last=Nicks |first=Denver |date=February 26, 2014 |website=Time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528040029/http://time.com/10549/breaking-bad-t-shirt-meth-lab-arrest/ |archive-date=May 28, 2016 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/02/man-wearing-breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-t-shirt-busted-for-meth-lab |title=Man Wearing 'Breaking Bad' Los Pollos Hermanos T-shirt Busted for Allegedly Running Meth Lab |last=Fields |first=Liz |date=February 26, 2014 |website=ABC News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522151645/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/02/man-wearing-breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-t-shirt-busted-for-meth-lab/ |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> ''Breaking Bad'' creator [[Vince Gilligan]] revealed on a 2015 [[Reddit AMA]] that there were talks at Sony to make Los Pollos Hermanos into a real restaurant.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/a-real-life-los-pollos-hermanos-restaurant-is-in-the-works-with-backing-from-breaking-bad-creator-10219360.html |title=A real life Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant is in the works |date=May 1, 2015 |website=The Independent |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217070831/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/a-real-life-los-pollos-hermanos-restaurant-is-in-the-works-with-backing-from-breaking-bad-creator-10219360.html |archive-date=February 17, 2018 |access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the restaurant's logo was the subject of a lawsuit brought by Humberto Puentes-Segura, the artist who created it, alleging that [[Sony]] infringed on his copyright by selling merchandise emblazoned with the image without permission.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-artist-sues-sony-942720 |title=Artist Behind 'Breaking Bad's' Los Pollos Hermanos Sues Sony |last=Cullins |first=Ashley |date=October 31, 2016 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215111736/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-artist-sues-sony-942720 |archive-date=December 15, 2016 |access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> \"Plaintiff did not, however, grant Defendant Topanga Productions or any other person or entity any ancillary rights in the Artwork, or the right to license, manufacture, distribute, or sell any merchandise bearing any reproduction of any portion of the Artwork, or any derivative works thereof,\" writes attorney Benjamin Feuchter in the complaint.\n\nIn 2017 Los Pollos Hermanos was a [[pop-up restaurant]] that toured several cities.

Brothers''') is a [[fried chicken]] fast food restaurant that originated in the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Better Call Saul]]''. In the fictional universe of ''Breaking Bad'', Los Pollos Hermanos is a [[front organization]] for [[Gus Fring]]'s meth manufacturing and distribution operation. The set used for the restaurant in the show was at a [[Twisters]] branch in [[South Valley, New Mexico]], and Twisters has seen an increase in business attributed to being associated with ''Breaking Bad''. Due to the shows' popularity, Los Pollos Hermanos has also appeared on numerous occasions and locations a real-life [[pop-up restaurant]].\n\n== In-universe history ==\nLos Pollos Hermanos was founded by Chilean nationals [[Gus Fring]] and [[Max Arciniega (Breaking Bad)|Max Arciniega]] in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/breaking-bad-hermanos-1798169493 |title=Breaking Bad: \u201cHermanos\u201d |last=Bowman |first=Donna |date=September 4, 2011 |website=[[The A.V.

Eventually Gus emigrated to the United States and opened branches primarily in [[New Mexico]], and the chain grew to have over a dozen locations throughout the [[American Southwest]]. Los Pollos Hermanos trucks were used to smuggle drugs manufactured by the show's fictional drug cartel across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. The company eventually became a subsidiary of fictional German shipping conglomerate, Madrigal Electromotive GmbH, whose connections Fring used to further increase the outreach of both his legal and illegal operations.
