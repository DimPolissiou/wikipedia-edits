Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of [[ratification]] of the [[United States Constitution]], many of the [[Thirteen Colonies|original colonies]] referred to themselves as states shortly after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the [[Articles of Confederation]], Declaration of Independence, and [[United States Constitution]]. Several of the earliest adopted state [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] and [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] were similar or identical to their [[Historical coats of arms of the U.S. states#State Arms depicted on United States banknotes|colonial counterparts]].\n\n''State Arms of the Union'', illustrated by Henry Mitchell and published by [[Louis Prang]] (known as the father of the lithographic industry), offers historically accurate renderings of the state's coats of arms as they existed in 1876. An accomplished engraver with the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] for 40 years, Mitchell was responsible for engraving several coats of arms for official state use as well as arms for well-known educational and philanthropic organizations. The illustrations are presented alongside proof impressions from the engraved dies used to print the state arms on the first issue of United States [[National Bank Note]]s.\n\nPublished in 1876 by [[Louis Prang]] and illustrated by Henry Mitchell, ''State Arms of the Union'' contains a [[Chromolithography|chromolithographed]] title page depicting the [[Great Seal of the United States]] and seven color plates with 45 state and territorial coats of arms. The book was likely published for the [[Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]].<ref>{{cite web| title = State Arms of the Union | publisher = Antiquarian Booksellers Association  | url = http://www.abaa.org/book/294382231| accessdate = 16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nLouis Prang was born 12 March 1824 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]].

Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of [[ratification]] of the [[United States Constitution]], many of the [[Thirteen Colonies|original colonies]] referred to themselves as states shortly after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the [[Articles of Confederation]], Declaration of Independence, and [[United States Constitution]]. Several of the earliest adopted state [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] and [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] were similar or identical to their [[Historical coats of arms of the U.S. states#State Arms depicted on United States banknotes|colonial counterparts]].\n\n''State Arms of the Union'', illustrated by Henry Mitchell and published by [[Louis Prang]] (known as the father of the lithographic industry), offers historically accurate renderings of the state's coats of arms as they existed in 1876. An accomplished engraver with the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] for 40 years, Mitchell was responsible for engraving several coats of arms for official state use as well as arms for well-known educational and philanthropic organizations. The illustrations are presented alongside proof impressions from the engraved dies used to print the state arms on the first issue of United States [[National Bank Note]]s.\n\nPublished in 1876 by [[Louis Prang]] and illustrated by Henry Mitchell, ''State Arms of the Union'' contains a [[Chromolithography|chromolithographed]] title page depicting the [[Great Seal of the United States]] and seven color plates with 45 state and territorial coats of arms. The book was likely published for the [[Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]].<ref>{{cite web| title = State Arms of the Union | publisher = Antiquarian Booksellers Association  | url = http://www.abaa.org/book/294382231| accessdate = 16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nLouis Prang was born 12 March 1824 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]].

Probably the single most important development, which is first found in the Brahmanas and exerts the most influence over all other factors, is the identification of Vishnu with the [[Yajna|sacrifice]]'.<ref name=\":5\" /> Vishnu is explicitly stated to be sacrifice repeatedly throughout the Shatapatha Brahmana (e.g. SB 1.7.4.20, 1.1.4.9, 3.2.1.38, 3.6.3.3, 5.2.3.6, 5.4.5.1, 5.4.5.18, 11.4.1.4, 12.5.4.11, 14.1.1.13, and 11.4.1.4).\n\n==== Kanda 14, Adhyaya 1, Brahmana 1 ====\nin SB 14.1.1 ('The [[Pravargya]]'), the story given is that 'the gods [[Agni]], [[Indra]], [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], Makha, [[Vishnu]], and the [<nowiki/>[[Visvedevas|Vi]][[Visvedevas|svedevas]]], except the two [[A\u015bvins|Asvins]], performed a [[Yajna|sacrificial session]]', which was first attained by [[Vishnu]], hence 'he became the most excellent of the gods'. ''Upadika'' ants then agreed with the other gods to gnaw at the bowstring of Vishnu while He rested his head on the Bow, in exchange for the boon to 'find water even in the desert' (as 'all food is water'). The ''Gharma'' (hot beverage offered as an oblation)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?q=gharma|title=Sanskrit Dictionary: 'gharma'|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sanskritdictionary.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> is named after the sound of Vishnu's head hitting the ground (which 'on falling became yonder sun'), and 'inasmuch as he [Vishnu] stretched out (''pra-vrig'') on the ground, therefrom the ''[[Pravargya]]'' (took its name)'. The body of Vishnu is encompassed by Indra, who possessed by His glory 'became ''Makhavat'' (possessed of makha)'. Vishnu is then divided into three parts, with Agni receiving the first (morning) portion, Indra the second (midday) portion, and the remaining Visvedevas the third portion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44117.htm|title=Satapatha Brahmana Part V (SBE44): Fourteenth K\u00e2nda: XIV, 1, 1.

The tortoise avatar is also synonymous with [[World Turtle|Akupara]], the 'world-turtle' supporting the Earth, as well as the [[Saptarishi]] sage, [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]]. Accounts from the Shatapatha Brahmana are stated by Varadpande to be the seed of Kurma.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nEggeling adds that the '[[Kapala|kapalas]] [cups used in ritual [[Yajna|sacrifices]]] are usually arranged in such a manner as to produce a fancied resemblance to the (upper) shell of the tortoise, which is a symbol of the sky, as the tortoise itself represents the universe... In the same way the term kapala, in the singular, is occasionally applied to the skull, as well as to the upper and the lower case of the tortoise, e.g. Sat Br.

He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with toil and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple science. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, 'the Brahman ([[Vedas|Veda]]) is the foundation of everything here.' Wherefore, having studied (the Veda) one rests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his foundation. Resting on that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.\n\nHe created the waters out of V\u00e2k (speech, that is) the world; for speech belonged to it: that was created (set free).

He entered the waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. 'Let it exist! let it exist and multiply!' so he said. From it the Brahman (neut.) was first created, the triple science. Hence they say, 'The Brahman (n.) is the first-born of this All.' For even before that Person the Brahman was created: it was created as his mouth. Hence they say of him who has studied the Veda, that 'he is like [[Agni]];' for it, the Brahman (Veda), is Agni's mouth...\n\nHe desired, 'May I generate, this (earth) from these waters!'

Probably the single most important development, which is first found in the Brahmanas and exerts the most influence over all other factors, is the identification of Vishnu with the [[Yajna|sacrifice]]'.<ref name=\":5\" /> Vishnu is explicitly stated to be sacrifice repeatedly throughout the Shatapatha Brahmana (e.g. SB 1.7.4.20, 1.1.4.9, 3.2.1.38, 3.6.3.3, 5.2.3.6, 5.4.5.1, 5.4.5.18, 11.4.1.4, 12.5.4.11, 14.1.1.13, and 11.4.1.4).\n\n==== Kanda 14, Adhyaya 1, Brahmana 1 ====\nin SB 14.1.1 ('The [[Pravargya]]'), the story given is that 'the gods [[Agni]], [[Indra]], [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], Makha, [[Vishnu]], and the [<nowiki/>[[Visvedevas|Vi]][[Visvedevas|svedevas]]], except the two [[A\u015bvins|Asvins]], performed a [[Yajna|sacrificial session]]', which was first attained by [[Vishnu]], hence 'he became the most excellent of the gods'. ''Upadika'' ants then agreed with the other gods to gnaw at the bowstring of Vishnu while He rested his head on the Bow, in exchange for the boon to 'find water even in the desert' (as 'all food is water'). The ''Gharma'' (hot beverage offered as an oblation)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?q=gharma|title=Sanskrit Dictionary: 'gharma'|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sanskritdictionary.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> is named after the sound of Vishnu's head hitting the ground (which 'on falling became yonder sun'), and 'inasmuch as he [Vishnu] stretched out (''pra-vrig'') on the ground, therefrom the ''[[Pravargya]]'' (took its name)'. The body of Vishnu is encompassed by Indra, who possessed by His glory 'became ''Makhavat'' (possessed of makha)'. Vishnu is then divided into three parts, with Agni receiving the first (morning) portion, Indra the second (midday) portion, and the remaining Visvedevas the third portion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44117.htm|title=Satapatha Brahmana Part V (SBE44): Fourteenth K\u00e2nda: XIV, 1, 1.

The tortoise avatar is also synonymous with [[World Turtle|Akupara]], the 'world-turtle' supporting the Earth, as well as the [[Saptarishi]] sage, [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]]. Accounts from the Shatapatha Brahmana are stated by Varadpande to be the seed of Kurma.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nEggeling adds that the '[[Kapala|kapalas]] [cups used in ritual [[Yajna|sacrifices]]] are usually arranged in such a manner as to produce a fancied resemblance to the (upper) shell of the tortoise, which is a symbol of the sky, as the tortoise itself represents the universe... In the same way the term kapala, in the singular, is occasionally applied to the skull, as well as to the upper and the lower case of the tortoise, e.g. Sat Br.

He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with toil and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple science. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, 'the Brahman ([[Vedas|Veda]]) is the foundation of everything here.' Wherefore, having studied (the Veda) one rests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his foundation. Resting on that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.\n\nHe created the waters out of V\u00e2k (speech, that is) the world; for speech belonged to it: that was created (set free). It pervaded everything here; and because it pervaded (\u00e2p) whatsoever there was here, therefore (it is called) water (\u00e2pah); and because it covered (var), therefore also it (is called) water (v\u00e2r).\n\nHe desired, 'May I be reproduced from these waters!' He entered the waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. 'Let it exist! let it exist and multiply!' so he said. From it the Brahman (neut.) was first created, the triple science. Hence they say, 'The Brahman (n.) is the first-born of this All.' For even before that Person the Brahman was created: it was created as his mouth.

This ritual therefore seems to be significant as the mock-battle between the King (symbolising the boar) and the Raganya (symbolising Varuna, [[Rigvedic deities|RigVedic]] deity of water) parallels the battle between Varaha with the [[Asura]] [[Hiranyaksha|Hiranyaksa]] in various [[Puranas|Puranic]] accounts of the Earth being saved and lifted out of the waters.\n\n== Manuscripts and Translations ==\nAll English translations of the [[Madhyandina Shakha|Madhyandina School]] recension are by [[Julius Eggeling]] in five volumes.

Several times during this period, the team was also called the '''Erie Senators''', after its major league affiliate, the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]].  The Sailors won league championship in 1957.  The Sailors won the regular season by nine games in 1951.  They then lost the league championship series to the [[Niagara Falls Citizens]], four games to two.\n\nFrom 1948 onward, this team (and all subsequent Sailors teams) played at [[Ainsworth Field]].\n\n==New York\u2013Penn League &ndash; 1990s==\nIn 1990, after the [[Baltimore Orioles]] ended their affiliation with the team (then known as the '''Erie Orioles'''), they reclaimed the Sailors name and operated as an unaffiliated minor league team for two years before becoming the [[Florida Marlins]]' first farm team in 1992 and a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] affiliate in 1993.  Because of the deteriorating condition of Ainsworth Field, the team moved after the 1993 season to [[Fishkill, New York]] and then became the [[Hudson Valley Renegades]].\n\n==Frontier League==\nIn 1994, the Sailors were a team in the independent [[Frontier League]], winning the league championship in their only year of existence as a member of the Frontier League.  In 1995, the [[Erie SeaWolves]] moved to town, displacing the Sailors, forcing the franchise to move to [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] as the [[Florence Freedom|Johnstown Steal/Johnnies]] and then to [[Florence, Kentucky]] as the [[Florence Y'alls]].\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n===Hall of Fame Alumni===\n\n*[[Chief Bender]] (1932) Inducted, 1953\n\n===Notable Alumni===\n\n* [[Vic Aldridge]] (1915)\n\n* [[Luis Alicea]] (1986)\n\n* [[Pete Appleton]] (1951)\n\n* [[George Bamberger]] (1946)\n\n* [[Joe Boever]] (1982)\n\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] (1912)\n\n* [[Frank Gilhooley]] (1912)\n\n* [[Bernard Gilkey]] (1985)\n\n* [[Fredi Gonzalez]] (1992)\n\n* [[Lance Johnson]] (1984) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Pat Kelly (outfielder)|Pat Kelly]] (1962) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Paul LaPalme]] (1942)\n\n* [[Dick McAuliffe]] (1957) 3 x MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Cliff Melton]] (1932) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Jim Merritt]] (1962) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Tom Pagnozzi]] (1983) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Frank Quilici]] (1961)\n\n* [[Arthur Rhodes]] (1989) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Buck Rodgers]] (1957) 1987 NL Manager of the Year\n\n* [[Dean Stone]] (1951) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Bobby Tolan]] (1988-1989)\n\n* [[Todd Worrell]] (1982) 3 x MLB All-Star; 1986 NL Rookie of the Year\n\n* [[Todd Zeile]] (1986)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Year-by-year record==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

unrelated teams used the Erie Sailors name in the [[Interstate League]] (1906&ndash;1907, 1913, 1916), the [[Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania League]] (1908&ndash;1911), and the [[Central League (baseball)|Central League]] (1912, 1915, 1928&ndash;30, 1932).\n\n==1938&ndash;1963==\nDuring these years, the Erie Sailors played in the [[Middle Atlantic League]] from 1938&ndash;1939, 1941&ndash;1942, and 1946&ndash;1951; the [[PONY League]] from 1944&ndash;1945 and 1954&ndash;1956; and the PONY's successor [[New York &ndash; Penn League]] from 1957&ndash;1963.  Several times during this period, the team was also called the '''Erie Senators''', after its major league affiliate, the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]].  The Sailors won league championship in 1957.  The Sailors won the regular season by nine games in 1951.  They then lost the league championship series to the [[Niagara Falls Citizens]], four games to two.\n\nFrom 1948 onward, this team (and all subsequent Sailors teams) played at [[Ainsworth Field]].\n\n==New York\u2013Penn League &ndash; 1990s==\nIn 1990, after the [[Baltimore Orioles]] ended their affiliation with the team (then known as the '''Erie Orioles'''), they reclaimed the Sailors name and operated as an unaffiliated minor league team for two years before becoming the [[Florida Marlins]]' first farm team in 1992 and a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] affiliate in 1993.  Because of the deteriorating condition of Ainsworth Field, the team moved after the 1993 season to [[Fishkill, New York]] and then became the [[Hudson Valley Renegades]].\n\n==Frontier League==\nIn 1994, the Sailors were a team in the independent [[Frontier League]], winning the league championship in their only year of existence as a member of the Frontier League.  In 1995, the [[Erie SeaWolves]] moved to town, displacing the Sailors, forcing the franchise to move to [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] as the [[Florence Freedom|Johnstown Steal/Johnnies]] and then to [[Florence, Kentucky]] as the [[Florence Y'alls]].\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n===Hall of Fame Alumni===\n\n*[[Chief Bender]] (1932) Inducted, 1953\n\n===Notable Alumni===\n\n* [[Vic Aldridge]] (1915)\n\n* [[Luis Alicea]] (1986)\n\n* [[Pete Appleton]] (1951)\n\n* [[George Bamberger]] (1946)\n\n* [[Joe Boever]] (1982)\n\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] (1912)\n\n* [[Frank Gilhooley]] (1912)\n\n* [[Bernard Gilkey]] (1985)\n\n* [[Fredi Gonzalez]] (1992)\n\n* [[Lance Johnson]] (1984) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Pat Kelly (outfielder)|Pat Kelly]] (1962) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Paul LaPalme]] (1942)\n\n* [[Dick McAuliffe]] (1957) 3 x MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Cliff Melton]] (1932) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Jim Merritt]] (1962) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Tom Pagnozzi]] (1983) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Frank Quilici]] (1961)\n\n* [[Arthur Rhodes]] (1989) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Buck Rodgers]] (1957) 1987 NL Manager of the Year\n\n* [[Dean Stone]] (1951) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Bobby Tolan]] (1988-1989)\n\n* [[Todd Worrell]] (1982) 3 x MLB All-Star; 1986 NL Rookie of the Year\n\n* [[Todd Zeile]] (1986)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Year-by-year record==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

[article in Alter Ego #150 on Stan Lee's efforts to get out of comics, with sample: \"Get Me Out of Here\"]</ref>\n\n==Characters and story==\nThe series was narrated by the leading male character, befuddled daydreamer Chester B. Tibbit, who suffered in a dead-end job as a [[Department store|department-store]] floorwalker. He started by relating the story of how he met his wife a few years earlier (\"I\u2019ll never forget the day I met Betsy. Let\u2019s see... was it June or August?\"), followed by their courtship and marriage, and then the birth of their son. Next came the accounts of Farley's babyhood, and it was obvious before he could walk or talk that the boy was a supergenius. After a little over two months of introducing the family, Chet shifted the storyline to the \"present,\" when Farley was a pompous and cynical five-year-old with no patience for clueless adults like the family's sarcastic swinging-bachelor friend, Gus. Readers experienced the Tibbits' sudden \"need\" for their first car (a 1945 \"Huppmobile\") after realizing that everyone else already had one (\"We were the last of a dying race\"), and then their plan to move to a new [[Tract housing|tract house]] in suburban Sunken Hills. Many strips began with well-intentioned but delusional bumbler Chet sitting in his living room talking directly to the reader. He tended to romanticize his [[narration]], and the humor came from the fact that his rosy \"voice-over\" captions usually contradicted what actually happened in the drawings.<ref name=\"auto6\">Cole, Jack; Parks, Dwight (2007).

And, of the Sundays that made it in, the only two in color are the incomplete third-page versions.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> P. Ryan Anthony concluded in his Amazon review that the book \"will only be indispensable to Jack Cole completists and those interested in the last work of an unqualified comic genius.\" According to ''Publishers Weekly'', the collection only exists because \"we're living in the Golden Age of comic reprints . . . and we still don't know exactly why author Cole killed himself.\"<ref name=\"auto3\"/> R. C. Harvey's \"excellent, informative\" 21-page introduction<ref name=\"auto5\"/> includes a generously illustrated biographical sketch of Jack Cole the veratile artist,<ref name=\"auto11\"/> and it also explores the mystery of his suicide.

They were developing their own strip Willy Lumpkin for the associated Publishers Syndicate, at that same time. Together they produced a week's samples, lettered and dated from September 9.<ref> Apeldoorn, Ger. [article in Alter Ego #150 on Stan Lee's efforts to get out of comics, with sample: \"Get Me Out of Here\"]</ref>\n\n==Characters and story==\nThe series was narrated by the leading male character, befuddled daydreamer Chester B. Tibbit, who suffered in a dead-end job as a [[Department store|department-store]] floorwalker. He started by relating the story of how he met his wife a few years earlier (\"I\u2019ll never forget the day I met Betsy. Let\u2019s see... was it June or August?\"), followed by their courtship and marriage, and then the birth of their son. Next came the accounts of Farley's babyhood, and it was obvious before he could walk or talk that the boy was a supergenius. After a little over two months of introducing the family, Chet shifted the storyline to the \"present,\" when Farley was a pompous and cynical five-year-old with no patience for clueless adults like the family's sarcastic swinging-bachelor friend, Gus. Readers experienced the Tibbits' sudden \"need\" for their first car (a 1945 \"Huppmobile\") after realizing that everyone else already had one (\"We were the last of a dying race\"), and then their plan to move to a new [[Tract housing|tract house]] in suburban Sunken Hills. Many strips began with well-intentioned but delusional bumbler Chet sitting in his living room talking directly to the reader. He tended to romanticize his [[narration]], and the humor came from the fact that his rosy \"voice-over\" captions usually contradicted what actually happened in the drawings.<ref name=\"auto6\">Cole, Jack; Parks, Dwight (2007).

[[Art Spiegelman]] went so far as to declare that ''Betsy and Me'' \"reads like a [[suicide]] note delivered in daily installments!\"<ref name=\"auto12\"/> [[R. C. Harvey|Robert C.

And, of the Sundays that made it in, the only two in color are the incomplete third-page versions.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> P. Ryan Anthony concluded in his Amazon review that the book \"will only be indispensable to Jack Cole completists and those interested in the last work of an unqualified comic genius.\" According to ''Publishers Weekly'', the collection only exists because \"we're living in the Golden Age of comic reprints . . . and we still don't know exactly why author Cole killed himself.\"<ref name=\"auto3\"/> R.

In Crohn's disease, surgery involves removing the worst inflamed segments of the intestine and connecting the healthy regions, but unfortunately, it does not cure Crohn's or eliminate the disease. At some point after the first surgery, Crohn's disease can recur in the healthy parts of the intestine, usually at the resection site. (For example, if a patient with Crohn's disease has an ileocecal anastomosis, in which the caecum and terminal ileum are removed and the ileum is joined to the ascending colon, their Crohn's will nearly always flare-up near the anastomosis or in the rest of the ascending colon).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Medical therapies===\nMedical treatment of IBD is individualised to each patient.<ref name=\"pmid21464096\" /> The choice of which drugs to use and by which route to administer them (oral, rectal, injection, infusion) depends on factors including the type, distribution, and severity of the patient's disease, as well as other historical and biochemical prognostic factors, and patient preferences. For example, [[mesalazine]] is more useful in [[ulcerative colitis]] than in [[Crohn's disease]].<ref name=agabegi2nd/> Generally, depending on the level of severity, IBD may require [[immunosuppression]] to control the symptoms, with drugs such as [[prednisone]], [[TNF inhibitor]]s, [[azathioprine]] (Imuran), [[methotrexate]], or [[6-mercaptopurine]].\n\n[[Glucocorticoid|Steroid]]s, such as the glucocorticoid [[prednisone]], are frequently used to control disease flares and were once acceptable as a maintenance drug.
