P. Herbert''' or simply '''A. P. H.''', was an English humorist,<!-- THIS REALLY IS THE O.E.D. SPELLING--> novelist, playwright and [[law reform]] activist who served as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]] from the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] to the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], when [[university constituencies]] were abolished.\n\nBorn in Ashtead, Surrey, Herbert attended [[Winchester College]] and [[New College, Oxford]], graduating with a first in [[Jurisprudence]] in 1914. He joined the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] as an ordinary seaman after the outbreak of [[World War I]], later serving as an officer with the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division|Royal Naval Division]]. He fought in the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli campaign]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], becoming his battalion's [[adjutant]] in 1917, following which he was injured and did not return to the frontline before the end of the war. Following the war, he published ''[[The Secret Battle]]'' and joined the permanent staff of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1924. He also wrote the [[libretto]]s for several musicals.\n\nHerbert was elected as the Independent MP for Oxford University in the 1935 general election. Before the outbreak of World War II, Herbert campaigned for private member's rights, piloted the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]] through Parliament, opposed the Entertainments Duty and campaigned against the [[Oxford Group]]. He enlisted in the River Emergency Service in 1938 and served in [[World War II]] as a Petty Officer in the Royal Naval Auxiliary Patrol. He captained his river boat, the ''Water Gipsy'', assigned to the [[River Thames]]. In 1943, he was part of a parliamentary commission sent to investigate the future of the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nHerbert was born at Ashtead Lodge, [[Ashtead]], Surrey, on 24 September 1890.

H. Asquith]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] at the time. He took an active part in the College's debating society and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] society. As a student at Winchester, Herbert sent verses to the offices of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', and received notes of encouragement and suggestions from the editor, [[Owen Seaman]]. Herbert was also Captain of Houses, one of the College's three football divisions.<ref>Pound, pp. 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nFrom Winchester, Herbert went to [[New College, Oxford]] as an [[Exhibitioner]]. He made his first public speech at the Kensington branch of the [[Tariff Reform League]], speaking ''[[Ex tempore|extempore]]'' on [[home rule]]. His first contribution to ''Punch'' was printed on 24 August 1910, being a set of verses with the title \"Stones of Venus\". Herbert went up to Oxford in October, and made his first speech at the [[Oxford Union]] in November. Apart from ''Punch'', his work began appearing in ''[[The Observer]]'', the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (UK)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref>Pound, pp. 25\u201333.</ref>\n\nHerbert received a \"not very good Second\" in [[Honour Moderations]], and, apparently disenchanted with [[Classics]], changed his degree to Law. He went into lodgings with [[Walter Monckton]] and others and was also good friends with notables [[Duff Cooper]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Philip Guedalla]]. Herbert finished at Oxford in 1914, with \"a very good First\" in [[Jurisprudence]]. He then decided to join his friend Jack Parr as a volunteer at [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]] in [[Bethnal Green]] for a year. He spent the time \"doing what I could\": washing dishes, sweeping floors, running errands and collecting money.<ref>Pound, pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n==First World War service, 1914\u201318==\nOn 5 September 1914, Herbert enlisted at Lambeth Pier as an [[ordinary seaman]] in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]], which later became one of the constituent bodies of the [[Royal Naval Division]]. In early October, the news reached Herbert that his brother, Owen Herbert, had been posted \"missing, believed killed\" in the retreat from [[Battle of Mons|Mons]]. Herbert reached the rank of acting [[leading seaman]] before being commissioned as a [[sub-lieutenant]] in early 1915, when he was posted to Hawke Battalion of the Royal Naval Division (later to come under army command as part of the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division]]).<ref>Pound, pp. 40\u201343.</ref>\n\n\"C\" and \"D\" companies of Hawke Battalion departed for [[Gallipoli]] in early 1915, briefly stopping in [[Malta]] before arriving at the [[Moudros]] on 17 May. The battalion finally arrived at Gallipoli on 27 May. Herbert was put in command of No. 11 Platoon, \"C\" Company, which was composed mostly of [[Tyneside]]rs and also two men from a remote [[Durham, England|Durham]] mining town. A week after arrival, the battalion suffered heavy casualties at the [[Third Battle of Krithia]]. In July 1915, Herbert went down with an illness and had to spend time recovering in a military hospital. When he was passed \"fit for light duty\", he was seconded to the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] at [[Whitehall]]. It was at this time that he decided to begin renting 12 [[Hammersmith Terrace]].<ref>Pound, pp. 43\u201339.</ref><ref name=\"bathe\">{{cite news|title=British war poetry: The Bathe|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-five/10542340/war-poetry-ap-herbert.html|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=31 December 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Royal Naval Division trench.jpg|left|thumb|350x350px|Soldiers of the Royal Naval Division training to leave a trench during [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], 1915]]\nIn summer 1916, when passed fit for duty, Herbert returned to Hawke Battalion at their base camp in [[Abbeville]], where he was made assistant adjutant. The battalion moved to the front line at [[Souchez]] in July 1916, and in mid-November the battalion took part in an attack on [[Beaucourt]] during the [[Battle of the Ancre]] that saw almost the entire battalion wiped out. Herbert was one of only two officers that came out unscathed from the attack. When the battalion returned to the front line at [[Pozi\u00e8res]] in February 1917, Herbert was made the battalion's adjutant, but he was later injured from shrapnel during an attack on [[Gavrelle]], west of [[Arras]].<ref name=\"bathe\" /><ref>Pound, pp. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nOn medical leave back in England following the injury, Herbert began writing his first book, ''[[The Secret Battle]]'', which was finished \"in a few weeks\". He was also elected a member of the Savage Club, and was raised by ''Punch'' to the \"exclusive group of its contributors who were allowed to attach their initials to their work.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 54-55</ref> On 2 October 1918, Herbert sailed out of [[Liverpool]] in a convoy bound for [[Alexandria]]. His role was as assistant to the [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]]. After arriving at Port Said, he was given a free pass to Cairo and was allowed to make a number of unaccompanied incursions inland. He was able to visit a number of places on the North African coast, and from Tunis, he took a train to Constantine, and then to Algiers. On 11 November, he went by train from Oran to Tlemcen. Exactly at 11 am, he heard that the Armistice had been signed. He wrote that \"I must have been the only Englishman for at least 80 miles.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 57\u201359.</ref>\n\nHe was granted shore leave at [[Gibraltar]] and took the opportunity to travel to [[Seville]] and then to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He arrived in [[Madrid]] on 22 November and dined with the embassy's naval attache, Captain John Harvey, as well as [[Filson Young]] and others before making the return journey to Gibraltar.<ref>Pound, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\n==Interwar career, 1918\u201335==\n''[[The Secret Battle]]'' was recommended to [[Methuen Publishing]] by [[E. V. Lucas]] and was announced in their spring list in 1919. The book was \"read all night\" by [[Lloyd George]], the Prime Minister, who also brought it to the attention of [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], then [[Secretary of State for War]]. [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]] considered it \"the best story of front line war\", and Herbert himself believed that court martial arrangements were subsequently \"altered in some way\" as a result of the book. However, the book was not a great commercial success, which his biographer Reginald Pound puts down to the fact that \"Readers, it seems, were tired of war as a dramatic theme.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 64\u201364.</ref>\n\nHerbert was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] by [[Inner Temple]] in 1919 and entered the chambers of [[Leslie Scott (British politician)|Leslie Scott]]. He was joined by two of his Oxford friends, [[Walter Monckton, 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Walter Monckton]] and [[Henry Strauss, 1st Baron Conesford|Henry Strauss]], who were called on the same day. Although he spent some time at Inner Temple, he never practised law and did not enter a legal career. He later declared himself \"forever sorry\" that he was \"not of the proud and faithful brotherhood who serve the laws of England.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nUnable to sustain himself on ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''{{'}}s \"eccentric rates of payment\", Herbert wrote his second book, ''The House by the River'', in two months, and it was published in 1920. He handed his literary business to A. P. Watt, who sold the American rights to ''The House by the River'' and also published a collection of his prose submissions to ''Punch'' under the title ''Light Articles Only''.<ref>Pound, pp. 66\u201367.</ref>\n\nIn January 1924, [[Owen Seaman]], the editor of ''Punch'', invited Herbert to join their staff. Herbert accepted and his accession to the staff meant he would receive a salary of \u00a350 a week. In 1925, Herbert attended the Third Imperial Press Conference on behalf of ''Punch'', where he made his first speech in front of a large audience in [[Melbourne]], where it was described as \"delectably witty\" by [[Harry Brittain|Sir Harry Brittain]].<ref>Pound, pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Herbert was invited by [[Nigel Playfair]] to write \"an entertainment\" for the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Theatre]], Hammersmith. The result was ''Riverside Nights'', performed at the Lyric in April 1926. His next play, ''The White Witch'', was performed at [[Haymarket Theatre]] in September 1926.\n\n[[File:Alan Herbert Blue Plaque Hammersmith Terrace 01.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 12 [[Hammersmith Terrace]]]]\n\n==Early parliamentary career, 1935\u201339==\nHerbert first encountered Parliament in 1934, when he brought the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons to court for selling liquor without a licence. [[Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart|Hewart, LCJ,]] ruled that the court would not hear the complaint because the matter fell within [[parliamentary privilege]]. Since the decision was never challenged in a higher court, this has led to the unique situation where there has been uncertainty as to \"the extent to which statute law applies to either House of Parliament.\"<ref name=privilege>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Privilege \u2013 Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtprivi/30/3010.htm|website=Parliament|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> When, the next year, Herbert published ''[[Uncommon Law]]'', Hewart contributed a generous introduction.\n\nHerbert first entertained the thought of standing for Parliament a few weeks before the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], when he ran into [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], who had just been rejected as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]]. Herbert decided to stand as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate, aided by [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Frank Pakenham]] who served as his [[election agent]]. Herbert wrote an \"unconventional\", 5,000-word-long [[election address]], which included: \"Agriculture: I know nothing about agriculture.\"<ref name=seatrobe>{{cite web|last1=Seatrobe |first1=J.

He protested to the Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]], on a motion that would give precedence to government bills over [[private member's bill]]s. He went into the \"No\" lobby alongside the members of the [[Independent Labour Party]] and fellow university member [[Eleanor Rathbone]], but the motion was passed by 232 to 5.<ref>Pound, pp. 135\u201336.</ref> Churchill praised Herbert for his \"composure and aplomb\", and also famously said: \"Call that a maiden speech? It was a brazen hussy of a speech. Never did such a painted lady of a speech parade itself before a modest Parliament.\"<ref>Herbert, p. 38.</ref> During his speech, Herbert promised to introduce his [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937|Matrimonial Causes Bill]] into law by the end of the parliament.<ref name=seatrobe />\n\nIn 1936, Herbert failed to get drawn in the private members' ballot but managed to get the Conservative [[Rupert De la B\u00e8re]] to sponsor the bill. On 20 November, Herbert made a speech in its favour and it passed its second reading by 78 votes to 12. It was given a third reading in the House of Lords on 19 July 1937 and was passed by 79 votes to 28. It was passed, somewhat strengthened by the House of Lords, in 1938 as the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]]. This allowed divorce without requiring proof of [[adultery]], although fake adulteries and the bizarre rules about collusion persisted until the [[Divorce Reform Act 1969]] came into force in 1971.\n\nDuring the pre-war period, Herbert drafted a number of bills that were printed on the Order Paper, including a Betting and Bookmakers Bill, a Public Refreshment Bill and a Spring (Arrangements) Bill, which was written in verse.<ref>Herbert, pp. 41\u201342.</ref> Herbert made numerous attacks on the Entertainments Duty, which had been introduced as a \"temporary, war-time tax\" in 1916.<ref>Herbert, p. 91.</ref> In his campaign against the duty, Herbert worked closely with [[William Mabane, 1st Baron Mabane|William Mabane]], and they made some headway when in 1939 the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] reduced the duty.<ref>Herbert, p. 95.</ref> Herbert also spoke out against the proposed Population (Statistics) Bill in 1937, making a speech that was received with \"loud laughter\" in the Commons chamber, making it, according to ''Punch'', \"an astonishing occasion\". Herbert and others brought in several amendments to the bill before it reached the statute book in 1938.<ref>Pound, pp. 151\u201353.</ref>\n\nHerbert was also a fervent opponent of the [[Oxford Group]] and its leader, [[Frank Buchman]]. In particular, he opposed the use of \"Oxford\" in their name and their supposed association with the [[University of Oxford]]. He was supported by the University in his endeavours, particularly by the [[Oxford Union]], which unanimously passed a resolution in support of Herbert. [[H. A. L. Fisher]], the warden of [[New College, Oxford]], and [[Douglas Veale]], the [[Registrar of the University of Oxford]], also expressed their support to Herbert.<ref>Pound, pp. 155\u201356.</ref>\n\n==Second World War service, 1939\u201345==\nOn 3 November 1938, Herbert enrolled himself and his boat, the ''Water Gipsy'', in the River Emergency Service, which was under the control of the [[Port of London Authority]].<ref>Herbert, p. 113.</ref> Over the summer of 1939, he had taken part in exercises involving simulated air raid and casualty retrieval. In early September 1939, the River Emergency Service reported to their war stations, and Herbert's own crew consisted of Darcy Braddell, vice-president of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], [[Victor Pasmore]], [[Magnus Pyke]] and [[John Pudney]]. At the sounding of the first air raid siren in London in 1939, the ''Water Gipsy'' was anchored off Speaker's Steps by Westminster Bridge. A number of MPs left the Commons following the sirens and cheered the ''Water Gipsy'' as the only naval vessel in sight, before saluting it.<ref>Pound, pp. 158\u201359.</ref>\n\nDuring the Second World War, Herbert was the only [[non-commissioned officer]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and wore his uniform on any and every occasion during the war years. He turned down efforts to persuade him to apply for a commission, despite once appearing before a selection board against his will. He also turned down the offer of a role in Churchill's [[Churchill war ministry|war cabinet]] when asked, saying \"No, thank you, sir. I'm quite happy where I am.\"<ref>Pound, p. 178.</ref>\n\nHe was sent to [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1943 with [[Derrick Gunston]] and [[Charles Ammon, 1st Baron Ammon|Charles Ammon]] as part of a parliamentary commission to investigate the future of the dominion. Of the alternatives, he supported independence rather than a confederation.\n\n==Later parliamentary career, 1945\u201350==\nFollowing his re-election in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] on 5 July, Herbert noted of the new Parliament that \"the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see.\" The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], under [[Clement Attlee]], had won 393 seats, and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs that \"Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty.\" Herbert campaigned to ensure that the newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including on betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of [[decree nisi]], among other things. However, he was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time \u2013 later in the Parliament, it would be restored.<ref>Pound, pp. 197\u201398.</ref>\n\nIn autumn 1945, [[George Orwell]] had the essay ''[[Notes on Nationalism]]'' published in the magazine ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]''. In it, he named Herbert as one of the followers of \"neo-Toryism\", who, according to Orwell, are marked by a \"desire not to recognise that British power and influence have declined\".<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite web|url=http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat|title=Notes on Nationalism|website=Orwell.ru|last1=Orwell|first1=George|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> Herbert's biographer, Reginald Pound, notes that \"APH would have rejected the Tory affiliation, though his inclinations were with the Right.\"<ref>Pound, p. 208.</ref>\n\nFrom July 1945 through to 1946, Herbert worked on the [[libretto]] for [[Charles B. Cochran]]'s new musical, ''Big Ben''. It opened at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] on 17 July 1946 and was watched on its opening night by Churchill, [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]], Attlee and Herbert, but Cochran was too ill to attend. During its first three months, it took an average of \u00a34,000 a week at the box office, but the running costs were also high so there was no fortune for Cochran or Herbert.<ref>Pound, pp. 199\u2013201.</ref> The show ended its run at the end of 1946, after 172 performances.<ref>Pound, p. 207.</ref> Cochran commissioned Herbert to write another musical, ''[[Bless the Bride]]'', which opened at the Adelphi on 26 April 1947. It ran for two and a quarter years, and was the source of \"an accretion of cash\" for Herbert as well as being Cochran's most successful musical.<ref>Pound, p. 211.</ref>\n\nHerbert sat on the Supreme Court Committee on Practice and Procedures, chaired by [[Raymond Evershed, 1st Baron Evershed|Raymond Evershed]], which was investigating the cost of litigation. He also chaired the Literary Sub-Committee of the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London, which judged the literary compositions of 29 nations in their own languages. He also accepted an invitation to serve on the Council of the [[Festival of Britain]], to be held in 1951. At this time, he was already a member of the [[Thames Conservancy|Thames Conservancy Board]], a trustee of the [[National Maritime Museum]], president of the [[Inland Waterways Association]] and a vice president of the [[Living Streets (UK)|Pedestrians' Association for Road Safety]]. He also authored a critical study of [[Royal Commission|royal commissions]] for the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], which was dismissed for its \"light touch\". Herbert commented that \"Had it included graphs and tables and been written in a heavy style it would have been accepted as a major contribution to the practice of sound administration.\"<ref>Pound, p. 212\u201314</ref>\n\nHerbert was re-elected in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] and continued as an MP until the [[University constituency|University seats]] were abolished in 1950 as a result of the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]].<ref>Herbert, p. 31.</ref> Herbert's last speech, on 23 November 1949, was in favour of the [[Festival of Britain]], a cause he strongly supported.<ref name=\"seatrobe\" /> He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1945 in [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[1945 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37227 |supp=y |pages=4183\u20134184  |date=14 August 1945 }}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' noted \"his individual niche in the parliamentary temple as the doughty vindicator of the private member's rights, including not least the right to legislate.\"<ref>{{citation |title=none|newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=14 August 1945 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Herbert published a memoir of his service in the House of Commons, ''Independent Member'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Co., Inc., 1951).\n\nHerbert was the subject of a ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' TV programme in 1961 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Hammersmith Terrace 07.JPG|thumb|12 Hammersmith Terrace]]\nIn the summer of 1914, Herbert first met his future wife, Gwendolyn Harriet Quilter, the daughter of [[Harry Quilter]].<ref>Pound, p. 37.</ref> They became engaged in December 1914 and were married in the first week of 1915 by [[Frederic Iremonger]], the vicar of St James the Great in [[Bethnal Green]].

They spent their honeymoon in a room in [[Fulham Road]].<ref>Pound, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Gwendolyn lived to the age of 97, dying in 1986. Lady Herbert was elected as the first President of Hammersmith Chess Club <ref>[http://hammerchess.co.uk Chess Club site]</ref> in 1966 and was a well-known face on the chess circuit at that time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hammerchess.co.uk/2016/03/18/a-brief-history-of-hammersmith-chess-club/ |title=A Brief History of Hammersmith Chess Club \u2013 Hammersmith Chess Club}}</ref> They had four children Crystal, Lavender, [[Jocelyn Herbert|Jocelyn]] and John.\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Member of Parliament for [[Chesterfield]], [[Toby Perkins]], is his great-grandson.\n\n===The Thames===\nHerbert loved the [[River Thames]]. He lived beside it at [[Hammersmith]], West London. He was a Conservator (a member of the [[Thames Conservancy Board]]) and a Freeman of the [[Lightermen|Company of Watermen and Lightermen]]. In 1966 he wrote ''The Thames'' ([[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]) in which he explored the \"machinery\" of the river in all its aspects.\n\n==Death==\nIn the last days of 1970, Herbert was taken to [[Middlesex Hospital]] in [[Fitzrovia]], following a seizure that affected his left side and arm. Within six weeks, he was home again, and over many months his physical powers waned. In August 1971, he wrote his last letter to ''The Times'', an appeal for parliamentary good manners in refraining from \"witty derision of the literary exertions of Mr [[Harold Wilson]]\" and of the \"marine activities\" of [[Edward Heath]]. By then, he was describing himself as \"a recumbent nuisance.\" He died on 11 November 1971, and obituaries were published in both ''The Times'' and ''Punch''. ''The Times'' supplemented their obituary notice with a leading article. They described him as having done \"more than any man of his day to add to the gaiety of the nation.\"<ref name=death />\n\nA memorial service was held on 6 December in the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], which was \"crowded to overflowing\". On 7 December, the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' of the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] appeared with four pages of tributes to Herbert, by congressmen from Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Robert H. Land, chief of the Reference Department of the [[Library of Congress]], later said that \"[there is no] record or recollection of a similar tribute to another English writer in the proceedings of Congress.\"<ref name=death>Pound, pp. 299\u2013301.</ref>\n\n==References by other authors==\nIn his 1957 article \"Over Seventy\", lamenting the decline of the humorist, [[P. G. Wodehouse]] wrote: \"I want to see an A. P. Herbert on every street corner, an [[Alex Atkinson]] in every [[Public house|local]].\"\n\nThe title of [[Alexandra Fuller]]'s 2001 memoir ''[[Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood]]'' is taken from a Herbert quote, \"Don't let's go to the dogs tonight, for Mother will be there.\"<ref>[Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight] Cited from epigraph.</ref>\n\nIn Stella Gibbons' [[Cold Comfort Farm]], there is an exchange between Seth and Flora where she teases him : \" \u2018I goes over to Beershorn,\u2019 replied Seth, rather sulkily. The dark flame of his male pride was a little suspicious of having its leg pulled. \u2018To play darts?\u2019 Flora knew her A.P.H.\"\n\n==\"Misleading cases\"==\n[[File:UnCommonLaw1979Cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Uncommon Law]],'' collecting ''Misleading Cases in the Common Law'']]\n{{details|Uncommon Law}}\nStarting in 1910, he contributed regularly to ''[[Punch Magazine|Punch]]''. One series of his it took was ''[[Uncommon Law|Misleading Cases in the Common Law]]'' \u2013 the work for which he is best remembered. These were satirical pieces in the form of \"[[law reports]]\" or \"[[Legal judgment|judgement]]s\" on various aspects of the English legal and judicial system. Many featured the exploits of Albert Haddock, a tireless and veteran litigant. One of the best-known and most colourful is ''[[Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock]],'' also known as \"The Negotiable Cow\". Even the title is a humorous allusion to the entirely serious \"Smith's Leading Cases\". Herbert often referred to himself as \"A. P. Haddock\" in skits in ''Punch'' magazine, whether or not these had a courtroom setting.\n\nThanks to their realism, they were on several occasions mistakenly reported by newspapers both in Britain and elsewhere as factual. One of the \"cases\", supposedly establishing a novel crime of \"doing what you like\", was sharply criticised by an American [[law review]] article, whose author failed to note its entire absurdity.<ref>''Uncommon Law'', ''Rex v Haddock'': Is it a free country?, 5, pp. 24\u201329. Haddock is arrested for jumping into the [[River Thames]] from [[Hammersmith Bridge]]. When questioned to motive, Haddock replies, \"For fun\". The judge sums up: \"The appellant made the general answer that this was a free country and a man can do what he likes if he does nobody any harm.... It cannot be too clearly understood that this is ''not'' a free country, and it will be an evil day for the legal profession when it is... and least of all may they do unusual actions 'for fun'. People must not do things for fun. There is no reference to fun in any Act of Parliament.\"</ref> As such they are examples of the literary technique known as [[false document]]. And while in these fictitious law reports, the fictitious judges and lawyers regularly cited various real and venerable authorities, such as [[Henry de Bracton]], they were prone also to citing texts of Herbert's own imagination such as \"Wedderburn on Water Courses\" and \"A. Capone's Handbook for Bootleggers\".\n\nMore importantly, these cases were Herbert's vehicles for his law-reform work. Beneath their satire, they often carried cogent and sharp legal or political points that tied into his personal crusades against obsolescent legislation. Although fictional, they are, consequently, sometimes quoted in judicial decisions,<ref>See for example [http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/Messing_BankAmerica0703.pdf Messing v Bank of America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319153809/http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/Messing_BankAmerica0703.pdf |date=19 March 2006 }}(2002) at paragraph 1, and [http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1999/214.html Victor Chandler International Ltd v The Commissioners of Custom and Excise and Teletext Limited] 1999 EWHC Ch 214, para 11, where [[Gavin Lightman (judge)|Mr Justice Lightman]] stated that a document, in the context of the [[Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981]], \"must be inanimate: neither a person nor A.

The English use [[Right- and left-hand traffic|left-hand traffic]] but the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] dictate right-hand traffic.</ref>\n\nOver his lifetime Herbert published five collections, entitled ''[[Misleading Cases in the Common Law]]'', ''[[More Misleading Cases]]'', ''[[Still More Misleading Cases]]'', ''[[Codd's Last Case]]'' and ''[[Bardot M.P.?]]''. Stray cases also appear in his collections of miscellaneous humorous essays, such as ''[[General Cargo]]''. Virtually all the cases were assembled into two omnibus volumes, ''[[Uncommon Law]]'' in 1935 and ''[[More Uncommon Law]]'' in 1982. A shorter selection, ''[[Wigs at Work]]'', appeared in 1966.\n\nThe [[BBC]] successfully adapted them for television as three series of ''[[A P Herbert's Misleading Cases]]'' (1967, 1968 and 1971), with [[Roy Dotrice]] as Haddock and [[Alastair Sim]] as the judge, Mr Justice Swallow.\n\n==Novels and other writings==\nHerbert wrote eight novels, including ''[[The Water Gipsies (novel)|The Water Gipsies]]'' (1930), and 15 plays, including the light operas ''[[Tantivy Towers]]'' (1931) and ''Big Ben'' (1946), and the comedy ''[[Bless the Bride]]'' (1947), which ran for two-and-a-quarter years in London.\n\nIn addition to his fiction, Herbert wrote ''[[What a Word!]]'' in 1935, continuing his campaign in ''Punch'' for better use of English, including a section on \"Plain English\", more than a decade ahead of Sir [[Ernest Gowers]]'s more celebrated work. Characteristically, Herbert uses humour to make his serious points about good writing. He was the author of the lyrics of the patriotic song \"[[Song of Liberty]]\", set in 1940 to the music of Edward [[Elgar]]'s ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches|Pomp and Circumstance March No. 4]]''. In 1944, a set of posters by [[Eric Kennington]], a personal friend, called ''Seeing It Through'', were accompanied by poems by Herbert. They describe the work of certain professionals in London in the war. After the war he wrote a booklet called \"The War Story of [[Southend Pier]]\" detailing an account of when the pier was taken over by the Royal Navy in World War II.\n\nIn 1967, Herbert published ''[[Sundials Old and New; or, Fun with the Sun]]''; a book describing in detail his long fascination with, and experiments in, sundial technology. In the book, he describes all manner of sundials, and recounts many of his experiments in designing and building a number of different models, including a few that could be used to tell your position on the earth as well as the local time.\n\nIn 1970 Herbert published ''[[A.P.H., His Life and Times]]'', dedicated to \"My dear wife, for our 56th anniversary\".\n\n==Selected filmography==\n*''[[Tell England (film)|Tell England]]'' (1931)\n*''[[Waltz Time (1933 film)|Waltz Time]]'' (1933)\n\n==Publications==\n===General===\n*''[[The Secret Battle]]'', 1919, Methuen (A novel about a soldier executed for cowardice.)\n*''[[The House by the River]]'', 1921, Methuen (A novel about a war poet who commits a murder.)

He joined the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] as an ordinary seaman after the outbreak of [[World War I]], later serving as an officer with the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division|Royal Naval Division]]. He fought in the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli campaign]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], becoming his battalion's [[adjutant]] in 1917, following which he was injured and did not return to the frontline before the end of the war. Following the war, he published ''[[The Secret Battle]]'' and joined the permanent staff of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1924. He also wrote the [[libretto]]s for several musicals.\n\nHerbert was elected as the Independent MP for Oxford University in the 1935 general election. Before the outbreak of World War II, Herbert campaigned for private member's rights, piloted the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]] through Parliament, opposed the Entertainments Duty and campaigned against the [[Oxford Group]]. He enlisted in the River Emergency Service in 1938 and served in [[World War II]] as a Petty Officer in the Royal Naval Auxiliary Patrol. He captained his river boat, the ''Water Gipsy'', assigned to the [[River Thames]]. In 1943, he was part of a parliamentary commission sent to investigate the future of the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nHerbert was born at Ashtead Lodge, [[Ashtead]], Surrey, on 24 September 1890.

As a student at Winchester, Herbert sent verses to the offices of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', and received notes of encouragement and suggestions from the editor, [[Owen Seaman]]. Herbert was also Captain of Houses, one of the College's three football divisions.<ref>Pound, pp. 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nFrom Winchester, Herbert went to [[New College, Oxford]] as an [[Exhibitioner]]. He made his first public speech at the Kensington branch of the [[Tariff Reform League]], speaking ''[[Ex tempore|extempore]]'' on [[home rule]]. His first contribution to ''Punch'' was printed on 24 August 1910, being a set of verses with the title \"Stones of Venus\". Herbert went up to Oxford in October, and made his first speech at the [[Oxford Union]] in November. Apart from ''Punch'', his work began appearing in ''[[The Observer]]'', the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (UK)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref>Pound, pp. 25\u201333.</ref>\n\nHerbert received a \"not very good Second\" in [[Honour Moderations]], and, apparently disenchanted with [[Classics]], changed his degree to Law. He went into lodgings with [[Walter Monckton]] and others and was also good friends with notables [[Duff Cooper]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Philip Guedalla]]. Herbert finished at Oxford in 1914, with \"a very good First\" in [[Jurisprudence]]. He then decided to join his friend Jack Parr as a volunteer at [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]] in [[Bethnal Green]] for a year. He spent the time \"doing what I could\": washing dishes, sweeping floors, running errands and collecting money.<ref>Pound, pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n==First World War service, 1914\u201318==\nOn 5 September 1914, Herbert enlisted at Lambeth Pier as an [[ordinary seaman]] in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]], which later became one of the constituent bodies of the [[Royal Naval Division]]. In early October, the news reached Herbert that his brother, Owen Herbert, had been posted \"missing, believed killed\" in the retreat from [[Battle of Mons|Mons]]. Herbert reached the rank of acting [[leading seaman]] before being commissioned as a [[sub-lieutenant]] in early 1915, when he was posted to Hawke Battalion of the Royal Naval Division (later to come under army command as part of the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division]]).<ref>Pound, pp. 40\u201343.</ref>\n\n\"C\" and \"D\" companies of Hawke Battalion departed for [[Gallipoli]] in early 1915, briefly stopping in [[Malta]] before arriving at the [[Moudros]] on 17 May.

Herbert was put in command of No. 11 Platoon, \"C\" Company, which was composed mostly of [[Tyneside]]rs and also two men from a remote [[Durham, England|Durham]] mining town. A week after arrival, the battalion suffered heavy casualties at the [[Third Battle of Krithia]]. In July 1915, Herbert went down with an illness and had to spend time recovering in a military hospital. When he was passed \"fit for light duty\", he was seconded to the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] at [[Whitehall]].

The battalion moved to the front line at [[Souchez]] in July 1916, and in mid-November the battalion took part in an attack on [[Beaucourt]] during the [[Battle of the Ancre]] that saw almost the entire battalion wiped out. Herbert was one of only two officers that came out unscathed from the attack. When the battalion returned to the front line at [[Pozi\u00e8res]] in February 1917, Herbert was made the battalion's adjutant, but he was later injured from shrapnel during an attack on [[Gavrelle]], west of [[Arras]].<ref name=\"bathe\" /><ref>Pound, pp. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nOn medical leave back in England following the injury, Herbert began writing his first book, ''[[The Secret Battle]]'', which was finished \"in a few weeks\". He was also elected a member of the Savage Club, and was raised by ''Punch'' to the \"exclusive group of its contributors who were allowed to attach their initials to their work.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 54-55</ref> On 2 October 1918, Herbert sailed out of [[Liverpool]] in a convoy bound for [[Alexandria]]. His role was as assistant to the [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]]. After arriving at Port Said, he was given a free pass to Cairo and was allowed to make a number of unaccompanied incursions inland. He was able to visit a number of places on the North African coast, and from Tunis, he took a train to Constantine, and then to Algiers. On 11 November, he went by train from Oran to Tlemcen. Exactly at 11 am, he heard that the Armistice had been signed. He wrote that \"I must have been the only Englishman for at least 80 miles.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 57\u201359.</ref>\n\nHe was granted shore leave at [[Gibraltar]] and took the opportunity to travel to [[Seville]] and then to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He arrived in [[Madrid]] on 22 November and dined with the embassy's naval attache, Captain John Harvey, as well as [[Filson Young]] and others before making the return journey to Gibraltar.<ref>Pound, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\n==Interwar career, 1918\u201335==\n''[[The Secret Battle]]'' was recommended to [[Methuen Publishing]] by [[E. V. Lucas]] and was announced in their spring list in 1919. The book was \"read all night\" by [[Lloyd George]], the Prime Minister, who also brought it to the attention of [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], then [[Secretary of State for War]]. [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]] considered it \"the best story of front line war\", and Herbert himself believed that court martial arrangements were subsequently \"altered in some way\" as a result of the book. However, the book was not a great commercial success, which his biographer Reginald Pound puts down to the fact that \"Readers, it seems, were tired of war as a dramatic theme.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 64\u201364.</ref>\n\nHerbert was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] by [[Inner Temple]] in 1919 and entered the chambers of [[Leslie Scott (British politician)|Leslie Scott]]. He was joined by two of his Oxford friends, [[Walter Monckton, 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Walter Monckton]] and [[Henry Strauss, 1st Baron Conesford|Henry Strauss]], who were called on the same day. Although he spent some time at Inner Temple, he never practised law and did not enter a legal career. He later declared himself \"forever sorry\" that he was \"not of the proud and faithful brotherhood who serve the laws of England.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nUnable to sustain himself on ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''{{'}}s \"eccentric rates of payment\", Herbert wrote his second book, ''The House by the River'', in two months, and it was published in 1920. He handed his literary business to A. P. Watt, who sold the American rights to ''The House by the River'' and also published a collection of his prose submissions to ''Punch'' under the title ''Light Articles Only''.<ref>Pound, pp. 66\u201367.</ref>\n\nIn January 1924, [[Owen Seaman]], the editor of ''Punch'', invited Herbert to join their staff. Herbert accepted and his accession to the staff meant he would receive a salary of \u00a350 a week. In 1925, Herbert attended the Third Imperial Press Conference on behalf of ''Punch'', where he made his first speech in front of a large audience in [[Melbourne]], where it was described as \"delectably witty\" by [[Harry Brittain|Sir Harry Brittain]].<ref>Pound, pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Herbert was invited by [[Nigel Playfair]] to write \"an entertainment\" for the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Theatre]], Hammersmith. The result was ''Riverside Nights'', performed at the Lyric in April 1926. His next play, ''The White Witch'', was performed at [[Haymarket Theatre]] in September 1926.\n\n[[File:Alan Herbert Blue Plaque Hammersmith Terrace 01.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 12 [[Hammersmith Terrace]]]]\n\n==Early parliamentary career, 1935\u201339==\nHerbert first encountered Parliament in 1934, when he brought the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons to court for selling liquor without a licence. [[Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart|Hewart, LCJ,]] ruled that the court would not hear the complaint because the matter fell within [[parliamentary privilege]]. Since the decision was never challenged in a higher court, this has led to the unique situation where there has been uncertainty as to \"the extent to which statute law applies to either House of Parliament.\"<ref name=privilege>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Privilege \u2013 Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtprivi/30/3010.htm|website=Parliament|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> When, the next year, Herbert published ''[[Uncommon Law]]'', Hewart contributed a generous introduction.\n\nHerbert first entertained the thought of standing for Parliament a few weeks before the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], when he ran into [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], who had just been rejected as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]]. Herbert decided to stand as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate, aided by [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Frank Pakenham]] who served as his [[election agent]]. Herbert wrote an \"unconventional\", 5,000-word-long [[election address]], which included: \"Agriculture: I know nothing about agriculture.\"<ref name=seatrobe>{{cite web|last1=Seatrobe |first1=J.

He protested to the Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]], on a motion that would give precedence to government bills over [[private member's bill]]s. He went into the \"No\" lobby alongside the members of the [[Independent Labour Party]] and fellow university member [[Eleanor Rathbone]], but the motion was passed by 232 to 5.<ref>Pound, pp. 135\u201336.</ref> Churchill praised Herbert for his \"composure and aplomb\", and also famously said: \"Call that a maiden speech? It was a brazen hussy of a speech. Never did such a painted lady of a speech parade itself before a modest Parliament.\"<ref>Herbert, p. 38.</ref> During his speech, Herbert promised to introduce his [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937|Matrimonial Causes Bill]] into law by the end of the parliament.<ref name=seatrobe />\n\nIn 1936, Herbert failed to get drawn in the private members' ballot but managed to get the Conservative [[Rupert De la B\u00e8re]] to sponsor the bill. On 20 November, Herbert made a speech in its favour and it passed its second reading by 78 votes to 12. It was given a third reading in the House of Lords on 19 July 1937 and was passed by 79 votes to 28. It was passed, somewhat strengthened by the House of Lords, in 1938 as the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]]. This allowed divorce without requiring proof of [[adultery]], although fake adulteries and the bizarre rules about collusion persisted until the [[Divorce Reform Act 1969]] came into force in 1971.\n\nDuring the pre-war period, Herbert drafted a number of bills that were printed on the Order Paper, including a Betting and Bookmakers Bill, a Public Refreshment Bill and a Spring (Arrangements) Bill, which was written in verse.<ref>Herbert, pp. 41\u201342.</ref> Herbert made numerous attacks on the Entertainments Duty, which had been introduced as a \"temporary, war-time tax\" in 1916.<ref>Herbert, p. 91.</ref> In his campaign against the duty, Herbert worked closely with [[William Mabane, 1st Baron Mabane|William Mabane]], and they made some headway when in 1939 the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] reduced the duty.<ref>Herbert, p. 95.</ref> Herbert also spoke out against the proposed Population (Statistics) Bill in 1937, making a speech that was received with \"loud laughter\" in the Commons chamber, making it, according to ''Punch'', \"an astonishing occasion\". Herbert and others brought in several amendments to the bill before it reached the statute book in 1938.<ref>Pound, pp. 151\u201353.</ref>\n\nHerbert was also a fervent opponent of the [[Oxford Group]] and its leader, [[Frank Buchman]]. In particular, he opposed the use of \"Oxford\" in their name and their supposed association with the [[University of Oxford]]. He was supported by the University in his endeavours, particularly by the [[Oxford Union]], which unanimously passed a resolution in support of Herbert. [[H. A. L. Fisher]], the warden of [[New College, Oxford]], and [[Douglas Veale]], the [[Registrar of the University of Oxford]], also expressed their support to Herbert.<ref>Pound, pp. 155\u201356.</ref>\n\n==Second World War service, 1939\u201345==\nOn 3 November 1938, Herbert enrolled himself and his boat, the ''Water Gipsy'', in the River Emergency Service, which was under the control of the [[Port of London Authority]].<ref>Herbert, p. 113.</ref> Over the summer of 1939, he had taken part in exercises involving simulated air raid and casualty retrieval. In early September 1939, the River Emergency Service reported to their war stations, and Herbert's own crew consisted of Darcy Braddell, vice-president of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], [[Victor Pasmore]], [[Magnus Pyke]] and [[John Pudney]]. At the sounding of the first air raid siren in London in 1939, the ''Water Gipsy'' was anchored off Speaker's Steps by Westminster Bridge. A number of MPs left the Commons following the sirens and cheered the ''Water Gipsy'' as the only naval vessel in sight, before saluting it.<ref>Pound, pp. 158\u201359.</ref>\n\nDuring the Second World War, Herbert was the only [[non-commissioned officer]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and wore his uniform on any and every occasion during the war years. He turned down efforts to persuade him to apply for a commission, despite once appearing before a selection board against his will. He also turned down the offer of a role in Churchill's [[Churchill war ministry|war cabinet]] when asked, saying \"No, thank you, sir. I'm quite happy where I am.\"<ref>Pound, p. 178.</ref>\n\nHe was sent to [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1943 with [[Derrick Gunston]] and [[Charles Ammon, 1st Baron Ammon|Charles Ammon]] as part of a parliamentary commission to investigate the future of the dominion. Of the alternatives, he supported independence rather than a confederation.\n\n==Later parliamentary career, 1945\u201350==\nFollowing his re-election in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] on 5 July, Herbert noted of the new Parliament that \"the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see.\" The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], under [[Clement Attlee]], had won 393 seats, and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs that \"Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty.\" Herbert campaigned to ensure that the newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including on betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of [[decree nisi]], among other things. However, he was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time \u2013 later in the Parliament, it would be restored.<ref>Pound, pp. 197\u201398.</ref>\n\nIn autumn 1945, [[George Orwell]] had the essay ''[[Notes on Nationalism]]'' published in the magazine ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]''. In it, he named Herbert as one of the followers of \"neo-Toryism\", who, according to Orwell, are marked by a \"desire not to recognise that British power and influence have declined\".<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite web|url=http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat|title=Notes on Nationalism|website=Orwell.ru|last1=Orwell|first1=George|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> Herbert's biographer, Reginald Pound, notes that \"APH would have rejected the Tory affiliation, though his inclinations were with the Right.\"<ref>Pound, p. 208.</ref>\n\nFrom July 1945 through to 1946, Herbert worked on the [[libretto]] for [[Charles B. Cochran]]'s new musical, ''Big Ben''. It opened at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] on 17 July 1946 and was watched on its opening night by Churchill, [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]], Attlee and Herbert, but Cochran was too ill to attend. During its first three months, it took an average of \u00a34,000 a week at the box office, but the running costs were also high so there was no fortune for Cochran or Herbert.<ref>Pound, pp. 199\u2013201.</ref> The show ended its run at the end of 1946, after 172 performances.<ref>Pound, p. 207.</ref> Cochran commissioned Herbert to write another musical, ''[[Bless the Bride]]'', which opened at the Adelphi on 26 April 1947. It ran for two and a quarter years, and was the source of \"an accretion of cash\" for Herbert as well as being Cochran's most successful musical.<ref>Pound, p. 211.</ref>\n\nHerbert sat on the Supreme Court Committee on Practice and Procedures, chaired by [[Raymond Evershed, 1st Baron Evershed|Raymond Evershed]], which was investigating the cost of litigation. He also chaired the Literary Sub-Committee of the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London, which judged the literary compositions of 29 nations in their own languages. He also accepted an invitation to serve on the Council of the [[Festival of Britain]], to be held in 1951. At this time, he was already a member of the [[Thames Conservancy|Thames Conservancy Board]], a trustee of the [[National Maritime Museum]], president of the [[Inland Waterways Association]] and a vice president of the [[Living Streets (UK)|Pedestrians' Association for Road Safety]]. He also authored a critical study of [[Royal Commission|royal commissions]] for the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], which was dismissed for its \"light touch\". Herbert commented that \"Had it included graphs and tables and been written in a heavy style it would have been accepted as a major contribution to the practice of sound administration.\"<ref>Pound, p. 212\u201314</ref>\n\nHerbert was re-elected in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] and continued as an MP until the [[University constituency|University seats]] were abolished in 1950 as a result of the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]].<ref>Herbert, p. 31.</ref> Herbert's last speech, on 23 November 1949, was in favour of the [[Festival of Britain]], a cause he strongly supported.<ref name=\"seatrobe\" /> He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1945 in [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[1945 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37227 |supp=y |pages=4183\u20134184  |date=14 August 1945 }}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' noted \"his individual niche in the parliamentary temple as the doughty vindicator of the private member's rights, including not least the right to legislate.\"<ref>{{citation |title=none|newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=14 August 1945 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Herbert published a memoir of his service in the House of Commons, ''Independent Member'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Co., Inc., 1951).\n\nHerbert was the subject of a ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' TV programme in 1961 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Hammersmith Terrace 07.JPG|thumb|12 Hammersmith Terrace]]\nIn the summer of 1914, Herbert first met his future wife, Gwendolyn Harriet Quilter, the daughter of [[Harry Quilter]].<ref>Pound, p. 37.</ref> They became engaged in December 1914 and were married in the first week of 1915 by [[Frederic Iremonger]], the vicar of St James the Great in [[Bethnal Green]]. Herbert wore his formal dress uniform of an Acting Leading Seaman during the wedding. They spent their honeymoon in a room in [[Fulham Road]].<ref>Pound, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Gwendolyn lived to the age of 97, dying in 1986. Lady Herbert was elected as the first President of Hammersmith Chess Club <ref>[http://hammerchess.co.uk Chess Club site]</ref> in 1966 and was a well-known face on the chess circuit at that time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hammerchess.co.uk/2016/03/18/a-brief-history-of-hammersmith-chess-club/ |title=A Brief History of Hammersmith Chess Club \u2013 Hammersmith Chess Club}}</ref> They had four children Crystal, Lavender, [[Jocelyn Herbert|Jocelyn]] and John.\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Member of Parliament for [[Chesterfield]], [[Toby Perkins]], is his great-grandson.\n\n===The Thames===\nHerbert loved the [[River Thames]]. He lived beside it at [[Hammersmith]], West London. He was a Conservator (a member of the [[Thames Conservancy Board]]) and a Freeman of the [[Lightermen|Company of Watermen and Lightermen]]. In 1966 he wrote ''The Thames'' ([[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]) in which he explored the \"machinery\" of the river in all its aspects.\n\n==Death==\nIn the last days of 1970, Herbert was taken to [[Middlesex Hospital]] in [[Fitzrovia]], following a seizure that affected his left side and arm. Within six weeks, he was home again, and over many months his physical powers waned. In August 1971, he wrote his last letter to ''The Times'', an appeal for parliamentary good manners in refraining from \"witty derision of the literary exertions of Mr [[Harold Wilson]]\" and of the \"marine activities\" of [[Edward Heath]]. By then, he was describing himself as \"a recumbent nuisance.\" He died on 11 November 1971, and obituaries were published in both ''The Times'' and ''Punch''. ''The Times'' supplemented their obituary notice with a leading article. They described him as having done \"more than any man of his day to add to the gaiety of the nation.\"<ref name=death />\n\nA memorial service was held on 6 December in the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], which was \"crowded to overflowing\". On 7 December, the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' of the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] appeared with four pages of tributes to Herbert, by congressmen from Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Robert H. Land, chief of the Reference Department of the [[Library of Congress]], later said that \"[there is no] record or recollection of a similar tribute to another English writer in the proceedings of Congress.\"<ref name=death>Pound, pp. 299\u2013301.</ref>\n\n==References by other authors==\nIn his 1957 article \"Over Seventy\", lamenting the decline of the humorist, [[P. G. Wodehouse]] wrote: \"I want to see an A. P. Herbert on every street corner, an [[Alex Atkinson]] in every [[Public house|local]].\"\n\nThe title of [[Alexandra Fuller]]'s 2001 memoir ''[[Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood]]'' is taken from a Herbert quote, \"Don't let's go to the dogs tonight, for Mother will be there.\"<ref>[Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight] Cited from epigraph.</ref>\n\n==\"Misleading cases\"==\n[[File:UnCommonLaw1979Cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Uncommon Law]],'' collecting ''Misleading Cases in the Common Law'']]\n{{details|Uncommon Law}}\nStarting in 1910, he contributed regularly to ''[[Punch Magazine|Punch]]''. One series of his it took was ''[[Uncommon Law|Misleading Cases in the Common Law]]'' \u2013 the work for which he is best remembered. These were satirical pieces in the form of \"[[law reports]]\" or \"[[Legal judgment|judgement]]s\" on various aspects of the English legal and judicial system. Many featured the exploits of Albert Haddock, a tireless and veteran litigant. One of the best-known and most colourful is ''[[Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock]],'' also known as \"The Negotiable Cow\". Even the title is a humorous allusion to the entirely serious \"Smith's Leading Cases\". Herbert often referred to himself as \"A. P. Haddock\" in skits in ''Punch'' magazine, whether or not these had a courtroom setting.\n\nThanks to their realism, they were on several occasions mistakenly reported by newspapers both in Britain and elsewhere as factual. One of the \"cases\", supposedly establishing a novel crime of \"doing what you like\", was sharply criticised by an American [[law review]] article, whose author failed to note its entire absurdity.<ref>''Uncommon Law'', ''Rex v Haddock'': Is it a free country?, 5, pp. 24\u201329. Haddock is arrested for jumping into the [[River Thames]] from [[Hammersmith Bridge]]. When questioned to motive, Haddock replies, \"For fun\". The judge sums up: \"The appellant made the general answer that this was a free country and a man can do what he likes if he does nobody any harm.... It cannot be too clearly understood that this is ''not'' a free country, and it will be an evil day for the legal profession when it is... and least of all may they do unusual actions 'for fun'. People must not do things for fun. There is no reference to fun in any Act of Parliament.\"</ref> As such they are examples of the literary technique known as [[false document]]. And while in these fictitious law reports, the fictitious judges and lawyers regularly cited various real and venerable authorities, such as [[Henry de Bracton]], they were prone also to citing texts of Herbert's own imagination such as \"Wedderburn on Water Courses\" and \"A. Capone's Handbook for Bootleggers\".\n\nMore importantly, these cases were Herbert's vehicles for his law-reform work. Beneath their satire, they often carried cogent and sharp legal or political points that tied into his personal crusades against obsolescent legislation. Although fictional, they are, consequently, sometimes quoted in judicial decisions,<ref>See for example [http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/Messing_BankAmerica0703.pdf Messing v Bank of America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319153809/http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/Messing_BankAmerica0703.pdf |date=19 March 2006 }}(2002) at paragraph 1, and [http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1999/214.html Victor Chandler International Ltd v The Commissioners of Custom and Excise and Teletext Limited] 1999 EWHC Ch 214, para 11, where [[Gavin Lightman (judge)|Mr Justice Lightman]] stated that a document, in the context of the [[Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981]], \"must be inanimate: neither a person nor A.

The English use [[Right- and left-hand traffic|left-hand traffic]] but the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] dictate right-hand traffic.</ref>\n\nOver his lifetime Herbert published five collections, entitled ''[[Misleading Cases in the Common Law]]'', ''[[More Misleading Cases]]'', ''[[Still More Misleading Cases]]'', ''[[Codd's Last Case]]'' and ''[[Bardot M.P.?]]''. Stray cases also appear in his collections of miscellaneous humorous essays, such as ''[[General Cargo]]''. Virtually all the cases were assembled into two omnibus volumes, ''[[Uncommon Law]]'' in 1935 and ''[[More Uncommon Law]]'' in 1982. A shorter selection, ''[[Wigs at Work]]'', appeared in 1966.\n\nThe [[BBC]] successfully adapted them for television as three series of ''[[A P Herbert's Misleading Cases]]'' (1967, 1968 and 1971), with [[Roy Dotrice]] as Haddock and [[Alastair Sim]] as the judge, Mr Justice Swallow.\n\n==Novels and other writings==\nHerbert wrote eight novels, including ''[[The Water Gipsies (novel)|The Water Gipsies]]'' (1930), and 15 plays, including the light operas ''[[Tantivy Towers]]'' (1931) and ''Big Ben'' (1946), and the comedy ''[[Bless the Bride]]'' (1947), which ran for two-and-a-quarter years in London.\n\nIn addition to his fiction, Herbert wrote ''[[What a Word!]]'' in 1935, continuing his campaign in ''Punch'' for better use of English, including a section on \"Plain English\", more than a decade ahead of Sir [[Ernest Gowers]]'s more celebrated work. Characteristically, Herbert uses humour to make his serious points about good writing. He was the author of the lyrics of the patriotic song \"[[Song of Liberty]]\", set in 1940 to the music of Edward [[Elgar]]'s ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches|Pomp and Circumstance March No. 4]]''. In 1944, a set of posters by [[Eric Kennington]], a personal friend, called ''Seeing It Through'', were accompanied by poems by Herbert. They describe the work of certain professionals in London in the war. After the war he wrote a booklet called \"The War Story of [[Southend Pier]]\" detailing an account of when the pier was taken over by the Royal Navy in World War II.\n\nIn 1967, Herbert published ''[[Sundials Old and New; or, Fun with the Sun]]''; a book describing in detail his long fascination with, and experiments in, sundial technology. In the book, he describes all manner of sundials, and recounts many of his experiments in designing and building a number of different models, including a few that could be used to tell your position on the earth as well as the local time.\n\nIn 1970 Herbert published ''[[A.P.H., His Life and Times]]'', dedicated to \"My dear wife, for our 56th anniversary\".\n\n==Selected filmography==\n*''[[Tell England (film)|Tell England]]'' (1931)\n*''[[Waltz Time (1933 film)|Waltz Time]]'' (1933)\n\n==Publications==\n===General===\n*''[[The Secret Battle]]'', 1919, Methuen (A novel about a soldier executed for cowardice.)\n*''[[The House by the River]]'', 1921, Methuen (A novel about a war poet who commits a murder.)

It operates on St. Clair Avenue{{Snd}}between Yonge Street and the [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]] subway{{Snd}}and Gunns Road, just west of Keele Street.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Toronto Civic Railways]] opened the St. Clair streetcar route in 1913 along [[St. Clair Avenue|St. Clair Avenue West]] between Yonge Street and the Grand Trunk Railway crossing (near today's Caledonia Road) to serve small developed areas in a newly annexed section of the city. Previously, the only streetcar service near this area was the Davenport line of the [[Toronto Suburban Railway]] (along Davenport Road) and the Avenue route of the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (ending at Avenue Road and St. Clair Avenue). At the east end of the St. Clair line, passengers could connect with the radial cars of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway (Toronto)|Metropolitan line]] of the [[Toronto and York Radial Railway]] running on Yonge Street. The St. Clair line was double-track but had no loops or wyes; thus, all streetcars were double-ended.{{sfn|Hood|1986|pages= 22\u201330}}\n\nAfter its creation in 1921, the [[Toronto Transit Commission|Toronto Transportation Commission]] took over the assets of the Toronto Civic Railways and the Toronto Railway Company with the goal to connect and integrate the two separate streetcar systems. With respect to St. Clair, the TTC expanded the line eastwards and westwards, adding turning loops at end points and replacing double-ended streetcars with single-ended cars (initially ex\u2013TRC cars). At the east end, the line would continue north from St. Clair Avenue East on Mount Pleasant Road to [[Eglinton Avenue]]; however, this portion would later become a separate route that was subsequently converted to bus operation in the 1970s.{{sfn|Hood|1986|pages= 22\u201330}}\n\nBy 1930, the Bay streetcar route was running north on Avenue Road and then west on St. Clair Avenue. Passengers could travel from St. Clair Avenue and Caledonia Road to Bay Street and Queens Quay.<ref name=\"TT-1930\" /> By 1932, Earlscourt Loop at St. Clair Avenue and Lansdowne Avenue became the western terminus of the Bay route.<ref name=\"TT-1932\" /> With the opening of the Yonge subway in 1954, the Bay route disappeared, and the Earlscourt route was created to replace the St. Clair portion of the former Bay route. The Earlscourt route ran between St. Clair station and Earlscourt Loop overlapping the St. Clair route.<ref name=\"TT-1954\" /> About 1978, the Earlscourt route was merged into 512 St. Clair.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=18%|Date\n!

A dedicated right-of-way is a lane generally in the centre of the street, reserved for transit vehicles. However, it was removed between 1928 and 1935 and replaced with paved trackage open to mixed traffic.<ref name=\"Treehugger2013-11-25\" /><ref name=\"Toronto\" />\n\nHowever, since then, road traffic had increased and was degrading the reliability of streetcar service. Given the success of the new 510 Spadina route along dedicated right-of-ways on Spadina and Queens Quay and on portions on several streetcar routes, the TTC proposed to upgrade the St. Clair streetcar line to a dedicated right-of-way.<ref name=\"Toronto\" /> The tracks along the route needed replacement, and the TTC estimated that building a dedicated right-of-way would cost only $7 million more than simply replacing the tracks. Furthermore, St. Clair Avenue is one of the few streets in Toronto wide enough to accommodate a dedicated right-of-way without significantly reducing the width of traffic lanes.\n\nIn 2004, Toronto City Council decided to proceed with the proposal. Construction started on September 25, 2005 and was completed in three stages: From St. Clair station to Vaughan Road on February 18, 2007,<ref name=\"Toronto\" /> to Lansdowne Avenue on December 20, 2009,<ref name=\"TTC-2009-12-17\" /> and finally with full service to Gunns Loop on June 30, 2010.<ref name=\"TTC-2010-06-30\" />{{sfn|Springirth|2014|pp=105, 113}} On December 19, 2009, the day prior to the opening of the section from Vaughan Road to Lansdowne Avenue, there was a pre-opening event utilizing the TTC's two remaining [[PCC streetcar|PCC]] streetcars.\n\n===Time-based transfers===\n{{See also|Toronto Transit Commission fares}}\n\n====St. Clair Pilot (2005\u20132017)====\nFrom July 31, 2005, until September 2, 2017, the TTC ran a [[pilot project]] of providing 2-hour time-based transfers<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Transfers/Time_based_transfers.jsp | title=Time-based Transfers: 512 St Clair Pilot Program | website=Toronto Transit Commission | url-status=dead | access-date=January 21, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202154123/http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Transfers/Time_based_transfers.jsp | archive-date=February 2, 2014 }}</ref> on this route as a temporary measure to support business along St. Clair during the construction projects of the new dedicated streetcar [[right-of-way]] scheme, under which passengers who took a paper transfer after paying their fares by cash or tokens were allowed to disembark and re-board another 512 streetcar, even one going in the opposite direction, as long as they did so within 2 hours of their original boarding. This meant that one could stop part-way through a journey and then continue, or even make a round trip, without paying multiple fares. From December 14, 2015, until the September 3, 2017, passengers who paid by cash or token were required to obtain a time-based paper transfer as a result of the [[proof-of-payment]] (POP) system that had come into effect on all TTC streetcar routes as passengers could have been asked at any time to show POP. At the time, the [[Presto card]] readers on the 512 cars were not configured to handle this special route-specific time-based transfer pilot scheme. Presto users who wished to take advantage of the project were required to board at the front door of the vehicle in order to obtain the special paper time-based transfer after tapping their cards on the fare reader there, or else they would have been charged another fare every time they re-tapped on the same route. The pilot program was discontinued on September 3, 2017, the same day the new [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|Flexity Outlook]] streetcars were deployed on the 512 route, as drivers of the new streetcars are situated inside a fully enclosed cab and are not responsible for handling fare collection or providing paper transfers.<ref name=\"BlogTO-2017-07\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2017/07/ttc-end-time-based-transfer-program/ |title=TTC to end time-based transfer program |publisher=BlogTO |first=Jeremy  |last=Gilbert |date=July 2017 |accessdate=April 5, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n====Presto====\nThe TTC reintroduced a 2-hour time-based transfer on August 26, 2018, but this time system-wide rather than for just the 512 route.

At that time, transit advocate [[Steve Munro]] was of the opinion that extensions west of Gunns Loop may lack the ridership to be justified.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2007-08-07\">{{cite web |url=https://stevemunro.ca/2007/08/07/st-clair-extension-trial/ |title=St. Clair Extension Trial? |publisher=[[Steve Munro]] |first=Steve |last=Munro |date=August 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 27, 2018 |quote=If St. Clair from Keele to Jane is a potential streetcar line, then there should be a lot more riders than the level of service on the 71 (Runnymede) suggests. }}</ref>\n\nThe first proposal would see Route 512 extended west along St. Clair Avenue West to Runnymede Road, and south underneath the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] Galt Subdivision line to a bus loop at Runnymede Road and Dundas Street West, replacing a portion of route 71A Runnymede. Streetcar tracks would then be extended southeast along Dundas Street West to [[Dundas West (TTC)|Dundas West Station]] where the [[504 King]] and 505 Dundas streetcar routes currently terminate. The tracks on Dundas would be served by a new route replacing the current 40 Junction bus route. While this scheme may not be warranted by potential ridership, it would cut down the amount of deadhead (not-in-service) time required by St. Clair streetcars to get to St. Clair Avenue.\n\nThe other proposal comes as part of [[Transit City]], the Light Rail expansion proposal. It would see route 512 extended west on St. Clair all the way to Jane Street, replacing portions of routes 71A Runnymede (now replaced by route 189 Stockyards) and 79B Scarlett Road, where it would connect with a planned [[Jane LRT|Jane Street LRT]].\n\n==Route description==\nRoute 512 St. Clair serves St. Clair Avenue between [[St. Clair station]] at the east end of the line and [[Gunns Loop]] at Gunns Road at the west end. The route passes through [[St. Clair West station]] in both directions. The route operates almost entirely within a dedicated streetcar right-of-way, with mixed traffic for a short distance east of Yonge Street and for very short distances at streetcar loops. There are five turning loops along the line; besides the station loops at St. Clair and St. Clair West stations, the other loops are Oakwood Loop at Oakwood Avenue, Earlscount Loop at Lansdowne Avenue and Gunns Loop at Gunns Road. The streetcar tracks along Bathurst Street and Vaughan Road are the only connection between the St. Clair streetcar line and the rest of the Toronto streetcar system.<ref name=\"TT-Map-2011\" />\n\nAccording to the TTC's Trip Planner,<ref>[http://www.ttc.ca/Trip_planner/index.jsp]</ref> it takes about 29 minutes to travel from St. Clair station to Gunns Loop. A 2011 ''[[Torontoist]]'' article confirmed this travel time measured shortly after the [[rush hour]].<ref name=\"Torontoist2011-04-05\" />\n\n[[File:512 St. Clair route Arlington westbound stop.jpg|right|thumb|Stop layout: Signaled crossing (right), shelter, artwork along shelter roof, planter (left)]]\n\nWith the exception of stops at turning loops, all stops along the route are on-street, surface stops with islands separating the regular traffic from the streetcar tracks, and have streetcar traffic signals, partial shelters, and railings to protect patrons from the traffic. One end of each platform connects to a pedestrian crossing at a signalized street intersection. The other end of the platform has a planter. There are 22 on-street stops serving both directions, and two serving just one direction: Old Stock Yards (eastbound) and Yonge (westbound), both near a terminus.\n\nHalf of the on-street stops have an artwork consisting of vertical panels along the shelter roof.

It operates on St Clair Avenue, between Yonge Street and the [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University]] subway and Gunns Road, just west of Keele Street.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Toronto Civic Railways]] opened the St. Clair streetcar route in 1913 along [[St. Clair Avenue|St. Clair Avenue West]] between Yonge Street and the Grand Trunk Railway crossing (near today's Caledonia Road) to serve small developed areas in a newly annexed section of the city. Previously, the only streetcar service near this area was the Davenport line of the [[Toronto Suburban Railway]] (along Davenport Road) and the Avenue route of the [[Toronto Railway Company]] (ending at Avenue Road and St. Clair Avenue). At the east end of the St. Clair line, passengers could connect with the radial cars of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway (Toronto)|Metropolitan line]] of the [[Toronto and York Radial Railway]] running on Yonge Street. The St. Clair line was double-track but had no loops or wyes; thus, all streetcars were double-ended.{{sfn|Hood|1986|pages= 22\u201330}}\n\nAfter its creation in 1921, the [[Toronto Transit Commission|Toronto Transportation Commission]] took over the assets of the Toronto Civic Railways and the Toronto Railway Company with the goal to connect and integrate the two separate streetcar systems. With respect to St. Clair, the TTC expanded the line eastwards and westwards, adding turning loops at end points and replacing double-ended streetcars with single-ended cars (initially ex\u2013TRC cars). At the east end, the line would continue north from St. Clair Avenue East on Mount Pleasant Road to [[Eglinton Avenue]]; however, this portion would later become a separate route that was subsequently converted to bus operation in the 1970s.{{sfn|Hood|1986|pages= 22\u201330}}\n\nBy 1930, the Bay streetcar route was running north on Avenue Road and then west on St. Clair Avenue. Passengers could travel from St. Clair Avenue and Caledonia Road to Bay Street and Queens Quay.<ref name=\"TT-1930\" /> By 1932, Earlscourt Loop at St. Clair Avenue and Lansdowne Avenue became the western terminus of the Bay route.<ref name=\"TT-1932\" /> With the opening of the Yonge subway in 1954, the Bay route disappeared, and the Earlscourt route was created to replace the St. Clair portion of the former Bay route. The Earlscourt route ran between St. Clair station and Earlscourt Loop overlapping the St. Clair route.<ref name=\"TT-1954\" /> About 1978, the Earlscourt route was merged into 512 St. Clair.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=18%|Date\n!

A dedicated right-of-way is a lane generally in the centre of the street, reserved for transit vehicles. However, it was removed between 1928 and 1935 and replaced with paved trackage open to mixed traffic.<ref name=\"Treehugger2013-11-25\" /><ref name=\"Toronto\" />\n\nHowever, since then, road traffic had increased and was degrading the reliability of streetcar service. Given the success of the new 510 Spadina route along dedicated right-of-ways on Spadina and Queens Quay and on portions on several streetcar routes, the TTC proposed to upgrade the St. Clair streetcar line to a dedicated right-of-way.<ref name=\"Toronto\" /> The tracks along the route needed replacement, and the TTC estimated that building a dedicated right-of-way would cost only $7 million more than simply replacing the tracks. Furthermore, St. Clair Avenue is one of the few streets in Toronto wide enough to accommodate a dedicated right-of-way without significantly reducing the width of traffic lanes.\n\nIn 2004, Toronto City Council decided to proceed with the proposal. Construction started on September 25, 2005 and was completed in three stages: From St. Clair station to Vaughan Road on February 18, 2007,<ref name=\"Toronto\" /> to Lansdowne Avenue on December 20, 2009,<ref name=\"TTC-2009-12-17\" /> and finally with full service to Gunns Loop on June 30, 2010.<ref name=\"TTC-2010-06-30\" />{{sfn|Springirth|2014|pp=105, 113}} On December 19, 2009, the day prior to the opening of the section from Vaughan Road to Lansdowne Avenue, there was a pre-opening event utilizing the TTC's two remaining [[PCC streetcar|PCC]] streetcars.\n\n===Time-based transfers===\n{{See also|Toronto Transit Commission fares}}\n\n====St. Clair Pilot (2005\u20132017)====\nFrom July 31, 2005, until September 2, 2017, the TTC ran a [[pilot project]] of providing 2-hour time-based transfers<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Transfers/Time_based_transfers.jsp | title=Time-based Transfers: 512 St Clair Pilot Program | website=Toronto Transit Commission | url-status=dead | access-date=January 21, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202154123/http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Transfers/Time_based_transfers.jsp | archive-date=February 2, 2014 }}</ref> on this route as a temporary measure to support business along St. Clair during the construction projects of the new dedicated streetcar [[right-of-way]] scheme, under which passengers who took a paper transfer after paying their fares by cash or tokens were allowed to disembark and re-board another 512 streetcar, even one going in the opposite direction, as long as they did so within 2 hours of their original boarding. This meant that one could stop part-way through a journey and then continue, or even make a round trip, without paying multiple fares. From December 14, 2015, until the September 3, 2017, passengers who paid by cash or token were required to obtain a time-based paper transfer as a result of the [[proof-of-payment]] (POP) system that had come into effect on all TTC streetcar routes as passengers could have been asked at any time to show POP. At the time, the [[Presto card]] readers on the 512 cars were not configured to handle this special route-specific time-based transfer pilot scheme. Presto users who wished to take advantage of the project were required to board at the front door of the vehicle in order to obtain the special paper time-based transfer after tapping their cards on the fare reader there, or else they would have been charged another fare every time they re-tapped on the same route. The pilot program was discontinued on September 3, 2017, the same day the new [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|Flexity Outlook]] streetcars were deployed on the 512 route, as drivers of the new streetcars are situated inside a fully enclosed cab and are not responsible for handling fare collection or providing paper transfers.<ref name=\"BlogTO-2017-07\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2017/07/ttc-end-time-based-transfer-program/ |title=TTC to end time-based transfer program |publisher=BlogTO |first=Jeremy  |last=Gilbert |date=July 2017 |accessdate=April 5, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n====Presto====\nThe TTC reintroduced a 2-hour time-based transfer on August 26, 2018, but this time system-wide rather than for just the 512 route.

At that time, transit advocate [[Steve Munro]] was of the opinion that extensions west of Gunns Loop may lack the ridership to be justified.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2007-08-07\">{{cite web |url=https://stevemunro.ca/2007/08/07/st-clair-extension-trial/ |title=St. Clair Extension Trial? |publisher=[[Steve Munro]] |first=Steve |last=Munro |date=August 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 27, 2018 |quote=If St. Clair from Keele to Jane is a potential streetcar line, then there should be a lot more riders than the level of service on the 71 (Runnymede) suggests. }}</ref>\n\nThe first proposal would see Route 512 extended west along St. Clair Avenue West to Runnymede Road, and south underneath the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] Galt Subdivision line to a bus loop at Runnymede Road and Dundas Street West, replacing a portion of route 71A Runnymede. Streetcar tracks would then be extended southeast along Dundas Street West to [[Dundas West (TTC)|Dundas West Station]] where the [[504 King]] and 505 Dundas streetcar routes currently terminate. The tracks on Dundas would be served by a new route replacing the current 40 Junction bus route. While this scheme may not be warranted by potential ridership, it would cut down the amount of deadhead (not-in-service) time required by St. Clair streetcars to get to St. Clair Avenue.\n\nThe other proposal comes as part of [[Transit City]], the Light Rail expansion proposal. It would see route 512 extended west on St. Clair all the way to Jane Street, replacing portions of routes 71A Runnymede (now replaced by route 189 Stockyards) and 79B Scarlett Road, where it would connect with a planned [[Jane LRT|Jane Street LRT]].\n\n==Route description==\nRoute 512 St. Clair serves St. Clair Avenue between [[St. Clair station]] at the east end of the line and [[Gunns Loop]] at Gunns Road at the west end. The route passes through [[St. Clair West station]] in both directions. The route operates almost entirely within a dedicated streetcar right-of-way, with mixed traffic for a short distance east of Yonge Street and for very short distances at streetcar loops. There are five turning loops along the line; besides the station loops at St. Clair and St. Clair West stations, the other loops are Oakwood Loop at Oakwood Avenue, Earlscount Loop at Lansdowne Avenue and Gunns Loop at Gunns Road. The streetcar tracks along Bathurst Street and Vaughan Road are the only connection between the St. Clair streetcar line and the rest of the Toronto streetcar system.<ref name=\"TT-Map-2011\" />\n\nAccording to the TTC's Trip Planner,<ref>[http://www.ttc.ca/Trip_planner/index.jsp]</ref> it takes about 29 minutes to travel from St. Clair station to Gunns Loop. A 2011 ''[[Torontoist]]'' article confirmed this travel time measured shortly after the [[rush hour]].<ref name=\"Torontoist2011-04-05\" />\n\n[[File:512 St. Clair route Arlington westbound stop.jpg|right|thumb|Stop layout: Signaled crossing (right), shelter, artwork along shelter roof, planter (left)]]\n\nWith the exception of stops at turning loops, all stops along the route are on-street, surface stops with islands separating the regular traffic from the streetcar tracks, and have streetcar traffic signals, partial shelters, and railings to protect patrons from the traffic. One end of each platform connects to a pedestrian crossing at a signalized street intersection. The other end of the platform has a planter. There are 22 on-street stops serving both directions, and two serving just one direction: Old Stock Yards (eastbound) and Yonge (westbound), both near a terminus.\n\nHalf of the on-street stops have an artwork consisting of vertical panels along the shelter roof. If a on-street stop has both east- and westbound platforms, then only one of the two platforms would display an artwork. Various artists were selected by competition to design the art pieces.<ref name=\"Torontoist-2011-07-20\" />\n\n===Night route===\n\n312 St Clair\u2013Junction operates during the overnight period.

However, HTTPS signals the browser to use an added encryption layer of SSL/TLS to protect the traffic. SSL/TLS is especially suited for HTTP, since it can provide some protection even if only one side of the communication is [[authentication|authenticated]]. This is the case with HTTP transactions over the Internet, where typically only the [[Web server|server]] is authenticated (by the client examining the server's [[public key certificate|certificate]]).\n\nHTTPS creates a secure channel over an insecure network. This ensures reasonable protection from [[eavesdropping|eavesdroppers]] and [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s, provided that adequate [[cipher suite]]s are used and that the server certificate is verified and trusted.\n\nBecause HTTPS piggybacks HTTP entirely on top of TLS, the entirety of the underlying HTTP protocol can be encrypted. This includes the request URL (which particular web page was requested), query parameters, headers, and cookies (which often contain identity information about the user). However, because host (website) addresses and [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port]] numbers are necessarily part of the underlying [[TCP/IP]] protocols, HTTPS cannot protect their disclosure. In practice this means that even on a correctly configured web server, eavesdroppers can infer the IP address and port number of the web server (sometimes even the domain name e.g. www.example.org, but not the rest of the URL) that one is communicating with, as well as the amount (data transferred) and duration (length of session) of the communication, though not the content of the communication.<ref name=httpse/>\n\nWeb browsers know how to trust HTTPS websites based on [[Certificate authority|certificate authorities]] that come pre-installed in their software. Certificate authorities (such as [[Let's Encrypt]], [[Digicert]], [[Sectigo]], [[GoDaddy]] and [[GlobalSign]]) are in this way being trusted by web browser creators to provide valid certificates. Therefore, a user should trust an HTTPS connection to a website [[if and only if]] all of the following are true:\n\n* The user trusts that the browser software correctly implements HTTPS with correctly pre-installed certificate authorities.\n* The user trusts the certificate authority to vouch only for legitimate websites.\n* The website provides a valid certificate, which means it was signed by a trusted authority.\n* The certificate correctly identifies the website (e.g., when the browser visits \"https://example.com\", the received certificate is properly for \"example.com\" and not some other entity).\n* The user trusts that the protocol's encryption layer (SSL/TLS) is sufficiently secure against eavesdroppers.\n\nHTTPS is especially important over insecure networks (such as public [[Wi-Fi]] access points), as anyone on the same local network can [[packet analyzer|packet-sniff]] and discover sensitive information not protected by HTTPS. Additionally, many free to use and paid [[wireless LAN|WLAN]] networks engage in [[packet injection]] in order to serve their own ads on webpages. However, this can be exploited maliciously in many ways, such as injecting [[malware]] onto webpages and stealing users' private information.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hotel Wifi JavaScript Injection |url=https://justinsomnia.org/2012/04/hotel-wifi-javascript-injection/ |date=2012-04-03 |work=JustInsomnia |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118154608/https://justinsomnia.org/2012/04/hotel-wifi-javascript-injection/ |archive-date=2018-11-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHTTPS is also very important for connections over the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], as malicious Tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection.

[[X.509]] certificates are used to authenticate the server (and sometimes the client as well). As a consequence, [[certificate authority|certificate authorities]] and [[public key certificate]]s are necessary to verify the relation between the certificate and its owner, as well as to generate, sign, and administer the validity of certificates. While this can be more beneficial than verifying the identities via a [[web of trust]], the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] drew attention to certificate authorities as a potential weak point allowing [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/packet-forensics/ |title=Law Enforcement Appliance Subverts SSL |journal=Wired |date=2010-03-24 |first=Ryan |last=Singel |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117142906/https://www.wired.com/2010/03/packet-forensics/ |archive-date=2019-01-17 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/researchers-reveal-likelihood-governments-fake-ssl |title=New Research Suggests That Governments May Fake SSL Certificates |first=Seth |last=Schoen |work=EFF |date=2010-03-24 |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104234608/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/researchers-reveal-likelihood-governments-fake-ssl |archive-date=2016-01-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> An important property in this context is [[forward secrecy]], which ensures that encrypted communications recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future.

Also having only a certain page that contains sensitive information (such as a log-in page) of a website loaded over HTTPS, while having the rest of the website loaded over plain HTTP, will expose the user to attacks. On a site that has sensitive information somewhere on it, every time that site is accessed with HTTP instead of HTTPS, the user and the session will get exposed. Similarly, [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] on a site served through HTTPS have to have the [[secure cookie|secure attribute]] enabled.<ref name=deployhttpscorrectly/>\n\n==Technical==\n\n===Difference from HTTP===\nHTTPS [[URL]]s begin with \"https://\" and use [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port]] 443 by default, whereas, [[HTTP]] URLs begin with \"http://\" and use port 80 by default.\n\nHTTP is not encrypted and thus is vulnerable to [[man-in-the-middle]] and [[eavesdropping attack]]s, which can let attackers gain access to website accounts and sensitive information, and modify webpages to inject [[malware]] or advertisements. HTTPS is designed to withstand such attacks and is considered secure against them (with the exception of older, deprecated versions of SSL).\n\n===Network layers===\nHTTP operates at the highest layer of the [[TCP/IP model]], the [[Application layer]]; as does the [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] security protocol (operating as a lower sublayer of the same layer), which encrypts an HTTP message prior to transmission and decrypts a message upon arrival. Strictly speaking, HTTPS is not a separate protocol, but refers to use of ordinary [[HTTP]] over an [[encryption|encrypted]] SSL/TLS connection.\n\nHTTPS encrypts all message contents, including the HTTP headers and the request/response data. With the exception of the possible [[Chosen-ciphertext attack|CCA]] cryptographic attack described in the [[#Limitations|limitations]] section below, an attacker should only be able to discover that a connection is taking place between the two parties and their domain names and IP addresses.\n\n===Server setup===\nTo prepare a web server to accept HTTPS connections, the administrator must create a [[public key certificate]] for the web server. This certificate must be signed by a trusted [[certificate authority]] for the web browser to accept it without warning. The authority certifies that the certificate holder is the operator of the web server that presents it. Web browsers are generally distributed with a list of [[root certificate|signing certificates of major certificate authorities]] so that they can verify certificates signed by them.\n\n====Acquiring certificates====\nA number of commercial [[Certificate authority|certificate authorities]] exist, offering paid-for SSL/TLS certificates of a number of types, including [[Extended Validation Certificate]]s.\n\n[[Let's Encrypt]], launched in April 2016,<ref name=\"softpedia-launch\">{{cite web |url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/let-s-encrypt-launched-today-currently-protects-3-8-million-domains-502857.shtml |title=Let's Encrypt Launched Today, Currently Protects 3.8 Million Domains |publisher=Softpedia News |first=Catalin |last=Cimpanu |date=2016-04-12 |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209055129/https://news.softpedia.com/news/let-s-encrypt-launched-today-currently-protects-3-8-million-domains-502857.shtml |archive-date=2019-02-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> provides free and automated service that delivers basic SSL/TLS certificates to websites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eweek.com/security/let-s-encrypt-effort-aims-to-improve-internet-security |title=Let's Encrypt Effort Aims to Improve Internet Security |publisher=Quinstreet Enterprise |website=eWeek.com |date=2014-11-18 |access-date=2018-10-20 |last=Kerner |first=Sean Michael}}</ref> According to the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], Let's Encrypt will make switching from HTTP to HTTPS \"as easy as issuing one command, or clicking one button.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/certificate-authority-encrypt-entire-web |title=Launching in 2015: A Certificate Authority to Encrypt the Entire Web |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=2014-11-18 |access-date=2018-10-20 |last=Eckersley |first=Peter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118160126/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/certificate-authority-encrypt-entire-web |archive-date=2018-11-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> The majority of web hosts and cloud providers now leverage Let's Encrypt, providing free certificates to their customers.\n\n====Use as access control====\nThe system can also be used for client [[authentication]] in order to limit access to a web server to authorized users. To do this, the site administrator typically creates a certificate for each user, a certificate that is loaded into their browser. Normally, that contains the name and e-mail address of the authorized user and is automatically checked by the server on each reconnect to verify the user's identity, potentially without even entering a password.\n\n====In case of compromised secret (private) key====\n{{Update|section|date=April 2019|reason=Out of date}}\nAn important property in this context is [[forward secrecy|perfect forward secrecy]] (PFS).

[[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange]] (DHE) and [[Elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] key exchange (ECDHE) are in 2013 the only ones known to have that property.

If, for any reasons (routing, traffic optimization, etc.), this front machine is not the application server and it has to decipher data, solutions have to be found to propagate user authentication information or certificate to the application server, which needs to know who is going to be connected.\n* For SSL/TLS with mutual authentication, the SSL/TLS session is managed by the first server that initiates the connection. In situations where encryption has to be propagated along chained servers, session timeOut management becomes extremely tricky to implement.\n* With mutual SSL/TLS, security is maximal, but on the client-side, there is no way to properly end the SSL/TLS connection and disconnect the user except by waiting for the server session to expire or closing all related client applications.\n\nA sophisticated type of [[man-in-the-middle attack]] called SSL stripping was presented at the [[Black hat (computer security)|Blackhat]] Conference 2009. This type of attack defeats the security provided by HTTPS by changing the {{code|https:}} link into an {{code|http:}} link, taking advantage of the fact that few Internet users actually type \"https\" into their browser interface: they get to a secure site by clicking on a link, and thus are fooled into thinking that they are using HTTPS when in fact they are using HTTP. The attacker then communicates in clear with the client.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/index.html |title=sslstrip 0.9 |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620042059/https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/index.html |archive-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> This prompted the development of a countermeasure in HTTP called [[HTTP Strict Transport Security]].\n\nHTTPS has been shown vulnerable to a range of [[traffic analysis]] attacks. Traffic analysis attacks are a type of [[side-channel attack]] that relies on variations in the timing and size of traffic in order to infer properties about the encrypted traffic itself. Traffic analysis is possible because SSL/TLS encryption changes the contents of traffic, but has minimal impact on the size and timing of traffic.  In May 2010, a research paper by researchers from [[Microsoft Research]] and [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] discovered that detailed sensitive user data can be inferred from side channels such as packet sizes. More specifically, the researchers found that an eavesdropper can infer the illnesses/medications/surgeries of the user, his/her family income and investment secrets, despite HTTPS protection in several high-profile, top-of-the-line web applications in healthcare, taxation, investment and web search.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/side-channel-leaks-in-web-applications-a-reality-today-a-challenge-tomorrow/ |title=Side-Channel Leaks in Web Applications: a Reality Today, a Challenge Tomorrow |journal=Microsoft Research |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] Symposium on Security & Privacy 2010 |date=2010-05-20 |author1=Shuo Chen |author2=Rui Wang |author3=XiaoFeng Wang |author4=Kehuan Zhang |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722120329/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/side-channel-leaks-in-web-applications-a-reality-today-a-challenge-tomorrow/ |archive-date=2018-07-22 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although this work demonstrated vulnerability of HTTPS to traffic analysis, the approach presented by the authors required manual analysis and focused specifically on web applications protected by HTTPS.\n\nThe fact that most modern websites, including Google, Yahoo!, and Amazon, use HTTPS causes problems for many users trying to access public Wi-Fi hot spots, because a Wi-Fi hot spot login page fails to load if the user tries to open an HTTPS resource.<ref>{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Guaay |url=https://zapier.com/blog/open-wifi-login-page/ |title=How to Force a Public Wi-Fi Network Login Page to Open |date=2017-09-21 |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810143254/https://zapier.com/blog/open-wifi-login-page/ |archive-date=2018-08-10 |url-status=live }}</ref> Several websites, such as [http://neverssl.com/ neverssl.com] or [http://www.nonhttps.com nonhttps.com], guarantee that they will always remain accessible by HTTP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://neverssl.com/ |title=NeverSSL |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901224536/http://neverssl.com/ |archive-date=2018-09-01 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nonhttps.com |title=a non https website |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017052428/http://www.nonhttps.com/ |archive-date=2018-10-17 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Netscape Communications]] created HTTPS in 1994 for its [[Netscape Navigator]] web browser.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLvsis4_QhEC&pg=PA344 |title=Embedded Software: The Works |last=Walls |first=Colin |year=2005 |pages=344 |isbn=0-7506-7954-9 |publisher=Newnes |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209055124/https://books.google.com/books?id=FLvsis4_QhEC&pg=PA344 |archive-date=2019-02-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> Originally, HTTPS was used with the [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] protocol.

However, HTTPS signals the browser to use an added encryption layer of SSL/TLS to protect the traffic. SSL/TLS is especially suited for HTTP, since it can provide some protection even if only one side of the communication is [[authentication|authenticated]]. This is the case with HTTP transactions over the Internet, where typically only the [[Web server|server]] is authenticated (by the client examining the server's [[public key certificate|certificate]]).\n\nHTTPS creates a secure channel over an insecure network. This ensures reasonable protection from [[eavesdropping|eavesdroppers]] and [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s, provided that adequate [[cipher suite]]s are used and that the server certificate is verified and trusted.\n\nBecause HTTPS piggybacks HTTP entirely on top of TLS, the entirety of the underlying HTTP protocol can be encrypted. This includes the request URL (which particular web page was requested), query parameters, headers, and cookies (which often contain identity information about the user). However, because host (website) addresses and [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port]] numbers are necessarily part of the underlying [[TCP/IP]] protocols, HTTPS cannot protect their disclosure. In practice this means that even on a correctly configured web server, eavesdroppers can infer the IP address and port number of the web server (sometimes even the domain name e.g. www.example.org, but not the rest of the URL) that one is communicating with, as well as the amount (data transferred) and duration (length of session) of the communication, though not the content of the communication.<ref name=httpse/>\n\nWeb browsers know how to trust HTTPS websites based on [[Certificate authority|certificate authorities]] that come pre-installed in their software. Certificate authorities (such as [[Let's Encrypt]], [[Digicert]], [[Sectigo]], [[GoDaddy]] and [[GlobalSign]]) are in this way being trusted by web browser creators to provide valid certificates. Therefore, a user should trust an HTTPS connection to a website [[if and only if]] all of the following are true:\n\n* The user trusts that the browser software correctly implements HTTPS with correctly pre-installed certificate authorities.\n* The user trusts the certificate authority to vouch only for legitimate websites.\n* The website provides a valid certificate, which means it was signed by a trusted authority.\n* The certificate correctly identifies the website (e.g., when the browser visits \"https://example.com\", the received certificate is properly for \"example.com\" and not some other entity).\n* The user trusts that the protocol's encryption layer (SSL/TLS) is sufficiently secure against eavesdroppers.\n\nHTTPS is especially important over insecure networks (such as public [[Wi-Fi]] access points), as anyone on the same local network can [[packet analyzer|packet-sniff]] and discover sensitive information not protected by HTTPS. Additionally, many free to use and paid [[wireless LAN|WLAN]] networks engage in [[packet injection]] in order to serve their own ads on webpages. However, this can be exploited maliciously in many ways, such as injecting [[malware]] onto webpages and stealing users' private information.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hotel Wifi JavaScript Injection |url=https://justinsomnia.org/2012/04/hotel-wifi-javascript-injection/ |date=2012-04-03 |work=JustInsomnia |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118154608/https://justinsomnia.org/2012/04/hotel-wifi-javascript-injection/ |archive-date=2018-11-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHTTPS is also very important for connections over the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], as malicious Tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection.

HTTPS is designed to withstand such attacks and is considered secure against them (with the exception of older, deprecated versions of SSL).\n\n===Network layers===\nHTTP operates at the highest layer of the [[TCP/IP model]], the [[Application layer]]; as does the [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] security protocol (operating as a lower sublayer of the same layer), which encrypts an HTTP message prior to transmission and decrypts a message upon arrival. Strictly speaking, HTTPS is not a separate protocol, but refers to use of ordinary [[HTTP]] over an [[encryption|encrypted]] SSL/TLS connection.\n\nHTTPS encrypts all message contents, including the HTTP headers and the request/response data. With the exception of the possible [[Chosen-ciphertext attack|CCA]] cryptographic attack described in the [[#Limitations|limitations]] section below, an attacker should only be able to discover that a connection is taking place between the two parties and their domain names and IP addresses.\n\n===Server setup===\nTo prepare a web server to accept HTTPS connections, the administrator must create a [[public key certificate]] for the web server.

If, for any reasons (routing, traffic optimization, etc.), this front machine is not the application server and it has to decipher data, solutions have to be found to propagate user authentication information or certificate to the application server, which needs to know who is going to be connected.\n* For SSL/TLS with mutual authentication, the SSL/TLS session is managed by the first server that initiates the connection. In situations where encryption has to be propagated along chained servers, session timeOut management becomes extremely tricky to implement.\n* With mutual SSL/TLS, security is maximal, but on the client-side, there is no way to properly end the SSL/TLS connection and disconnect the user except by waiting for the server session to expire or closing all related client applications.\n\nA sophisticated type of [[man-in-the-middle attack]] called SSL stripping was presented at the [[Black hat (computer security)|Blackhat]] Conference 2009. This type of attack defeats the security provided by HTTPS by changing the {{code|https:}} link into an {{code|http:}} link, taking advantage of the fact that few Internet users actually type \"https\" into their browser interface: they get to a secure site by clicking on a link, and thus are fooled into thinking that they are using HTTPS when in fact they are using HTTP. The attacker then communicates in clear with the client.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/index.html |title=sslstrip 0.9 |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620042059/https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/index.html |archive-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> This prompted the development of a countermeasure in HTTP called [[HTTP Strict Transport Security]].\n\nHTTPS has been shown vulnerable to a range of [[traffic analysis]] attacks. Traffic analysis attacks are a type of [[side-channel attack]] that relies on variations in the timing and size of traffic in order to infer properties about the encrypted traffic itself. Traffic analysis is possible because SSL/TLS encryption changes the contents of traffic, but has minimal impact on the size and timing of traffic.  In May 2010, a research paper by researchers from [[Microsoft Research]] and [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] discovered that detailed sensitive user data can be inferred from side channels such as packet sizes. More specifically, the researchers found that an eavesdropper can infer the illnesses/medications/surgeries of the user, his/her family income and investment secrets, despite HTTPS protection in several high-profile, top-of-the-line web applications in healthcare, taxation, investment and web search.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/side-channel-leaks-in-web-applications-a-reality-today-a-challenge-tomorrow/ |title=Side-Channel Leaks in Web Applications: a Reality Today, a Challenge Tomorrow |journal=Microsoft Research |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] Symposium on Security & Privacy 2010 |date=2010-05-20 |author1=Shuo Chen |author2=Rui Wang |author3=XiaoFeng Wang |author4=Kehuan Zhang |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722120329/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/side-channel-leaks-in-web-applications-a-reality-today-a-challenge-tomorrow/ |archive-date=2018-07-22 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although this work demonstrated vulnerability of HTTPS to traffic analysis, the approach presented by the authors required manual analysis and focused specifically on web applications protected by HTTPS.\n\nThe fact that most modern websites, including Google, Yahoo!, and Amazon, use HTTPS causes problems for many users trying to access public Wi-Fi hot spots, because a Wi-Fi hot spot login page fails to load if the user tries to open an HTTPS resource.<ref>{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Guaay |url=https://zapier.com/blog/open-wifi-login-page/ |title=How to Force a Public Wi-Fi Network Login Page to Open |date=2017-09-21 |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810143254/https://zapier.com/blog/open-wifi-login-page/ |archive-date=2018-08-10 |url-status=live }}</ref> Several websites, such as [http://neverssl.com/ neverssl.com] or [http://www.nonhttps.com nonhttps.com], guarantee that they will always remain accessible by HTTP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://neverssl.com/ |title=NeverSSL |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901224536/http://neverssl.com/ |archive-date=2018-09-01 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nonhttps.com |title=a non https website |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017052428/http://www.nonhttps.com/ |archive-date=2018-10-17 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Netscape Communications]] created HTTPS in 1994 for its [[Netscape Navigator]] web browser.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLvsis4_QhEC&pg=PA344 |title=Embedded Software: The Works |last=Walls |first=Colin |year=2005 |pages=344 |isbn=0-7506-7954-9 |publisher=Newnes |access-date=2018-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209055124/https://books.google.com/books?id=FLvsis4_QhEC&pg=PA344 |archive-date=2019-02-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> Originally, HTTPS was used with the [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] protocol.

These were \"The Diggers\", one of the radical groups set up in the aftermath of the English Civil War and the execution of King Charles I in 1649. They seized land in the area and lived by simple farming. As well as debates about religion and how the country should be run at this time these groups complained that even the Parliamentary side in the Civil War was dominated by \"Grandees\" i.e. wealthy nobles who often spent their time in comfort conducting fatuous debates in Parliament while the less well off risked their lives in the war to defeat an absolutist system. They were the subject of a long campaign of harassment by a local landowner and were eventually removed in a questionable legal case. The wealthy leaders of their own side were also deeply alarmed about some of these radical ideas and also suppressed them. These events and facts are the subject of long standing authoritative historical study at most Universities in the UK but have recently been removed from this section by persons or organisations unknown.\n\n==Transport==\nThe [[M25 motorway]] has several junctions nearby and the [[A3 road|A3(M)]] from [[London]] bisects the borough.\n\nThe main north-south road is the [[A244 road|A244]]  for instance to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]] and starts in the borough at [[Walton Bridge]] leading to Esher and Oxshott then to [[Leatherhead]].  The east-west Leatherhead to [[Horsell|Horsell, Woking]] road, the [[A245 road|A245]] leads by Cobham and [[Brooklands|Brooklands, Weybridge]].\n\nAs to rail, the [[South West Main Line]] cuts through the borough, with four stations from [[Esher railway station|Esher]] to [[Weybridge railway station|Weybridge]], one of which several express services call at: [[Walton on Thames railway station|Walton on Thames]] in the [[Ashley Park]] estate of the south of the town.  The branch lines have services with four stations in the borough via [[Cobham and Stoke D'Abernon railway station|Cobham and Stoke D'Abernon]] to [[Guildford]]; and a branch to [[Thames Ditton railway station|Thames Ditton]] and [[Hampton Court railway station]] in [[East Molesey]], both within Transport for London's Zone 6.\n\nBus services include [[Transport for London|TfL]] [[oyster card]] services to East and West [[Molesey]], [[Hinchley Wood]], [[Claygate]] and [[Esher]].\n\nCycling is very popular, with the [[Thames Path]] passing through the north of the borough and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] hosting both of the main road cycling events in the borough with most of the road section around [[Hampton Court]] and with the sections of the routes taken to and from [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy is diverse, with a strong local service sector, including numerous bars and restaurants,<ref name=in/> homes built and being built for [[City of London|city]] workers as the majority of locations have access to one of the [[Home Counties]] fastest [[London Commuter Belt|commutes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/|title=National Rail Enquiries - Official source for UK train times and timetables|website=www.nationalrail.co.uk}}</ref> trades including interior supplies, fitting,<ref name=in/> gardening, golf course/landscape management and a developed public/education sector.

These were \"The Diggers\", one of the radical groups set up in the aftermath of the English Civil War and the execution of King Charles I in 1649. They seized land in the area and lived by simple farming. As well as debates about religion and how the country should be run at this time these groups complained that even the Parliamentary side in the Civil War was dominated by \"Grandees\" i.e. wealthy nobles who often spent their time in comfort conducting fatuous debates in Parliament while the less well off risked their lives in the war to defeat an absolutist system. They were the subject of a long campaign of harassment by a local landowner and were eventually removed in a questionable legal case. The wealthy leaders of their own side were also deeply alarmed about some of these radical ideas and also suppressed them. These events and facts are the subject of long standing authoritative historical study at most Universities in the UK but have recently been removed from this section by persons or organisations unknown.\n\n==Transport==\nThe [[M25 motorway]] has several junctions nearby and the [[A3 road|A3(M)]] from [[London]] bisects the borough.\n\nThe main north-south road is the [[A244 road|A244]]  for instance to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]] and starts in the borough at [[Walton Bridge]] leading to Esher and Oxshott then to [[Leatherhead]].  The east-west Leatherhead to [[Horsell|Horsell, Woking]] road, the [[A245 road|A245]] leads by Cobham and [[Brooklands|Brooklands, Weybridge]].\n\nAs to rail, the [[South West Main Line]] cuts through the borough, with four stations from [[Esher railway station|Esher]] to [[Weybridge railway station|Weybridge]], one of which several express services call at: [[Walton on Thames railway station|Walton on Thames]] in the [[Ashley Park]] estate of the south of the town.  The branch lines have services with four stations in the borough via [[Cobham and Stoke D'Abernon railway station|Cobham and Stoke D'Abernon]] to [[Guildford]]; and a branch to [[Thames Ditton railway station|Thames Ditton]] and [[Hampton Court railway station]] in [[East Molesey]], both within Transport for London's Zone 6.\n\nBus services include [[Transport for London|TfL]] [[oyster card]] services to East and West [[Molesey]], [[Hinchley Wood]], [[Claygate]] and [[Esher]].\n\nCycling is very popular, with the [[Thames Path]] passing through the north of the borough and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] hosting both of the main road cycling events in the borough with most of the road section around [[Hampton Court]] and with the sections of the routes taken to and from [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy is diverse, with a strong local service sector, including numerous bars and restaurants,<ref name=in/> homes built and being built for [[City of London|city]] workers as the majority of locations have access to one of the [[Home Counties]] fastest [[London Commuter Belt|commutes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/|title=National Rail Enquiries - Official source for UK train times and timetables|website=www.nationalrail.co.uk}}</ref> trades including interior supplies, fitting,<ref name=in/> gardening, golf course/landscape management and a developed public/education sector.
