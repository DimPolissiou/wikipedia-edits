His last will, in which he specifically excluded both his brother, James Digges, and William Digges, was proved on 1 September. Digges was buried in the chancel of the church of [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], London.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|2004b}}.</ref>\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nDigges married Anne St Leger (1555\u20131636), daughter of [[Warham St Leger|Sir Warham St Leger]] and his first wife, Ursula Neville (d. 1575), the fifth daughter of [[George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny]], by his third wife, Mary Stafford.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2004}}.</ref> In his will he named two surviving sons, Sir [[Dudley Digges]] (1583\u20131639), politician and statesman, and [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]] (1588\u20131635), poet, and two surviving daughters, Margaret and Ursula. After Digges' death, his widow, Anne, married Thomas Russell of [[Alderminster]] in [[Warwickshire]], \"whom in 1616 [[William Shakespeare]] named as an [[Executor|overseer]] of his will\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|2004}}.</ref>\n\n==Work==\nDigges attempted to determine the [[parallax]] of the 1572 [[SN 1572|supernova]] observed by [[Tycho Brahe]], and concluded it had to be beyond the orbit of the Moon. This contradicted Aristotle's view of the universe, according to which no change could take place among the fixed stars.\n\nIn 1576, he published a new edition of his father's perpetual almanac, ''A Prognostication everlasting''. The text written by Leonard Digges for the third edition of 1556 was left unchanged, but Thomas added new material in several appendices. The most important of these was ''A Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the Pythagoreans, latelye revived by Copernicus and by Geometricall Demonstrations approved''. Contrary to the [[Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic]] [[cosmology]] of the original book by his father, the appendix featured a detailed discussion of the controversial and still poorly known [[Copernicus|Copernican]] heliocentric model of the Universe. This was the first publication of that model in English, and a milestone in the popularisation of science.\n\n[[Image:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|thumb|An illustration of the Copernican universe from Thomas Digges' book]]\nFor the most part, the appendix was a loose translation into English of chapters from Copernicus' book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''. Thomas Digges went further than Copernicus, however, by proposing that the universe is infinite, containing infinitely many stars, and may have been the first person to do so. According to [[Edward Robert Harrison|Harrison]]:<ref>[[Edward Robert Harrison|Harrison]] (1987), p. 35, 37.</ref>\n{{quote|1=Copernicus had said little or nothing about what lay beyond the sphere of fixed stars. Digges's original contribution to cosmology consisted of dismantling the starry sphere, and scattering the stars throughout endless space. ...<p>By grafting endless space onto the Copernican system and scattering the stars throughout this endless space, Digges pioneered... the idea of an unlimited universe filled with the mingling rays of countless stars.</p>}}\n\nAn illustration of the Copernican universe can be seen at right. The outer inscription on the map reads (after spelling adjustments from [[Elizabethan English|Elizabethan]] to [[Modern English]]):\n{{quote|1=This orb of stars fixed infinitely up extends itself in altitude spherically, and therefore immovable the palace of felicity garnished with perpetual shining glorious lights innumerable, far excelling our sun both in quantity and quality the very court of celestial angels, devoid of grief and replenished with perfect endless joy, the habitacle for the elect.}}\n\nIn 1583, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] appointed Digges, along with [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)]] and [[John Chamber (academic)|John Chamber]], to sit on a commission to consider whether England should adopt the [[Gregorian calendar]], as proposed by [[John Dee]].<ref name=mosley>Adam Mosley, 'Chamber, John (1546\u20131604), in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Edwards |first=David |year=2004 |title=St Leger, Sir Warham (1525?\u20131597) |id=24514}}  {{DNBfirst|wstitle=St. Leger, Warham}}\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Johnston |first=Stephen |year=2004a |title=Digges, Leonard (c.1515\u2013c.1559) |id=7637}}  {{DNBfirst|wstitle=Digges, Leonard (d.1571?)}}\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Johnston |first=Stephen |year=2004b |title=Digges, Thomas (c.1546\u20131595) |id=7639}}  {{DNBfirst|wstitle=Digges, Thomas}}\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Lee |first=Sidney, rev.

Digges was buried in the chancel of the church of [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], London.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|2004b}}.</ref>\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nDigges married Anne St Leger (1555\u20131636), daughter of [[Warham St Leger|Sir Warham St Leger]] and his first wife, Ursula Neville (d. 1575), the fifth daughter of [[George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny]], by his third wife, Mary Stafford.<ref>{{Harvnb|Edwards|2004}}.</ref> In his will he named two surviving sons, Sir [[Dudley Digges]] (1583\u20131639), politician and statesman, and [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]] (1588\u20131635), poet, and two surviving daughters, Margaret and Ursula. After Digges' death, his widow, Anne, married Thomas Russell of [[Alderminster]] in [[Warwickshire]], \"whom in 1616 [[William Shakespeare]] named as an [[Executor|overseer]] of his will\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|2004}}.</ref>\n\n==Work==\nDigges attempted to determine the [[parallax]] of the 1572 [[SN 1572|supernova]] observed by [[Tycho Brahe]], and concluded it had to be beyond the orbit of the Moon. This contradicted Aristotle's view of the universe, according to which no change could take place among the fixed stars.\n\nIn 1576, he published a new edition of his father's perpetual almanac, ''A Prognostication everlasting''. The text written by Leonard Digges for the third edition of 1556 was left unchanged, but Thomas added new material in several appendices. The most important of these was ''A Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the Pythagoreans, latelye revived by Copernicus and by Geometricall Demonstrations approved''. Contrary to the [[Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic]] [[cosmology]] of the original book by his father, the appendix featured a detailed discussion of the controversial and still poorly known [[Copernicus|Copernican]] heliocentric model of the Universe. This was the first publication of that model in English, and a milestone in the popularisation of science.\n\n[[Image:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|thumb|An illustration of the Copernican universe from Thomas Digges' book]]\nFor the most part, the appendix was a loose translation into English of chapters from Copernicus' book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''. Thomas Digges went further than Copernicus, however, by proposing that the universe is infinite, containing infinitely many stars, and may have been the first person to do so. According to [[Edward Robert Harrison|Harrison]]:<ref>[[Edward Robert Harrison|Harrison]] (1987), p. 35, 37.</ref>\n{{quote|1=Copernicus had said little or nothing about what lay beyond the sphere of fixed stars. Digges's original contribution to cosmology consisted of dismantling the starry sphere, and scattering the stars throughout endless space. ...<p>By grafting endless space onto the Copernican system and scattering the stars throughout this endless space, Digges pioneered... the idea of an unlimited universe filled with the mingling rays of countless stars.</p>}}\n\nAn illustration of the Copernican universe can be seen at right. The outer inscription on the map reads (after spelling adjustments from [[Elizabethan English|Elizabethan]] to [[Modern English]]):\n{{quote|1=This orb of stars fixed infinitely up extends itself in altitude spherically, and therefore immovable the palace of felicity garnished with perpetual shining glorious lights innumerable, far excelling our sun both in quantity and quality the very court of celestial angels, devoid of grief and replenished with perfect endless joy, the habitacle for the elect.}}\n\nIn 1583, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] appointed Digges, along with [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)]] and [[John Chamber (academic)|John Chamber]], to sit on a commission to consider whether England should adopt the [[Gregorian calendar]], as proposed by [[John Dee]].<ref name=mosley>Adam Mosley, 'Chamber, John (1546\u20131604), in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Edwards |first=David |year=2004 |title=St Leger, Sir Warham (1525?\u20131597) |id=24514}}  {{DNBfirst|wstitle=St. Leger, Warham}}\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Johnston |first=Stephen |year=2004a |title=Digges, Leonard (c.1515\u2013c.1559) |id=7637}}  {{DNBfirst|wstitle=Digges, Leonard (d.1571?)}}\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Johnston |first=Stephen |year=2004b |title=Digges, Thomas (c.1546\u20131595) |id=7639}}  {{DNBfirst|wstitle=Digges, Thomas}}\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Lee |first=Sidney, rev.

His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions. The [[Francis turbine|Francis reaction turbine]] is still in wide use today. In the 1870s, deriving from uses in the California mining industry, [[Lester Allan Pelton]] developed the high efficiency [[Pelton wheel|Pelton wheel impulse turbine]], which utilized hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the mountainous California interior.\n\n== Calculating the amount of available power ==\nA hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available [[Power (physics)|power]]. Power is a function of the [[hydraulic head]] and [[volumetric flow rate]].

This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel.\n\nUnlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians do not need ''Letters of Bourgeoisie'' to prove their status.\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris (but not in the [[suburb]]s) as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris.

This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel.\n\nUnlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians do not need ''Letters of Bourgeoisie'' to prove their status.\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris (but not in the [[suburb]]s) as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris.

Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organisation of cities. This urban system in Europe dates back for many cities still existing today to [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Latin antiquity]], others were founded around the year one thousand.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Les villes du Moyen \u00c2ge, essai d\u2019histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'', Bruxelles, Lamertin, 1927.

Dans l'angle nord-ouest de l'Europe, la vie, durant le haut Moyen \u00c2ge, a ressembl\u00e9 de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s, mat\u00e9riellement et socialement, \u00e0 ce qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge du Fer, soit que la tradition s'en f\u00fbt purement et simplement maintenue, comme ce fut le cas hors des limites de l'Empire romain, soit qu'elle ait repris vigueur, ce qui advint en de\u00e7\u00e0 de ces limites. Dans le domaine des techniques, l'arch\u00e9ologie ne cesse de multiplier les preuves de cette situation. (...) Forges, charronnages ou poteries rurales sont, au d\u00e9but du Moyen \u00c2ge, tout \u00e0 fait dans la tradition de l'\u00e2ge du Fer. Tandis que notre mode traditionnel d'agriculture, fond\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois sur l'\u00e9levage pour la viande et le lait et sur la culture du bl\u00e9, remonte plus haut encore: \u00e0 l'origine m\u00eame du N\u00e9olithique europ\u00e9en continental (Danubien), c'est-\u00e0-dire au Ve mill\u00e9naire au moins.

Et la m\u00eame origine vaut pour nos vieilles chaumi\u00e8res aux murs de colombage, hourd\u00e9s de torchis et coiff\u00e9s d'un toit \u00e0 double pente. (...) Ajoutons que nos campagnes ont conserv\u00e9 parfois jusqu'\u00e0 l'aube de la r\u00e9volution industrielle de vieilles techniques protohistoriques. (...) Nous devons donc nous demander s'il n'existe pas quelques tr\u00e8s vieilles continuit\u00e9s plongeant dans la Pr\u00e9histoire qui peuvent conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la physionomie de la Wallonie actuelle certains traits particuliers.</blockquote></ref>\n\n== Subsisting bourgeois of Paris families ==\n===13th century===\n\n*[[File:Armoiriesgpisdoe.png|24px]] '''Pizdoe''' family, four [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|provost of the merchants]] of Paris.

This makes it different, in my mind, to the garden variety of 'crazy' \u2013 because he was rejected by a woman [as was commonly thought]. So I sat down with a print of ''Starry Night'' and wrote the lyrics out on a paper bag.\"<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/7264618/Don-McLean-interview-Why-I-had-to-write-Vincent.html|title=Don McLean interview: Why I had to write \"Vincent\" - Telegraph|date=24 February 2010|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote \"With its bittersweet palette of major and minor chords, \"Vincent\"'s soothing melody is one of high emotion recollected in tranquillity\".<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> [[AllMusic]] retrospectively described the song as \"McLean's paean to Van Gogh ... sympathiz[ing] with Van Gogh's suicide as a sane comment on an insane world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/american-pie-mw0000040803|title=American Pie|author=William Ruhlmann|work=AllMusic}}</ref> The site also said McLean performs \"a particularly poignant rendition\" of \"Vincent\" on the 2001 live album ''[[Starry, Starry Night (album)|Starry, Starry Night]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/starry-starry-night-mw0000003600|title=Starry Starry Night|author=Bruce Eder|work=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\nThe song was a particular favorite of the rapper and actor [[Tupac Shakur]], and was played to him in the hospital just before he died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/7264618/Don-McLean-interview-Why-I-had-to-write-Vincent.html|title=Don McLean interview: why I had to write 'Vincent'|first=Helen|last=Brown|date=24 February 2010|accessdate=20 January 2019|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1972)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia<ref name=\"Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992\">{{cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992]]|type=doc|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W |year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n{{singlechart |Flanders|30|artist= Don McLean|song=Vincent}}\n|-\n|[[RPM (magazine)|Canada]] Top Singles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.7705.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - May 20, 1972}}</ref> \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|[[RPM (magazine)|Canada]] Adult Contemporary \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|-\n| Germany ([[GfK Entertainment Charts|Official German Charts]])<ref>{{cite web|title=Swedishcharts.com \u2013 DON MCLEAN - VINCENT|url=http://www.swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Don+McLean&titel=Vincent&cat=s|publisher=[[Sverigetopplistan|Singles Top 100]]}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 21\n|-\n{{singlechart |Dutch100|16|artist= Don McLean|song=Vincent}}\n|-\n|Ireland ([[Irish Recorded Music Association|IRMA]])<ref>{{cite web |title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know |url=http://irishcharts.ie/search/placement?page=1&search_type=title&placement=Vincent |website=irishcharts.ie |accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20listener&qartistid=816#n_view_location |title=flavour of new zealand - search listener |website=Flavourofnz.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-10-07}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|South Africa ([[Springbok Radio|Springbok]])<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(M).html |title= South African Rock Lists Website SA Charts 1969 \u2013 1989 Acts (M) |publisher= Rock.co.za |accessdate= 8 September 2018}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n{{singlechart|UKsinglesbyname|1|artist=Don McLean}}\n|-\n{{singlechart |Billboardhot100|12|artist= Don McLean}}\n|-\n{{singlechart |Billboardadultcontemporary|2|artist= Don McLean}}\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19720520.html|title=Cash Box Top 100 5/20/72|website=Tropicalglen.com|accessdate=20 January 2019}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|11\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1972)\n!
