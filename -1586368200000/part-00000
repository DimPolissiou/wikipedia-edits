I am aware that it casts a shadow over me and the party. (..) \"I apologize to those close to me, supporters and to the National Alliance for this shadow.\" He also said that he was in favor of a democratic political system and that his more recent writings and activities underlined this, and that he would accept whatever decision the National Alliance came to with regard to the controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/politics/politics/senior-national-alliance-figure-apologises-for-cloud-of-far-right-messages.a338044/ |title=Senior National Alliance figure apologises for \"cloud\" of far-right messages |date=12 November 2019 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |accessdate=28 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nLater investigative journalism show \"De Facto\" reported that at the end of 2014 Zelt\u012bts, already as the party's Secretary-General, appeared on the online radio show \"Voice of Albion\" hosted by [[National Action (UK)|National Action]] supporter Paul Hickman. A few months later, in March 2015, the leader of National Action and administrator of \"Iron March\" Benjamin Raymond together with Hickman visited National Alliance's headquarters in Riga. Raymond was also seen participating at the [[Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires]] events alongside Zelt\u012bts. Zelt\u012bts denied having invited them or given them a tour of the party office, but knew the identity of the person who did, which he refused to reveal for \"ethical reasons\". Party chairman [[Raivis Dzintars]] when asked to comment, said that he had accepted Zelt\u012bts' apology for the previous controversy, but dismissed the subsequent information from \"De Facto\" as \"not relevant\" to anyone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/politics/politics/de-facto-british-neo-nazi-visited-latvian-political-party-office.a339504/ |title=De Facto: British neo-Nazi visited Latvian political party office |date=25 November 2019 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |accessdate=28 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zeltits, Raivis}}\n[[Category:1992 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Riga]]\n[[Category:National Alliance (Latvia) politicians]]\n\n\n\n{{Latvia-politician-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: doesn\u2019t \u2192 doesn't, \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raivis_Zelt%C4%ABts"}
