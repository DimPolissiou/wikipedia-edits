Webster was a labelmate of Boone's at Dot Records.\n\nThis was the title track from one of Boone's better-selling albums. Boone sang this song as if he were in pain.  It was covered some years later by Johnny Burnette in 1962, also [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Johnny Rivers]]. In August 2009, [[John Fogerty]] covered the song in the album entitled ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe song tells the story of a man who goes to meet his love at the river, by the old oak tree, and finds that she has committed suicide.  A note on the riverbank explains that she has cheated on him and that \"No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin.  I just couldn't tell you that guy was just a friend.\" He then looks into the river and sees his own reflection on the river looking back, ever hauntingly, at him.

It reached number-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart the following month.<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>  It was written by and originally performed by country rockabilly singer Chase Webster (real name Gary Daniel Bruce, not to be confused with Gary Bruce of [[the Knack]]). Webster was a labelmate of Boone's at Dot Records.\n\nThis was the title track from one of Boone's better-selling albums. Boone sang this song as if he were in pain.  It was covered some years later by Johnny Burnette in 1962, also [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Johnny Rivers]]. In August 2009, [[John Fogerty]] covered the song in the album entitled ''[[The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe song tells the story of a man who goes to meet his love at the river, by the old oak tree, and finds that she has committed suicide.  A note on the riverbank explains that she has cheated on him and that \"No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin.  I just couldn't tell you that guy was just a friend.\" He then looks into the river and sees his own reflection on the river looking back, ever hauntingly, at him. He is the \"lonely, lonely face just lookin' back at me\". So with \"Tears in his eyes, and a prayer on his lips, and the glove of his lost love, at his fingertips\".\n\n== Chart performance ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1961)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Canada ([[CHUM]] ''Hit Parade'')<ref>[http://chumtribute.com/61-06-26-chart.jpg CHUM Tribute Charts, June 26, 1961]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|New Zealand (''Lever Hit Parade'')<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20lever&qartistid=175#n_view_location Flavour of New Zealand, 20 July 1961]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.K. Singles charts\n|align=\"center\"|18\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. Adult Contemporany\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Hot 100 number-one singles of 1961 (U.S.)]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041734/http://www.bear-family.de/tabel1/product/bcd16776_e.htm Pat Boone at Bear Family Records]\n* {{YouTube|AzpoZyiLLwA|Video of original recording by Chase Webster}}\n* [http://www.beachwoodreporter.com/music/pat_boone_moody_river.php \"Beachwood Reporter\" background and commentary on Moody River]\n\n[[Category:1961 singles]]\n[[Category:Pat Boone songs]]\n[[Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in Canada]]\n[[Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Songs about suicide]]\n[[Category:Teenage tragedy songs]]\n[[Category:1961 songs]]\n[[Category:Dot Records singles]]\n\n\n{{1960s-single-stub}}\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody_River"}

Being [[Magadha Empire]] village, Kutri has witnessed [[vedic]] education and judiciary system in the ancient times. [[Nalanda University]] - an educational hub of India is situated near Kutri village. During the [[British Raj]], School education was initiated in this village with the establishment of Middle School Kutri in the north of the village in 1900\u2019s. Late Siya Saran Singh \u2013 a teacher of Kochgaon village played a pivotal role in proliferating education in Kutri. With the support of Harvansh Kumari alias (Parvati Kumari) a primary school of 3 rooms was constructed during [[Zamindari]] system. Later on, with awareness of  educational  & its importance, school was extended to Middle school up to class7. After [[Indian independence]], Kutri villagers used to go nearby school for high school education i.e. BK Sahoo High School at [[Warisaliganj]].  In 1970\u2019s there were urgent need felt by villagers to improve educational institution in the village for higher secondary education and it was finally decided in Oct 1972 during [[Durga Puja]] Festival that a high school is urgently needed in the proximity of the village. This need was further strengthened with demand of  improving literacy & education among girls. For girls, it was difficult to get higher education due to unavailability of high school in near by locations. At that time, President Late Bhishundeo Singh, Secretary Late Girijanandan Sharma, Treasurer Late Sunder Sharma, Auditor Parasnath Singh formed a committee with some nominated members Such as Sh. Umesh Chandra Sinha, Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, Sh. Kushewshar Singh, Late Bharat Singh, Late Rajpati Singh, Late Ramchandra Singh (Chaubhaiya) became active members for high school establishment. Role of president & secretary were immense to get land for the School and subscription or donation amount was offered by all members and many villagers. Considering education an urgent need, members of Natya Kala Parishad, Kutri initiated school foundation for higher education in the south of the village and a foundation stone of  high school was kept by the first district Magistrate of Nawada Shri Narendra Pal Singh on 5th Feb 1973 on the eve of Saraswati Puja. Surprisingly, 5th Feb was the birthday of Sh. Narendrapal Singh (then DM) and when invitation for foundation stone of school was given by Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, he accepted this request happily and was ready to support this noble work in all the way. Late Kushewshar Singh became the first Headmaster of Kutri high school and some unemployed villagers at that time used to teach there. Successor headmaster late Ram Naresh Singh put great effort to get uphill task of permanent high school approval from the government authority. In doing so Late Bandi Shankar Singh ([[MLA]], [[Warisaliganj]]), the son of first Chief minister of [[Bihar]] supported very well. In Dec. 1978, Kutri High school became govt approved high school now it is inter high school (10+2). Apart from, this, there was some coaching classes was run privately to bring better education in the village.  The unforgettable name of Late Haridwar Singh was one of them who privately run coaching cum school at late Shyam nandan Pathak banglow. He was very disciplined teacher and kept strong foundation of English literature & Mathematics in the students.  At present there is one middle school & one inter high school in our village where students from nearby villages even from Naromurar, Gorapar, Lohrajpur, Paingari etc. are coming for the education along with our village students. Thus we can say, that our forefathers had strategic vision towards education.\nIn late 1990,s & early 2000\u2019s, a group of villagers Dr. Amit Kumar, Prof.(Dr.) Baliram Pd Singh & Sh  Baliram Sharma understood the difficulties of students to get job oriented education and collected Rs 1100 (rupees eleven hundred only) each to initiate refresher classes for the students with the participation of learned & responsible villagers, such as late Jata Shankar Pathak Ji and many unemployed villagers at that time used to take classes to strengthen basics and to motivate students to face tough competition. Once again in 2020\u2019s Villagers who are in the job and business but out of village at present once again felt the need of the education, and thought that talent is everywhere and we need to up bring them through motivation & creating quiz & competition classes amongst students  to nourish them self dependant citizen of the country. In this direction, a [[WhatsApp]] group i.e. Kutri Residents Group initiated spread of education thought with the support of Maa kali Sewa Sansthan Kutri (Maa Kali Sewa Siksha Sansthan) and conducted [[Quiz]] competition amongst student of different classes to bring competition  amongst students and to understand importance of education under the shadow of Mr. Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Anjani Kumar, Daya Shankar  who dedicated himself as educationists & motivators from their busy schedule to make it successful. From WhatsApp group, Dr. Amit Kumar.

Being [[Magadha Empire]] village, Kutri has witnessed [[vedic]] education and judiciary system in the ancient times. [[Nalanda University]] - an educational hub of India is situated near Kutri village. During the [[British Raj]], School education was initiated in this village with the establishment of Middle School Kutri in the north of the village in 1900\u2019s. Late Siya Saran Singh \u2013 a teacher of Kochgaon village played a pivotal role in proliferating education in Kutri. With the support of Harvansh Kumari alias (Parvati Kumari) a primary school of 3 rooms was constructed during [[Zamindari]] system. Later on, with awareness of  educational  & its importance, school was extended to Middle school up to class7. After [[Indian independence]], Kutri villagers used to go nearby school for high school education i.e. BK Sahoo High School at [[Warisaliganj]].  In 1970\u2019s there were urgent need felt by villagers to improve educational institution in the village for higher secondary education and it was finally decided in Oct 1972 during [[Durga Puja]] Festival that a high school is urgently needed in the proximity of the village. This need was further strengthened with demand of  improving literacy & education among girls. For girls, it was difficult to get higher education due to unavailability of high school in near by locations. At that time, President Late Bhishundeo Singh, Secretary Late Girijanandan Sharma, Treasurer Late Sunder Sharma, Auditor Parasnath Singh formed a committee with some nominated members Such as Sh. Umesh Chandra Sinha, Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, Sh. Kushewshar Singh, Late Bharat Singh, Late Rajpati Singh, Late Ramchandra Singh (Chaubhaiya) became active members for high school establishment. Role of president & secretary were immense to get land for the School and subscription or donation amount was offered by all members and many villagers. Considering education an urgent need, members of Natya Kala Parishad, Kutri initiated school foundation for higher education in the south of the village and a foundation stone of  high school was kept by the first district Magistrate of Nawada Shri Narendra Pal Singh on 5th Feb 1973 on the eve of Saraswati Puja. Surprisingly, 5th Feb was the birthday of Sh. Narendrapal Singh (then DM) and when invitation for foundation stone of school was given by Sh. Ram Lakhan Sharma, he accepted this request happily and was ready to support this noble work in all the way. Late Kushewshar Singh became the first Headmaster of Kutri high school and some unemployed villagers at that time used to teach there. Successor headmaster late Ram Naresh Singh put great effort to get uphill task of permanent high school approval from the government authority. In doing so Late Bandi Shankar Singh ([[MLA]], [[Warisaliganj]]), the son of first Chief minister of [[Bihar]] supported very well. In Dec. 1978, Kutri High school became govt approved high school now it is inter high school (10+2). Apart from, this, there was some coaching classes was run privately to bring better education in the village.  The unforgettable name of Late Haridwar Singh was one of them who privately run coaching cum school at late Shyam nandan Pathak banglow. He was very disciplined teacher and kept strong foundation of English literature & Mathematics in the students.  At present there is one middle school & one inter high school in our village where students from nearby villages even from Naromurar, Gorapar, Lohrajpur, Paingari etc. are coming for the education along with our village students. Thus we can say, that our forefathers had strategic vision towards education.\nIn late 1990,s & early 2000\u2019s, a group of villagers Dr. Amit Kumar, Prof.(Dr.) Baliram Pd Singh & Sh  Baliram Sharma understood the difficulties of students to get job oriented education and collected Rs 1100 (rupees eleven hundred only) each to initiate refresher classes for the students with the participation of learned & responsible villagers, such as late Jata Shankar Pathak Ji and many unemployed villagers at that time used to take classes to strengthen basics and to motivate students to face tough competition. Once again in 2020\u2019s Villagers who are in the job and business but out of village at present once again felt the need of the education, and thought that talent is everywhere and we need to up bring them through motivation & creating quiz & competition classes amongst students  to nourish them self dependant citizen of the country. In this direction, a [[WhatsApp]] group i.e. Kutri Residents Group initiated spread of education thought with the support of Maa kali Sewa Sansthan Kutri (Maa Kali Sewa Siksha Sansthan) and conducted [[Quiz]] competition amongst student of different classes to bring competition  amongst students and to understand importance of education under the shadow of Mr. Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Anjani Kumar, Daya Shankar  who dedicated himself as educationists & motivators from their busy schedule to make it successful. From WhatsApp group, Dr. Amit Kumar. Rakesh Kumar, Mukesh Kumar Singh, Rupesh Kumar, Umakant, Prof. Baliram, sanjeev, Sonu etc took lead to move forward this education awareness under the supervision of Maa Kali Sewa Sanstahan President Shri Ram Avtar Sharma, Secretary, Shri Ram Lakhan Sharma & Treasurer Shri Rajendra Singh. Some of the villagers also contributed financially to support this initiative. MAA KALI SEWA SANSTHAN took active participation in opening saving account and contributed morally as well as financially to uplift poor students.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Villages in Bihar]] \n* [[Nawada District]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://nawada.nic.in |title=Official District Website |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Nawada district]]\n", "name_user": "DrAmitKSharma", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCulture", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutri"}

The outward appearance of the deep red oxidised steel drew inspiration from the earthy colours of the soil and reflections of the sky in the ornamental lake in front of the stage area, aiming to produce a greater harmony between structure and the beauty of surrounding landscape.\n[[File:DennisGilbert Aug1997 (9).jpg#file|thumb|left|August 1997, Crystal Palace Concert (Photo by Dennis Gilbert \u00a9)]]\n\n\nA generously proportioned 25 metre wide by 15 metre deep stage could accommodate a full 120 piece orchestra, while the acoustic canopy projects over the stage and soars to 11.34 metres high, cantilevered at an angle of 40 degrees. The structure also boasted the world's first computer controlled outdoor active acoustic system, designed by Paul Gilleron<ref> https://www.gsacoustics.org/</ref>. This enabled the stage acoustics to be tuned as required by the performers; the canopy contains a total of 46 speakers, with two freestanding columns either side of the stage designed to house speakers and the amplification system<ref>http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/crystalpalacepark/</ref>.\n\nThe new stage opened in August 1997 with a performance by [[Evelyn Glennie]], in 1998 it was nominated for the [[RIBA Stirling Prize]], while also winning the [[Royal Fine Arts Commission]] Building of the Year Award, a [[Civic Trust Award]] and the 'Excellence in Design' award from the [[American Institute of Architects]].\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[https://www.ianritchiearchitects.co.uk/projects/concert_stand/index.htm Ian Ritchie Architects]\n[http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/crystalpalacepark/index.htm Crystal Palace Concert Bowl]\n\n{{coord|51.4240|-0.0691|region:GB_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Bromley]]\n[[Category:Music venues in London]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Bromley]]\n[[Category:Crystal Palace, London]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typos (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_Bowl"}

In a JAMA article published on Oct 18, 1913 he noted that \"the name 'Roseola infantilis' had an important place in the medical terminology of writers on skin diseases\" but that descriptions of the disease by previous writers tended to confuse it with many other diseases that produce febrile rashes. In this JAMA article Zahorsky reports on 29 more children with Roseola and notes that the only condition that should seriously be considered in the differential diagnosis is German Measles ([[rubella]]) but notes that the fever of rubella only lasts a few hours whereas the prodromal fever of Roseola lasts three to five days and disappears with the formation of a [[morbilliform]] rash.<ref>John Zahorsky.

This form of HHV-6 infects over 90% of infants by age 2.\n\n==Prevention==\nThere is no specific [[vaccine]] against or treatment for exanthema subitum, and most children with the disease are not seriously ill.\n\n==Treatment==\nMost cases of HHV-6 infection get better on their own.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tesini|first1=BL|last2=Epstein|first2=LG|last3=Caserta|first3=MT|title=Clinical impact of primary infection with roseoloviruses.|journal=Current Opinion in Virology|date=December 2014|volume=9|pages=91\u20136|pmid=25462439|doi=10.1016/j.coviro.2014.09.013|pmc=4267952}}</ref> If [[encephalitis]] occurs [[ganciclovir]] or [[foscarnet]] may be useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ongr\u00e1di|first1=J|last2=Ablashi|first2=DV|last3=Yoshikawa|first3=T|last4=Stercz|first4=B|last5=Ogata|first5=M|title=Roseolovirus-associated encephalitis in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.|journal=Journal of NeuroVirology|date=February 2017|volume=23|issue=1|pages=1\u201319|pmid=27538995|doi=10.1007/s13365-016-0473-0|pmc=5329081}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[John Zahorsky]] MD wrote extensively on this disease in the early 20th century, his first formal presentation was to the St Louis Pediatric society in 1909 where he described 15 young children with the illness. In a JAMA article published on Oct 18, 1913 he noted that \"the name 'Roseola infantilis' had an important place in the medical terminology of writers on skin diseases\" but that descriptions of the disease by previous writers tended to confuse it with many other diseases that produce febrile rashes. In this JAMA article Zahorsky reports on 29 more children with Roseola and notes that the only condition that should seriously be considered in the differential diagnosis is German Measles ([[rubella]]) but notes that the fever of rubella only lasts a few hours whereas the prodromal fever of Roseola lasts three to five days and disappears with the formation of a [[morbilliform]] rash.<ref>John Zahorsky.
