In neutrophils, lipid products of PI3Ks regulate activation of Rho GTPases and are required for [[cell motility]]. They accumulate asymmetrically to the [[plasma membrane]] at the leading edge of polarized cells. Spatially regulating Rho GTPases and organizing the leading edge of the cell, PI3Ks and their lipid products could play pivotal roles in establishing leukocyte polarity, as compass molecules that tell the cell where to crawl.\n\nIt has been shown in mice that in certain conditions neutrophils have a specific type of migration behaviour referred to as [[neutrophil swarming]] during which they migrate in a highly coordinated manner and accumulate and cluster to sites of inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = L\u00e4mmermann T, Afonso PV, Angermann BR, Wang JM, Kastenm\u00fcller W, Parent CA, Germain RN | title = Neutrophil swarms require LTB4 and integrins at sites of cell death in vivo | journal = Nature | volume = 498 | issue = 7454 | pages = 371\u20135 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23708969 | pmc = 3879961 | doi = 10.1038/nature12175 | bibcode = 2013Natur.498..371L }}</ref>\n\n===Anti-microbial function===\nBeing highly [[motility|motile]], neutrophils quickly congregate at a focus of [[infection]], attracted by [[cytokine]]s expressed by activated [[endothelium]], [[mast cell]]s, and [[macrophage]]s.

Superoxide decays spontaneously or is broken down via enzymes known as [[superoxide dismutase]]s (Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD), to hydrogen peroxide, which is then converted to [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO), by the green heme enzyme [[myeloperoxidase]].

The newly elected [[members of the 17th D\u00e1il]] assembled at [[Leinster House]] on 11 October, when the new [[Taoiseach]] and [[Government of Ireland|government]] were appointed.\n\nThe general election took place in [[D\u00e1il constituencies|38 parliamentary constituencies]] throughout Ireland for 144 seats in the lower house of parliament, [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], which had been reduced in size by three seats from the previous election.\n\n==Campaign==\nThe general election of 1961 saw the three main parties being led by three new leaders. [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] had taken charge of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] in 1959. It was also the first time Fianna F\u00e1il faced a general election campaign without [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] (who was by this time [[President of Ireland]]). [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Dillon]] had taken over at [[Fine Gael]] in 1959 also, while the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] was now under the leadership of [[Brendan Corish]].\n\nWhile the election was caused by the \"crisis\" surrounding Ireland's application for membership of the [[European Economic Community]] and various other international affairs, little attention was paid to these matters during the campaign; the 1961 general election has become known as the dullest campaign on record, with the most important issue being the teaching of the [[Irish language]] in schools. Fianna F\u00e1il fought the election on its record in government and a reforming theme; Fine Gael presented itself as the party of free enterprise. The Labour Party campaigned strongly against the \"conservative\" Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael parties. It also favoured major expansion in the public sector. It was the first and only general election for the new [[National Progressive Democrats]] party led by [[No\u00ebl Browne]].\n\n==Result==\n{{Irish general election header\n|elec_no   =

just over three weeks after the [[Dissolution of Parliament|dissolution]] of the D\u00e1il on 8 September. The newly elected [[members of the 17th D\u00e1il]] assembled at [[Leinster House]] on 11 October, when the new [[Taoiseach]] and [[Government of Ireland|government]] were appointed.\n\nThe general election took place in [[D\u00e1il constituencies|38 parliamentary constituencies]] throughout Ireland for 144 seats in the lower house of parliament, [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], which had been reduced in size by three seats from the previous election.\n\n==Campaign==\nThe general election of 1961 saw the three main parties being led by three new leaders. [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] had taken charge of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] in 1959. It was also the first time Fianna F\u00e1il faced a general election campaign without [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] (who was by this time [[President of Ireland]]). [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Dillon]] had taken over at [[Fine Gael]] in 1959 also, while the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] was now under the leadership of [[Brendan Corish]].\n\nWhile the election was caused by the \"crisis\" surrounding Ireland's application for membership of the [[European Economic Community]] and various other international affairs, little attention was paid to these matters during the campaign; the 1961 general election has become known as the dullest campaign on record, with the most important issue being the teaching of the [[Irish language]] in schools. Fianna F\u00e1il fought the election on its record in government and a reforming theme; Fine Gael presented itself as the party of free enterprise. The Labour Party campaigned strongly against the \"conservative\" Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael parties. It also favoured major expansion in the public sector. It was the first and only general election for the new [[National Progressive Democrats]] party led by [[No\u00ebl Browne]].\n\n==Result==\n{{Irish general election header\n|elec_no   =

He is best known for fighting in the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], which was owned by [[Zuffa]] \u2013 the previous owner of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]]. He used to fight for the [[Toronto Dragons]] of the [[International Fight League]] and is the former [[List of IFL champions#Featherweight Championship|IFL Featherweight Champion]].\n\n==Background==\nWagnney\u2019s mix of his proficient striking ability and solid ground game is helping him grow into a well rounded and accomplished mixed martial artist. Wagnney has trained in Brazil with teammates under [[Ant\u00f4nio Rodrigo Nogueira]] and has been linked to Renzo Gracie\u2019s Academy. He is also known to have coached [[Georges St-Pierre]] in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.\n\n===APEX===\nOn October 14 of 2006, Fabiano stepped in to face off against [[Jeff Curran]]. Both fighters seemed overly tentative on the feet, and the fight largely consisted of grappling. Fabiano landed a few takedowns but offered little offence on the ground, being unable to improve his position. Curran came out firing in the third as he landed some good shots before they hit the canvas again. Even with Curran's third round, it appeared Fabiano would be ahead on takedowns on the scorecards. However the decision was announced, contentiously, in favor of Jeff Curran by split decision.\n\n===International Fight League===\nAfter losing for the first time in his career via controversial split decision to Jeff Curran, Fabiano ventured into the International Fight League. In his career there, he enjoyed four straight wins showcasing notable submission offence by ending each fight via submission in the first round. He then fought [[LC Davis]] and became IFL Featherweight Champion with a submission victory by [[armbar]] near the close of the first round.

He is best known for fighting in the [[World Extreme Cagefighting|WEC]], which was owned by [[Zuffa]] \u2013 the previous owner of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]]. He used to fight for the [[Toronto Dragons]] of the [[International Fight League]] and is the former [[List of IFL champions#Featherweight Championship|IFL Featherweight Champion]].\n\n==Background==\nWagnney\u2019s mix of his proficient striking ability and solid ground game is helping him grow into a well rounded and accomplished mixed martial artist. Wagnney has trained in Brazil with teammates under [[Ant\u00f4nio Rodrigo Nogueira]] and has been linked to Renzo Gracie\u2019s Academy. He is also known to have coached [[Georges St-Pierre]] in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.\n\n===APEX===\nOn October 14 of 2006, Fabiano stepped in to face off against [[Jeff Curran]]. Both fighters seemed overly tentative on the feet, and the fight largely consisted of grappling. Fabiano landed a few takedowns but offered little offence on the ground, being unable to improve his position. Curran came out firing in the third as he landed some good shots before they hit the canvas again. Even with Curran's third round, it appeared Fabiano would be ahead on takedowns on the scorecards. However the decision was announced, contentiously, in favor of Jeff Curran by split decision.\n\n===International Fight League===\nAfter losing for the first time in his career via controversial split decision to Jeff Curran, Fabiano ventured into the International Fight League. In his career there, he enjoyed four straight wins showcasing notable submission offence by ending each fight via submission in the first round. He then fought [[LC Davis]] and became IFL Featherweight Champion with a submission victory by [[armbar]] near the close of the first round. This was after dropping down to 145-pounds after defeating [[John Gunderson]] at 155-pounds in his previous IFL World Grand Prix fight. The victory over Gunderson was supposed to set up Fabiano for a match with the previously unbeaten [[Chris Horodecki]], but Fabiano dropped down to 145-pounds in order to fight for the Featherweight Championship.\n\nWagnney Fabiano's next bout, and first IFL Featherwight title defense, came against Shad Lierley on April 4, 2008 at; IFL - New Blood, New Battles 2. In what was dubbed as an archetypal fight between [[wrestler]] and Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert, Fabiano won by knocking out Lierly at 0:37 of the first round. Fabiano displayed impressive standup skills, utilizing good leg kicks and bodyshots. Near the end of the round he threw a left jab which Lierly parried partially, but connected a flush [[right hook]] to knock out the challenger convincingly and conclude his first title defence.

In the test, athletes must run from one line to another before a timed beep. Athletes must continue running back and forth, each time reaching the line before the next beep. Once one can no longer run, the test is over and the number of laps is recorded. As the test continues, the time between beeps gets shorter. \n\nThe test is used by sporting organizations around the world along with schools, militaries, and others interested in gauging one's cardiovascular endurance, an important component of overall [[physical fitness]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/testing/beep-variations.htm|title=Variations of the Beep Test|website=Top End Sports}}</ref>.

With the PACER, runners continue until they have no energy remaining, ensuring scores reflect cardiovascular fitness over pacing abilities.\n* Even if the distance ultimately completed is similar, psychological studies indicate people find it less daunting to be told to \"run as much as you can\" as opposed to \"run ___ distance.\" Making fitness more appealing is important because, after graduation, leading a healthy lifestyle ultimately becomes a matter of personal choice.\n\n==Correlated measures==\n\n[[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub>max]] = (Velocity (km/h) \u00d7 6.65 - 35.8) \u00d7 0.95 + 0.182<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Flouris | first1 = A D | last2 = Metsios | first2 = G S | last3 = Koutedakis | first3 = Y | year = 2005 | title = Enhancing the efficacy of the 20 m multistage shuttle run test | url = | journal = Br J Sports Med | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 166\u2013170 | doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.012500| pmid = 15728698 | pmc = 1725157 }}</ref>\n\n[METs] = VO<sub>2</sub>max / 3.5<ref name=\"L\u00e9ger-\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = L\u00e9ger | first1 = L. | last2 = Mercier | first2 = D. | title = Gross energy cost of horizontal treadmill and track running. | journal = Sports Med | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 270\u20137 | month =  | year =  1984| doi =  10.2165/00007256-198401040-00003| pmid = 6390604 }}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe test involves running continuously between two points that are 20 m apart from side to side (or 15 m in small gyms). The runs are synchronized with a pre-recorded [[audio tape]], [[compact disk|CD]] or computer software, which plays [[beep (sound)|beep]]s at set intervals. As the test proceeds, the interval between each successive beep decreases, forcing the athletes to increase their speed over the course of the test until it is impossible to keep in sync with the recording (or, on extremely rare occasions, until the athlete completes the test). Many people who test people using the multi-stage fitness test allow one level to beep before the person makes the line, but some middle and grade schools allow two missed laps. If the person being tested does not make the next interval, the most recent level they completed is their final score.\n\nThe recording is typically structured into 21 levels, each lasting around 62 s. Usually, the interval of beeps is calculated as requiring a speed at the start of 8.5&nbsp;km/h (see format table), increasing by 0.5&nbsp;km/h with each level thereafter. The progression from one level to the next is signaled by 3 quick beeps. The highest level attained before failing to keep up is recorded as the score for that test.\n\n==Format==\nThe original beep test was initially available on [[audio tape]] format. A problem with the tape was that it could stretch over time, or the tape player would play at inconsistent speed, making the timing between beeps inaccurate. Most versions of the tape had a one-minute recorded interval for calibrating the tape and tape player. [[Digital audio]] formats replaced the tapes, but checks were still required on the CD/player due to some tone controls possibly affecting the playback speed.<ref name=\"MSFT_1988\">{{cite journal|last1=L\u00e9ger|first1=L.A.|last2=Mercier|first2=D.|last3=Gadoury|first3=C.|last4=Lambert|first4=J.|year=1988|title=The multistage 20 metre shuttle run test for aerobic fitness|journal=J Sports Sci|volume=6|issue=2|pages=93\u2013101|doi=10.1080/02640418808729800|pmid=3184250|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nInexpensive beep test software is now popular due to modern electronic devices having excellent and consistent timing accuracy. The software generally runs on a portable electronic computer such as a tablet, phone or laptop, making the test easy to organise for teams, and also tracks player fitness over a season. The contemporary accepted format starts at 8.5&nbsp;km/h with levels of 1 minute as described in Leger's and Lambert's paper of 1988<ref name=\"MSFT_1988\"/>.

In the test, athletes must run from one line to another before a timed beep. Athletes must continue running back and forth, each time reaching the line before the next beep. Once one can no longer run, the test is over and the number of laps is recorded. As the test continues, the time between beeps gets shorter. \n\nThe test is used by sporting organizations around the world along with schools, militaries, and others interested in gauging one's cardiovascular endurance, an important component of overall [[physical fitness]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/testing/beep-variations.htm|title=Variations of the Beep Test|website=Top End Sports}}</ref>.

With the PACER, runners continue until they have no energy remaining, ensuring scores reflect cardiovascular fitness over pacing abilities.\n* Even if the distance ultimately completed is similar, psychological studies indicate people find it less daunting to be told to \"run as much as you can\" as opposed to \"run ___ distance.\" Making fitness more appealing is important because, after graduation, leading a healthy lifestyle ultimately becomes a matter of personal choice.\n\n==Correlated measures==\n\n[[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub>max]] = (Velocity (km/h) \u00d7 6.65 - 35.8) \u00d7 0.95 + 0.182<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Flouris | first1 = A D | last2 = Metsios | first2 = G S | last3 = Koutedakis | first3 = Y | year = 2005 | title = Enhancing the efficacy of the 20 m multistage shuttle run test | url = | journal = Br J Sports Med | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 166\u2013170 | doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.012500| pmid = 15728698 | pmc = 1725157 }}</ref>\n\n[METs] = VO<sub>2</sub>max / 3.5<ref name=\"L\u00e9ger-\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = L\u00e9ger | first1 = L. | last2 = Mercier | first2 = D. | title = Gross energy cost of horizontal treadmill and track running. | journal = Sports Med | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 270\u20137 | month =  | year =  1984| doi =  10.2165/00007256-198401040-00003| pmid = 6390604 }}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe test involves running continuously between two points that are 20 m apart from side to side (or 15 m in small gyms). The runs are synchronized with a pre-recorded [[audio tape]], [[compact disk|CD]] or computer software, which plays [[beep (sound)|beep]]s at set intervals. As the test proceeds, the interval between each successive beep decreases, forcing the athletes to increase their speed over the course of the test until it is impossible to keep in sync with the recording (or, on extremely rare occasions, until the athlete completes the test). Many people who test people using the multi-stage fitness test allow one level to beep before the person makes the line, but some middle and grade schools allow two missed laps. If the person being tested does not make the next interval, the most recent level they completed is their final score.\n\nThe recording is typically structured into 21 levels, each lasting around 62 s. Usually, the interval of beeps is calculated as requiring a speed at the start of 8.5&nbsp;km/h (see format table), increasing by 0.5&nbsp;km/h with each level thereafter. The progression from one level to the next is signaled by 3 quick beeps. The highest level attained before failing to keep up is recorded as the score for that test.\n\n==Format==\nThe original beep test was initially available on [[audio tape]] format. A problem with the tape was that it could stretch over time, or the tape player would play at inconsistent speed, making the timing between beeps inaccurate. Most versions of the tape had a one-minute recorded interval for calibrating the tape and tape player. [[Digital audio]] formats replaced the tapes, but checks were still required on the CD/player due to some tone controls possibly affecting the playback speed.<ref name=\"MSFT_1988\">{{cite journal|last1=L\u00e9ger|first1=L.A.|last2=Mercier|first2=D.|last3=Gadoury|first3=C.|last4=Lambert|first4=J.|year=1988|title=The multistage 20 metre shuttle run test for aerobic fitness|journal=J Sports Sci|volume=6|issue=2|pages=93\u2013101|doi=10.1080/02640418808729800|pmid=3184250|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nInexpensive beep test software is now popular due to modern electronic devices having excellent and consistent timing accuracy. The software generally runs on a portable electronic computer such as a tablet, phone or laptop, making the test easy to organise for teams, and also tracks player fitness over a season.
