Doctor Abdul Kulkarni ([[Rahul Dev]]) hires to kill prominent Judge Subramaniam ([[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Bharath Murali]]), since he is handling the inquiry and verdict on Abdul's child kidnapping, rape, murder, and organ trafficking cases in Kolkata. Aadhavan attempts to murder Subramaniam but fails at the first attempt. After Abdul insults him for his inability, Aadhavan is angry with himself and promises to kill Subramaniam within ten days. He threatens the Judge's comical servant Bannerjee ([[Vadivelu]]) to help him get into the house as Murugan, Bannerjee's brother in law, while he locks up the actual Murugan ([[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]]) in his ship.\n\nSlowly Aadhavan begins to win over the members of  Subramaniam's household - his mother ([[B. Saroja Devi]]), her beautiful granddaughter Thara ([[Nayantara]]) and his other relatives. Thara is attracted to Murugan's (Aadhavan) intelligence and simple-innocent nature. Aadhavan tries to assassinate the judge at home in the middle of the night and also plants a bomb in Subramaniam's van, but both attempts fail. Meanwhile, Subramaniam's entire family is on a trip to Darjeeling, and Thara asks Aadhavan to hide a guitar belonging to Ilaiyaman ([[Ramesh Khanna]]), her madcap musician cousin. Aadhavan uses this opportunity and plants a mobile bomb in the guitar and places it in one of the cars which explodes at the wrong time and he fails to kill Subramaniam yet again. Meanwhile, a security officer at Subramaniam's house keeps informing Abdul Kulkarni of Aadhavan's entry into the house and all his progresses and failed attempts.\n\nThara is now suspicious about Aadhavan but when she questions him in secret, he informs her that he is really Subramaniam's long lost runaway son Madhavan. Thara soon informs all the members of the household about Madhavan and they are overjoyed and Thara and Aadhavan fall in love. However, they hide it from Subramaniam and Ilaiyaman, because of his hatred towards Madhavan. Aadhavan , however tells Bannerjee that he lied to Thara about Madhavan to distract her suspicion and that he really is not that runaway son at all. However, on Thara's birthday, a flashback reveals that Aadhavan is indeed the runaway Madhavan.\n\nYears ago, a ten-year-old Madhavan unknowingly carries a gift with a hidden bomb for his cousin Thara's birthday. His friend's mother plants the bomb in the toy to avenge Subramaniam for her husband's jail sentence. Though Thara survives, her mother Anu ([[Anu Hassan]]), opens the box and is killed along with her husband in the explosion. Subramaniam blames Madhavan for his sister Anu's death and for his friendship with a gangster's son and thrashes him. In anger and fear of going to a juvenile prison, Madhavan steals a gun from the cops and accidentally shoots his father and runs away from home. He kills his friend's mother as she is responsible for his aunt's death.  He saves a local goon Ibrahim Rowther ([[Sayaji Shinde]]) from death and is in turn adopted as his son and rechristened as Aadhavan.\n\nComing back to the present, Tharani tried to kill Subramanium, is stopped by Aadhavan and reveals his true identity that He is the son of Subramanium and Ibrahim Rowther challenges within two days I will kill you and the judge. Abdul Kulkarni is fed up with the repeated failed attempts of Aadhavan. So he makes another plan and threatens Ibrahim and his gang to surrender to the police and make a confession about Aadhavan and his plans. When the Assistant Commissioner of police ([[Riyaz Khan]]), confronts Aadhavan and is about to have him hauled off, Aadhavan gets Subramaniam's laptop containing the verdict and inquiry reports, takes him and Thara as hostages and drives away. In the meanwhile, the police commissioner ([[FEFSI Vijayan]]) arrives and makes a confession that the police actually had caught him after his very first attempt to kill the Judge had failed. When questioned by the commissioner, Aadhavan said that he backed off and misfired on purpose at the last moment, after he found that he was going to kill his own father. The Police then ask him to go back to the house to protect his father over a twenty-four-hour period everyday. This information is relayed to the Judge who is tearfully grateful to his son. Meanwhile, Abdul Kulkarni attacks the vehicle in which the trio are travelling and a fight ensues where Aadhavan saves his father and Thara, and Kulkarni is killed.\n\nAs the credits roll, we see that Madhavan and Thara are now married and live in the household with the huge family, and yet again Bannerjee brings two assistants ([[K. S. Ravikumar]] and [[Udhayanidhi Stalin]]), to help him and asks approval from Madhavan and he gladly approves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Suriya (actor)|Suriya]] as Madhavan (Aadhavan)\n* [[Nayantara]] as Thara\n* [[Vadivelu]] as Kuppan (Bannerjee)\n* [[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Bharath Murali]] as Subramaniam, Madhavan's Father\n* [[Saroja Devi]] as Rajalakshmi, Subramaniam's Mother\n* [[Rahul Dev]] as Abdul Kulkarni\n* [[Sayaji Shinde]] as Ibrahim Rowther\n* [[Anand Babu]] as Tharani\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Kuppusamy (Ilaiyamaan)\n* [[FEFSI Vijayan]] as Police Commissioner Rathnavelu\n* [[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]] as Murugan, Bannerjee's Nephew\n* [[Riyaz Khan]] as Deva\n* [[Manobala]] as Sundaramurthy, Subramaniam's Young Brother\n* [[Alex (actor)|Alex]] as Vasudevan, Subramaniam's Young Brother\n* [[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]] as Rani, Subramaniam's Young Sister-in-Law\n* [[Anu Hasan]] as  Anu, Thara's Mother\n{{colend}}\nThe director (K.

Doctor Abdul Kulkarni ([[Rahul Dev]]) hires to kill prominent Judge Subramaniam ([[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Bharath Murali]]), since he is handling the inquiry and verdict on Abdul's child kidnapping, rape, murder, and organ trafficking cases in Kolkata. Aadhavan attempts to murder Subramaniam but fails at the first attempt. After Abdul insults him for his inability, Aadhavan is angry with himself and promises to kill Subramaniam within ten days. He threatens the Judge's comical servant Bannerjee ([[Vadivelu]]) to help him get into the house as Murugan, Bannerjee's brother in law, while he locks up the actual Murugan ([[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]]) in his ship.\n\nSlowly Aadhavan begins to win over the members of  Subramaniam's household - his mother ([[B. Saroja Devi]]), her beautiful granddaughter Thara ([[Nayantara]]) and his other relatives. Thara is attracted to Murugan's (Aadhavan) intelligence and simple-innocent nature. Aadhavan tries to assassinate the judge at home in the middle of the night and also plants a bomb in Subramaniam's van, but both attempts fail. Meanwhile, Subramaniam's entire family is on a trip to Darjeeling, and Thara asks Aadhavan to hide a guitar belonging to Ilaiyaman ([[Ramesh Khanna]]), her madcap musician cousin. Aadhavan uses this opportunity and plants a mobile bomb in the guitar and places it in one of the cars which explodes at the wrong time and he fails to kill Subramaniam yet again. Meanwhile, a security officer at Subramaniam's house keeps informing Abdul Kulkarni of Aadhavan's entry into the house and all his progresses and failed attempts.\n\nThara is now suspicious about Aadhavan but when she questions him in secret, he informs her that he is really Subramaniam's long lost runaway son Madhavan. Thara soon informs all the members of the household about Madhavan and they are overjoyed and Thara and Aadhavan fall in love. However, they hide it from Subramaniam and Ilaiyaman, because of his hatred towards Madhavan. Aadhavan , however tells Bannerjee that he lied to Thara about Madhavan to distract her suspicion and that he really is not that runaway son at all. However, on Thara's birthday, a flashback reveals that Aadhavan is indeed the runaway Madhavan.\n\nYears ago, a ten-year-old Madhavan unknowingly carries a gift with a hidden bomb for his cousin Thara's birthday. His friend's mother plants the bomb in the toy to avenge Subramaniam for her husband's jail sentence. Though Thara survives, her mother Anu ([[Anu Hassan]]), opens the box and is killed along with her husband in the explosion. Subramaniam blames Madhavan for his sister Anu's death and for his friendship with a gangster's son and thrashes him. In anger and fear of going to a juvenile prison, Madhavan steals a gun from the cops and accidentally shoots his father and runs away from home. He kills his friend's mother as she is responsible for his aunt's death.  He saves a local goon Ibrahim Rowther ([[Sayaji Shinde]]) from death and is in turn adopted as his son and rechristened as Aadhavan.\n\nComing back to the present, Tharani tried to kill Subramanium, is stoped by Aadhavan and reveals his true identity that He is the son of Subramanium and Ibrahim Rowther challenges within two days I will kill you and the judge. Abdul Kulkarni is fed up with the repeated failed attempts of Aadhavan. So he makes another plan and threatens Ibrahim and his gang to surrender to the police and make a confession about Aadhavan and his plans. When the Assistant Commissioner of police ([[Riyaz Khan]]), confronts Aadhavan and is about to have him hauled off, Aadhavan gets Subramaniam's laptop containing the verdict and inquiry reports, takes him and Thara as hostages and drives away. In the meanwhile, the police commissioner ([[FEFSI Vijayan]]) arrives and makes a confession that the police actually had caught him after his very first attempt to kill the Judge had failed. When questioned by the commissioner, Aadhavan said that he backed off and misfired on purpose at the last moment, after he found that he was going to kill his own father. The Police then ask him to go back to the house to protect his father over a twenty-four-hour period everyday. This information is relayed to the Judge who is tearfully grateful to his son. Meanwhile, Abdul Kulkarni attacks the vehicle in which the trio are travelling and a fight ensues where Aadhavan saves his father and Thara, and Kulkarni is killed.\n\nAs the credits roll, we see that Madhavan and Thara are now married and live in the household with the huge family, and yet again Bannerjee brings two assistants ([[K. S. Ravikumar]] and [[Udhayanidhi Stalin]]), to help him and asks approval from Madhavan and he gladly approves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Suriya (actor)|Suriya]] as Madhavan (Aadhavan)\n* [[Nayantara]] as Thara\n* [[Vadivelu]] as Kuppan (Bannerjee)\n* [[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Bharath Murali]] as Subramaniam, Madhavan's Father\n* [[Saroja Devi]] as Rajalakshmi, Subramaniam's Mother\n* [[Rahul Dev]] as Abdul Kulkarni\n* [[Sayaji Shinde]] as Ibrahim Rowther\n* [[Anand Babu]] as Tharani\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Kuppusamy (Ilaiyamaan)\n* [[FEFSI Vijayan]] as Police Commissioner Rathnavelu\n* [[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]] as Murugan, Bannerjee's Nephew\n* [[Riyaz Khan]] as Deva\n* [[Manobala]] as Sundaramurthy, Subramaniam's Young Brother\n* [[Alex (actor)|Alex]] as Vasudevan, Subramaniam's Young Brother\n* [[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]] as Rani, Subramaniam's Young Sister-in-Law\n* [[Anu Hasan]] as  Anu, Thara's Mother\n{{colend}}\nThe director (K.

Some politicians promised to immediately remove the blockade after being voted into power, and were accused by their opponents of prolonging the demonstration to agitate voters. The blocked road affects more than 100,000 vehicles a day, adding hours to some journeys. As the area is also a border point into the capital, thousands of trucks are being diverted to other border points.\n\nFive petitions have been filed to stop the blockade. The [[Delhi High Court]] refused to hear the first two pleas and on 14 January 2020 declared the blockade to be a police matter. The [[Delhi Police]] have said that they will not use force to end the blockade. A third petition highlighted the difficulty faced by students with upcoming [[board examination]]s. The matter also reached the [[Supreme Court of India]] with two pleas being filed. Following the initial hearings, on 17 February the Supreme Court appointed three mediators to initiate conversations with the protesters regarding shifting to a location which doesn't block a public place. As of 5 March 2020 the second round of talks with the interlocutors is underway and the next hearing is on 23 March.\n\nEven after the spread of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India|coronavirus in India]], including additional restrictions enforced by the government under the [[Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897]], which includes a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people and the closure of schools, colleges, cinema halls and weekly markets among other things, the Shaheen Bagh protest still continued for several days.

Some politicians promised to immediately remove the blockade after being voted into power, and were accused by their opponents of prolonging the demonstration to agitate voters. The blocked road affects more than 100,000 vehicles a day, adding hours to some journeys. As the area is also a border point into the capital, thousands of trucks are being diverted to other border points.\n\nFive petitions have been filed to stop the blockade. The [[Delhi High Court]] refused to hear the first two pleas and on 14 January 2020 declared the blockade to be a police matter. The [[Delhi Police]] have said that they will not use force to end the blockade. A third petition highlighted the difficulty faced by students with upcoming [[board examination]]s. The matter also reached the [[Supreme Court of India]] with two pleas being filed. Following the initial hearings, on 17 February the Supreme Court appointed three mediators to initiate conversations with the protesters regarding shifting to a location which doesn't block a public place. As of 5 March 2020 the second round of talks with the interlocutors is underway and the next hearing is on 23 March.\n\nEven after the spread of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India|coronavirus in India]], including additional restrictions enforced by the government under the [[Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897]], which includes a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people and the closure of schools, colleges, cinema halls and weekly markets among other things, the Shaheen Bagh protest still continued for several days. As a precautionary measure the protesters planned a more \"controlled gathering\" by reducing the number of protesters to just 5 individuals and symbolically placing cots and sandals by other protesters in solidarity.<ref name=\"HT SBagh 1\"/><ref name=\"SB corona outbreak\"/> However, following the complete [[Lockdown#Emergency lockdown|lockdown]] imposed in Delhi from 23 to 31 March 2020,<ref name=\"lockdown Delhi\"/> the protesters were arrested and forcefully removed from the site by the Delhi Police on 24 March 2020.<ref name=\"100days\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n=== Causes ===\n[[File:No NPR CAA NRC graffiti Shaheen Bagh protests New Delhi 8 Jan 2020.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=Graffito of NPR-CAA-NRC in spray paint|No NPR CAA NRC graffiti at Shaheen Bagh]]\nOn 12 December 2019, the [[Parliament of India]] passed the [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]] (CAA), which amends the [[Indian nationality law|Citizenship Act of 1955]] to grant a swifter path to Indian citizenship under the assumption of [[religious persecution]] to any individual belonging to the specific religious minorities of [[Hindus]], [[Sikhs]], [[Buddhist]]s, [[Jain]]s, [[Parsis]] and [[Christians]] from [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]], for those who entered India on or before 31 December 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=195783|title=Parliament passes the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019|website=pib.gov.in|access-date=21 December 2019}}</ref> However, the Act does not mention Muslims and does not offer eligibility benefits to Muslim immigrants or immigrants belonging to other religions or from other countries,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/redefining-the-republic-citizenship-amendment-bill-6162526/|title=Citizenship law, proposed nation-wide NRC will revise conception of group rights in India|date=12 December 2019|website=The Indian Express|access-date=17 December 2019}}, Quote: \"Indeed, the CAB would only apply to undocumented Hindus, Sikhs, [...] would become \"refugees\" whereas Muslims [...] would remain illegal.\"</ref><ref name=\"MSNCAB\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/newsindia/rajya-sabha-passes-citizenship-amendment-bill-what-is-a-hindu-and-why-are-myanmar-nepal-bhutan-sri-lanka-left-out-of-cab/ar-AAK0NL1|title=Rajya Sabha passes Citizenship Amendment Bill: What is a Hindu and why are Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka left out of CAB?
