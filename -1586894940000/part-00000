I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence.

With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students, who have been exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says \"but.\" The Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man does another cover-up as he goes to prevent a kid named Crank and his two followers from freeing their grandfather from Swellview Prison so that he can get the monkey he owes Crank. The Danger Force teleports to Swellview Prison where they try to help fight the bad guys. Due to the Danger Force being unable  controltheir powers yet, and Mika's sonic scream manifesting, they mess up in the first battle and accidentally free the Toddler, Frankini, Goomer, the Beekeeper, Dr. Minyak, Jeff, the Time Jerker, Jack Frittleman, the Thumb Buddies, and other unnamed criminals from Swellview Prison. As the Danger Force agrees with Captain Man that they need more training, Frankini keeps going around due to the 75 costumes that he smuggled into Swellview Prison.\n\n''Guest stars'': [[Frankie Grande]] as Frankini, Carrie Barrett as Mary, [[Nakia Burrise]] as Angela, Antonio D.

They want to be referred to as Volt, AWOL, Shout-Out, and Brainstorm. Schwoz states that if the news uses their dumb name three times, it will stick. Captain Man stated that he got his name said three times thanks to a DJ named Coyote Jake. Their first attempt to get their right names said is to get a toddler named Ellis that Bose mistook for Toddler back to his parents. Mika and Miles go to Hip Hop Puree to meet a vlogger named Natalie Mazdah who sat on the same airplane that [[Emma Watson]] rode where they plan to get her to say the names of their superhero forms three times. When the Danger Force tries to get her to say their name, Hip Hop Pureee is visited by the Toddler and his henchmen. As their powers haven't been perfected, the Danger Force struggles to defeat the Toddler and his men until they use spicy milk on them. After the Toddler flees, Ellis' dads arrive to pick up Ellis who calls the Danger Force by their real superhero names.

After passing, Shapen gets them two new students she found at a bus stop due to a shortage of entries at the local gifted school. Schwoz finds a loophole in which they can get the students to leave on their own if it is miserable. The next day, Shapen arrives with the kids Percy and Miriam, who are sweet. Chapa states Percy and Miriam will affect their response to criminal activity. Early the next morning Captain Man and Danger Force come in after a night of crime-fighting. As Ray didn't get any sleep, Schwoz warns them that he will turn bad if he doesn't get enough rest. This causes Ray to plot to use a mayonnaise container filled with flesh-eating bacteria at them. Chapa, Mika, Miles, and Bose work to keep Percy and Miriam safe from an exhausted Ray. The mayonnaise container breaks on Ray as Shapen comes in after obtaining an opening in a Bordertown school for poor gifted children.

With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students ever since they were exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says \"but.\" The Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man does another cover-up as he goes to prevent a kid named Crank and his two followers from freeing their grandfather from Swellview Prison so that he can get the monkey he owes Crank. The Danger Force teleports to Swellview Prison where they try to help fight the bad guys.

Captain Man stated that he got his name said three times thanks to a DJ named Coyote Jake.

After passing, Shapen gets them two new students she found a bus stop due to a shortage of entries at the local gifted school. Schwoz finds a loophole in which they can get the students to leave on their own if it is miserable. The next day, Shapen arrives with the kids Percy and Miriam who are sweet. Chapa states Percy and Miriam will affect their response to criminal activity. Early the next morning, Captain Man and Danger Force come in after a night of crime-fighting. As Ray didn't get any sleep, Schwoz warns them that he will turn bad if he doesn't get enough sleep. This causes Ray to plot to use a mayonaise container filled with flesh-eating bacteria at them.

[[Aconbury Priory]] was established by [[John, King of England|King John]], who gave priory nuns felling and selling rights to Athelstans Wood. Following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century, the woods became the property of the Scudamore family, who until at least the 18th century coppiced the wood to make charcoal for fueling forges, while oak bark was used in the leather tanning process. The extent and characteristics of the wood remained the same from this time until after the Second World War, witnessed by aerial photographic evidence of 1946. Before felling from the 1950s, making room for the wide commercial coniferisation of the 1970s approved by the [[Forestry Commission]], the woods were of lime and ash, with \"oak and sweet chestnut trees and the sheets of bluebells and wood anemones under the coppice\".<ref name=Lovelace>Lovelace, David, ''Athelstans Wood, history, character and future'', Native Woodland Restoration in Herefordshire (2007)</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External Links==\n*{{commons category-inline|Little Birch, Herefordshire}}\n*[https://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/HEF/LittleBirch Little Birch], Genuki\n\n{{Portalbar|England|United Kingdom}}\n{{Herefordshire|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Civil parishes in Herefordshire]]\n[[Category:Hamlets in Herefordshire]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toHoarwithy(link changed toHoarwithy, Herefordshire; link changed toHoarwithy, Herefordshire) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Birch"}

Called \"Sweden's darkest pop export\" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" /> she is known for her raw, [[grunge music|grunge]]-influenced take on [[pop music]]. Her honest, complex and [[autobiography|autobiographical]] lyrical content has led to her being dubbed \"the saddest girl in Sweden\".<ref name=\"Out\" />\n\nRaised in the [[Djursholm]] district of [[Danderyd Municipality|Danderyd]], Lo is an alumna of the music school Rytmus Musikergymnasiet. She formed the rock band Tremblebee in 2006. After it disbanded, Lo pursued a career in songwriting and earned a publishing deal with [[Warner/Chappell Music]] in 2011. Working with producers [[Alexander Kronlund]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Xenomania]], she became a successful songwriter, while also recording and releasing her own compositions independently.\n\nIn 2013, Lo was signed to [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]], [[Island Records|Island]] and [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]. The following year, Lo rose to prominence with her debut album, ''[[Queen of the Clouds]]'', which opened at number 14 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in October 2014. It spawned the [[sleeper hit]] single \"[[Habits (Stay High)]]\", which peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as the moderate radio hit \"[[Talking Body]]\". Her second album, ''[[Lady Wood]]'', was released in October 2016 and debuted at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Its lead single, \"[[Cool Girl]]\", became an international hit. Her follow-up records, ''[[Blue Lips]]'' (2017) and ''[[Sunshine Kitty]]'' (2019), also performed well, the latter spawning the song \"[[Glad He's Gone]], which was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Music Video.\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Lo has co-written songs for other artists, including: [[Lorde]]'s \"[[Homemade Dynamite (Lorde song)|Homemade Dynamite]]\" (2017) and [[Ellie Goulding]]'s \"[[Love Me like You Do]]\" (2015), a song that garnered her [[Grammy Award]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations. She has collaborated with many artists, including [[Alesso]], [[Flume (musician)|Flume]], [[Nick Jonas]], [[Seven Lions]], [[Broods]], [[Urban Cone]] and [[Coldplay]].\n\n==Early life==\nEbba Tove Elsa Nilsson was born on 29 October 1987 in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|author=Savage, Mark|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26954021|title=Tove Lo: A Swedish pop star in waiting|work=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|author=Buchanan, John D.|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tove-lo-mn0003035440/biography|title=Tove Lo Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref> She has one older brother and is the daughter of [[iZettle]] [[co-founder]] Magnus Nilsson and psychologist Gunilla Nilsson Edholm.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/916940?programid=2071|title= Tove \"Tove Lo\" Nilsson|date=15 July 2017|access-date=5 January 2019|language=sv}}</ref><ref name=\"Popjustice\">{{cite web|author=Robinson, Peter|url=http://www.popjustice.com/interviewsandfeatures/an-interview-with-tove-lo/124165/|title=An interview with Tove Lo|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|date=17 February 2014|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref> Her lifelong nickname and adopted stage name, Tove Lo, was given to her at age three by her godmother because of her love for [[lynx]]es (singular: \"lo\" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).<ref name=\"BBC\"/> She explained; \"There was this lynx at a zoo that was called Tove, and that I totally fell in love with.

as '''Tove Lo''' ({{IPA-sv|\u02c8t\u00fb\u02d0v\u025b \u02c8lu\u02d0}}), is a Swedish singer and songwriter. Called \"Sweden's darkest pop export\" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\" /> she is known for her raw, [[grunge music|grunge]]-influenced take on [[pop music]]. Her honest, complex and [[autobiography|autobiographical]] lyrical content has led to her being dubbed \"the saddest girl in Sweden\".<ref name=\"Out\" />\n\nRaised in the [[Djursholm]] district of [[Danderyd Municipality|Danderyd]], Lo is an alumna of the music school Rytmus Musikergymnasiet. She formed the rock band Tremblebee in 2006. After it disbanded, Lo pursued a career in songwriting and earned a publishing deal with [[Warner/Chappell Music]] in 2011. Working with producers [[Alexander Kronlund]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Xenomania]], she became a successful songwriter, while also recording and releasing her own compositions independently.\n\nIn 2013, Lo was signed to [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]], [[Island Records|Island]] and [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]. The following year, Lo rose to prominence with her debut album, ''[[Queen of the Clouds]]'', which opened at number 14 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in October 2014. It spawned the [[sleeper hit]] single \"[[Habits (Stay High)]]\", which peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as the moderate radio hit \"[[Talking Body]]\". Her second album, ''[[Lady Wood]]'', was released in October 2016 and debuted at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Its lead single, \"[[Cool Girl]]\", became an international hit. Her follow-up records, ''[[Blue Lips]]'' (2017) and ''[[Sunshine Kitty]]'' (2019), also performed well, the latter spawning the song \"[[Glad He's Gone]], which was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Music Video.\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Lo has co-written songs for other artists, including: [[Lorde]]'s \"[[Homemade Dynamite (Lorde song)|Homemade Dynamite]]\" (2017) and [[Ellie Goulding]]'s \"[[Love Me like You Do]]\" (2015), a song that garnered her [[Grammy Award]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations. She has collaborated with many artists, including [[Alesso]], [[Flume (musician)|Flume]], [[Nick Jonas]], [[Seven Lions]], [[Broods]], [[Urban Cone]] and [[Coldplay]].\n\n==Early life==\nEbba Tove Elsa Nilsson was born on 29 October 1987 in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news|author=Savage, Mark|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26954021|title=Tove Lo: A Swedish pop star in waiting|work=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|author=Buchanan, John D.|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tove-lo-mn0003035440/biography|title=Tove Lo Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref> She has one older brother and is the daughter of [[iZettle]] [[co-founder]] Magnus Nilsson and psychologist Gunilla Nilsson Edholm.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/916940?programid=2071|title= Tove \"Tove Lo\" Nilsson|date=15 July 2017|access-date=5 January 2019|language=sv}}</ref><ref name=\"Popjustice\">{{cite web|author=Robinson, Peter|url=http://www.popjustice.com/interviewsandfeatures/an-interview-with-tove-lo/124165/|title=An interview with Tove Lo|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|date=17 February 2014|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref> Her lifelong nickname and adopted stage name, Tove Lo, was given to her at age three by her godmother because of her love for [[lynx]]es (singular: \"lo\" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).<ref name=\"BBC\"/> She explained; \"There was this lynx at a zoo that was called Tove, and that I totally fell in love with.

{"title_page": "Laws against Holocaust denial", "text_new": "[[File:Holocaust Denial Laws .svg|alt=|thumb|450x450px|Countries with laws against Holocaust denial]]\nSixteen European countries and [[Israel]] have '''laws against Holocaust denial''', the denial of the systematic [[Genocide|genocidal]] killing of approximately six million Jews in Europe by [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1930s and 1940s. Many countries also have broader laws that criminalize [[genocide denial]]. Of the countries that ban Holocaust denial, some, such as [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]], were among the perpetrators of [[the Holocaust]], and many of these also ban other elements associated with [[Nazism]], such as the display of [[Nazi symbols]].\n\nLaws against [[Holocaust denial]] have been proposed in many other countries (in addition to those nations that have criminalized such acts) including the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Such proposed laws have been criticised and faced opposition, most significantly from [[civil rights]] and [[human rights]] advocates who contend that the such laws would violate people's established rights of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of expression]]. Organizations representing Jews and other groups victimized during the Holocaust have generally been split, in opinion, about such proposed laws.\n\nThe courts in a number of jurisdictions have taken [[judicial notice]] that the Holocaust did happen. For example, a United States court in 1981, in a case brought by [[Mel Mermelstein]], declared the occurrence of gassings in [[Auschwitz]] during [[the Holocaust]] was a legally incontestable fact.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news | title = California Judge Rules Holocaust Did Happen | date = October 10, 1981 | page = A26 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/10/us/california-judge-rules-holocaust-did-happen.html | accessdate = November 20, 2010 }}</ref><ref>''[[Mel Mermelstein]] v. [[Institute for Historical Review]]'' (1981), Superior Court of Los Angeles County .</ref> Despite the doors to the supposed gas Chambers being made out of wood.\n\n== Overview and commentary ==\nScholars have pointed out that countries that specifically ban Holocaust denial generally have legal systems that limit speech in other ways, such as banning \"[[hate speech]]\". According to [[D. D. Guttenplan]], this is a split between the \"''[[common law]] countries'' of the United States, Ireland and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries from the ''civil law countries'' of continental Europe and Scotland. In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries the law is generally more proscriptive. Also, under the civil law regime, the judge acts more as an inquisitor, gathering and presenting evidence as well as interpreting it\".<ref>D D Guttenplan, [http://www.indexonline.org/en/news/articles/2005/1/europe-should-freedom-of-speech-stop-at-holo.shtml Should Freedom of Speech Stop at Holocaust Denial?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115074249/http://www.indexonline.org/en/news/articles/2005/1/europe-should-freedom-of-speech-stop-at-holo.shtml |date=January 15, 2008 }}, ''Index of Free Expression, 2005''.</ref> Michael Whine argues that Holocaust denial can inspire violence against Jews; he states, \"Jews' experience in the post-World War II era suggests that their rights are best protected in open and tolerant democracies that actively prosecute all forms of racial and religious hatred\".<ref>{{citation|author=Whine, Michael|title=Expanding Holocaust Denial and Legislation Against It|publisher=Jewish Political Studies Review|date=Spring 2008|url=http://jcpa.org/article/expanding-holocaust-denial-and-legislation-against-it/}}</ref>\n\n[[J\u00e1nos Kis]]<ref>J\u00e1nos Kis: Sz\u00f3l\u00e1ssabads\u00e1g \u00e9s n\u00e1ci besz\u00e9d, N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g, March 30, 1996.</ref> and in particular [[Andr\u00e1s Schiffer]]<ref>[http://www.mancs.hu/index.php?gcPage=/public/hirek/hir.php&id=19439 Fogadatlan pr\u00f3k\u00e1torok \u2013 A g\u00e1rda\u00edt\u00e9let f\u00e9lre\u00e9rtelmez\u00e9seir\u0151l], [[Magyar Narancs]], July 23, 2009</ref> feel the work of Holocaust deniers should be protected by a universal right to [[Freedom of Speech|free speech]]. \nAn identical argument was used<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkab.hu/content/en/en3/30_1992.pdf|title=Alkotm\u00e1nyb\u00edr\u00f3s\u00e1g - Kezd\u0151lap|accessdate=6 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421010839/http://www.mkab.hu/content/en/en3/30_1992.pdf|archive-date=21 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> by the Hungarian Constitutional Court (Alkotm\u00e1nyb\u00edr\u00f3s\u00e1g) led by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00f3lyom]] when it struck down a law against Holocaust denial in 1992.

Many countries also have broader laws that criminalize [[genocide denial]].
