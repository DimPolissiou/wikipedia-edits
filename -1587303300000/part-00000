His name has been mentioned in different forms in various sources; including [[Herodotus]], who has written his name as '''D\u0113iok\u0113s'''. Deioces' name is derived from the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] word ''Dahyu-ka-'', meaning \"the lands\" (above, on and beneath the earth).\n\nThe exact date of the era of Deioces' rule is not clear and probably covered most of the first half of the seventh century BC. According to Herodotus, Deioces governed for 53 years.\n\nBased on Herodotus's writings, Deioces was the first Median king to have gained independence from the [[Assyria]]ns. He contemplated the project and plan of forming a single Median government; and in an [[Anarchism|anarchistic]] era of the Medes, he tried to enforce [[justice]] in his own village and earn a credibility and fame as a neutral [[judge]]. Thus, the territory of his activity was expanded and the peoples of other villages also resorted to him until he eventually announced that this place has been troublesome for him and he is not willing to continue working. Following this resignation, theft and chaos increased and the Medians gathered and chose him as the king this time.\n\nDeioces' first action after [[coronation]] was to appoint guards for himself and also constructing a [[Capital city|capital]]. The city Deioces chose for it was called ''Hagmat\u0101na'' in [[Old Persian]] and [[Ecbatana]] in [[Greek language]], believed to be [[Hamadan]] today. Ecbatana means \"the gathering place\" or \"a city for everyone\" and indicates the gathering of the Median clans, which were disunited previously. In the late eighth century BC, he had a fortified [[castle]] constructed on a hill in the city to run all [[military]], [[government]] and [[treasury]] affairs within.\n\nIn 715 BC, [[Sargon II]], the Assyrian king, learned that Deioces had allied with [[Rusa I]], the [[Urartu|Urartian]] king.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates (i.e. vertically) and the atomic volumes as abscissae (i.e. horizontally)\u2014the curve obtained a series of maximums and minimums\u2014the most [[electropositive]] elements would appear at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights. In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]] and the five rare earths \u2014 [[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{Sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=4-5}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by a half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{Sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=23}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements,  which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew was is now called [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

These radioactive elements (termed \"radioelements\") were accordingly placed at the bottom of the periodic table, as they were known to have greater atomic weights than stable elements, although their exact order was not known. Researchers believed there were still more radioactive elements yet to be discovered, and during the next decade, the [[decay chain#Actinide alpha decay chain|decay chain]]s of thorium and uranium were extensively studied. Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas [[radon]], and their chemical properties were investigated.{{r|ley196610}} By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist [[Bertram Boltwood]] proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>). This finding was accepted as an explanation of the fixed lengths of periods and led to repositioning of the noble gases from the left edge of the table to the right.<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Unwillingness of the noble gases to engage in chemical reaction was explained in the alluded stability of closed noble gas electron configurations; from this notion emerged the [[octet rule]].<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Among the notable works that established the importance of the periodicity of eight were the [[valence bond theory]], published in 1916 by American chemist [[Gilbert N.

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]]. The first person in history to discover a new element was [[Hennig Brand]], a [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] [[Germans|German]] merchant. Brand tried to discover the [[Philosopher's Stone]]\u2014a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base [[metal]]s into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with [[Distillation|distilled]] human [[urine]] resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (''kaltes Feuer'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/discoveryoftheel002045mbp#page/n135/mode/2up|title=Discovery of the Elements|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary|date=1956|publisher=Journal of Chemical Education|edition=6th|location=Easton, Pennsylvania, USA|page=122}}</ref> He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]] rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, British physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, German physicist [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]] began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

It has gaps in row 0 (hypothesized elements lighter than hydrogen) and row 9 (lanthanides).]]\n\n=== Mendeleev's predictions and inability to incorporate the rare earth metals ===\nIn addition to the predictions of scandium, gallium, and germanium that were quickly realized, Mendeleev's 1871 table left many more spaces for undiscovered elements, though he did not provide detailed predictions of their properties. In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]] and the five rare earths \u2014 [[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{Sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2014|pp=4-5}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by a half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{Sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2014|p=23}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements,  which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew was is now called [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

However, neither the higher valency for cerium nor for didymium had been established, and Mendeleev tried to do that himself. Having had no success in that, he abandoned his attempts to incorporate the rare earth metals in late 1871 and embarked on his grand idea of [[luminiferous ether]]. His idea was carried on by Austrian-Hungarian chemist [[Bohuslav Brauner]], who sought to find a place in the periodic table for the rare earth metals;{{Sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2014|pp=29-30}} Mendeleev later referred to him as to \"one of the true consolidators of the periodic law\".\n\nWhile elements with these atomic weights were later discovered, their chemistry did not correspond to the gaps in Mendeleev's table.<ref name=\"1871table\">{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=P.J.|date=2019|title=Mendeleev's predictions: success and failure|journal=Foundations of Chemistry|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3\u20139|doi=10.1007/s10698-018-9312-0}}</ref> Several heavier analogs were correctly predicted, such as tri-[[manganese]] ([[rhenium]]) and dvi-[[iodine]] ([[astatine]]), though they were later found to occupy the positions of dvi-manganese and eka-iodine respectively.

Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas [[radon]], and their chemical properties were investigated.{{r|ley196610}} By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist [[Bertram Boltwood]] proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>). This finding was accepted as an explanation of the fixed lengths of periods and led to repositioning of the noble gases from the left edge of the table to the right.<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Unwillingness of the noble gases to engage in chemical reaction was explained in the alluded stability of closed noble gas electron configurations; from this notion emerged the [[octet rule]].<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Among the notable works that established the importance of the periodicity of eight were the [[valence bond theory]], published in 1916 by American chemist [[Gilbert N.

The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties. Bohr proposed that elements in the same group behaved similarly because they have similar electron configurations, and that noble gases had filled [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] shells;<ref name=scerri98>{{cite journal |last1=Scerri |first1=E.R. |title=The Evolution of the Periodic System |journal=Scientific American |date=1998 |volume=279 |issue=3 |pages=78\u201383 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0998-78 |url=https://mipt.ru/dasr/upload/62f/f_brx2-arphh81ii9w.pdf}}</ref> this forms the basis of the modern [[octet rule]].

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], suggested the appearance of the ''d'' subshell in period&nbsp;4 and the ''f'' subshell in period&nbsp;6, lengthening the periods from 8 to 18 and then 18 to 32 elements.<ref name=Jensen>{{cite journal |journal = Journal of Chemical Education |volume = 80 |issue = 8 |year = 2003 |url = http://www.uv.es/~borrasj/ingenieria_web/temas/tema_1/lecturas_comp/p952.pdf |title = The Place of Zinc, Cadmium, and Mercury in the Periodic Table |first = William B. |last = Jensen |pages=952\u2013961 |doi = 10.1021/ed080p952 |bibcode = 2003JChEd..80..952J }}</ref>\n\n=== Proton and neutron ===\n{{Empty section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Later expansions and the end of the periodic table==\n\n=== Actinides ===\nAs early as 1913, Bohr's research on [[electronic structure]] led physicists such as Rydberg to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements heavier than uranium. Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively. However, preliminary investigations of their chemistry suggested a greater similarity to uranium than to lighter transition metals, challenging their placement in the periodic table.<ref name=clark/> During his [[Manhattan Project]] research in 1943, [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] experienced unexpected difficulties in isolating the elements [[americium]] and [[curium]], as they were believed to be part of a fourth series of transition metals.

The actinide series is the second row of the f-block (5f series), and comprises the elements from [[actinium]] to [[lawrencium]]. In both the actinide and lanthanide series, an inner [[electron shell]] is being filled.\n\n=== Relativistic effects and expansions beyond period 7 ===\nSeaborg's subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of [[Transuranium element|superheavy elements]] in a [[transactinide]] series comprising elements from [[Rutherfordium|104]] to [[Unbiunium|121]] and a [[superactinide]] series of elements from [[Unbibium|122]] to 153.<ref name=clark /> He proposed an [[extended periodic table]] with an additional period of 50&nbsp;elements (thus reaching element&nbsp;168); this eighth period was derived from an extrapolation of the [[Aufbau principle]] and placed elements&nbsp;121 to&nbsp;138 in a g-block, in which a new g subshell would be filled.<ref name=transu1>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=D.C |last2=Ghiorso |first2=A. |last3=Seaborg |first3=G.T. |title=The Transuranium People: The Inside Story |publisher=Imperial College Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-1-86094-087-3 |page=435\u2013436}}</ref> Seaborg's model, however, did not take into account [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] resulting from high atomic number and electron orbital speed.

It is now thought that because of relativistic effects, such an extension will feature elements that break the periodicity in known elements, thus posing another hurdle to future periodic table constructs.<ref name=PT172/>\n\nThe discovery of [[tennessine]] in 2010 filled the last remaining gap in the seventh period. Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.\n\nDespite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law. In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at [[University of California, Berkeley]] observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5. More recent experiments on [[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]] have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas [[radon]] rather than mercury and lead, their respective [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s. As such, the chemistry of many superheavy elements has yet to be well-characterized, and it remains unclear whether the periodic law can still be used to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements.<ref name=\"NYT-20190827\">{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Siobhan |title=Is It Time to Upend the Periodic Table? - The iconic chart of elements has served chemistry well for 150 years.

While hunting, the game plays as a third-person action game; the player uses a [[combo (video gaming)|combo system]] to attack the creature, while monitoring their own health and stamina gauge.

The processor accessed memory through the [[front-side bus]], which was clocked at 167&nbsp;MHz. The chips in these models of Mac mini ran at either 1.25, 1.33, 1.42, or 1.5&nbsp;[[GHz]]. It also had an ATI [[Radeon 9200]] graphics processor with 32&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] of DDR SDRAM in the standard editions, which was upgraded to 64 MB VRAM in the high-end version of the final Mac mini G4 in 2005.\n\n===Memory===\nThe Mac mini G4 uses 333&nbsp;MHz DDR SDRAM, allows a maximum of 1&nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] of memory, and has only one desktop DIMM slot for [[random-access memory]]. This restricts both the maximum amount of available memory, which can greatly reduce performance by forcing the system to page to the hard disk, and, since the system is unable to take advantage of dual channels, maximum bandwidth. This issue was addressed in the Intel models of Mac mini by using two notebook DIMM slots.\n\n===Storage===\nThe Mac mini G4 uses a single 2.5-inch [[Ultra ATA]]/100 [[hard drive]], which offers a maximum transfer rate of 100&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]]/s. Because of its sealed enclosure, it is not possible to upgrade the hard drive without opening the enclosure and possibly voiding the warranty of the system.<ref name=\"warranty\"/> The Mac mini G4 also contains a second [[Analog telephony adapter|ATA]] cable that connects to the optical drive. A [[Combo drive]] was included as standard, while a [[SuperDrive]] able to write to [[Digital Versatile Disc|DVDs]] was also an option.\n\n[[File:Mac mini G4 silent upgrade back.jpg|thumb|right|Back panel of a late 2005 PowerMac10,2 model Mac mini.

External displays are supported via a [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] port. Adaptors are also available for [[VGA]], [[S-Video]], and [[composite video]]. The system contains a built-in speaker and an analog 1/8-inch stereo mini jack.\n\nIn the last revision of the Mac mini G4, the internal [[daughterboard|mezzanine board]] was upgraded to accommodate the AirPort Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology onto one chip.

Second row: DC in, [[gigabit Ethernet]], [[Firewire 800]], [[Mini DVI]], [[Mini-DisplayPort]], 5 [[USB 2.0]] ports]]\n\n===Memory===\nUnlike the Mac mini G4, the Intel-based Mac mini uses a [[dual-channel architecture]] for memory. The original Intel-based Mac mini uses 667&nbsp;MHz [[DDR2 SDRAM]], while models starting with the early 2009 revision use 1066&nbsp;MHz [[DDR3 SDRAM]].\n\n===Storage===\nThe Intel-based Mac mini moves away from the formerly used [[Ultra ATA]]/100 to the newer [[Serial ATA]] interface, which offers a maximum 3&nbsp;Gbit/s transfer rate, however all models of Intel Mac mini have been limited to 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s even though the SATA standard supports a transfer of 3&nbsp;Gbit/s. All models continue to use 2.5-inch [[hard drives]] as opposed to the 3.5-inch drives used in standard desktops. A server edition of the Mac mini was introduced in October 2009, which omits the optical drive in favor of a second hard drive for a total of 1&nbsp;[[terabyte|TB]] of storage. A [[Combo drive]] was initially offered as standard, with the [[SuperDrive]] being an option, but through the 2010 models, all models that have an optical drive contain the SuperDrive as standard. The 2010 standard version of the Mac (without Server) comes with a 300&nbsp;GB or on 2.66&nbsp;GHz 500&nbsp;GB of storage.\n\n===Connectivity===\nThe Intel-based Mac mini includes four [[USB 2.0]] ports and one [[FireWire 400]] port. The [[I/O]] ports were changed with the early 2009 revision, with a fifth [[USB 2.0]] port added and the FireWire 400 port replaced with a FireWire 800 port. An infrared receiver was added allowing the use of an [[Apple Remote]]. \n\n[[Bluetooth]] 2.0+EDR and [[802.11g]] [[Wi-Fi]] became standard after being optional in the G4 version, and the Ethernet port was upgraded to [[Gigabit Ethernet|Gigabit]], while a built-in 56k modem is no longer available.<ref>[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/02/28Apple-Unveils-Mac-mini-with-Intel-Core-Duo/ Apple Unveils Mac mini with Intel Core Duo]. Apple. 28 February 2006.</ref> The 2009 models added [[802.11n|802.11 draft-n]] and later 802.11n Wi-Fi, and [[Bluetooth]] was also upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1.\n\nExternal displays are supported through a [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] port. The 2009 models change the video outputs to [[Mini-DVI]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]], which allowed for dual displays. The Mini DisplayPort supports external displays with a resolution up to 2560\u00d71600, which allows use of the 30-inch Cinema Display. While the Mac mini G4 supported only analog audio output, the Intel-based Mac mini has separate [[Mini-TOSLINK]]/[[TRS connector|3.5&nbsp;mm mini-jacks]] that supported both analog audio input and output as well optical digital [[S/PDIF]] input and output. \n\n===Specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF9999;\"|\n| <abbr title=\"Mac products that were discontinued 7 years ago and no longer receive hardware support from Apple or service providers.\">Obsolete</abbr><ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 |title=Vintage and obsolete products |work=Apple}}</ref>\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:10%\"| Component\n!colspan=2|[[Intel Core]]\n!colspan=3|[[Intel Core 2 Duo]]\n|-\n!style=width:10%\"|Model\n!style=\"background:#FF9999;width:18%\"|Early 2006<ref name=\"Early 2006\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Early 2006) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=October 13, 2008 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP34 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810171704/http://support.apple.com/kb/SP34 |archivedate=August 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n!style=\"background:#FF9999;width:18%\"|Late 2006<ref name=\"Late 2006\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Late 2006) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=October 13, 2008 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP29 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521091738/http://support.apple.com/kb/sp29 |archivedate=May 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n!style=\"background:#FF9999;width:18%\"|{{nowrap|Mid-2007}}<ref name=\"Mid 2007\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Mid 2007) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=January 30, 2009 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP7 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530094156/http://support.apple.com/kb/sp7 |archivedate=May 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n!style=\"background:#FF9999;width:18%\"|Early 2009<ref name=\"Early 2009\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Early 2009) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=March 3, 2009 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP505 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725055020/http://support.apple.com/kb/SP505 |archivedate=July 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n! style=\"background:#FF9999; width:18%;\"|Late 2009<ref name=\"Late 2009\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Late 2009) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=March 16, 2010 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP577 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821185238/http://support.apple.com/kb/SP577 |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Mac OS X Server, Late 2009\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Mac OS X Server, Late 2009) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=October 21, 2009 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP578 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821120045/http://support.apple.com/kb/SP578 |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|-\n!

PCIe-based flash storage is standard with no option of a [[hard disk drive]]. The storage was changed to a baseline 128 GB, with a maximum of 2 TB. The [[RAM]] was increased to a baseline of 8 GB, and a maximum of 64 GB of [[DDR4|SO-DIMM DDR4]]. The chassis is mostly a carryover from the previous generation, measuring the same dimensions, though is only available in a darker \"space gray\" finish.<ref>[https://www.pcmag.com/news/364698/apples-new-mac-mini-kills-the-entry-level-mac Apple's New Mac mini Kills the Entry-Level Mac].

The first Server model came preloaded with an [[OS X Server]] version of OS X, but later models instead came preloaded with the standard version of [[OS X]], as well as a separate OS X Server package, which included separate component apps (including \"Server App\", \"File Sharing\", \"Wiki Server\", \"Profile Manager\", etc.)<!-- from 2011 onwards *both* OS X & OS X Server came with Server models.

Later on, Apple released the OS X Server packaged app as a single purchase from the [[Mac App Store]], containing all the separate components apps, so that any model of Mac computer could download and use them.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe Mid-2010 Server model was initially the only Mac mini to entirely remove the optical drive, replacing it with a second hard drive in its place. However, from the Mid-2011 models onwards, all models of Mac mini had the optical drive removed.\n\nGreenhouse gas emission projections for the Mac mini Server were several times those of the regular Mac mini, in part because of the extra hard disk, but also due to increased expected lifetime energy use; the percentage of CO2 from usage rose from 39% to 77%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vertatique.com/apple-product-co2e-data-gives-good-guidance-all-gear-use |title=Apple CO2e Data Gives Useful Guidance for All Gear Use |work=Vertatique |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Mac mini Server hardware was discontinued with the Late 2014 model.

The processor accessed memory through the [[front-side bus]], which was clocked at 167&nbsp;MHz. The chips in these models of Mac mini ran at either 1.25, 1.33, 1.42, or 1.5&nbsp;[[GHz]]. It also had an ATI [[Radeon 9200]] graphics processor with 32&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] of DDR SDRAM in the standard editions, which was upgraded to 64 MB VRAM in the high-end version of the final Mac mini G4 in 2005.\n\n===Memory===\nThe Mac mini G4 uses 333&nbsp;MHz DDR SDRAM, allows a maximum of 1&nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] of memory, and has only one desktop DIMM slot for [[random-access memory]]. This restricts both the maximum amount of available memory, which can greatly reduce performance by forcing the system to page to the hard disk, and, since the system is unable to take advantage of dual channels, maximum bandwidth. This issue was addressed in the Intel models of Mac mini by using two notebook DIMM slots.\n\n===Storage===\nThe Mac mini G4 uses a single 2.5-inch [[Ultra ATA]]/100 [[hard drive]], which offers a maximum transfer rate of 100&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]]/s. Because of its sealed enclosure, it is not possible to upgrade the hard drive without opening the enclosure and possibly voiding the warranty of the system.<ref name=\"warranty\"/> The Mac mini G4 also contains a second [[Analog telephony adapter|ATA]] cable that connects to the optical drive. A [[Combo drive]] was included as standard, while a [[SuperDrive]] able to write to [[Digital Versatile Disc|DVDs]] was also an option.\n\n[[File:Mac mini G4 silent upgrade back.jpg|thumb|right|Back panel of a late 2005 PowerMac10,2 model Mac mini.

[[Computer networking|Networking]] is supported with [[Fast Ethernet|10/100 Ethernet]] and 56k V.92 modem, while [[IEEE 802.11g-2003|802.11b/g Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]] were additional build-to-order options. External displays are supported via a [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] port. Adaptors are also available for [[VGA]], [[S-Video]], and [[composite video]]. The system contains a built-in speaker and an analog 1/8-inch stereo mini jack.\n\nIn the last revision of the Mac mini G4, the internal [[daughterboard|mezzanine board]] was upgraded to accommodate the AirPort Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology onto one chip.

Second row: DC in, [[gigabit Ethernet]], [[Firewire 800]], [[Mini DVI]], [[Mini-DisplayPort]], 5 [[USB 2.0]] ports]]\n\n===Memory===\nUnlike the Mac mini G4, the Intel-based Mac mini uses a [[dual-channel architecture]] for memory. The original Intel-based Mac mini uses 667&nbsp;MHz [[DDR2 SDRAM]], while models starting with the early 2009 revision use 1066&nbsp;MHz [[DDR3 SDRAM]].\n\n===Storage===\nThe Intel-based Mac mini moves away from the formerly used [[Ultra ATA]]/100 to the newer [[Serial ATA]] interface, which offers a maximum 3&nbsp;Gbit/s transfer rate, however all models of Intel Mac mini have been limited to 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s even though the SATA standard supports a transfer of 3&nbsp;Gbit/s. All models continue to use 2.5-inch [[hard drives]] as opposed to the 3.5-inch drives used in standard desktops. A server edition of the Mac mini was introduced in October 2009, which omits the optical drive in favor of a second hard drive for a total of 1&nbsp;[[terabyte|TB]] of storage. A [[Combo drive]] was initially offered as standard, with the [[SuperDrive]] being an option, but through the 2010 models, all models that have an optical drive contain the SuperDrive as standard. The 2010 standard version of the Mac (without Server) comes with a 300&nbsp;GB or on 2.66&nbsp;GHz 500&nbsp;GB of storage.\n\n===Connectivity===\nThe Intel-based Mac mini includes four [[USB 2.0]] ports and one [[FireWire 400]] port. The [[I/O]] ports were changed with the early 2009 revision, with a fifth [[USB 2.0]] port added and the FireWire 400 port replaced with a FireWire 800 port. An infrared receiver was added allowing the use of an [[Apple Remote]]. \n\n[[Bluetooth]] 2.0+EDR and [[802.11g]] [[Wi-Fi]] became standard after being optional in the G4 version, and the Ethernet port was upgraded to [[Gigabit Ethernet|Gigabit]], while a built-in 56k modem is no longer available.<ref>[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/02/28Apple-Unveils-Mac-mini-with-Intel-Core-Duo/ Apple Unveils Mac mini with Intel Core Duo]. Apple. 28 February 2006.</ref> The 2009 models added [[802.11n|802.11 draft-n]] and later 802.11n Wi-Fi, and [[Bluetooth]] was also upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1.\n\nExternal displays are supported through a [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] port. The 2009 models change the video outputs to [[Mini-DVI]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]], which allowed for dual displays. The Mini DisplayPort supports external displays with a resolution up to 2560\u00d71600, which allows use of the 30-inch Cinema Display. While the Mac mini G4 supported only analog audio output, the Intel-based Mac mini has separate [[Mini-TOSLINK]]/[[TRS connector|3.5&nbsp;mm mini-jacks]] that supported both analog audio input and output as well optical digital [[S/PDIF]] input and output. \n\n===Specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF9999;\"|\n| <abbr title=\"Mac products that were discontinued 7 years ago and no longer receive hardware support from Apple or service providers.\">Obsolete</abbr><ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 |title=Vintage and obsolete products |work=Apple}}</ref>\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:10%\"| Component\n!colspan=2|[[Intel Core]]\n!colspan=3|[[Intel Core 2 Duo]]\n|-\n!style=width:10%\"|Model\n!style=\"background:#FF9999;width:18%\"|Early 2006<ref name=\"Early 2006\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Early 2006) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=October 13, 2008 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP34 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810171704/http://support.apple.com/kb/SP34 |archivedate=August 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n!style=\"background:#FF9999;width:18%\"|Late 2006<ref name=\"Late 2006\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Late 2006) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=October 13, 2008 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP29 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521091738/http://support.apple.com/kb/sp29 |archivedate=May 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n!style=\"background:#FF9999;width:18%\"|{{nowrap|Mid-2007}}<ref name=\"Mid 2007\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Mid 2007) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=January 30, 2009 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP7 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530094156/http://support.apple.com/kb/sp7 |archivedate=May 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n!style=\"background:#FF9999;width:18%\"|Early 2009<ref name=\"Early 2009\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Early 2009) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=March 3, 2009 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP505 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725055020/http://support.apple.com/kb/SP505 |archivedate=July 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n! style=\"background:#FF9999; width:18%;\"|Late 2009<ref name=\"Late 2009\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Late 2009) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=March 16, 2010 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP577 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821185238/http://support.apple.com/kb/SP577 |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Mac OS X Server, Late 2009\">{{Citation |title=Mac mini (Mac OS X Server, Late 2009) \u2013 Technical Specifications |date=October 21, 2009 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP578 |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821120045/http://support.apple.com/kb/SP578 |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n|-\n!

It also included an internal [[power supply]] and an [[SD card]] slot.<ref name=\"unibodyoriginaldevelopment\">{{Citation |title=Designed to put more power in less space. |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=https://www.apple.com/macmini/design.html |accessdate=June 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627051656/http://www.apple.com/macmini/design.html |archivedate=June 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> An [[HDMI]] port, which Apple describes as being HDMI 1.4 compliant, replaces the [[Mini-DVI]] port as one of the main video connection methods.\n\nAn update announced on July 20, 2011 added a [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] port, dual-core Intel [[Core i5]] and quad-core [[Core i7|i7]] processors, support for up to 16&nbsp;GB of memory, [[Bluetooth]] 4.0, and either Intel [[HD Graphics 3000]] integrated graphics or AMD [[Comparison of AMD graphics processing units#Radeon HD 6xxxM Series|Radeon HD 6630M]] dedicated graphics. The revision also removed the internal CD/DVD optical drive from all versions. The server model was upgraded to a quad-core [[Core i7]] processor.\n\nApple updated the line on October 23, 2012 with [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] processors, [[USB 3.0]], and upgraded graphics.<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3542576/apple-announces-updated-mac-mini-starting-at-599 Apple announces updated Mac mini starting at $599].

The Firewire 800 port was replaced with a second Thunderbolt port. The price of the base-model was lowered by $100. The only change to the body was the removal of the two holes used to open the case, as the memory was no longer upgradable because it was soldered to the logic board. Since the integrated graphics processor does not have its own dedicated memory, the system shares some of the main system memory with it.<ref>[http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203091 Mac mini (Late 2014): Memory specifications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210023306/http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203091 |date=February 10, 2015 }} Retrieved February 9, 2015</ref> [[4K resolution|4K]] video output via HDMI was added.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202856 | title=Use 4K displays and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222431/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202856 | archivedate=September 5, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Structure===\nThere is a removable panel on the bottom of the chassis enabling the user to upgrade the [[RAM]].

PCIe-based flash storage is standard with no option of a [[hard disk drive]]. The storage was changed to a baseline 128 GB, with a maximum of 2 TB. The [[RAM]] was increased to a baseline of 8 GB, and a maximum of 64 GB of [[DDR4|SO-DIMM DDR4]]. The chassis is mostly a carryover from the previous generation, measuring the same dimensions, though is only available in a darker \"space gray\" finish.<ref>[https://www.pcmag.com/news/364698/apples-new-mac-mini-kills-the-entry-level-mac Apple's New Mac mini Kills the Entry-Level Mac].

The HDMI port supported up to [[1080p]] and 8 channel 24-bit audio at 192&nbsp;kHz, Dolby Surround 5.1 and stereo output.

The first Server model came preloaded with an [[OS X Server]] version of OS X, but later models instead came preloaded with the standard version of [[OS X]], as well as a separate OS X Server package, which included separate component apps (including \"Server App\", \"File Sharing\", \"Wiki Server\", \"Profile Manager\", etc.)<!-- from 2011 onwards *both* OS X & OS X Server came with Server models. Around late 2011 and early 2012, they then came with the standard OS X distribution supplemented with an additional OS X Server *package of separate apps* instead. -->. Later on, Apple released the OS X Server packaged app as a single purchase from the [[Mac App Store]], containing all the separate components apps, so that any model of Mac computer could download and use them.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe Mid-2010 Server model was initially the only Mac mini to entirely remove the optical drive, replacing it with a second hard drive in its place. However, from the Mid-2011 models onwards, all models of Mac mini had the optical drive removed.\n\nGreenhouse gas emission projections for the Mac mini Server were several times those of the regular Mac mini, in part because of the extra hard disk, but also due to increased expected lifetime energy use; the percentage of CO2 from usage rose from 39% to 77%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vertatique.com/apple-product-co2e-data-gives-good-guidance-all-gear-use |title=Apple CO2e Data Gives Useful Guidance for All Gear Use |work=Vertatique |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Mac mini Server hardware was discontinued with the Late 2014 model.

It functions both as a [[hormone]] and a [[neurotransmitter]], and plays several important roles in the brain and body. It is an [[amine]] synthesized by removing a [[carboxyl group]] from a molecule of its [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor chemical]] [[L-DOPA]], which is [[biosynthesis|synthesized]] in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as a [[neurotransmitter]]\u2014a chemical released by [[neuron]]s (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinct [[dopaminergic pathway|dopamine pathways]], one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of [[reward system|reward-motivated behavior]]. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain,<ref name=\"Dissecting components of reward: \u2018liking\u2019, \u2018wanting\u2019, and learning\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Robinson TE, Aldridge JW | title = Dissecting components of reward: 'liking', 'wanting', and learning | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 65\u201373 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19162544 | pmc = 2756052 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2008.12.014 }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2019}} and many [[addiction|addictive]] [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] increase dopamine release or block its [[reuptake]] into neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in [[motor system|motor control]] and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and [[dopaminergic cell groups|cell groups]] form a dopamine system which is [[neuromodulation|neuromodulatory]].\n\nIn popular culture and media, dopamine is usually seen as the main chemical of pleasure, but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confers [[motivational salience]];<ref name=\"NAcc function\" /><ref name=\"pmid24107968\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baliki MN, Mansour A, Baria AT, Huang L, Berger SE, Fields HL, Apkarian AV | title = Parceling human accumbens into putative core and shell dissociates encoding of values for reward and pain | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 33 | issue = 41 | pages = 16383\u201393 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24107968 | pmc = 3792469 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1731-13.2013 | quote = <!--Recent evidence indicates that inactivation of D2 receptors, in the indirect striatopallidal pathway in rodents, is necessary for both acquisition and expression of aversive behavior, and direct pathway D1 receptor activation controls reward-based learning (Hikida et al., 2010; Hikida et al., 2013). It seems we can conclude that direct and indirect pathways of the NAc, via D1 and D2 receptors, subserve distinct anticipation and valuation roles in the shell and core of NAc, which is consistent with observations regarding spatial segregation and diversity of responses of midbrain dopaminergic neurons for rewarding and aversive conditions, some encoding motivational value, others motivational salience, each connected with distinct brain networks and having distinct roles in motivational control (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2012; Lammel et al., 2013).&nbsp;... Thus, the previous results, coupled with the current observations, imply that the NAc pshell response reflects a prediction/anticipation or salience signal, and the NAc pcore response is a valuation response (reward predictive signal) that signals the negative reinforcement value of cessation of pain (i.e., anticipated analgesia). -->}}</ref><ref name=\"Aversion neurons\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wenzel JM, Rauscher NA, Cheer JF, Oleson EB | title = A role for phasic dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens in encoding aversion: a review of the neurochemical literature | journal = ACS Chemical Neuroscience | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 16\u201326 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25491156 | doi = 10.1021/cn500255p |quote = Thus, fear-evoking stimuli are capable of differentially altering phasic dopamine transmission across NAcc subregions.

Motivation can be conceptually described as a continuum along which stimuli can either reinforce or punish responses to other stimuli. Behaviorally, stimuli that reinforce are called rewarding and those that punish aversive (Skinner, 1953). Reward and aversion describe the impact a stimulus has on behavior, and provided of motivational properties, thus able to induce attribution of motivational salience.&nbsp;... Attribution of motivational salience is related to the salience of an UCS (Dallman et al., 2003; Pecina et al., 2006). Thus, the more salient an UCS the more likely a neutral (to-be-conditioned) stimulus will be associated with it through motivational salience attribution. Prior experience is a major determinant of the motivational impact of any given stimulus (Borsook et al., 2007) and emotional arousal induced by motivational stimuli increases the attention given to stimuli influencing both the initial perceptual encoding and the consolidation process (Anderson et al., 2006; McGaugh, 2006).-->}}</ref>\n\nOutside the central nervous system, dopamine functions primarily as a local [[paracrine]] messenger.  In blood vessels, it inhibits [[norepinephrine]] release and acts as a [[vasodilator]] (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces [[Gastrointestinal physiology#Motility|gastrointestinal motility]] and protects [[intestinal mucosa]]; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of [[lymphocytes]].  With the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.\n\nSeveral important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. [[Parkinson's disease]], a degenerative condition causing [[tremor]] and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the [[midbrain]] called the [[substantia nigra]]. Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured; ''Levodopa'', a pure form of L-DOPA, is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's. There is evidence that [[schizophrenia]] involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic drugs]] used to treat this are [[dopamine antagonist]]s which reduce dopamine activity.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Moncrieff J | title =The myth of the chemical cure.

Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (\u201cwanting\u201d) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum).

As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.&nbsp;...

It seems we can conclude that direct and indirect pathways of the NAc, via D1 and D2 receptors, subserve distinct anticipation and valuation roles in the shell and core of NAc, which is consistent with observations regarding spatial segregation and diversity of responses of midbrain dopaminergic neurons for rewarding and aversive conditions, some encoding motivational value, others motivational salience, each connected with distinct brain networks and having distinct roles in motivational control (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2012; Lammel et al., 2013).&nbsp;... Thus, the previous results, coupled with the current observations, imply that the NAc pshell response reflects a prediction/anticipation or salience signal, and the NAc pcore response is a valuation response (reward predictive signal) that signals the negative reinforcement value of cessation of pain (i.e., anticipated analgesia). -->}}</ref><ref name=\"Aversion neurons\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wenzel JM, Rauscher NA, Cheer JF, Oleson EB | title = A role for phasic dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens in encoding aversion: a review of the neurochemical literature | journal = ACS Chemical Neuroscience | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 16\u201326 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25491156 | doi = 10.1021/cn500255p |quote = Thus, fear-evoking stimuli are capable of differentially altering phasic dopamine transmission across NAcc subregions.

Motivation can be conceptually described as a continuum along which stimuli can either reinforce or punish responses to other stimuli. Behaviorally, stimuli that reinforce are called rewarding and those that punish aversive (Skinner, 1953). Reward and aversion describe the impact a stimulus has on behavior, and provided of motivational properties, thus able to induce attribution of motivational salience.&nbsp;... Attribution of motivational salience is related to the salience of an UCS (Dallman et al., 2003; Pecina et al., 2006). Thus, the more salient an UCS the more likely a neutral (to-be-conditioned) stimulus will be associated with it through motivational salience attribution. Prior experience is a major determinant of the motivational impact of any given stimulus (Borsook et al., 2007) and emotional arousal induced by motivational stimuli increases the attention given to stimuli influencing both the initial perceptual encoding and the consolidation process (Anderson et al., 2006; McGaugh, 2006).-->}}</ref>\n\nOutside the central nervous system, dopamine functions primarily as a local [[paracrine]] messenger.  In blood vessels, it inhibits [[norepinephrine]] release and acts as a [[vasodilator]] (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces [[Gastrointestinal physiology#Motility|gastrointestinal motility]] and protects [[intestinal mucosa]]; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of [[lymphocytes]].  With the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.\n\nSeveral important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine.

As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.&nbsp;...

In particular, we found that risperidone impaired participants\u2019 ability to experience musical pleasure, whereas levodopa enhanced it.&nbsp;... Here, in contrast, studying responses to abstract rewards in human subjects, we show that manipulation of dopaminergic transmission affects both the pleasure (i.e., amount of time reporting chills and emotional arousal measured by EDA) and the motivational components of musical reward (money willing to spend). These findings suggest that dopaminergic signaling is a sine qua non condition not only for motivational responses, as has been shown with primary and secondary rewards, but also for hedonic reactions to music. This result supports recent findings showing that dopamine also mediates the perceived pleasantness attained by other types of abstract rewards (37) and challenges previous findings in animal models on primary rewards, such as food (42, 43).|lay-source=Neuroscience News|lay-url=https://neurosciencenews.com/dopamine-music-10628/|lay-date=24 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Secondary source for 'Dopaminergic control of hedonic impact'\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Goupil L, Aucouturier JJ | title = Musical pleasure and musical emotions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 116 | issue = 9 | pages = 3364\u20133366 | date = February 2019 | pmid = 30770455 | pmc = 6397567 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1900369116 | quote = In a pharmacological study published in PNAS, Ferreri et al.

While the question of the musical expression of emotion has a long history of investigation, including in PNAS (6), and the 1990s psychophysiological strand of research had already established that musical pleasure could activate the autonomic nervous system (7), the authors\u2019 demonstration of the implication of the reward system in musical emotions was taken as inaugural proof that these were veridical emotions whose study has full legitimacy to inform the neurobiology of our everyday cognitive, social, and affective functions (8). Incidentally, this line of work, culminating in the article by Ferreri et al. (1), has plausibly done more to attract research funding for the field of music sciences than any other in this community.<br />The evidence of Ferreri et al. (1) provides the latest support for a compelling neurobiological model in which musical pleasure arises from the interaction of ancient reward/valuation systems (striatal\u2013limbic\u2013paralimbic) with more phylogenetically advanced perception/predictions systems (temporofrontal).}}</ref>\n\n===Outside the nervous system===\n\nDopamine does not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, so its synthesis and functions in peripheral areas are to a large degree independent of its synthesis and functions in the brain.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> A substantial amount of dopamine circulates in the bloodstream, but its functions there are not entirely clear.<ref name=Eisenhofer/> Dopamine is found in blood plasma at levels comparable to those of epinephrine, but in humans, over 95% of the dopamine in the plasma is in the form of dopamine [[sulfate]], a conjugate produced by the enzyme [[SULT1A3|sulfotransferase 1A3/1A4]] acting on free dopamine.<ref name=Eisenhofer/> The bulk of this dopamine sulfate is produced in the [[mesentery]] that surrounds parts of the digestive system.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>  The production of dopamine sulfate is thought to be a mechanism for detoxifying dopamine that is ingested as food or produced by the digestive process\u2014levels in the plasma typically rise more than fifty-fold after a meal.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>  Dopamine sulfate has no known biological functions and is excreted in urine.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>\n\nThe relatively small quantity of unconjugated dopamine in the bloodstream may be produced by the [[sympathetic nervous system]], the digestive system, or possibly other organs.<ref name=Eisenhofer/> It may act on dopamine receptors in peripheral tissues, or be metabolized, or be converted to norepinephrine by the enzyme [[dopamine beta hydroxylase]], which is released into the bloodstream by the adrenal medulla.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>  Some dopamine receptors are located in the walls of arteries, where they act as a [[vasodilation|vasodilator]] and an inhibitor of norepinephrine release.<ref name=Missale>{{cite journal | vauthors = Missale C, Nash SR, Robinson SW, Jaber M, Caron MG | title = Dopamine receptors: from structure to function | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pages = 189\u2013225 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9457173 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.1998.78.1.189 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/224a351ba65d5df26f977d403175abc8d1412504 }}</ref>  These responses might be activated by dopamine released from the [[carotid body]] under conditions of low oxygen, but whether arterial dopamine receptors perform other biologically useful functions is not known.<ref name=Missale/>\n\nBeyond its role in modulating blood flow, there are several peripheral systems in which dopamine circulates within a limited area and performs an [[exocrine gland|exocrine]] or [[paracrine signalling|paracrine]] function.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>  The peripheral systems in which dopamine plays an important role include the [[immune system]], the [[kidney]]s and the [[pancreas]].\n\nIn the immune system dopamine acts upon receptors present on immune cells, especially [[lymphocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Buttarelli\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buttarelli FR, Fanciulli A, Pellicano C, Pontieri FE | title = The dopaminergic system in peripheral blood lymphocytes: from physiology to pharmacology and potential applications to neuropsychiatric disorders | journal = Current Neuropharmacology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 278\u201388 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 22131937 | pmc = 3131719 | doi = 10.2174/157015911795596612 }}</ref>  Dopamine can also affect immune cells in the [[spleen]], [[bone marrow]], and [[circulatory system]].<ref name=\"pmid19896530\"/> In addition, dopamine can be synthesized and released by immune cells themselves.<ref name=Buttarelli/>  The main effect of dopamine on lymphocytes is to reduce their activation level.

She sees [[prostitution]] as an occupation rather than a crime because women are using their bodies as commodities. However, she explains how the laws against [[Brothel|bawdy houses]] make sure that prostitution goes back to the streets where it has been criminalized. It is on the streets where prostitutes are seen as immoral and are prosecuted. If [[sex worker]]s were able to do their work in a secure, less criminalized area they would not be visible and therefore would not be seen as immoral and in turn prosecuted much less. She does definitely make the distinction between adult sex work and that of juvenile sex work because adults can consent to the activity and many use it as a source of employment however most of the time juveniles are exploited by older people in a position of power. Brock explains that societies panic surrounding [[sex]] and [[morality]] has enabled Canada to still criminalized sex work and prostitution.\n\n== Major works ==\nBrock, Deborah. 1998. Making Work, Making Trouble: Prostitution as a Social Problem. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.\n\nMaking work making trouble looks at how prostitution was made to be a social problem and a [[moral panic]]. Brock wonders why sex work is seen as a problem and for whom is it a problem. Chapter two focuses on how the [[murder]] of a young boy started a moral panic and the media made prostitution seem as though it was a big social problem. The government then got into it and started to shut places down and arrest people. Prostitution was used as a [[scapegoat]] for the young boy\u2019s death. Chapter three focuses on the problems with how to regulate [[street prostitution]] because of the definitions of who is a [[prostitute]], what is a public place, what is [[solicitation]], etc. The media and different groups start to make a big deal out of a small issues and soon everybody wants more police and more jails which leads to more [[criminal record]]s which forces women to sell their bodies because they cannot get another job. Basically moral and discriminatory bias is punishing the most disadvantaged women - those who work the streets- while doing nothing to understand why they are there in the first place. Chapter four looks at the creation of the special committee on [[pornography]] and Prostitution (The [[Fraser Committee]]), its mandates, its goals and its recommendations. Chapter five looks at bill C-49 which attempted to restrict the communication for the purpose of prostitution. Restricting the communication for the purpose of prostitution did not work to get the sex workers of the street even though there were a huge number of arrest. Chapter five also looks at how the rights of the upper and the [[middle class]] take priority over the rights of the sex workers in the way that the middle and [[upper class]] feel threatened and uncomfortable with the prostitutes but the rights of the prostitutes are not taken into account. Chapter six looks at the report of the Committee on Sexual offences against children and Youth (The Badgley Report) and its recommendations. Its purpose was to \"enquire into the incidence and prevalence in Canada of [[sexual offences]] against children and youth and to recommend improvements in laws for the protection of young persons from [[sexual abuse]] and [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]]\"(Brock, 1998, p.&nbsp;102). Chapter seven focuses on how the Badgley report built on a social problem of youth prostitution and victimization but it did not look at why the youth engaged in prostitution in the first place. The media and therefore the public saw youth prostitution as a new social problem but it has been happening for years. Chapter seven also looks at the legislation put in place to \"protect\" youth in prostitution and other resources that attempt to help youth prostitutes and/or [[runaway (dependent)|runaways]]. Finally Chapter eight explains that criminalizing prostitution is not going to make it stop. Proving safe places for prostitution to take place would better serve everybody affected. Many prostitutes are murdered each year by their customers and many youth turn to [[survival sex]], a form of prostitution. Women in the [[sex trade]] need more tools and support to protect themselves. The [[legislation]] and moral panic will not stop the sex trade despite what lawmakers may think.\n\nBrock, Deborah. 2000. \"Victim, Nuisance, Fallen Woman, Outlaw, Worker?: Making the Identity, Prostitute in Canadian Criminal Law.\" In D. Chunn and D. Lacombe (Ed.) Law as a Gendering Practice. Ontario.: Oxford University Press.\n\nIn this chapter Deborah Brock looks at how some people see prostitution as women who are victimized by [[patriarchy]], others see prostitution as women who will not be confined by the moral rules of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Other people see prostitutes as workers, some of which work is less favorable conditions than others but they are still workers. She examines how prostitution is often seen as symbolic of patriarchal [[oppression]] however many women use their bodies as a source of income. Sex workers are not able to participate in the discussions about the issues that directly affect them. They do not have a voice in the legislation being put forth to regulate their jobs and they do not have a say in the solutions that could decrease prostitution. She examines how laws have been in place to govern sex work since 1839 and is either seen as a [[public nuisance]] or a morality problem. The law continues to distinguish between good women and bad women and sex workers are often the scapegoat for other incidents or problems in the area.\n\n== Contributions to feminist criminology ==\nDeborah Brock has contributed to [[Feminism|feminist]] [[criminology]] through her work in understanding the root causes of prostitution and sex work. She contributes by explaining that prostitution, for the most part, is a choice made by the women as a way of supporting themselves. Sex work is sometimes the only option for women to support themselves because they are, many times, only given access to jobs that provide very low wages, are in the services sector and have little chance of advancement (Brock, 1998,p.&nbsp;14-15). She notes that prostitution is seen as immoral however it is the oldest occupation in the world. She attempts to understand why prostitutes are labeled by their job rather than by who they really are. She tries to demystify why some women must turn to prostitution in order to support themselves. She also explains that the laws to stop prostitution do not work and mainly come from the moral panic that the [[Mass media|media]] creates (Brock, 1998, p.&nbsp;138). Her major contribution of feminist criminology is in how moral panics about prostitution create laws that do not work in fixing the problem.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Brock, Deborah. 2000. \"Victim, Nuisance, Fallen Woman, Outlaw, Worker?: Making the Identity, Prostitute in Canadian Criminal Law.\" In D.

She completed her M.A. at [[Carleton University]] in 1984 and her Ph.D. at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1990. She is currently an associate professor (Arts) at [[York University]] and she teaches Crime and Criminological Theory; Social Regulation; Gender and Sexualities; Historical Sociology.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.arts.yorku.ca/soci/facstaff/people/brock.html |title=Deborah Brock |work=York University web site |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807063510/http://www.arts.yorku.ca/soci/facstaff/people/brock.html |archivedate=2009-08-07 }}</ref>\n\n== Overview of research ==\nBrock has written mostly about [[prostitution in Canada]]. She sees [[prostitution]] as an occupation rather than a crime because women are using their bodies as commodities. However, she explains how the laws against [[Brothel|bawdy houses]] make sure that prostitution goes back to the streets where it has been criminalized. It is on the streets where prostitutes are seen as immoral and are prosecuted. If [[sex worker]]s were able to do their work in a secure, less criminalized area they would not be visible and therefore would not be seen as immoral and in turn prosecuted much less. She does definitely make the distinction between adult sex work and that of juvenile sex work because adults can consent to the activity and many use it as a source of employment however most of the time juveniles are exploited by older people in a position of power. Brock explains that societies panic surrounding [[sex]] and [[morality]] has enabled Canada to still criminalized sex work and prostitution.\n\n== Major works ==\nBrock, Deborah. 1998. Making Work, Making Trouble: Prostitution as a Social Problem. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.\n\nMaking work making trouble looks at how prostitution was made to be a social problem and a [[moral panic]]. Brock wonders why sex work is seen as a problem and for whom is it a problem. Chapter two focuses on how the [[murder]] of a young boy started a moral panic and the media made prostitution seem as though it was a big social problem. The government then got into it and started to shut places down and arrest people. Prostitution was used as a [[scapegoat]] for the young boy\u2019s death. Chapter three focuses on the problems with how to regulate [[street prostitution]] because of the definitions of who is a [[prostitute]], what is a public place, what is [[solicitation]], etc. The media and different groups start to make a big deal out of a small issues and soon everybody wants more police and more jails which leads to more [[criminal record]]s which forces women to sell their bodies because they cannot get another job. Basically moral and discriminatory bias is punishing the most disadvantaged women - those who work the streets- while doing nothing to understand why they are there in the first place. Chapter four looks at the creation of the special committee on [[pornography]] and Prostitution (The [[Fraser Committee]]), its mandates, its goals and its recommendations. Chapter five looks at bill C-49 which attempted to restrict the communication for the purpose of prostitution. Restricting the communication for the purpose of prostitution did not work to get the sex workers of the street even though there were a huge number of arrest. Chapter five also looks at how the rights of the upper and the [[middle class]] take priority over the rights of the sex workers in the way that the middle and [[upper class]] feel threatened and uncomfortable with the prostitutes but the rights of the prostitutes are not taken into account. Chapter six looks at the report of the Committee on Sexual offences against children and Youth (The Badgley Report) and its recommendations. Its purpose was to \"enquire into the incidence and prevalence in Canada of [[sexual offences]] against children and youth and to recommend improvements in laws for the protection of young persons from [[sexual abuse]] and [[Sexual exploitation|exploitation]]\"(Brock, 1998, p.&nbsp;102). Chapter seven focuses on how the Badgley report built on a social problem of youth prostitution and victimization but it did not look at why the youth engaged in prostitution in the first place. The media and therefor the public saw youth prostitution as a new social problem but it has been happening for years. Chapter seven also looks at the legislation put in place to \"protect\" youth in prostitution and other resources that attempt to help youth prostitutes and/or [[runaway (dependent)|runaways]]. Finally Chapter eight explains that criminalizing prostitution is not going to make it stop. Proving safe places for prostitution to take place would better serve everybody affected. Many prostitutes are murdered each year by their customers and many youth turn to [[survival sex]], a form of prostitution. Women in the [[sex trade]] need more tools and support to protect themselves. The [[legislation]] and moral panic will not stop the sex trade despite what lawmakers may think.\n\nBrock, Deborah. 2000. \"Victim, Nuisance, Fallen Woman, Outlaw, Worker?: Making the Identity, Prostitute in Canadian Criminal Law.\" In D. Chunn and D. Lacombe (Ed.) Law as a Gendering Practice. Ontario.: Oxford University Press.\n\nIn this chapter Deborah Brock looks at how some people see prostitution as women who are victimized by [[patriarchy]], others see prostitution as women who will not be confined by the moral rules of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Other people see prostitutes as workers, some of which work is less favorable conditions than others but they are still workers. She examines how prostitution is often seen as symbolic of patriarchal [[oppression]] however many women use their bodies as a source of income. Sex workers are not able to participate in the discussions about the issues that directly affect them. They do not have a voice in the legislation being put forth to regulate their jobs and they do not have a say in the solutions that could decrease prostitution. She examines how laws have been in place to govern sex work since 1839 and is either seen as a [[public nuisance]] or a morality problem. The law continues to distinguish between good women and bad women and sex workers are often the scapegoat for other incidents or problems in the area.\n\n== Contributions to feminist criminology ==\nDeborah Brock has contributed to [[Feminism|feminist]] [[criminology]] through her work in understanding the root causes of prostitution and sex work. She contributes by explaining that prostitution, for the most part, is a choice made by the women as a way of supporting themselves. Sex work is sometimes the only option for women to support themselves because they are, many times, only given access to jobs that provide very low wages, are in the services sector and have little chance of advancement (Brock, 1998,p.&nbsp;14-15). She notes that prostitution is seen as immoral however it is the oldest occupation in the world. She attempts to understand why prostitutes are labeled by their job rather than by who they really are. She tries to demystify why some women must turn to prostitution in order to support themselves. She also explains that the laws to stop prostitution do not work and mainly come from the moral panic that the [[Mass media|media]] creates (Brock, 1998, p.&nbsp;138). Her major contribution of feminist criminology is in how moral panics about prostitution create laws that do not work in fixing the problem.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Brock, Deborah. 2000. \"Victim, Nuisance, Fallen Woman, Outlaw, Worker?: Making the Identity, Prostitute in Canadian Criminal Law.\" In D.

She demonstrates a few on some of her siblings much to their annoyance. But little does Luan know that she might get pranked right back.\n# Lori Loud \u2013 With Bobby on her phone helping out from Great Lakes City and Luna providing musical accompanyment, he and Lori talk about how they first met and eventually started dating. However, they over-romanticize the details on their first date so Luan and Lynn Jr. chime in and tell them what really happened and how they had spied on them during the date to make sure that Bobby was good for Lori.\n# Lincoln Loud \u2013 Lincoln and Clyde give the listeners a virtual tour of their treehouse. When their hammock goes missing, Lincoln and Clyde become Ace Savvy and One-Eyed Jack to find out who stole it. While Lincoln suspects that it's one of his sisters, they soon discover that the culprit is someone they'd least suspect.\n# Lynn Loud Jr. \u2013 Lynn Jr. leads the listeners in her own at-home workout, arguing that gym memberships are expensive and mentioning how some gyms tend to ban people for bringing spicy submarine sandwiches into the sauna. During every single part of the workout, Lynn causes fitness-type chaos in the house which annoys her family.\n# Lana Loud \u2013 Lana teaches the listeners how to handle and take care of vehicles. She uses the family van Vanzilla as an example. Lana gets some more help from her faithful frog Hops, her parents (Lynn Sr. and Rita), and two of her sisters: Lori and Leni as they are the ones who drive Vanzilla.\n# Lucy Loud \u2013 Lucy talks about the five main features of the Royal Woods Cemetery with the help of Lincoln since Luan was unavailable. Though they soon find evidence that there is a [[ghost]] in the area.\n# Rita Loud \u2013 Rita discusses what she does at her dentist job as she runs the dental office while Dr. Feinstein is away at Cavity Con. While she does the dental work on Lola, Lori, and a reluctant Lynn Loud Sr., Rita also has to deal with some malfunctioning equipment which leads to her calling Lana in to take care of them.\n# Lisa Loud \u2013 Lisa takes a break from solving her family's problems so that she can use her brainpower to solve the greater challenges of humankind by hosting a call-in called \"Ask a Brainiac.\" Though the people who call her up are Lynn Loud Sr., Luan, Rita, Lincoln, and Lynn with their respectful questions.\n\n===Films===\n====Feature film====\nOn March 28, 2017, [[Paramount Pictures]]' president [[Marc Evans]] announced a film based on the series originally set for release on February 7, 2020 in cinemas.<ref name=\"D'Alessandro\">{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|title=Paramount Teases Its Nickelodeon-Based Feature Toon Lineup Including \u2018The Loud House\u2019 \u2013 CinemaCon|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/spongebob-loud-house-sherlock-gnomes-1202054433/|date=March 28, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}</ref> However, in January 2019, Paramount removed the film from their schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|title=Paramount Dates \u2018Crawl\u2019 & \u2018Playing With Fire\u2019, Moves \u2018Loud House\u2019 Off Schedule|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/paramount-crawl-playing-with-fire-loud-house-release-dates-1202537734/|date=January 18, 2019|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> On February 5, 2019, it was announced that the film would instead be produced for release on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Vlessing\"/> On April 30, 2019, it was announced the film will be released sometime in 2021.

She demonstrates a few on some of her siblings much to their annoyance. But little does Luan know that she might get pranked right back.\n# Lori Loud \u2013 With Bobby on her phone helping out from Great Lakes City and Luna providing musical accompanyment, he and Lori talk about how they first met and eventually started dating. However, they over-romanticize the details on their first date so Luan and Lynn Jr. chime in and tell them what really happened and how they had spied on them during the date to make sure that Bobby was good for Lori.\n# Lincoln Loud \u2013 Lincoln and Clyde give the listeners a virtual tour of their treehouse. When their hammock goes missing, Lincoln and Clyde become Ace Savvy and One-Eyed Jack to find out who stole it. While Lincoln suspects that it's one of his sisters, they soon discover that the culprit is someone they'd least suspect.\n# Lynn Loud Jr. \u2013 Lynn Jr. leads the listeners in her own at-home workout, arguing that gym memberships are expensive and mentioning how some gyms tend to ban people for bringing spicy submarine sandwiches into the sauna. During every single part of the workout, Lynn causes fitness-type chaos in the house which annoys her family.\n# Lana Loud \u2013 Lana teaches the listeners how to handle and take care of vehicles. She uses the family van Vanzilla as an example. Lana gets some more help from her faithful frog Hops, her parents (Lynn Sr. and Rita), and two of her sisters: Lori and Leni as they are the ones who drive Vanzilla.\n# Lucy Loud \u2013 Lucy talks about the five main features of the Royal Woods Cemetery with the help of Lincoln since Luan was unavailable. Though they soon find evidence that there is a [[ghost]] in the area.\n# Rita Loud \u2013 Rita discusses what she does at her dentist job as she runs the dental office while Dr. Feinstein is away at Cavity Con. While she does the dental work on Lola, Lori, and a reluctant Lynn Loud Sr., Rita also has to deal with some malfunctioning equipment which leads to her calling Lana in to take care of them.\n# Lisa Loud \u2013 Lisa takes a break from solving her family's problems so that she can use her brainpower to solve the greater challenges of humankind by hosting a call-in called \"Ask a Brainiac.\" Though the people who call her up are Lynn Loud Sr., Luan, Rita, Lincoln, and Lynn with their respectful questions.\n\n===Films===\n====Feature film====\nOn March 28, 2017, [[Paramount Pictures]]' president [[Marc Evans]] announced a film based on the series originally set for release on February 7, 2020 in cinemas.<ref name=\"D'Alessandro\">{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|title=Paramount Teases Its Nickelodeon-Based Feature Toon Lineup Including \u2018The Loud House\u2019 \u2013 CinemaCon|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/spongebob-loud-house-sherlock-gnomes-1202054433/|date=March 28, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}</ref> However, in January 2019, Paramount removed the film from their schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|title=Paramount Dates \u2018Crawl\u2019 & \u2018Playing With Fire\u2019, Moves \u2018Loud House\u2019 Off Schedule|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/paramount-crawl-playing-with-fire-loud-house-release-dates-1202537734/|date=January 18, 2019|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> On February 5, 2019, it was announced that the film would instead be produced for release on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Vlessing\"/> On April 30, 2019, it was announced the film will be released sometime in 2021.
