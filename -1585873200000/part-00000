This award goes to the performing artist, the producer, recording engineer and/or mixer for that song. In this sense, \"record\" means a particular recorded song, not its composition or an album of songs.\n* Song of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the songwriter who actually wrote the lyrics and/or melodies to the song. \"Song\" in this context means the song as composed, not its recording.\n* Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer for that album. In this context, \"album\" means a recorded collection of songs (a multi-track LP, CD, or download package), not the individual songs or their compositions.\n\n==History and description==\nThe Record of the Year awards have been awarded since 1959.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/grammy-rewind-1st-annual-grammy-awards|title=GRAMMY REWIND: 1ST ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS|publisher=The Recording Academy|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> It is one of the four most prestigious Grammy Awards.

Triads in Hong Kong are less involved with \"traditional\" criminal activity and are becoming associated with [[white-collar crime]]; traditional initiation ceremonies rarely take place to avoid official attention. Rumors have it that triads have now migrated to the U.S and all groups and factions have now joined and aligned themselves as one large group. There are no longer any separations with rivals or groups, including United Bamboo and 14k.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|author=De Leon Petta Gomes da Costa|title=As Tr\u00edades e as Sociedades Secretas na China: Entre o mito e a desmistifica\u00e7\u00e3o|journal=Brazilian Journal of Social Sciences|issn=1806-9053|date=20 February 2017|volume=32|issue=93|pages=01|doi=10.17666/329309/2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nTriad, a China-based criminal organization, secret association or club, was a branch of the secret [[Hung Society]]. The society was fragmented, and one group (known as the Triad and the Ching Gang) became a criminal organization. After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, secret societies in mainland China were suppressed in campaigns ordered by [[Mao Zedong]]. Most Chinese secret societies, including the triads and some of the remaining Ching Gang, relocated to British-controlled Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia and overseas countries (particularly the US) and competed with the [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] and other Chinese secret societies. Gradually, Chinese secret societies turned to drugs and extortion for income.<ref name=\":0\">\"Gangland- Deadly Triangle.\" Online video clip, YouTube. YouTube, 2008. Web. 21 Apr. 2016</ref>\n\n===18th century===\nThe Heaven and Earth Society (\u5929\u5730\u6703, [[Tiandihui]]), a [[fraternal organization]], was founded during the 1760s. As the society's influence spread throughout China, it branched into several smaller groups with different names; one was the Three Harmonies Society (\u4e09\u5408\u6703, Sanhehui). These societies adopted the triangle as their emblem, usually accompanied by decorative images of swords or portraits of [[Guan Yu]].\n\n===19th century===\n[[British Hong Kong]] was intolerant of secret societies, and the British considered the triads a criminal threat. Triads were charged and imprisoned under British law.\n\nDuring the 19th century, many such societies were seen as legitimate ways of helping immigrants from China settle into a new country. Secret societies were banned by the British government in Singapore during the 1890s, and slowly reduced in number by successive colonial governors and leaders. Facilitating the origins of Singapore gangs, the opium trade, prostitution and brothels were also banned. Immigrants were encouraged to seek help from a local ''[[kongsi]]'' instead of turning to secret societies, which contributed to the societies' decline.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:KWC - 1989 Aerial.jpg|thumb|From the 1950s to the 1970s, the [[Kowloon Walled City]] in [[British Hong Kong]] was controlled by local triads.]]\nAfter [[World War II]], the secret societies saw a resurgence as gangsters took advantage of uncertainty and growing anti-British sentiment. Some Chinese communities, such as \"[[new village]]s\" in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Bukit Ho Swee]] in Singapore, became notorious for gang violence. When the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] came to power in 1949 in mainland China, law enforcement became stricter and a government crackdown on criminal organizations forced the triads to migrate to British Hong Kong. An estimated 300,000 triad members lived in Hong Kong during the 1950s. According to the University of Hong Kong, most triad societies were established between 1914 and 1939 and there were once more than 300 in the territory. The number of groups has consolidated to about 50, of which 14 are under police surveillance. There were nine main triads operating in Hong Kong. They divided land by ethnic group and geographic locations, with each triad in charge of a region. The triads were [[Wo Hop To]], [[Wo Shing Wo]], Rung, Tung, Chuen, Shing, [[Sun Yee On]], [[14K Triad|14K]] and [[Luen Group|Luen]]. Each had a headquarters, sub-societies and public image. After the [[Hong Kong 1956 riots|1956 riots]], the Hong Kong government introduced stricter law enforcement and the triads became less active.\n\n==={{anchor|Modern History}}21st century===\nOn the 18th of January 2018, Italian police arrested 33 people connected to a Chinese triad operating in Europe as part of its Operation China Truck (which began in 2011). The triad were active in [[Tuscany]], [[Veneto]], [[Rome]] and [[Milan]] in Italy, and in France, Spain and the German city of [[Neuss]]. The indictment accuses the Chinese triad of extortion, usury, illegal gambling, prostitution and drug trafficking. The group was said to have infiltrated the transport sector, using intimidation and violence against Chinese companies wishing to transport goods by road into Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Italian police bust Chinese 'mafia' running rackets across Europe|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20180118/italy-chinese-mafia-china-truck|website=The Local IT|accessdate=23 January 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124005759/https://www.thelocal.it/20180118/italy-chinese-mafia-china-truck|archivedate=24 January 2018}}</ref> Police seized several vehicles, businesses, properties and bank accounts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Italy arrests 33 'Chinese mafia' members|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42724613|accessdate=23 January 2018|agency=BBC|date=18 January 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123092922/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42724613|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Criminal activities==\nTriads engage in a variety of crimes, from [[fraud]], [[extortion]] and [[money laundering]] to [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] and [[prostitution]], and are involved in [[smuggling]] and [[Counterfeit consumer goods|counterfeiting goods]] such as music, video, software, clothes, watches and money.<ref>Gertz, for the ''Washington Times''. \"Like other organized crime groups, triads [...] are engaged in a range of illegal activities such as bank and [[credit card fraud]], currency counterfeiting, money laundering, extortion, human trafficking and prostitution.\" Triads rarely fight other ethnic mob groups, fighting mainly among themselves or against other triads. However triads were involved in some territorial disputes with the Irish mob, Jewish mafia and others.</ref>\n\n===Drug trafficking===\nSince the first [[opium]] bans during the 19th century, Chinese criminal gangs have been involved in worldwide [[illegal drug trade]]. Many triads switched from opium to heroin, produced from opium plants in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], refined into heroin in China and trafficked to North America and Europe, in the 1960s and 1970s. The most important triads active in the international heroin trade are the [[14K Triad|14K]] and the [[Big Circle Gang|Tai Huen Chai]]. Triads have begun smuggling chemicals from Chinese factories to North America (for the production of [[methamphetamine]]), and to Europe for the production of [[MDMA|Ecstasy]]. Triads in the United States also traffic large quantities of Ketamine\n\n===Counterfeiting===\nTriads have been engaging in counterfeiting since the 1880s. During the 1960s and 1970s, they were involved in [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting currency]] (often the Hong Kong 50-cent piece). The gangs were also involved in counterfeiting expensive books for sale on the black market. With the advent of new technology and the improvement of the average standard of living, triads produce counterfeit goods such as watches, film VCDs and DVDs and designer apparel such as clothing and handbags.<ref>M.

After drinking a mixture of wine and blood (from the animal or the candidate), the member passes beneath an arch of swords while reciting the triad's oaths. The paper on which the oaths are written will be burnt on the altar to confirm the member's obligation to perform his duties to the gods.

When Malaysia and Singapore (with the region's largest population of ethnic Chinese) became [[Crown colony|crown colonies]], secret societies and triads controlled local communities by extorting [[protection racket|protection money]] and [[Loan shark|illegal money lending]]. Many conducted blood rituals, such as drinking one another's blood, as a sign of brotherhood; others ran opium dens and brothels.\n\nRemnants of these former gangs and societies still exist. Due to government efforts in Malaysia and Singapore to reduce crime, the societies have largely faded from the public eye (particularly in Singapore).\n\nTriads were also common in Vietnamese cities with large Chinese (especially [[Cantonese]] and [[Teochew people|Teochew]]) communities. During the [[French Indochina|French colonial period]], many businesses and wealthy residents in [[Saigon]] (particularly in the [[Cholon, Ho Chi Minh City|Chinatown district]]) and [[Haiphong]] were controlled by protection-racket gangs.\n\nWith Vietnamese independence in 1945, organized crime activity was drastically reduced as [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s governments purged criminal activity in the country. According to Ho, abolishing crime was a method of protecting Vietnam and its people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antv.gov.vn/tin-tuc/chinh-tri/luc-luong-cand-trong-khang-chien-chong-phap-151940.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022033504/http://www.antv.gov.vn/tin-tuc/chinh-tri/luc-luong-cand-trong-khang-chien-chong-phap-151940.html |archivedate=2017-10-22 }}</ref> During the [[First Indochina War]], Ho's police forces concentrated on protecting people in his zone from crime; the French cooperated with criminal organisations to fight the [[Viet Minh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catp.danang.gov.vn/lich-su-cong-an-nhan-dan|title=L\u1ecbch s\u1eed C\u00f4ng an nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n - C\u00f4ng An \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng|website=www.catp.danang.gov.vn|accessdate=27 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022033712/http://www.catp.danang.gov.vn/lich-su-cong-an-nhan-dan|archivedate=22 October 2017}}</ref> In 1955, President [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] ordered the [[South Vietnam]]ese military to disarm and imprison organized-crime groups in the Saigon-[[Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Province|Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh]]-[[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]]-[[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]] region and cities such as [[M\u1ef9 Tho]] and [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]] in the [[Mekong Delta]].

During the [[Vietnam War]], the triads were eliminated in the north; in the south, Republic of Vietnam corruption protected their illegal activities and allowed them to control US aid. During the 1970s and 1980s, all illegal Sino-Vietnamese activities were eliminated by the Vietnamese police.

The society was fragmented, and one group (known as the Triad and the Ching Gang) became a criminal organization. After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, secret societies in mainland China were suppressed in campaigns ordered by [[Mao Zedong]]. Most Chinese secret societies, including the triads and some of the remaining Ching Gang, relocated to British-controlled Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia and overseas countries (particularly the US) and competed with the [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] and other Chinese secret societies. Gradually, Chinese secret societies turned to drugs and extortion for income.<ref name=\":0\">\"Gangland- Deadly Triangle.\" Online video clip, YouTube. YouTube, 2008. Web. 21 Apr. 2016</ref>\n\n===18th century===\nThe Heaven and Earth Society (\u5929\u5730\u6703, [[Tiandihui]]), a [[fraternal organization]], was founded during the 1760s. As the society's influence spread throughout China, it branched into several smaller groups with different names; one was the Three Harmonies Society (\u4e09\u5408\u6703, Sanhehui). These societies adopted the triangle as their emblem, usually accompanied by decorative images of swords or portraits of [[Guan Yu]].\n\n===19th century===\n[[British Hong Kong]] was intolerant of secret societies, and the British considered the triads a criminal threat. Triads were charged and imprisoned under British law.\n\nDuring the 19th century, many such societies were seen as legitimate ways of helping immigrants from China settle into a new country. Secret societies were banned by the British government in Singapore during the 1890s, and slowly reduced in number by successive colonial governors and leaders. Facilitating the origins of Singapore gangs, the opium trade, prostitution and brothels were also banned. Immigrants were encouraged to seek help from a local ''[[kongsi]]'' instead of turning to secret societies, which contributed to the societies' decline.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:KWC - 1989 Aerial.jpg|thumb|From the 1950s to the 1970s, the [[Kowloon Walled City]] in [[British Hong Kong]] was controlled by local triads.]]\nAfter [[World War II]], the secret societies saw a resurgence as gangsters took advantage of uncertainty and growing anti-British sentiment. Some Chinese communities, such as \"[[new village]]s\" in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Bukit Ho Swee]] in Singapore, became notorious for gang violence. When the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] came to power in 1949 in mainland China, law enforcement became stricter and a government crackdown on criminal organizations forced the triads to migrate to British Hong Kong. An estimated 300,000 triad members lived in Hong Kong during the 1950s. According to the University of Hong Kong, most triad societies were established between 1914 and 1939 and there were once more than 300 in the territory. The number of groups has consolidated to about 50, of which 14 are under police surveillance. There were nine main triads operating in Hong Kong. They divided land by ethnic group and geographic locations, with each triad in charge of a region. The triads were [[Wo Hop To]], [[Wo Shing Wo]], Rung, Tung, Chuen, Shing, [[Sun Yee On]], [[14K Triad|14K]] and [[Luen Group|Luen]]. Each had a headquarters, sub-societies and public image. After the [[Hong Kong 1956 riots|1956 riots]], the Hong Kong government introduced stricter law enforcement and the triads became less active.\n\n==={{anchor|Modern History}}21st century===\nOn the 18th of January 2018, Italian police arrested 33 people connected to a Chinese triad operating in Europe as part of its Operation China Truck (which began in 2011). The triad were active in [[Tuscany]], [[Veneto]], [[Rome]] and [[Milan]] in Italy, and in France, Spain and the German city of [[Neuss]]. The indictment accuses the Chinese triad of extortion, usury, illegal gambling, prostitution and drug trafficking. The group was said to have infiltrated the transport sector, using intimidation and violence against Chinese companies wishing to transport goods by road into Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Italian police bust Chinese 'mafia' running rackets across Europe|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20180118/italy-chinese-mafia-china-truck|website=The Local IT|accessdate=23 January 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124005759/https://www.thelocal.it/20180118/italy-chinese-mafia-china-truck|archivedate=24 January 2018}}</ref> Police seized several vehicles, businesses, properties and bank accounts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Italy arrests 33 'Chinese mafia' members|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42724613|accessdate=23 January 2018|agency=BBC|date=18 January 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123092922/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42724613|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Criminal activities==\nTriads engage in a variety of crimes, from [[fraud]], [[extortion]] and [[money laundering]] to [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] and [[prostitution]], and are involved in [[smuggling]] and [[Counterfeit consumer goods|counterfeiting goods]] such as music, video, software, clothes, watches and money.<ref>Gertz, for the ''Washington Times''. \"Like other organized crime groups, triads [...] are engaged in a range of illegal activities such as bank and [[credit card fraud]], currency counterfeiting, money laundering, extortion, human trafficking and prostitution.\" Triads rarely fight other ethnic mob groups, fighting mainly among themselves or against other triads. However triads were involved in some territorial disputes with the Irish mob, Jewish mafia and others.</ref>\n\n===Drug trafficking===\nSince the first [[opium]] bans during the 19th century, Chinese criminal gangs have been involved in worldwide [[illegal drug trade]]. Many triads switched from opium to heroin, produced from opium plants in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], refined into heroin in China and trafficked to North America and Europe, in the 1960s and 1970s. The most important triads active in the international heroin trade are the [[14K Triad|14K]] and the [[Big Circle Gang|Tai Huen Chai]]. Triads have begun smuggling chemicals from Chinese factories to North America (for the production of [[methamphetamine]]), and to Europe for the production of [[MDMA|Ecstasy]]. Triads in the United States also traffic large quantities of Ketamine\n\n===Counterfeiting===\nTriads have been engaging in counterfeiting since the 1880s. During the 1960s and 1970s, they were involved in [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting currency]] (often the Hong Kong 50-cent piece). The gangs were also involved in counterfeiting expensive books for sale on the black market. With the advent of new technology and the improvement of the average standard of living, triads produce counterfeit goods such as watches, film VCDs and DVDs and designer apparel such as clothing and handbags.<ref>M.

When Malaysia and Singapore (with the region's largest population of ethnic Chinese) became [[Crown colony|crown colonies]], secret societies and triads controlled local communities by extorting [[protection racket|protection money]] and [[Loan shark|illegal money lending]]. Many conducted blood rituals, such as drinking one another's blood, as a sign of brotherhood; others ran opium dens and brothels.\n\nRemnants of these former gangs and societies still exist. Due to government efforts in Malaysia and Singapore to reduce crime, the societies have largely faded from the public eye (particularly in Singapore).\n\nTriads were also common in Vietnamese cities with large Chinese (especially [[Cantonese]] and [[Teochew people|Teochew]]) communities. During the [[French Indochina|French colonial period]], many businesses and wealthy residents in [[Saigon]] (particularly in the [[Cholon, Ho Chi Minh City|Chinatown district]]) and [[Haiphong]] were controlled by protection-racket gangs.\n\nWith Vietnamese independence in 1945, organized crime activity was drastically reduced as [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s governments purged criminal activity in the country.

Asian organized-crime groups were ranked the fourth-greatest organized-crime problem in Canada, behind outlaw motorcycle clubs, aboriginal crime groups and Indo-Canadian crime groups.\n\nIn 2011, it was estimated that criminal gangs associated with triads controlled 90 percent of the heroin trade in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/police/CrimeMaps/|title=Crime Heat Maps - Vancouver Police Department|website=vancouver.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008202144/http://vancouver.ca/police/crimemaps/|archivedate=8 October 2017}}</ref> Due to its geographic and demographic characteristics, Vancouver is the point of entry into North America for much of the heroin produced in Southeast Asia (much of the trade controlled by international organized-crime groups associated with triads). From 2006 to 2014, Southeast, East and South Asians accounted for 21 percent of gang deaths in British Columbia (trailing only Caucasians, who made up 46.3 percent of gang deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1403433/hong-kong-triads-supply-meth-ingredients-mexican-drug-cartels|title=Hong Kong triads supply meth ingredients to Mexican drug cartels|website=scmp.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405232538/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1403433/hong-kong-triads-supply-meth-ingredients-mexican-drug-cartels|archivedate=5 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://unitedgangs.com/2013/01/01/14k-triad/|title=14K Triad|date=1 January 2013|website=unitedgangs.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628222411/https://unitedgangs.com/2013/01/01/14k-triad/|archivedate=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Legislative measures}}Legislation===\nPrimary laws addressing the triad problem are the Societies Ordinance and the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance.

In fact, while [[Interruption marketing|outbound marketing]] pushes the product through various channels, inbound marketing creates awareness, attracts new customers with channels like blogs, social media, etc.\n\n== Strategies ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Search engine optimization ===\n[[Search engine optimization]] (SEO) is the practice of utilizing search engine best practices to improve the visibility of a website or a webpage by ranking higher in the search engine results (\"SERPS\") for keywords relevant to that particular website or webpage. There are several ways to improve a website or webpage's visibility:\n\n==== Improving Crawlability ====\n\nLeading search engines use crawlers to find pages for their algorithmic search results. It is important to ensure that these search engine crawlers (AKA spiders) can successfully crawl a website or webpage in its entirety to fully determine the relevance of that website or webpage for its targeted keywords. Since some websites have millions of pages associated to them and that need to be indexed, the practice of Technical SEO will help improve a website's ability to get all of those pages indexed by a search engine and thereby improving their prospects of ranking within the search engine results pages.\n\n==== Improving Content Relevance ====\nSearch engines utilize contextual relevance or semantic search to determine the relevancy of a website or webpage for a particular set of keywords. Improving content quality from a readability and relevancy perspective will help sites increase their relevance for a set of keywords and therefore should increase their keyword rankings and visibility within the search engine results page.\n\n'''Improving Credibility'''\n\nSearch engines also determine relevancy based on internal and external links that are found across the internet. These backlinks will help associate a website or webpage with a particular set of keywords and can help improve the relevancy of this website or webpage for a particular set of keywords.\n\n=== Search engine marketing ===\n[[Search engine marketing]] (SEM) is a form of web marketing which involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages, principally through paid advertising.\nSEM is strictly connected to SEO in regards to pay promotion and get found out in the first search page.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\nThere are some methods and metrics to optimize websites:\n[[Keyword research]] and analysis which ensure the site can be indexed in the search engine, finding the more frequently typed words; \nPresence which means how many times a web page is indexed by search engines and how many backlinks does it get;\nBack end tools such as Web analytic tools and HTML validators;\nWhois tools that reveal the owners of various websites and can provide information related to copyright and trademark.\nSEM objective is to boost the visibility of a page, it can be done using the so-called \"sponsorization\". With the term, \"sponsorization\" is intended a search engine company charging fees for the inclusion of a website in their results pages.\n\n== Process ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nTo work well, inbound marketing needs a precise process that, if respected, provides a competitive advantage compared with outbound marketing.\nThe process is composed of four sequential steps: attract, convert, close, and \"delight\" in order to obtain more visitors on sites, to speed up conversions and finally increase the number of leads and prospects.\n\n===Attract===\n\nOne of the most important differences between outbound and inbound marketing is the fact that \"if classical marketing is betting on those people, inbound is betting on that person\".\nit means that companies using inbound marketing know better which are the people they are talking with. They can do it through buyer [[persona]]s.\nThe buyer personas are the identikit of our ideal customers.

Emails are the most valuable information for an inbound marketer. The inbound marketer wants to attract the right visitor, so they will exchange a tutorial video, an ebook or something valuable for the customer so he/she will be glad to give his/her e-mail in return.\n\n===Close===\nOnce the needed information is gathered, it is important to stay in contact with the prospects. How are prospects transformed into customers?\nSome helpful tools are:\n\n==== Email integrated with call-to-action ====\n\n[[Call to action (marketing)|Call-to-actions]] are very useful to let customer complete an action that we like. With this powerful tool we can generate a positive cycle that generates value both for our customer and for us.\nGenerating useful contents and sending it periodically to our prospect we can create awareness but also build trust and make our ''close-customer'' be ready to buy something.\n\n==== Customer-relationship management ====\n[[Customer-relationship management]] (CRM) systems track the various steps of customer acquisition.

Generally in big companies, they are two separated units but in inbound marketing, they are usually mixed to have complete and fully understandable information between the two areas.\nWith closed-loop reports also sales and marketing departments know which is the right time to close a deal with the customer and above all know if the customer is ready to be acquired.\n\n==== Nurturing automation ====\n\nThrough the process of nurturing, companies make the customer ready to be acquired.\n\nFor example, if the visitor fills a form to download an ebook on a certain site, the company knows that their prospect is interested in the subject treated in the ebook. After collecting this information, they are ready to \"nurture\" their future probable customer with a series of emails, videos etc. connected with the subject he/she is interested in.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Delight===\n\nAfter attracting the fan, converting him into prospect, and letting him buy something from the company, the company has to keep in touch with their customer, continuing providing good and valuable contents with the hope of doing some upselling.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Halligan, Brian and Shah, Dharmesh (2009) Inbound Marketing: Get Found Using Google, Social Media, and Blogs, John Wiley & Sons Inc.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Inbound Marketing}}\n[[Category:Promotion and marketing communications]]\n[[Category:Digital marketing]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Types of marketing]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Technique for drawing customers to products and services}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Tone|date=April 2017}}\n{{original research|date=September 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}\n}}\n'''Inbound marketing''' is a technique for drawing customers to products and services via [[content marketing]], [[social media marketing]], [[search engine optimization]] and [[brand]]ing.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patrutiu-Baltes |first1=Loredana |title=Inbound Marketing - the most important digital marketing strategy |journal=Bulletin of the Transilvania University of Brasov |date=2016 |volume=9 |issue=2 |page=61 |url=http://webbut.unitbv.ro/BU2016/Series%20V/BULETIN%20I/07_Patrutiu_Baltes.pdf |accessdate=29 October 2018 |series=Series V: Economic Sciences |publisher=Transilvania University of Brasov}}</ref>\n\nInbound marketing provides improved [[customer experience]] and tries to build trust by offering potential customers information they value via company sponsored newsletters, blogs and entries on [[social media]] platforms.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nCompared with outbound marketing, inbound reverses the relationship between company and customer.

''Fallen'' was recorded between August and December 2002 in several locations, including [[Conway Recording Studios]] in Hollywood, California. This was followed by a two-week period of mixing at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood. It is Evanescence's only album to feature guitarist [[Ben Moody]], who left the band later in 2003.\n\n''Fallen'' is the band's most commercially successful album to date, selling over 8 million copies in the United States and over 17 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums of the 21st century|best-selling albums of the 21st century]]. It debuted at number seven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 141,000 copies sold in its first week, peaking at number three in June 2003. The album topped the charts in more than ten countries, and has been certified seven-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n''Fallen'' received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. ''Fallen'' yielded four [[single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Bring Me to Life]]\", \"[[My Immortal]]\", \"[[Going Under]]\", and \"[[Everybody's Fool]]\". \"Bring Me to Life\" and \"My Immortal\" charted in over ten countries, including [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the United States.

At the [[47th Annual Grammy Awards|following year's ceremony]], the album garnered an additional nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] for \"My Immortal\". To further promote the album, Evanescence embarked on their first headlining concert tour, the ''Fallen Tour'', in 2004.

Writing songs for ''Fallen'' started near the time of the band's formation; several of the songs that would feature on the album appeared on the band's earlier releases. ''Fallen'' was recorded between August and December 2002 in several locations, including [[Conway Recording Studios]] in Hollywood, California. This was followed by a two-week period of mixing at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood. It is Evanescence's only album to feature guitarist [[Ben Moody]], who left the band later in 2003.\n\n''Fallen'' is the band's most commercially successful album to date, selling over 8 million copies in the United States and over 17 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums of the 21st century|best-selling albums of the 21st century]]. It debuted at number seven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 141,000 copies sold in its first week, peaking at number three in June 2003. The album topped the charts in more than ten countries, and has been certified seven-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n''Fallen'' received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. ''Fallen'' yielded four [[single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Bring Me to Life]]\", \"[[My Immortal]]\", \"[[Going Under]]\", and \"[[Everybody's Fool]]\". \"Bring Me to Life\" and \"My Immortal\" charted in over ten countries, including [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the United States. The album earned Evanescence five nominations at the [[46th Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]], [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]].

At the [[47th Annual Grammy Awards|following year's ceremony]], the album garnered an additional nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] for \"My Immortal\". To further promote the album, Evanescence embarked on their first headlining concert tour, the ''Fallen Tour'', in 2004. A live album from this concert was released the same year, titled ''[[Anywhere but Home]]''.\n\n==Background and recording==\nAfter Evanescence was formed by [[Amy Lee]] and [[Ben Moody]] in 1995, the band released three [[extended play|EPs]] and one [[Demo (music)|demo CD]].

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
