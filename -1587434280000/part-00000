Eventually 29 were acquitted and 23 were convicted for \"debauchery and defaming Islam\" and sentenced for up to five years in prison with hard labor.

The temper in Egypt is against homosexuality.\" A government spokesman said the Queen Boat incident was not a violation of human rights but, \"actually an interpretation of the norms of our society, the family values of our society.

Before the last attack in February, a Sinai armed group of ISIS broadcast a video message threatening the lives of Copts and claiming responsibility for bombing of a [[Cairo]] church in December 2016 that killed at least 25 people. Due to the latest attacks in Egypt, at least 150 Coptic Christian families have fled al-Arish, seeking shelter in the neighborhood of [[Ismailia]]. As the report mentioned, Majid Halim fled [[Arish|al-Arish]] to Cairo with seven of his family members after his father, who runs a stationery shop in al-Arish, had received many threats over the past two years, and his photo had been published on Facebook pages alongside a message inciting violence against Coptic Christians and demanding that they had to leave the town.  On 22 February 2017, Nabila's son in law, Sameh Mansour, was told by his neighbor that two masked men came to his home and knocked on his door while he was out making arrangements the burial of his two relatives murdered by ISIS. That same day one of his neighbors, Kamel Abu Romany, who lived 150 meters away from Mansour's house, was also killed by armed gunmen.

Eventually 29 were acquitted and 23 were convicted for \"debauchery and defaming Islam\" and sentenced for up to five years in prison with hard labor.

The term, which means \"little [[:wikt:epic|epic]],\" came into use in the nineteenth century. It refers primarily to the erudite, shorter hexameter poems of the [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic period]] and the similar works composed at Rome from the age of the [[neoteric]]s; to a lesser degree, the term includes some poems of the [[English Renaissance]], particularly those influenced by [[Ovid]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Epyllion |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/epyllion |website=www.britannica.com |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> The most famous example of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] epyllion is perhaps [[Catullus 64]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''epic'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''epicus'', which itself comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} (''epikos''), from {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}} (''epos''),<ref>{{Cite OED | epic | id=63237 }}</ref> \"word, story, poem.\"<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=epic Epic] Online Etymology Dictionary</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nOriginating before the invention of writing, primary epics were composed by bards who used complex rhetorical and metrical schemes by which they could memorize the epic as received in tradition and add to the epic in their performances. Hence aside from writers like Dante, Cam\u00f5es, and Milton, [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] in his ''[[Argonautica]]'' and Virgil in ''[[Aeneid]]'' adopted and adapted [[Homer]]'s [[Parallels between Virgil's Aeneid and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey|style and subject matter]], but used devices available only to those who write, and in their works [[Nonnus|Nonnus' ''Dionysiaca'']] and [[Tulsidas]]' ''[[Sri Ramacharit Manas]]'' also used stylistic elements typical of epics.\n\nThe oldest epic recognized is the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' ({{circa|2500\u20131300 BCE}}), which was recorded in ancient [[Sumer]] during the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]].

Early twentieth-century study of living oral epic traditions in the [[Balkans]] by [[Milman Parry]] and Albert Lord demonstrated the [[Parataxis|paratactic]] model used for composing these poems. What they demonstrated was that oral epics tend to be constructed in short episodes, each of equal status, interest and importance. This facilitates memorization, as the poet is recalling each episode in turn and using the completed episodes to recreate the entire epic as he performs it. Parry and Lord also contend that the most likely source for written texts of the epics of [[Homer]] was dictation from an oral performance.\n\n[[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature. Nearly all of Western epic (including Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' and Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'') self-consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems. Classical epic poetry employs a meter called [[dactylic hexameter]] and recounts a journey, either physical (as typified by Odysseus in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') or mental (as typified by Achilles in the ''[[Iliad]]'') or both. Epics also tend to highlight cultural norms and to define or call into question cultural values, particularly as they pertain to [[heroism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Composition and conventions===\n\nIn his work ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle defines an epic as one of the forms of poetry, contrasted with [[lyric poetry]] and with drama in the form of tragedy and comedy.<ref>''Aristotle: Poetics'', translated with an introduction and notes by M. Heath, (Penguin) London 1996</ref>\n\nIn ''A Handbook to Literature'' (1999), Harmon and Holman define an epic:\n<blockquote>Epic: a long narrative poem in elevated style presenting characters of high position in adventures forming an organic whole through their relation to a central heroic figure and through their development of episodes important to the history of a nation or race.

The tower is made up of three sections: a {{convert|30.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} tower base forming the main entrance and public circulation spaces; a {{convert|235.4|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} tower body containing 57 office floors, a [[sky lobby]] and five mechanical plant floors; and the tower top consist of six mechanical plant floors and a {{convert|102|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} tower mast.\n\nThe ground level public area along with the public sitting out area form an {{convert|8400|m\u00b2|abbr=on}} landscaped garden with fountain, trees and artificial stone paving. No commercial element is included in the podium. The first level is a public thoroughfare for three pedestrian bridges linking the Mass Transit Railway, the Convention and Exhibition Centre and the China Resource Building. By turning these space to public use, the building got 20% plot ratio more as bonus. The shape of the tower is not truly triangular but with its three corners cut off to provide better internal office spaces.\n\nCentral Plaza was designed by the Hong Kong architectural firm Ng Chun Man and Associates and engineered by [[Arup Group|Arup]]. The main contractor was a joint venture, comprising the contracting firms Sanfield (a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai) and Tat Lee, called Manloze Ltd.<ref name=\"arupjournal\"/>\n\n==Design constraints==\n\n===Triangular shaped floor plan===\nThe building was designed to be triangular in shape because it would allow 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared with a square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement provides better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of {{convert|9|to|13.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.\nNonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the air handling unit (AHU) room in the internal core to also assume a triangular configuration. With only limited space, this makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning ducting, electrical trunking and piping gathered inside the core area has to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor ceiling void.\n\n===Super high-rise building===\nAs the building is situated opposite to the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]], the only way to get more sea view for the building and not be obstructed by the neighbouring high-rise buildings is to build it tall enough. However, a tall building brings a lot of difficulties to structural and building services design, for example, excessive system static pressure for water systems, high line voltage drop and long distance of vertical transportation. All these problems can increase the capital cost of the building systems and impair the safety operation of the building.\n\n===Maximum clear ceiling height===\nAs a general practice, for achieving a clear height of {{convert|2.6|to|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a floor-to-floor height of {{convert|3.9|to|4.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} would be required. However, because of high windload in Hong Kong for such a super high-rise building, every increase in building height by a metre would increase the structural cost by more than HK$1 million (HK$304,800 per ft). Therefore, a comprehensive study was conducted and finally a floor height of {{convert|3.6|m|abbr=on}} was adopted. With this issue alone, an estimated construction cost saving for a total of 58 office floors, would be around HK$30 million. Yet at the same time, a maximum ceiling height of {{convert|2.6|m|abbr=on}} in office area could still be achieved with careful coordination and dedicated integration.\n\n===Structural constraints===\n[[Image:Sky City Church Lounge.jpg|thumb|Sky City Church lounge area in the Apex]]\n*The site is a newly reclaimed area with a maximum water table rises to about {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} below ground level. In the original brief, a 6-storey basement is required, therefore a diaphragm wall design came out.\n*The keyword to this project is time. With a briefing in a limited detail, the structural engineer needed to start work The diaphragm wall design allowed for the basement to be constructed by the top-down method. It allows the superstructure to be constructed at the same time as the basement, thereby removing time-consuming basement construction period from the critical path.\n*Wind loading is another major design criterion in Hong Kong as it is situated in an area influenced by typhoons. Not only must the structure be able to resist the loads generally and the cladding system and its fixings resist higher local loads, but the building must also perform dynamically in an acceptable manner such that predicted movements lie within acceptable standards of occupant comfort criteria. To ensure that all aspects of the building's performance in strong winds will be acceptable, a detailed wind tunnel study was carried out by Professor [[Alan Davenport]] at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory at the [[University of Western Ontario]].\n\n===Steel structure vs reinforced concrete===\nSteel structure is more commonly adopted in high-rise building. In the original scheme, an externally cross-braced framed tube was applied with primary/secondary beams carrying metal decking with reinforced concrete slab. The core was also of steelwork, designed to carry vertical load only. Later after a financial review by the developer, they decided to reduce the height of the superstructure by increasing the size of the floor plate so as to reduce the complex architectural requirements of the tower base which means a highstrength concrete solution became possible.\n\nIn the final scheme, columns at {{convert|4.6|m|abbr=on}} centres and {{convert|1.1|m|ft|adj=mid|-deep}} floor edge beams were used to replace the large steel corner columns. As climbing form and table form construction method and efficient construction management are used in this project which make this reinforced concrete structure take no longer construction time than the steel structure. And the most attractive point is that the reinforced concrete scheme can save HK$230 million compared to that of steel structure. Hence the reinforced concrete structure was adopted and Central Plaza is now one of the tallest reinforced concrete buildings in the world.\n\nIn the reinforced concrete structure scheme, the core has a similar arrangement to the steel scheme and the wind shear is taken out from the core at the lowest basement level and transferred to the perimeter diaphragm walls. In order to reduce large shear reversals in the core walls in the basement, and at the top of the tower base level, the ground floor, basement levels 1 and 2 and the 5th and 6th floors, the floor slabs and beams are separated horizontally from the core walls.\n\nAnother advantage of using reinforced concrete structure is that it is more flexible to cope with changes in structural layout, sizes and height according to the site conditions by using table form system.\n\n==Trivia==\n[[Image:Central Plaza Sky Lobby.JPG|right|thumb|The ''Sky Lobby'' on the 46th floor was visited by American TV show ''[[The Amazing Race 2]]''.]]\nThis skyscraper was visited in the seventh leg of the reality TV show ''[[The Amazing Race 2]]'', which described Central Plaza as \"the tallest building in Hong Kong\".

The tower is made up of three sections: a {{convert|30.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} tower base forming the main entrance and public circulation spaces; a {{convert|235.4|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} tower body containing 57 office floors, a [[sky lobby]] and five mechanical plant floors; and the tower top consist of six mechanical plant floors and a {{convert|102|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} tower mast.\n\nThe ground level public area along with the public sitting out area form an {{convert|8400|m\u00b2|abbr=on}} landscaped garden with fountain, trees and artificial stone paving. No commercial element is included in the podium. The first level is a public thoroughfare for three pedestrian bridges linking the Mass Transit Railway, the Convention and Exhibition Centre and the China Resource Building. By turning these space to public use, the building got 20% plot ratio more as bonus. The shape of the tower is not truly triangular but with its three corners cut off to provide better internal office spaces.\n\nCentral Plaza was designed by the Hong Kong architectural firm Ng Chun Man and Associates and engineered by [[Arup Group|Arup]]. The main contractor was a joint venture, comprising the contracting firms Sanfield (a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai) and Tat Lee, called Manloze Ltd.<ref name=\"arupjournal\"/>\n\n==Design constraints==\n\n===Triangular shaped floor plan===\nThe building was designed to be triangular in shape because it would allow 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared with a square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement provides better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of {{convert|9|to|13.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.\nNonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the air handling unit (AHU) room in the internal core to also assume a triangular configuration. With only limited space, this makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning ducting, electrical trunking and piping gathered inside the core area has to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor ceiling void.\n\n===Super high-rise building===\nAs the building is situated opposite to the [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]], the only way to get more sea view for the building and not be obstructed by the neighbouring high-rise buildings is to build it tall enough. However, a tall building brings a lot of difficulties to structural and building services design, for example, excessive system static pressure for water systems, high line voltage drop and long distance of vertical transportation. All these problems can increase the capital cost of the building systems and impair the safety operation of the building.\n\n===Maximum clear ceiling height===\nAs a general practice, for achieving a clear height of {{convert|2.6|to|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a floor-to-floor height of {{convert|3.9|to|4.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} would be required. However, because of high windload in Hong Kong for such a super high-rise building, every increase in building height by a metre would increase the structural cost by more than HK$1 million (HK$304,800 per ft). Therefore, a comprehensive study was conducted and finally a floor height of {{convert|3.6|m|abbr=on}} was adopted. With this issue alone, an estimated construction cost saving for a total of 58 office floors, would be around HK$30 million. Yet at the same time, a maximum ceiling height of {{convert|2.6|m|abbr=on}} in office area could still be achieved with careful coordination and dedicated integration.\n\n===Structural constraints===\n[[Image:Sky City Church Lounge.jpg|thumb|Sky City Church lounge area in the Apex]]\n*The site is a newly reclaimed area with a maximum water table rises to about {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} below ground level. In the original brief, a 6-storey basement is required, therefore a diaphragm wall design came out.\n*The keyword to this project is time. With a briefing in a limited detail, the structural engineer needed to start work The diaphragm wall design allowed for the basement to be constructed by the top-down method. It allows the superstructure to be constructed at the same time as the basement, thereby removing time-consuming basement construction period from the critical path.\n*Wind loading is another major design criterion in Hong Kong as it is situated in an area influenced by typhoons. Not only must the structure be able to resist the loads generally and the cladding system and its fixings resist higher local loads, but the building must also perform dynamically in an acceptable manner such that predicted movements lie within acceptable standards of occupant comfort criteria. To ensure that all aspects of the building's performance in strong winds will be acceptable, a detailed wind tunnel study was carried out by Professor [[Alan Davenport]] at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory at the [[University of Western Ontario]].\n\n===Steel structure vs reinforced concrete===\nSteel structure is more commonly adopted in high-rise building. In the original scheme, an externally cross-braced framed tube was applied with primary/secondary beams carrying metal decking with reinforced concrete slab. The core was also of steelwork, designed to carry vertical load only. Later after a financial review by the developer, they decided to reduce the height of the superstructure by increasing the size of the floor plate so as to reduce the complex architectural requirements of the tower base which means a highstrength concrete solution became possible.\n\nIn the final scheme, columns at {{convert|4.6|m|abbr=on}} centres and {{convert|1.1|m|ft|adj=mid|-deep}} floor edge beams were used to replace the large steel corner columns. As climbing form and table form construction method and efficient construction management are used in this project which make this reinforced concrete structure take no longer construction time than the steel structure. And the most attractive point is that the reinforced concrete scheme can save HK$230 million compared to that of steel structure. Hence the reinforced concrete structure was adopted and Central Plaza is now one of the tallest reinforced concrete buildings in the world.\n\nIn the reinforced concrete structure scheme, the core has a similar arrangement to the steel scheme and the wind shear is taken out from the core at the lowest basement level and transferred to the perimeter diaphragm walls. In order to reduce large shear reversals in the core walls in the basement, and at the top of the tower base level, the ground floor, basement levels 1 and 2 and the 5th and 6th floors, the floor slabs and beams are separated horizontally from the core walls.\n\nAnother advantage of using reinforced concrete structure is that it is more flexible to cope with changes in structural layout, sizes and height according to the site conditions by using table form system.\n\n==Trivia==\n[[Image:Central Plaza Sky Lobby.JPG|right|thumb|The ''Sky Lobby'' on the 46th floor was visited by American TV show ''[[The Amazing Race 2]]''.]]\nThis skyscraper was visited in the seventh leg of the reality TV show ''[[The Amazing Race 2]]'', which described Central Plaza as \"the tallest building in Hong Kong\".

This was the 126th [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] election since the office was created in 1789.

As only 430 representatives in the 435-member House cast a vote (due to vacancies, absentees, or members being present but not voting), 216 votes were necessary in order to win.\n\nImmediately after the election, the [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives]], [[Don Young]], administered the [[Oath of office#Federal Executive and Legislative Branch Oaths|oath of office]] to the new speaker.

There have only been a few instances during the past century where a person received a majority of the votes cast, and thus won the election, while failing to obtain a majority of the full membership. It happened most recently in January 2015 ([[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]]), when [[John Boehner]] was elected with 216 votes (as opposed to 218). Such a variation in the number of votes necessary to win a given election might arise due to vacancies, absentees, or members being present but not voting. If no candidate wins a majority of the \"votes cast for a person by name,\" then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected.<ref name=CRS-RL30857/> Multiple roll calls have been necessary only 14 times since 1789; and not since 1923 ([[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]]), when a closely divided House needed nine ballots to elect [[Frederick H.
