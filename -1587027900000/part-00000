The symptoms of the condition relate to the elevated calcium levels, which can cause digestive symptoms, [[Nephrolithiasis|kidney stones]], psychiatric abnormalities, and bone disease.\n\nThe diagnosis is initially made on blood tests; an elevated level of calcium together with a raised level of parathyroid hormone are typically found. To identify the source of the excessive hormone secretion, [[medical imaging]] may be performed. [[Parathyroidectomy]], the surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands, may be required to control symptoms.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThe signs and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are those of hypercalcemia.  They are classically summarized by \"stones, bones, abdominal groans, thrones and psychiatric overtones\".\n* \"Stones\" refers to [[kidney stones]], [[nephrocalcinosis]], and [[diabetes insipidus]] (polyuria and polydipsia). These can ultimately lead to [[renal failure]].\n* \"Bones\" refers to bone-related complications. The classic bone disease in hyperparathyroidism is [[osteitis fibrosa cystica]], which results in pain and sometimes pathological fractures.  Other bone diseases associated with hyperparathyroidism are [[osteoporosis]], [[osteomalacia]], and [[arthritis]].\n* \"Abdominal groans\" refers to gastrointestinal symptoms of [[constipation]], [[indigestion]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].  Hypercalcemia can lead to [[peptic ulcers]] and [[acute pancreatitis]]. The peptic ulcers can be an effect of increased [[gastric acid]] secretion by hypercalcemia.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Barreras | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Donaldson | first2 = R.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly due to solitary parathyroid adenoma. Less commonly it may be due to double parathyroid adenomas or parathyroid hyperplasia.

The criteria were revised at the Third International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism . These criteria were chosen on the basis of clinical experience and observational and clinical trial data as to which patients are more likely to have end-organ effects of primary hyperparathyroidism (nephrolithiasis, skeletal involvement), disease progression if surgery is deferred, and the most benefit from surgery. The panel emphasized the need for parathyroidectomy to be performed by surgeons who are highly experienced and skilled in the operation. The Third International Workshop guidelines concluded that surgery is indicated in asymptomatic patients who meet any one of the following conditions:\n\n* Serum calcium concentration of 1.0&nbsp;mg/dL (0.25&nbsp;mmol/L) or more above the upper limit of normal\n* Creatinine clearance that is reduced to <60 mL/min\n* Bone density at the hip, lumbar spine, or distal radius that is more than 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass (T score <-2.5) and/or previous fragility fracture\n* Age less than 50 years\n\nOperative intervention can be delayed in patients over 50 years of age who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and who have serum calcium concentrations <1.0&nbsp;mg/dL (0.2&nbsp;mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal, and in patients who are medically unfit for surgery\n\nMore recently, three [[randomized controlled trial]]s have studied the role of surgery in patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism.

The symptoms of the condition relate to the elevated calcium levels, which can cause digestive symptoms, [[Nephrolithiasis|kidney stones]], psychiatric abnormalities, and bone disease.\n\nThe diagnosis is initially made on blood tests; an elevated level of calcium together with a raised level of parathyroid hormone are typically found. To identify the source of the excessive hormone secretion, [[medical imaging]] may be performed. [[Parathyroidectomy]], the surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands, may be required to control symptoms.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThe signs and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are those of hypercalcemia.  They are classically summarized by \"stones, bones, abdominal groans, thrones and psychiatric overtones\".\n* \"Stones\" refers to [[kidney stones]], [[nephrocalcinosis]], and [[diabetes insipidus]] (polyuria and polydipsia). These can ultimately lead to [[renal failure]].\n* \"Bones\" refers to bone-related complications. The classic bone disease in hyperparathyroidism is [[osteitis fibrosa cystica]], which results in pain and sometimes pathological fractures.  Other bone diseases associated with hyperparathyroidism are [[osteoporosis]], [[osteomalacia]], and [[arthritis]].\n* \"Abdominal groans\" refers to gastrointestinal symptoms of [[constipation]], [[indigestion]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].  Hypercalcemia can lead to [[peptic ulcers]] and [[acute pancreatitis]]. The peptic ulcers can be an effect of increased [[gastric acid]] secretion by hypercalcemia.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Barreras | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Donaldson | first2 = R.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly due to solitary parathyroid adenoma. Less commonly it may be due to double parathyroid adenomas or parathyroid hyperplasia.

The criteria were revised at the Third International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism . These criteria were chosen on the basis of clinical experience and observational and clinical trial data as to which patients are more likely to have end-organ effects of primary hyperparathyroidism (nephrolithiasis, skeletal involvement), disease progression if surgery is deferred, and the most benefit from surgery. The panel emphasized the need for parathyroidectomy to be performed by surgeons who are highly experienced and skilled in the operation. The Third International Workshop guidelines concluded that surgery is indicated in asymptomatic patients who meet any one of the following conditions:\n\n* Serum calcium concentration of 1.0&nbsp;mg/dL (0.25&nbsp;mmol/L) or more above the upper limit of normal\n* Creatinine clearance that is reduced to <60 mL/min\n* Bone density at the hip, lumbar spine, or distal radius that is more than 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass (T score <-2.5) and/or previous fragility fracture\n* Age less than 50 years\n\nOperative intervention can be delayed in patients over 50 years of age who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and who have serum calcium concentrations <1.0&nbsp;mg/dL (0.2&nbsp;mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal, and in patients who are medically unfit for surgery\n\nMore recently, three [[randomized controlled trial]]s have studied the role of surgery in patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism.

[[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] seized power from the central government and aristocracy and established a [[feudal system]] based in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] in which the private military, the [[samurai]], gained some political powers while the Emperor and the [[aristocracy]] remained the ''[[de jure]]'' rulers.

Two imperial families \u2013 the senior [[Northern Court]] and the junior [[Southern Court]] \u2013 had a claim to the throne. The problem was solved with the intercession of the Kamakura shogunate, who had the two lines alternate. This lasted until 1331, when [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (of the Southern Court) tried to overthrow the shogunate to stop the alternation. As a result, Daigo was exiled. Around 1334\u20131336, [[Ashikaga Takauji]] helped Daigo regain his throne.<ref name=\"sansom\">{{cite book |title=A History of Japan, 1134\u20131615 |first=George |last=Sansom |url=http://www.gotterdammerung.org/books/reviews/h/history-of-japan-1334-1615.html |year=1961 |location=United States |publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref>\n\nThe fight against the shogunate left the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] with too many people claiming a limited supply of land.

 barset:skip\n</timeline>\n\n==Shogunate==\nThe term {{Nihongo||\u5e55\u5e9c|bakufu|extra=\"tent government\"}} originally meant the dwelling and household of a shogun, but in time, became a [[metonym]] for the system of government of a feudal [[military dictatorship]], exercised in the name of the shogun or by the shogun himself. Therefore, various ''bakufu'' held absolute power over the country (territory ruled at that time) without pause from 1192 to 1867, glossing over actual power, clan and title transfers.\n\nThe shogunate system was originally established under the Kamakura shogunate by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. Although theoretically, the state (and therefore the Emperor) held ownership of all land in Japan. The system had some [[feudal]] elements, with lesser territorial lords pledging their allegiance to greater ones. [[Samurai]] were rewarded for their loyalty with agricultural surplus, usually rice, or labor services from peasants. In contrast to European feudal knights, samurai were not landowners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Jerry|title=Traditions and Encounters|isbn=978-0-07-325230-8|pages=301\u2013302}}</ref> The hierarchy that held this system of government together was reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', samurai and their subordinates.\n\nEach shogunate was dynamic, not static. Power was constantly shifting and authority was often ambiguous. The study of the ebbs and flows in this complex history continues to occupy the attention of scholars. Each shogunate encountered competition. Sources of competition included the Emperor and the court aristocracy, the remnants of the imperial governmental systems, the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', the ''[[sh\u014den]]'' system, the great temples and shrines, the ''[[s\u014dhei]]'', the ''[[shugo]]'' and ''[[jit\u014d]]'', the ''[[jizamurai]]'' and early modern ''daimy\u014d''. Each shogunate reflected the necessity of new ways of balancing the changing requirements of central and regional authorities.<ref>Mass, J. et al., eds. (1985). ''The Bakufu in Japanese History'', p. 189.</ref>\n\n== Relationship with the emperor ==\n[[File:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|thumb|left|100px|Imperial Seal of Japan]]\n{{main|Emperor of Japan}}\n\nSince [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] turned the figure of the shogun into a permanent and hereditary position and until the [[Meiji Restoration]] there were two ruling classes in Japan: 1. the emperor or {{nihongo|''[[tenn\u014d]]''|\u5929\u7687|extra=lit. \"Heavenly Sovereign\"}},<ref name=\"Mitchelhill\">Mitchelhill & Green, 2003:59.</ref> who acted as \"chief priest\" of the official religion of the country, [[Shinto]], and 2. the shogun, head of the army who also enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority.<ref name=\"Kuno245\">Kuno, 2007:245.</ref> Although in theory the shogun was an emperor's servant, it became the true power behind the throne.<ref>Davis, 2001:205.</ref>\n\nNo shogun tried to usurp the throne, even when they had at their disposal the military power of the territory. There were two reasons primarily:<ref>Roth, 2007:103.</ref>\n\n*Theoretically the shogun received the power of the emperor, so this was his symbol of authority.\n*There was a sentimentalist tradition created by priests and religious who traced the imperial line from the \"age of the gods\" into an \"eternal line unbroken by the times.\" According to Japanese mythology, the emperor was a direct descendant of [[Amaterasu]], goddess of the [[sun]].\n\nUnable to usurp the throne, the shoguns sought throughout history to keep the emperor away from the country's political activity, relegating them from the sphere of influence. One of the few powers that the imperial house could retain was that of being able to \"control time\" through the designation of the Japanese [[Neng\u014d]] or Eras and the issuance of calendars.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:235.</ref>\n\nThis is a highlight of two historical attempts of the emperor to recover the power they enjoyed before the establishment of the shogunate. In 1219 the [[Emperor Go-Toba]] accused the H\u014dj\u014d as outlaws. Imperial troops mobilized, leading to the [[J\u014dky\u016b War]] (1219-1221), which would culminate in the third [[Battle of Uji (1221)]]. During this, the imperial troops were defeated and the emperor Go-Toba was exiled.<ref name=\"Pag41\">Turnbull, 2006a:41.</ref> With the defeat of Go-Toba, the samurai government over the country was confirmed.<ref name=\"Pag41\" /> At the beginning of the fourteenth century the [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] decided to rebel, but the H\u014dj\u014d, who were then regents, sent an army from Kamakura. The emperor fled before the troops arrived and took the imperial insignia.<ref name=\"Pag43\">Turnbull, 2006a:43.</ref> The shogun named his own emperor, giving rise to the era {{nihongo|''[[Nanbokuch\u014d]]''|\u5357\u5317\u671d|extra=lit. \"Southern and Northern Courts\"}}.\n\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s, the shogunate was severely pressured both abroad and by foreign powers. It was then that various groups angry with the shogunate for the concessions made to the various European countries found in the figure of the emperor an ally through which they could expel the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] from power. The motto of this movement was {{nihongo|''[[Sonn\u014d j\u014di]]''|\u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937|extra=\"Revere the Emperor, Eject the Barbarians\"}} and they finally succeeded in 1868, when imperial power was restored after centuries of being in the shadow of the country's political life.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:236.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nUpon Japan's surrender after World War II, American Army General [[Douglas MacArthur]] became Japan's ''de facto'' ruler during the years of occupation.

The Taira family seized control from 1160 to 1185, but was defeated by the Minamoto in the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]]. [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] seized power from the central government and aristocracy and established a [[feudal system]] based in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] in which the private military, the [[samurai]], gained some political powers while the Emperor and the [[aristocracy]] remained the ''[[de jure]]'' rulers. In 1192, Yoritomo was awarded the title of ''Sei-i Taish\u014dgun'' by [[Emperor Go-Toba]] and the political system he developed with a succession of shoguns as the head became known as a shogunate.

Two imperial families \u2013 the senior [[Northern Court]] and the junior [[Southern Court]] \u2013 had a claim to the throne. The problem was solved with the intercession of the Kamakura shogunate, who had the two lines alternate. This lasted until 1331, when [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (of the Southern Court) tried to overthrow the shogunate to stop the alternation. As a result, Daigo was exiled. Around 1334\u20131336, [[Ashikaga Takauji]] helped Daigo regain his throne.<ref name=\"sansom\">{{cite book |title=A History of Japan, 1134\u20131615 |first=George |last=Sansom |url=http://www.gotterdammerung.org/books/reviews/h/history-of-japan-1334-1615.html |year=1961 |location=United States |publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref>\n\nThe fight against the shogunate left the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] with too many people claiming a limited supply of land.

 barset:skip\n</timeline>\n\n==Shogunate==\nThe term {{Nihongo||\u5e55\u5e9c|bakufu|extra=\"tent government\"}} originally meant the dwelling and household of a shogun, but in time, became a [[metonym]] for the system of government of a feudal [[military dictatorship]], exercised in the name of the shogun or by the shogun himself. Therefore, various ''bakufu'' held absolute power over the country (territory ruled at that time) without pause from 1192 to 1867, glossing over actual power, clan and title transfers.\n\nThe shogunate system was originally established under the Kamakura shogunate by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. Although theoretically, the state (and therefore the Emperor) held ownership of all land in Japan. The system had some [[feudal]] elements, with lesser territorial lords pledging their allegiance to greater ones. [[Samurai]] were rewarded for their loyalty with agricultural surplus, usually rice, or labor services from peasants. In contrast to European feudal knights, samurai were not landowners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Jerry|title=Traditions and Encounters|isbn=978-0-07-325230-8|pages=301\u2013302}}</ref> The hierarchy that held this system of government together was reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', samurai and their subordinates.\n\nEach shogunate was dynamic, not static. Power was constantly shifting and authority was often ambiguous. The study of the ebbs and flows in this complex history continues to occupy the attention of scholars. Each shogunate encountered competition. Sources of competition included the Emperor and the court aristocracy, the remnants of the imperial governmental systems, the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', the ''[[sh\u014den]]'' system, the great temples and shrines, the ''[[s\u014dhei]]'', the ''[[shugo]]'' and ''[[jit\u014d]]'', the ''[[jizamurai]]'' and early modern ''daimy\u014d''. Each shogunate reflected the necessity of new ways of balancing the changing requirements of central and regional authorities.<ref>Mass, J. et al., eds. (1985). ''The Bakufu in Japanese History'', p. 189.</ref>\n\n== Relationship with the emperor ==\n[[File:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|thumb|left|100px|Imperial Seal of Japan]]\n{{main|Emperor of Japan}}\n\nSince [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] turned the figure of the shogun into a permanent and hereditary position and until the [[Meiji Restoration]] there were two ruling classes in Japan: 1. the emperor or {{nihongo|''[[tenn\u014d]]''|\u5929\u7687|extra=lit. \"Heavenly Sovereign\"}},<ref name=\"Mitchelhill\">Mitchelhill & Green, 2003:59.</ref> who acted as \"chief priest\" of the official religion of the country, [[Shinto]], and 2. the shogun, head of the army who also enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority.<ref name=\"Kuno245\">Kuno, 2007:245.</ref> Although in theory the shogun was an emperor's servant, it became the true power behind the throne.<ref>Davis, 2001:205.</ref>\n\nNo shogun tried to usurp the throne, even when they had at their disposal the military power of the territory. There were two reasons primarily:<ref>Roth, 2007:103.</ref>\n\n*Theoretically the shogun received the power of the emperor, so this was his symbol of authority.\n*There was a sentimentalist tradition created by priests and religious who traced the imperial line from the \"age of the gods\" into an \"eternal line unbroken by the times.\" According to Japanese mythology, the emperor was a direct descendant of [[Amaterasu]], goddess of the [[sun]].\n\nUnable to usurp the throne, the shoguns sought throughout history to keep the emperor away from the country's political activity, relegating them from the sphere of influence. One of the few powers that the imperial house could retain was that of being able to \"control time\" through the designation of the Japanese [[Neng\u014d]] or Eras and the issuance of calendars.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:235.</ref>\n\nThis is a highlight of two historical attempts of the emperor to recover the power they enjoyed before the establishment of the shogunate. In 1219 the [[Emperor Go-Toba]] accused the H\u014dj\u014d as outlaws. Imperial troops mobilized, leading to the [[J\u014dky\u016b War]] (1219-1221), which would culminate in the third [[Battle of Uji (1221)]]. During this, the imperial troops were defeated and the emperor Go-Toba was exiled.<ref name=\"Pag41\">Turnbull, 2006a:41.</ref> With the defeat of Go-Toba, the samurai government over the country was confirmed.<ref name=\"Pag41\" /> At the beginning of the fourteenth century the [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] decided to rebel, but the H\u014dj\u014d, who were then regents, sent an army from Kamakura. The emperor fled before the troops arrived and took the imperial insignia.<ref name=\"Pag43\">Turnbull, 2006a:43.</ref> The shogun named his own emperor, giving rise to the era {{nihongo|''[[Nanbokuch\u014d]]''|\u5357\u5317\u671d|extra=lit. \"Southern and Northern Courts\"}}.\n\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s, the shogunate was severely pressured both abroad and by foreign powers. It was then that various groups angry with the shogunate for the concessions made to the various European countries found in the figure of the emperor an ally through which they could expel the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] from power. The motto of this movement was {{nihongo|''[[Sonn\u014d j\u014di]]''|\u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937|extra=\"Revere the Emperor, Eject the Barbarians\"}} and they finally succeeded in 1868, when imperial power was restored after centuries of being in the shadow of the country's political life.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:236.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nUpon Japan's surrender after World War II, American Army General [[Douglas MacArthur]] became Japan's ''de facto'' ruler during the years of occupation. So great was his influence in Japan that he has been dubbed the {{Nihongo||\u5916\u4eba\u5c06\u8ecd|Gaijin Sh\u014dgun}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Valley|first1=David J.|title=Gaijin Shogun : Gen.

majority of women participated in this tradition of conformity, but often ended up facing ridicule whether or not they were successful at shrinking their waistline. The practice of tight-lacing proved to have many negative health risks, and was also extremely uncomfortable for women who partook. Women were mocked for their egotism if they were not able to shrink their waistline, and they were criticized for too small a waistline if they were successful. This instilled a feeling of defeat in women during these times, as nothing they did seemed to satisfy their male counterparts. As part of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, women also fought for their right to dress in pants.<ref name=\":0\" /> Acceptance of all body types \u2013 regardless of waist measurements \u2013 was the major theme of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, and this was the first movement of its kind.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===First wave===\nIn 1967, New York radio host [[Steve Post]] held a \"fat-in\" in Central Park.

majority of women participated in this tradition of conformity, but often ended up facing ridicule whether or not they were successful at shrinking their waistline. The practice of tight-lacing proved to have many negative health risks, and was also extremely uncomfortable for women who partook. Women were mocked for their egotism if they were not able to shrink their waistline, and they were criticized for too small a waistline if they were successful. This instilled a feeling of defeat in women during these times, as nothing they did seemed to satisfy their male counterparts. As part of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, women also fought for their right to dress in pants.<ref name=\":0\" /> Acceptance of all body types \u2013 regardless of waist measurements \u2013 was the major theme of the Victorian Dress Reform Movement, and this was the first movement of its kind.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===First wave===\nIn 1967, New York radio host [[Steve Post]] held a \"fat-in\" in Central Park.

Parveen is ill due to Jinn's magic and can be protected only if Aman marries an Ayaana; a woman with the heart of an angel. Salma pretends to be sick, forcing Roshni to marry Aman for money. Aman misunderstands Roshni to be a gold digger. He starts detesting her and gives her a cheque in exchange of marrying him. Aman and Roshni get married.\n\nRoshni feels a connection with Aman but is hurt by his indifferent behaviour. Kabir Junaid Khan makes his entry. Roshni dies while saving Aman from Kabir. Aman realises his feelings for Roshni and is left heartbroken.\n\nKabir brings back Roshni to life but keeps her under his control, aiming to separate her from Aman. Kabir's hold on Roshni gets destroyed when Aman stabs her with a magical dagger. Parveen kills Kabir to become the Queen of Jinns. She tries to kill Aman next, but fails.\n\nAliya returns with Kabir's baby and tries to separate Aman and Roshni. Aliya is revealed to be a [[Demoness|Haiwana]]. Roshni tries to expose her, but fails. Aliya attacks Parveen resulting in Parveen going in a coma. Aman, believing it's Roshni's fault, asks her to leave the house.\n\n===One year later===\nRoshni decides to open a bakery by taking a loan. Aman spends time drinking to overcome his loneliness. Aman receives news about Parveen's kidney failure. Roshni and Aman meet. Aman destroys Roshni's bakery believing her to be the reason of Parveen's condition. Roshni is devastated. Aman offers her a job for her to repay the loan. Due to Salma's worsening health, Roshni accepts the job and works as his private secretary.\n\nAs the two come closer, Aman reveals to Roshni that he tried to hate her but cannot. They consummate their relationship. In order to save Parveen, Roshni secretly donates her kidney. Kabir returns with deadlier powers.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Vikram Singh Chauhan]] as Aman Junaid Khan: Parveen and Junaid's son ;Kabir,Sara,Saima's brother ; Roshni's husband(2019\u2013present)\n*[[Aditi Sharma (actor)|Aditi Sharma]] as Roshni Aman Junaid Khan 'n\u00e9e Ahmad: Salma's adoptive daughter;

Parveen is ill due to Jinn's magic and can be protected only if Aman marries an Ayaana; a woman with the heart of an angel. Salma pretends to be sick, forcing Roshni to marry Aman for money. Aman misunderstands Roshni to be a gold digger. He starts detesting her and gives her a cheque in exchange of marrying him. Aman and Roshni get married.\n\nRoshni feels a connection with Aman but is hurt by his indifferent behaviour. Kabir Junaid Khan makes his entry. Roshni dies while saving Aman from Kabir. Aman realises his feelings for Roshni and is left heartbroken.\n\nKabir brings back Roshni to life but keeps her under his control, aiming to separate her from Aman. Kabir's hold on Roshni gets destroyed when Aman stabs her with a magical dagger. Parveen kills Kabir to become the Queen of Jinns. She tries to kill Aman next, but fails.\n\nAliya returns with Kabir's baby and tries to separate Aman and Roshni. Aliya is revealed to be a [[Demoness|Haiwana]]. Roshni tries to expose her, but fails. Aliya attacks Parveen resulting in Parveen going in a coma. Aman, believing it's Roshni's fault, asks her to leave the house.\n\n===One year later===\nRoshni decides to open a bakery by taking a loan. Aman spends time drinking to overcome his loneliness. Aman receives news about Parveen's kidney failure. Roshni and Aman meet. Aman destroys Roshni's bakery believing her to be the reason of Parveen's condition. Roshni is devastated. Aman offers her a job for her to repay the loan. Due to Salma's worsening health, Roshni accepts the job and works as his private secretary.\n\nAs the two come closer, Aman reveals to Roshni that he tried to hate her but cannot. They consummate their relationship. In order to save Parveen, Roshni secretly donates her kidney. Kabir returns with deadlier powers.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Vikram Singh Chauhan]] as Aman Khan: Parveen and (2019\u2013present)\n*[[Aditi Sharma (actor)|Aditi Sharma]] as Roshni Aman Junaid Khan 'n\u00e9e Ahmad: Salma's adoptive daughter;

Gitai was wounded when the helicopter he was in was hit by a Syrian missile. During his missions, he used a Super 8 camera and after the war, he embarked on a career as a filmmaker and made his first documentary in 1980, House.\n\n==Film career==\n\n===Trilogies===\n[[File:Amos Gitai Jeanne Moreau.jpg|thumb|Amos Gitai and [[Jeanne Moreau]] at the ''One day you'll understand'' shooting, (2008)]]\nGitai began his career directing mostly documentaries.

The film follows a house in West Jerusalem, abandoned during the 1948 war by its Palestinian owner.

He achieves one of the most beautiful things a camera can register 'live', as it were; people who look at the same thing but see different things - and who are moved by that vision. In this crumbling shell of a house, real hallucinations begin to take shape. The film's central idea is simple and the film has simply the force of that idea, no more, no less.\" (Serge Daney, Lib\u00e9ration, 1 March 1982)\n\nWadi (''Wadi'' 1981, ''Wadi Ten Years After'' 1991, ''Wadi Grand Canyon'' 2001), similar to House is dealing with a specific location and examines the complex relationships between the residents of the former stone quarry: Eastern European immigrants, survivors of the camps and Arabs who have also been expelled from their homes. Gitai turns the valley into a symbol of a possible coexistence.<ref>http://www.amosgitai.com/html/film.asp?docid=39&lang=1</ref>\n \nIn 1982 he directed \"Field Diary\" (1982).

Events are re-enacted in a sequence of ritual tableaux shot in the ruins of Wadi Salib, the old Arab neighbourhood of Haifa that the Palestinians abandoned after the 1948 war. The sense of ancient unsettled scores that have simmered for centuries is almost palpable in this beautiful but ravaged territory. In the most striking shots, the actors seem to blend into the architecture like the figures in Persian miniatures. These shots are pointedly contrasted with others photographed in the same vicinity, which make it look like a squalid contemporary junkyard.

Each film is dedicated to a different city in Israel: \"Devarim\" takes place in Tel Aviv, and is after the novel by Yaakov Shabtai, Past Continuous. The film depicts the spiritual disarray of three men in their thirties and forties, in the agitation and turmoil of Tel Aviv, the city created by Jewish pioneers in 1909. None of them has the life he had imagined. \"Yom Yom\" draws upon Haifa's tradition of peaceful coexistence between Arab and Jewish neighbours to tell a dark comic tale of characters driven by divided loyalties and neurotic inhibitions. Leslie Camhi wrote \"Gita\u00ef\u2019s genius is to show the conflict infiltrating every encounter, from the marketplace to the bedroom and beyond; the vivid portraits of Israeli social types, whether arrogant reservists or hapless nebbishes, stand in sharp contrast to images promoted in the media.\" (Leslie Camhi, Village Voice, 20 February 2001). \n''[[Kadosh]]'' is set in [[Mea Shearim]], the ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of Jerusalem and tells the story of Me\u00efr and Rivka, that have been married for ten years but have to divorce because they have no children.

Among them are the demands of ultra-orthodox religion, which confines as it sustains, and the suffering of men and women whose religion comes before love, but whose culture lacks a vocabulary for expressing personal pain. Yet Kadosh is also foreign in the extreme, an austere and shocking portrait of daily life in Mea Shearim, the Hasidic Jewish quarter of Jerusalem. ( ... ) Kadosh is a horror story, or rather two horror stories intertwined, about women tyrannised by men in the name of religious belief.\"\n(The Wall Street Journal, 17 March 2000)\n\"Kadosh\" was entered into the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/kadosh Kadosh in 1999 Cannes Film Festival]</ref>\n\nAnother fiction trilogy deals with important historical events in Israel: ''[[Kippur]]'', 2000; ''[[Eden (2001 film)|Eden]]'', 2001; ''[[Kedma (film)|Kedma]]'', 2002.\n''Kippur''  (2000) was Israel's first large-scale cinematic depiction of the considerably difficult and traumatic [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973.

[\u2026] The principle for filming warfare in Kippur is simple, limpid. Favouring real time spaces, [\u2026] making the camera an extra person walking with the soldiers, running behind the others to get on the helicopter before it takes off.

His killer apprehended at the scene turned out to be a 25-year-old Jewish observant. Investigation into this brutal murder reveals a dark and frightening world that made this tragic deed possible. A subculture of hate fueled by hysterical rhetoric, paranoia and political intrigue. The extremist rabbis who condemned Rabin by invoking an obscure Talmudic ruling. The prominent right wing politicians who joined in a campaign of incitement against Rabin. The militant Israeli settlers for whom peace meant betrayal. \nAnd the security agents who saw what was coming and failed to prevent it. The film sheds light on an ever-growing crisis of hate in Israeli society today. \nGitai combines staged re-enactments with actual news footage of the shooting and its aftermath to create a thought-provoking political thriller.<ref>https://charlierose.com/videos/23077.htm{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n\"A few years ago we decided to make this project on the assassination of Rabin as a kind of a gesture about memory and even in the hope that sometimes when you resurrect memory, it can create movements. But we have to be modest about it: art is not the most efficient way to change reality. Politics or machine guns have a much more direct effect. But sometimes art has some delayed effect, because it conserves memory when big powers want to erase it, because they call for obedience, they don't want to be disturbed, they don't want dissent. But if artists are loyal to their inner truth, they produce works which voyage in time, which don't always have immediate effects, sometimes they have delayed effects. I hope that this is something that we do with this multi-format presentation, with a film installation, a performance, and research materials about and around the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin\" (Amos Gitai).\n\nIn 2017, Amos Gitai returns to the occupied territories for the first time since his 1982 documentary \"Field Diary\". \"WEST OF THE JORDAN RIVER\" describes the efforts of Israelis and Palestinians citizens, who try to overcome the consequences of the occupation. Gitai's documentary shows the human ties woven by the military, human rights activists, journalists, mourning mothers and even Jewish settlers. Faced with the failure of politics to solve the occupation, these men and women rise and act in the name of their civic consciousness. This human energy is a proposal for long overdue change. The film was premiered in Cannes International Film Festival 2017 \u2013 Directors' Fortnight.\n\n2018 is a year of intense activity for Amos Gitai, who presents at [[the Venice Film Festival]] \"A TRAMWAY IN JERUSALEM\", a light-hearted and dramatic fare on a tramway that connects several of Jerusalem's neighborhoods from East to West, bringing together a mosaic of people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds. \"The film describes an ironic, almost utopian situation in which most of the conflicts are contained and this beautiful city of Jerusalem charged with thousands of years of history facilitates people\u2019s way of living side by side.\" (Amos Gitai) \nCast: [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Pippo Delbono]], [[Yael Abecassis]], [[Hanna Laszlo]], among 36 Israeli, Palestinian and European actors and actresses.\n\nThe film is preceded by Amos Gitai's \"[[A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN GAZA]]\" (2018, 34 mins, in Hebrew & Arabic). The film responds to the current crisis between Israel and Gaza. 2 Palestinians and 2 Israelis read texts inspired by [[Mahmoud Darwish]], [[Yizhar Smilansky]], [[Emile Habibi]] and [[Amira Hass]], as an homage to a famous letter written by [[Albert Camus]] in 1943, which gives its title to the film.\n\n===Novel adaptations===\nGitai created several novel adaptations. ''One day you'll understand'' (\"Plus tard tu comprendras\", 2008) is based on an autobiographical book by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]], president of the Arte television channel and one of the leading figures of French culture, and tells the story of a French writer tracing the story of his Jewish mother ([[Jeanne Moreau]]) and her family during World War II.<ref>[[:fr:J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n<ref>A.

''[[Tsili]]'' (2014) is inspired by the novel by [[Aharon Appelfeld]], and tells the story of the wandering of its heroine submerged in the nightmare of the war. Tsili, a young Jewish woman, gathers all the forces of intuition and vitality to survive in this desperate universe. \nstarring [[Sarah Adler]], Meshi Olinski, and [[Lea Koenig]].\n<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/e-nina-rothe/best-of-venice-with-tsili_b_5815176.html</ref>\n\"I was inspired by what Aharon Appelfeld told Philip Roth :The reality of the Holocaust surpassed any imagination. If I remained true to the facts, no one would believe me. But the moment I chose a girl, a little older than I was at that time, I removed ''the story of my life'' from the mighty grip of memory and gave it over to the creative laboratory. There memory is not the only proprietor. There one needs a causal explanation, a thread to tie things together. The exceptional is permissible only if it is part of an overall structure and contributes to its understanding. \nWhen I wrote ''Tsili'' I was interested in the possibilities of naiveness in art. Can there be a naive modern art? It seemed to me that without the naivete still found among children and old people and, to some extent, in ourselves, the work of art would be flawed. I tried to correct that flaw.\" (Amos Gitai)\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller\".jpg|thumb|Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller]] -->\n\n===Exhibitions, publications and performances===\nGitai\u2019s work include film installations, stage work and books publications. Various publications and exhibitions took place, devoted to his parents Munio and Efratia: Traces at the Palais de Tokyo (Paris), the [[Bauhaus]] (Dessau, Germany), the art museum of the Ein Harod kibbutz (Israel), and Kib- butz Kfar Masaryk Dining Hall at the MoMA (New York, 2013). Retrospective and installation at the Museo nazionale del cinema in Turin.\nIn 2010 Gitai presents at The Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Europe \"The War of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness\", a work staged in the Boulbon quarry, at the Avignon Festival (July 2009). He publishes as well the letters of his mother Efratia (Efratia Gitai: Correspondence 1929\u20131994, Gallimard), which are read by Jeanne Moreau at the Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Europe and on France Culture.

In Yitzhak Rabin : chronique d\u2019un assassinat, Gitai uses the memories of Leah Rabin, the Prime Minister's widow, as a springboard. Four voices (two actresses, Hiam Abbass and Sarah Adler, and two musicians, Edna Stern (piano) and [[Sonia Wieder-Atherton]] (cello) create a recitative, \u201chalfway between lament and lullaby,\u201d to travel back through History and explore the incredible violence with which the nationalist forces fought the peace project, tearing Israel apart. Four voices caught \u201clike in an echo chamber,\u201d between image-documents and excerpts from classic and contemporary literature.\n\nIn July 2016, a 540-page book on Amos Gitai was published by Galerie Enrico Navarra and S\u00e9bastien Moreu. The book includes more than 250 reproductions from movies and research, but also family archives and creations by Amos Gitai and 7 conversations between Gitai and : [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]], [[Guy Amsellem]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Hou Hanru]], [[Annette Michelson]], [[Richard Ingersoll]], [[Elisabeth Lebovici]] & [[Stephan Levine]]), two poems (Mount Carmel and Lullaby to My Father) and a poetic essay on the Golem.\n<ref>[[\u00c9lisabeth Lebovici]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\nOn 8 October 2018, the [[Philharmonie de Paris]] presents \"[[Yitzhak Rabin Chronicle of an Assassination]]\" created in Avignon in 2016, with [[Barbara Hendricks]], [[Yael Abecassis]], [[Sarah Adler]], [[Gavriel Lipkind]] (cello), [[Edna Stern]] (piano).\n\n==Personal life==\nGitai was born in Haifa and divides his time today between Paris and Haifa.\n\n==Filmography==\n[[File:Golem l'esprit de l'exil - Shemesh and Schygulla - 1992.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Ophrah Shemesh]] and [[Hanna Schygulla]] in ''[[Golem, the Spirit of the Exile]]'', 1991]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''My Mother at the Seashore'' (1973)\n* ''Bayit'' (1980)\n* ''Yoman Sadeh'' (1982)\n* ''Bangkok-Bahrein'' (1983) \n* ''Ananas'' (1984)\n* ''[[Esther (1986 film)|Esther]]'' (1986)\n* ''Brand New Day''\n* ''[[Berlin-Jerusalem]]'' (1989)\n* ''{{ill|Birth of a Golem|fr|Naissance d'un Golem}}'' (1991)\n* ''[[Golem, the Spirit of the Exile]]'' (1992)\n* ''{{ill|Zihron Devarim|fr|Devarim (film)}}'' (1995)\n* ''Zirat Ha'Rezach'' (1996)\n* ''[[Metamorphosis of a Melody]]'' (1996)\n* ''War and Peace in Vesoul'' (1997)\n* ''{{ill|A House in Jerusalem|it}}'' (1998)\n* ''Orange'' (1998)\n* ''Zion, Auto-Emancipation'' (1998)\n* ''{{ill|Yom Yom|fr}}'' (1998)\n* ''[[Kadosh]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Kippur]]'' (2000)\n* ''{{ill|Eden (2001 film)|lt=Eden|fr|Eden (film, 2001)}}'' (2001)\n* ''[[Kedma (film)|Kedma]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[11'09\"01 September 11]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Alila]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Promised Land (2004 film)|Promised Land]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Free Zone (film)|Free Zone]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Disengagement (film)|Disengagement]]'' (2007)\n* ''{{ill|One day you'll understand|fr|Plus tard tu comprendras}}'' (2008)\n* ''{{ill|Carmel (film 2009)|it|lt=Carmel}}'' (2009)\n* ''The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness'' (2009)\n* ''{{lang|fr|[[Roses \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit]]}}'' (2010)\n* ''[[Lullaby to My Father]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Ana Arabia]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Words With Gods]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Tsili]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Rabin, the Last Day]]'' (2015)\n* ''West of the Jordan River'' (2017)\n* ''{{ill|A Tramway in Jerusalem|fr|Un tramway \u00e0 J\u00e9rusalem}}'' (2018)\n* ''Letter to A Friend in Gaza'' (2018)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Exhibitions, performances==\n* The Law Of The Pursuer.

He achieves one of the most beautiful things a camera can register 'live', as it were; people who look at the same thing but see different things - and who are moved by that vision. In this crumbling shell of a house, real hallucinations begin to take shape.

In the most striking shots, the actors seem to blend into the architecture like the figures in Persian miniatures.

Each film is dedicated to a different city in Israel: \"Devarim\" takes place in Tel Aviv, and is after the novel by Yaakov Shabtai, Past Continuous. The film depicts the spiritual disarray of three men in their thirties and forties, in the agitation and turmoil of Tel Aviv, the city created by Jewish pioneers in 1909. None of them has the life he had imagined. \"Yom Yom\" draws upon Haifa's tradition of peaceful coexistence between Arab and Jewish neighbours to tell a dark comic tale of characters driven by divided loyalties and neurotic inhibitions. Leslie Camhi wrote \"Gita\u00ef\u2019s genius is to show the conflict infiltrating every encounter, from the marketplace to the bedroom and beyond; the vivid portraits of Israeli social types, whether arrogant reservists or hapless nebbishes, stand in sharp contrast to images promoted in the media.\" (Leslie Camhi, Village Voice, 20 February 2001). \n''[[Kadosh]]'' is set in [[Mea Shearim]], the ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of Jerusalem and tells the story of Me\u00efr and Rivka, that have been married for ten years but have to divorce because they have no children.

Among them are the demands of ultra-orthodox religion, which confines as it sustains, and the suffering of men and women whose religion comes before love, but whose culture lacks a vocabulary for expressing personal pain. Yet Kadosh is also foreign in the extreme, an austere and shocking portrait of daily life in Mea Shearim, the Hasidic Jewish quarter of Jerusalem. ( ... ) Kadosh is a horror story, or rather two horror stories intertwined, about women tyrannised by men in the name of religious belief.\"\n(The Wall Street Journal, 17 March 2000)\n\"Kadosh\" was entered into the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/kadosh Kadosh in 1999 Cannes Film Festival]</ref>\n\nAnother fiction trilogy deals with important historical events in Israel: ''[[Kippur]]'', 2000; ''[[Eden (2001 film)|Eden]]'', 2001; ''[[Kedma (film)|Kedma]]'', 2002.\n''Kippur''  (2000) was Israel's first large-scale cinematic depiction of the considerably difficult and traumatic [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973.

His killer apprehended at the scene turned out to be a 25-year-old Jewish observant. Investigation into this brutal murder reveals a dark and frightening world that made this tragic deed possible. A subculture of hate fueled by hysterical rhetoric, paranoia and political intrigue. The extremist rabbis who condemned Rabin by invoking an obscure Talmudic ruling. The prominent right wing politicians who joined in a campaign of incitement against Rabin. The militant Israeli settlers for whom peace meant betrayal. \nAnd the security agents who saw what was coming and failed to prevent it. The film sheds light on an ever-growing crisis of hate in Israeli society today. \nGitai combines staged re-enactments with actual news footage of the shooting and its aftermath to create a thought-provoking political thriller.<ref>https://charlierose.com/videos/23077.htm{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n\"A few years ago we decided to make this project on the assassination of Rabin as a kind of a gesture about memory and even in the hope that sometimes when you resurrect memory, it can create movements. But we have to be modest about it: art is not the most efficient way to change reality. Politics or machine guns have a much more direct effect. But sometimes art has some delayed effect, because it conserves memory when big powers want to erase it, because they call for obedience, they don't want to be disturbed, they don't want dissent. But if artists are loyal to their inner truth, they produce works which voyage in time, which don't always have immediate effects, sometimes they have delayed effects. I hope that this is something that we do with this multi-format presentation, with a film installation, a performance, and research materials about and around the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin\" (Amos Gitai).\n\nIn 2017, Amos Gitai returns to the occupied territories for the first time since his 1982 documentary \"Field Diary\". \"WEST OF THE JORDAN RIVER\" describes the efforts of Israelis and Palestinians citizens, who try to overcome the consequences of the occupation. Gitai's documentary shows the human ties woven by the military, human rights activists, journalists, mourning mothers and even Jewish settlers. Faced with the failure of politics to solve the occupation, these men and women rise and act in the name of their civic consciousness. This human energy is a proposal for long overdue change. The film was premiered in Cannes International Film Festival 2017 \u2013 Directors' Fortnight.\n\n2018 is a year of intense activity for Amos Gitai, who presents at [[the Venice Film Festival]] \"A TRAMWAY IN JERUSALEM\", a light-hearted and dramatic fare on a tramway that connects several of Jerusalem's neighborhoods from East to West, bringing together a mosaic of people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds. \"The film describes an ironic, almost utopian situation in which most of the conflicts are contained and this beautiful city of Jerusalem charged with thousands of years of history facilitates people\u2019s way of living side by side.\" (Amos Gitai) \nCast: [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Pippo Delbono]], [[Yael Abecassis]], [[Hanna Laszlo]], among 36 Israeli, Palestinian and European actors and actresses.\n\nThe film is preceded by Amos Gitai's \"[[A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN GAZA]]\" (2018, 34 mins, in Hebrew & Arabic). The film responds to the current crisis between Israel and Gaza. 2 Palestinians and 2 Israelis read texts inspired by [[Mahmoud Darwish]], [[Yizhar Smilansky]], [[Emile Habibi]] and [[Amira Hass]], as an homage to a famous letter written by [[Albert Camus]] in 1943, which gives its title to the film.\n\n===Novel adaptations===\nGitai created several novel adaptations. ''One day you'll understand'' (\"Plus tard tu comprendras\", 2008) is based on an autobiographical book by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]], president of the Arte television channel and one of the leading figures of French culture, and tells the story of a French writer tracing the story of his Jewish mother ([[Jeanne Moreau]]) and her family during World War II.<ref>[[:fr:J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n<ref>A.

''[[Tsili]]'' (2014) is inspired by the novel by [[Aharon Appelfeld]], and tells the story of the wandering of its heroine submerged in the nightmare of the war. Tsili, a young Jewish woman, gathers all the forces of intuition and vitality to survive in this desperate universe. \nstarring [[Sarah Adler]], Meshi Olinski, and [[Lea Koenig]].\n<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/e-nina-rothe/best-of-venice-with-tsili_b_5815176.html</ref>\n\"I was inspired by what Aharon Appelfeld told Philip Roth :The reality of the Holocaust surpassed any imagination. If I remained true to the facts, no one would believe me. But the moment I chose a girl, a little older than I was at that time, I removed ''the story of my life'' from the mighty grip of memory and gave it over to the creative laboratory. There memory is not the only proprietor. There one needs a causal explanation, a thread to tie things together. The exceptional is permissible only if it is part of an overall structure and contributes to its understanding. \nWhen I wrote ''Tsili'' I was interested in the possibilities of naiveness in art. Can there be a naive modern art? It seemed to me that without the naivete still found among children and old people and, to some extent, in ourselves, the work of art would be flawed. I tried to correct that flaw.\" (Amos Gitai)\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller\".jpg|thumb|Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller]] -->\n\n===Exhibitions, publications and performances===\nGitai\u2019s work include film installations, stage work and books publications.
