Furthermore, Plato believed the soul to be a tripartite one, composed of the ''[[logos]]'', the ''[[thymos]]'', and the ''[[epithemitikon]]''. In order to protect the immortal soul from contamination, the perishable souls, the ''thymos'' and the ''epithemitikon'', were separated from the head by the neck. The ''thymos'', responsible for feelings such as rage, bravery, and hope, was located in the chest cavity. The ''epithemitikon'', which controlled desires and unconscious thought, was located near the umbilicus, farthest from the ''logos''. The brain, then, was the seat of all rational thought, the ''logos'', and the true location of the immortal and divine soul.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Crivellato|first=Enrico|last2=Ribatti|first2=Domenico|date=2007-01-09|title=Soul, mind, brain: Greek philosophy and the birth of neuroscience|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|volume=71|issue=4|pages=327\u2013336|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2006.09.020|pmid=17208648|issn=0361-9230}}</ref>\n\n== Aristotle ==\n{{quote|In De Spiritu Aristotle links the idea of pneuma and the soul directly together saying that \"Pneuma is connected to the soul\" that, \"it is the souls primary driving force\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aristotle, On the Life-Bearing Spirit (&lt;i&gt;De spiritu&lt;/i&gt;)|last=Bos|first=A.

Unlike Plato, Aristotle believed the soul's existence was not separate from the human body, thus the soul could not be immortal. Similarly to Plato, however, Aristotle believed the soul is composed of three parts: the vegetative, sensitive, and rational. Growth and reproduction is a result of the vegetative soul, and is found in all organisms. The sensitive soul, however, allows for sensation and movement in humans and animals. The third, the rational, is exclusive to humans, and allows for rational thought.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Reconfiguring the world : nature, God, and human understanding from the Middle Ages to early modern Europe|last=Osler, Margaret J., 1942-2010.|date=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-9655-2|location=Baltimore|oclc=476834538}}</ref> \n\nIn book II, Aristotle states that, the soul is the part of the human that allows its entire being, that one can't exist without the other and they complement each other. In book III he provides an example of his theory of the soul and makes the correlation between the physical sensations of light the ''phaos'' in the body and the corporeal imaginations ''phantasia''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/soul.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} On the Soul by Aristotle|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2018-07-23}}</ref> Aristotle imagined the soul as in part, within the human body and in part a corporeal imagination. In Aristotle's treatise ''[[On Youth, Old Age, Life and Death, and Respiration]]'', Aristotle explicitly states that while the soul has a corporeal form, there is a physical area of the soul in the human body, the heart. Aristotle states the heart is the location of the 5 sensations of the body and is directly responsible for respiration and the sustenance of life.<ref name=\"Ross 1942\">{{Cite book|title=Psychology: De anima. Parva Naturalia|last=Ross|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1942|isbn=|location=Indiana University|pages=}}</ref> The heart is of further importance as it is all animal's area of  heating the body and blood and the creation of ''pneuma'', or life force that animates the body.<ref name=\"Ross 1942\" /> To Aristotle this explains why dead things become cold, do not breath, and that their souls have left them. Because the heart is the location of the human soul and life force, it is the organ of utmost importance in Aristotelian physiology. Correspondingly, the heart is the first organ to appear during embryonic development. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Epicurus ==\n[[Epicurus]], with a view reflecting that of the Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], suggested that the human soul was corporeal and composed of small particles spread out within the entire body.

Most of the medical terminology and works are recorded in the books by Galen and therefore the reliability that Herophilus actually thought to the soul to be in the body is in question.<ref name=\"J.M.S 2018\" />\n\nAccording to the recordings of his work Herophilus thought that the location of the soul is in the brain, specifically in the [[Ventricular system|ventricles of the brain]], the 4 open cavities in the innermost parts of the brain. Herophilos describes the distinction of the soul and natures as being intertwined within the body and while are separate things, cannot exist without the other. Herophilos in his dissections discovered the differences between nerves and blood vessels.<ref name=\"J.M.S 2018\" /> Nerves carried the ''pneuma'' or soul to animate the body and the vessels being related to nature. Following the lines tracks of the nerves through the body he saw that they all converge in the brain, and by Herophilus' reasoning the ventricles of the brain.<ref name=\"J.M.S 2018\" /> Of particular importance to the location of the soul was the 4th ventricle of the brain.\n\nHerophilus observed that there existed two types of nerves, those that functioned in motor activity and those that take in sensory information. Because all nerves are a continuation of the spinal cord and the [[cerebellum]], which are located most closely to the 4th ventricle, it stood to reason that the center of movement and perception, and thus the soul, must be located in the 4th ventricle.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn his treatise, ''On Anatomy'', ''pneuma'' was inhaled by the lungs and sent to the brain ventricles via the vessels of the body where the brain would convert it into what he called \"psychic pneuma\", or the soul, and produce thought, motion and all other animations of the body. Herophilus discovered the bumpy aspect of the walls of the ventricles of the brain that he called the [[choroid plexus]] and which was thought to be the interaction of the brain with the ''pneuma'' to create the psychic pneuma and then these were sent out via the nervous system.<ref name=\"Heinrich Von 2007\" /> He further identified 8 of the cerebral nerves and tracked them to the spinal cord and throughout the body. The choroid plexus is the term still used today and are the structures that produce cerebrospinal fluid.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Plog|first=Benjamin A.|last2=Nedergaard|first2=Maiken|date=2018-01-24|title=The Glymphatic System in Central Nervous System Health and Disease: Past, Present, and Future|journal=Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease|volume=13|issue=1|pages=379\u2013394|doi=10.1146/annurev-pathol-051217-111018|pmid=29195051|pmc=5803388|issn=1553-4006}}</ref>\n\n== Galen ==\n[[Galen]] was one of the most foundational physicians in history and is known for careful and detailed [[vivisection]] and dissections of animals that was foundational to modern medicine. Galen was known for his treatises on being both a physician and a philosopher and was well versed in the works of Plato. His medical anatomy is described through the use of Plato's corporeal ideals of the soul.

In the treatise ''[[On the Sacred Disease]]'' air is described as not being located in just the lungs but in the entire body and circulating it giving life.<ref name=\"Thivel 2005\" /> According to the treatise the first location of the air is to the brain and it describes that medical conditions of the brain can be caused by a blockage of air flow there.<ref name=\"Thivel 2005\" /> Aristotle in his works refers to ''pneuma'' being directly related to the soul.\n\n== Plato ==\n{{See|Plato's theory of soul}}\nPlato, the student of [[Socrates]] and teacher to Aristotle, suggests in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timmeus]]'' that the human soul was divine in nature, and that it entered the human body after separating from a spiritual origin that it would return to upon death. Furthermore, Plato believed the soul to be a tripartite one, composed of the ''[[logos]]'', the ''[[thymos]]'', and the ''[[epithemitikon]]''. In order to protect the immortal soul from contamination, the perishable souls, the ''thymos'' and the ''epithemitikon'', were separated from the head by the neck. The ''thymos'', responsible for feelings such as rage, bravery, and hope, was located in the chest cavity. The ''epithemitikon'', which controlled desires and unconscious thought, was located near the umbilicus, farthest from the ''logos''. The brain, then, was the seat of all rational thought, the ''logos'', and the true location of the immortal and divine soul.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Crivellato|first=Enrico|last2=Ribatti|first2=Domenico|date=2007-01-09|title=Soul, mind, brain: Greek philosophy and the birth of neuroscience|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|volume=71|issue=4|pages=327\u2013336|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2006.09.020|pmid=17208648|issn=0361-9230}}</ref>\n\n== Aristotle ==\n{{quote|In De Spiritu Aristotle links the idea of pneuma and the soul directly together saying that \"Pneuma is connected to the soul\" that, \"it is the souls primary driving force\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aristotle, On the Life-Bearing Spirit (&lt;i&gt;De spiritu&lt;/i&gt;)|last=Bos|first=A.

Unlike Plato, Aristotle believed the soul\u2019s existence was not separate from the human body, thus the soul could not be immortal. Similarly to Plato, however, Aristotle believed the soul is composed of three parts: the vegetative, sensitive, and rational. Growth and reproduction is a result of the vegetative soul, and is found in all organisms. The sensitive soul, however, allows for sensation and movement in humans and animals. The third, the rational, is exclusive to humans, and allows for rational thought.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Reconfiguring the world : nature, God, and human understanding from the Middle Ages to early modern Europe|last=Osler, Margaret J., 1942-2010.|date=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-9655-2|location=Baltimore|oclc=476834538}}</ref> \n\nIn book II, Aristotle states that, the soul is the part of the human that allows its entire being, that one can't exist without the other and they complement each other. In book III he provides an example of his theory of the soul and makes the correlation between the physical sensations of light the ''phaos'' in the body and the corporeal imaginations ''phantasia''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/soul.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} On the Soul by Aristotle|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2018-07-23}}</ref> Aristotle imagined the soul as in part, within the human body and in part a corporeal imagination. In Aristotle's treatise ''[[On Youth, Old Age, Life and Death, and Respiration]]'', Aristotle explicitly states that while the soul has a corporeal form, there is a physical area of the soul in the human body, the heart. Aristotle states the heart is the location of the 5 sensations of the body and is directly responsible for respiration and the sustenance of life.<ref name=\"Ross 1942\">{{Cite book|title=Psychology: De anima. Parva Naturalia|last=Ross|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1942|isbn=|location=Indiana University|pages=}}</ref> The heart is of further importance as it is all animal's area of  heating the body and blood and the creation of ''pneuma'', or life force that animates the body.<ref name=\"Ross 1942\" /> To Aristotle this explains why dead things become cold, do not breath, and that their souls have left them. Because the heart is the location of the human soul and life force, it is the organ of utmost importance in Aristotelian physiology. Correspondingly, the heart is the first organ to appear during embryonic development. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Epicurus ==\n[[Epicurus]], with a view reflecting that of the Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], suggested that the human soul was corporeal and composed of small particles spread out within the entire body. Epicurus believed that the separation of these small particles resulted in a loss of sensation, and consequently, death.\u00a0 Like Aristotle, Epicurus was of the opinion that the soul was a result of the body, making it mortal and perishable.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Herophilus ==\n[[File:Diagram showing where the ventricles are in the brain CRUK 387.svg|thumb|Image depicting the third and fourth ventricle.

Most of the medical terminology and works are recorded in the books by Galen and therefore the reliability that Herophilus actually thought to the soul to be in the body is in question.<ref name=\"J.M.S 2018\" />\n\nAccording to the recordings of his work Herophilus thought that the location of the soul is in the brain, specifically in the [[Ventricular system|ventricles of the brain]], the 4 open cavities in the innermost parts of the brain. Herophilos describes the distinction of the soul and natures as being intertwined within the body and while are separate things, cannot exist without the other. Herophilos in his dissections discovered the differences between nerves and blood vessels.<ref name=\"J.M.S 2018\" /> Nerves carried the ''pneuma'' or soul to animate the body and the vessels being related to nature. Following the lines tracks of the nerves through the body he saw that they all converge in the brain, and by Herophilus' reasoning the ventricles of the brain.<ref name=\"J.M.S 2018\" /> Of particular importance to the location of the soul was the 4th ventricle of the brain.\n\nHerophilus observed that there existed two types of nerves, those that functioned in motor activity and those that take in sensory information. Because all nerves are a continuation of the spinal cord and the [[cerebellum]], which are located most closely to the 4th ventricle, it stood to reason that the center of movement and perception, and thus the soul, must be located in the 4th ventricle.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn his treatise, ''On Anatomy'', ''pneuma'' was inhaled by the lungs and sent to the brain ventricles via the vessels of the body where the brain would convert it into what he called \"psychic pneuma\", or the soul, and produce thought, motion and all other animations of the body. Herophilus discovered the bumpy aspect of the walls of the ventricles of the brain that he called the [[choroid plexus]] and which was thought to be the interaction of the brain with the ''pneuma'' to create the psychic pneuma and then these were sent out via the nervous system.<ref name=\"Heinrich Von 2007\" /> He further identified 8 of the cerebral nerves and tracked them to the spinal cord and throughout the body. The choroid plexus is the term still used today and are the structures that produce cerebrospinal fluid.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Plog|first=Benjamin A.|last2=Nedergaard|first2=Maiken|date=2018-01-24|title=The Glymphatic System in Central Nervous System Health and Disease: Past, Present, and Future|journal=Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease|volume=13|issue=1|pages=379\u2013394|doi=10.1146/annurev-pathol-051217-111018|pmid=29195051|pmc=5803388|issn=1553-4006}}</ref>\n\n== Galen ==\n[[Galen]] was one of the most foundational physicians in history and is known for careful and detailed [[vivisection]] and dissections of animals that was foundational to modern medicine. Galen was known for his treatises on being both a physician and a philosopher and was well versed in the works of Plato. His medical anatomy is described through the use of Plato's corporeal ideals of the soul.

Candidates participate in weekly {{convert|4|mi|adj=on}} timed runs in boots and pants (now changed to shorts and sneakers) and timed obstacle courses, swim distances up to two miles wearing fins in the ocean and learn small boat seamanship.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"First Phase\">{{cite web|url=https://navyseals.com/seal-training-tips/first-phase/|title=First Phase|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first two weeks of basic conditioning prepare candidates for the third week, also known as \"Hell Week.\" During Hell Week, candidates participate in five and a half days of continuous training. Each candidate sleeps at most four hours during the entire week, runs more than {{convert|200|mi}}, and does physical training for more than 20 hours per day. The remaining four weeks involve the acquisition of various methods of conducting [[hydrographic surveys]] and creating a [[nautical chart|hydrographic chart]].<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"First Phase\"/>\n\nBecause of its particularly challenging requirements, many candidates begin questioning their decision to come to BUD/S during First Phase, with a significant number deciding to Drop on Request (DOR). The tradition of DOR consists of dropping one's helmet liner next to a pole with a brass ship\u2019s bell attached to it and ringing the bell three times.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"First Phase\"/>\n\nIt has been reported{{by whom?|date=October 2019}} that all candidates receive two medical examinations within 24 hours after Hell Week.\n\n===Phase 2: Combat diving (7 weeks)===\nThe diving phase of BUD/S trains, develops and qualifies SEAL candidates as competent basic combat swimmers. During this period, physical training continues and becomes even more intensive. This second phase concentrates on dive physics, underwater skills and combat SCUBA. Candidates will learn two types of SCUBA: open circuit (compressed air) and closed circuit. Also, basic dive medicine and medical skills training is provided.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Second Phase\">{{cite web|url=https://navyseals.com/seal-training-tips/second-phase/|title=Second Phase|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nEmphasis is placed on long-distance underwater dives with the goal of training students to become basic combat divers, using swimming and diving techniques as a means of transportation from their launch point to their combat objective. This is what separates SEALs from all other US Special Operations Forces.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Second Phase\"/> By the end of Second Phase, candidates must complete timed 2-mile swim with fins in 80 minutes, the four-mile run with boots in 31 minutes, a 3.5-mile and 5.5-mile swim.\n\nSuccessful Second Phase Candidates demonstrate a high level of comfort in the water and the ability to perform in stressful and often uncomfortable environments. Candidates who are not completely comfortable in the water often struggle to succeed.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Second Phase\"/>\n\n===Phase 3: Land warfare (7 weeks)===\nThe land warfare phase teaches the class basic weapons, demolitions, land navigation, patrolling, rappelling, marksmanship, infantry tactics, and small-unit tactics. During the third phase, the class is taught to gather and process information that will complete the overall mission. There is more classroom work that teaches map, compass, land navigation and basic weapon skill sets. These skill-sets allow the class to transition from having novice skills to becoming more comfortable out in the field. Most of this training is new to the class, and the learning pace becomes faster and faster.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Third Phase\">{{cite web|url=https://navyseals.com/seal-training-tips/third-phase/|title=Third Phase|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor the final five weeks of training, the class goes offshore, about {{convert|60|mi}} from Coronado to San Clemente Island. On the island, the class practices the skills they learned in the third phase. The days become longer and more work-intensive, set to mirror the work hours spent in the field.<ref name=\" Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Third Phase\"/> Many students view this as one of the hardest parts of training, as training is conducted seven days a week, with very minimal sleep, all while handling live explosives and ammunition. Interaction with instructors is also never-ending, and punishments are at their harshest levels yet. By the end of the Third Phase, candidates must complete a timed 2-mile ocean swim with fins in 75 minutes, 4-mile timed run with boots in 30 minutes and complete a {{convert|14|mi|adj=on}} run.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=BUD/S Training\n|width=180\n|height=180\n|lines=5\n|File: US Navy 030415-N-3953L-039 During a Hell Week surf drill evolution, a Navy SEAL instructor assists students from Basic Underwater Demolition-SEAL (BUD-S) class 245 with learning the importance of listening.jpg|'''First Phase''' A Navy SEAL Instructor in Class 245 provides a lesson to his trainees on listening to instruction.\n|File: Endurance training -- August 2004.jpg|'''First Phase''' Trainees endure surf torture.

New operators will join their Platoon wherever they are in their deployment cycle. The normal workup or pre-deployment workup is a 12- to 18-month cycle divided into three phases.\n\n===Individual Specialty Training===\nPhase one of a work-up is Individual Specialty Training. Individual Specialty Training is 6 months long where individual operators attend a number of formal or informal schools and courses. These schools lead to required qualifications and designations that collectively allow the platoon to perform as an operational combat team. Depending on the team's and platoon's needs, operators can expect to acquire some of the following skills (Items in parentheses are Joint SOF Unit Course equivalent):<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navyseals.com/platoon-training |title=Platoon Training , NavySEALs.com \u2013 Experience the SEAL Edge |publisher=NavySEALs.com |accessdate=19 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613180222/http://www.navyseals.com/platoon-training |archive-date=13 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.specialoperations.com/Navy/SEALs/Platoon.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714112807/http://www.specialoperations.com/Navy/SEALs/Platoon.htm |archive-date=14 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n*SEAL Sniper Course | USMC Scout Sniper Course\n*Advanced Close Quarter Combat/Breacher (Barrier Penetration/Methods of Entry)\n*Surreptitious Entry (Mechanical and Electronic Bypass)\n*(18D) Special Operations Combat Medic Course\n*NSWCFC (Naval Special Warfare Combat Fighting Course)\n*Advanced Special Operations (MSO)\n*Technical Surveillance Operations\n*Advanced Driving Skills (Defensive, Rally, Protective Security)\n*Climbing/Rope Skills\n*Advanced Air Operations: [[Jumpmaster]] or [[Parachute Rigger]]\n*Diving Supervisor or Diving Maintenance-Repair\n*Range Safety Officer\n*Advanced Demolition\n*High Threat Protective Security (PSD) \u2013 (US/Foreign Heads of State or High Value Persons of Interest)\n*Instructor School and Master Training Specialist\n*Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Operator\n*[[Defense Language Institute|Language School]]\n*Joint SOF and Service Professional Military Education (JPME)\n\n===Unit Level Training===\nPhase two of a work-up is called Unit Level Training (ULT). ULT is a 6-month block run by the respective group (NSWG1/NSWG2) training detachment, where the TRP/PLT's train in their core mission area skills: Small unit tactics, land warfare, close quarters combat, urban warfare, hostile maritime interdiction (VBSS/GOPLATS), combat swimming, long range target interdiction, rotary and fixed wing air operations and special reconnaissance.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/>\n\n===Task Group Level Training===\nPhase three of a work-up is Task Group Level Training. Task Group Level Training is the last 6-month block wherein a troop conducts advanced training with the supporting attachments/enablers of a SEAL Squadron: Special Boat Teams (SWCC), Intelligence(SI/HI/ETC)Teams, Cryptological Support Teams, Communications (MCT/JCSE) Medical Teams, EOD, Interpreters/Linguist, etc. A final Certification Exercise (CERTEX) is conducted with the entire SEAL Squadron (SQDN) to synchronize Troop (TRP) operations under the Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) umbrella. Following CERTEX, a SEAL Team becomes a SEAL Squadron and is certified for deployment.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/>\n\nOnce certified, a SEAL Team/Squadron will deploy to a Joint Special Operations Task Force or Area of Responsibility to become a Special Operations Task Force (SOTF), combine with a Joint Task Force (JTF) or Task Force (TF) in support of other National Objectives. Once assigned, the Troops will be given an Area of Operations (AOR) where they will either work as a centralized/intact Troop or task organize into decentralized elements (PLT-20/SQD-10/TM-5) to conduct operations. NSW Troops have ranged in size from 60 personnel to over 200 and can consist of SEAL's and any [[United States Special Operations Command|USSOCOM]] operational element and enablers. A SEAL Team/Squadron deployment currently is approximately 6 months, keeping the entire cycle at 12 to 24 months.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=SEAL Troop (TRP) Training\n|width=180\n|height=180\n|lines=5\n|File:US Navy SEALs conducting VBSS exercise.jpg|US Navy SEALs demonstrate [[VBSS]] techniques for the 2004 Joint Civilian Orientation Conference.\n|File:US Navy SEALs hoisted into AF CV-22.jpg|SEALs being hoisted into a [[V-22 Osprey|CV-22 Osprey]] from the [[United States Air Force|Air Force's]] [[8th Special Operations Squadron]] during a joint training exercise.\n|File:SEALS wearing diving gear.JPG|Two SEALs in diving gear scout a beach during an exercise.\n|File:US Navy 030822-N-3642E-001 U.S. Navy SEALs (Sea, Air, Land) receive tactical mobility training.jpg|Tactical mobility training\n|File:US Navy 101104-N-4044H-133 Navy SEALs conduct close quarters combat training in a simulated home at U.S. Training Center Moyock.jpg|Close quarters combat training\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Naval Special Warfare Advanced Training Command}}\n*[[SEAL Team Six#Recruitment, selection and training|SEAL Team Six \u00a7 Recruitment, selection and training]]\n*{{annotated link|Naval Special Warfare Center}}\n*{{annotated link|Underwater Demolition Team}}\n*{{annotated link|United States Navy SEALs}}\n*{{annotated link|United States Navy SEALs in popular culture}}\n===In other countries===\n*[[Commandos Marine#Recruitment and training|Commandos Marine \u00a7 Recruitment and training]]\n*[[Special Boat Service#Recruitment, selection and training|Special Boat Service \u00a7 Recruitment, selection and training]]\n*[[Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte Marine#Conditions for entry|Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte Marine \u00a7 Conditions for entry]]\n*[[MARCOS#Selection and Training]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web|title = Navy Fact File: Navy SEALs|publisher=San Diego: Naval Special Warfare Command \u2013 Public Affairs Office, United States Navy|date=3 March 2005 |url=http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/factfile/personnel/seals/seals.html  |accessdate=25 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050303001021/http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/factfile/personnel/seals/seals.html |archivedate = 3 March 2005}}\n* McCoy, Shane T.

Here, aspiring SEALs are given a crash course in the physical standards required to even attempt to become a SEAL.\n\nIt starts with the initial Physical Screening Test and ends with a more demanding Physical Screening Test, one that includes a timed four-mile run and a timed 1,000-meter swim. The goal is to increase the SEAL candidates' physical readiness between the two tests so that they are ready to move on to Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) Training. Those unable to pass the final test are removed from the SEAL training pipeline and reclassified into other jobs in the Navy.<ref name=Navy.com >{{cite web | title = Navy SEAL Training and Advancement | url=http://www.navy.com/careers/special-operations/seals.html | accessdate =10 April 2013 }}</ref><ref name=sealswcc.com >{{cite web | title = NSW Prep | url=http://www.sealswcc.com/navy-seals-naval-special-warfare-prep-school.aspx#.UWYMETePYa8 | accessdate =10 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|BUD/S}}Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) Training (24 weeks)==\nBUD/S is a 24-week training challenge that develops the SEAL candidates' mental and physical stamina and leadership skills. Each BUD/S phase includes timed physical condition tests, with the time requirements becoming more demanding each week. BUD/S consists of a three-week orientation followed by three phases, covering physical conditioning (seven weeks), combat diving (seven weeks), and land warfare (seven weeks) respectively. Officer and enlisted personnel go through the same training program. It is designed to develop and test their stamina, leadership, and ability to work as a team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sealswcc.com/navy-seal-training-stages.html|title=BUD/S TRAINING STAGES|last=Center|first=Navy SEAL + SWCC Scout Team, Naval Special Warfare|website=SEALSWCC.COM|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===Indoctrination (INDOC) (3 weeks)===\nBUD/S INDOC is a three-week course that introduces candidates to Coronado, the Naval Special Warfare Center and the BUD/S lifestyle. During INDOC, Navy SEAL instructors introduce candidates to BUD/S physical training, the obstacle course and other unique training aspects. This part of training is designed to prepare candidates for day one of the first phase.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref>{{cite web | title = Basic Orientation | url=http://www.sealswcc.com/navy-seals-orientation.aspx | accessdate =10 April 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://navyseals.com/buds/|title=BUD/S {{!}} Navy SEALs|work=Navy SEALs|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Phase 1: Physical conditioning (7 weeks)===\nThe first phase of BUD/S assesses [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] candidates in physical conditioning, water competency, teamwork and mental tenacity. Trainees must be able to swim with 50 pound weights.\n\nPhysical conditioning utilizes running, swimming and calisthenics and grows harder and harder as the weeks progress. Candidates participate in weekly {{convert|4|mi|adj=on}} timed runs in boots and pants (now changed to shorts and sneakers) and timed obstacle courses, swim distances up to two miles wearing fins in the ocean and learn small boat seamanship.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"First Phase\">{{cite web|url=https://navyseals.com/seal-training-tips/first-phase/|title=First Phase|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first two weeks of basic conditioning prepare candidates for the third week, also known as \"Hell Week.\" During Hell Week, candidates participate in five and a half days of continuous training. Each candidate sleeps at most four hours during the entire week, runs more than {{convert|200|mi}}, and does physical training for more than 20 hours per day. The remaining four weeks involve the acquisition of various methods of conducting [[hydrographic surveys]] and creating a [[nautical chart|hydrographic chart]].<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"First Phase\"/>\n\nBecause of its particularly challenging requirements, many candidates begin questioning their decision to come to BUD/S during First Phase, with a significant number deciding to Drop on Request (DOR). The tradition of DOR consists of dropping one's helmet liner next to a pole with a brass ship\u2019s bell attached to it and ringing the bell three times.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"First Phase\"/>\n\nIt has been reported{{by whom?|date=October 2019}} that all candidates receive two medical examinations within 24 hours after Hell Week.\n\n===Phase 2: Combat diving (7 weeks)===\nThe diving phase of BUD/S trains, develops and qualifies SEAL candidates as competent basic combat swimmers. During this period, physical training continues and becomes even more intensive. This second phase concentrates on dive physics, underwater skills and combat SCUBA. Candidates will learn two types of SCUBA: open circuit (compressed air) and closed circuit. Also, basic dive medicine and medical skills training is provided.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Second Phase\">{{cite web|url=https://navyseals.com/seal-training-tips/second-phase/|title=Second Phase|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nEmphasis is placed on long-distance underwater dives with the goal of training students to become basic combat divers, using swimming and diving techniques as a means of transportation from their launch point to their combat objective. This is what separates SEALs from all other US Special Operations Forces.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Second Phase\"/> By the end of Second Phase, candidates must complete timed 2-mile swim with fins in 80 minutes, the four-mile run with boots in 31 minutes, a 3.5-mile and 5.5-mile swim.\n\nSuccessful Second Phase Candidates demonstrate a high level of comfort in the water and the ability to perform in stressful and often uncomfortable environments. Candidates who are not completely comfortable in the water often struggle to succeed.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Second Phase\"/>\n\n===Phase 3: Land warfare (7 weeks)===\nThe land warfare phase teaches the class basic weapons, demolitions, land navigation, patrolling, rappelling, marksmanship, infantry tactics, and small-unit tactics. During the third phase, the class is taught to gather and process information that will complete the overall mission. There is more classroom work that teaches map, compass, land navigation and basic weapon skill sets. These skill-sets allow the class to transition from having novice skills to becoming more comfortable out in the field. Most of this training is new to the class, and the learning pace becomes faster and faster.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Third Phase\">{{cite web|url=https://navyseals.com/seal-training-tips/third-phase/|title=Third Phase|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor the final five weeks of training, the class goes offshore, about {{convert|60|mi}} from Coronado to San Clemente Island. On the island, the class practices the skills they learned in the third phase. The days become longer and more work-intensive, set to mirror the work hours spent in the field.<ref name=\" Navy.com\"/><ref name=\"Third Phase\"/> Many students view this as one of the hardest parts of training, as training is conducted seven days a week, with very minimal sleep, all while handling live explosives and ammunition. Interaction with instructors is also never-ending, and punishments are at their harshest levels yet. By the end of the Third Phase, candidates must complete a timed 2-mile ocean swim with fins in 75 minutes, 4-mile timed run with boots in 30 minutes and complete a {{convert|14|mi|adj=on}} run.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=BUD/S Training\n|width=180\n|height=180\n|lines=5\n|File: US Navy 030415-N-3953L-039 During a Hell Week surf drill evolution, a Navy SEAL instructor assists students from Basic Underwater Demolition-SEAL (BUD-S) class 245 with learning the importance of listening.jpg|'''First Phase''' A Navy SEAL Instructor in Class 245 provides a lesson to his trainees on listening to instruction.\n|File: Endurance training -- August 2004.jpg|'''First Phase''' Trainees endure surf torture.

New operators will join their Platoon wherever they are in their deployment cycle. The normal workup or pre-deployment workup is a 12- to 18-month cycle divided into three phases.\n\n===Individual Specialty Training===\nPhase one of a work-up is Individual Specialty Training. Individual Specialty Training is 6 months long where individual operators attend a number of formal or informal schools and courses. These schools lead to required qualifications and designations that collectively allow the platoon to perform as an operational combat team. Depending on the team's and platoon's needs, operators can expect to acquire some of the following skills (Items in parentheses are Joint SOF Unit Course equivalent):<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navyseals.com/platoon-training |title=Platoon Training , NavySEALs.com \u2013 Experience the SEAL Edge |publisher=NavySEALs.com |accessdate=19 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613180222/http://www.navyseals.com/platoon-training |archive-date=13 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.specialoperations.com/Navy/SEALs/Platoon.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714112807/http://www.specialoperations.com/Navy/SEALs/Platoon.htm |archive-date=14 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n*SEAL Sniper Course | USMC Scout Sniper Course\n*Advanced Close Quarter Combat/Breacher (Barrier Penetration/Methods of Entry)\n*Surreptitious Entry (Mechanical and Electronic Bypass)\n*(18D) Special Operations Combat Medic Course\n*NSWCFC (Naval Special Warfare Combat Fighting Course)\n*Advanced Special Operations (MSO)\n*Technical Surveillance Operations\n*Advanced Driving Skills (Defensive, Rally, Protective Security)\n*Climbing/Rope Skills\n*Advanced Air Operations: [[Jumpmaster]] or [[Parachute Rigger]]\n*Diving Supervisor or Diving Maintenance-Repair\n*Range Safety Officer\n*Advanced Demolition\n*High Threat Protective Security (PSD) \u2013 (US/Foreign Heads of State or High Value Persons of Interest)\n*Instructor School and Master Training Specialist\n*Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Operator\n*[[Defense Language Institute|Language School]]\n*Joint SOF and Service Professional Military Education (JPME)\n\n===Unit Level Training===\nPhase two of a work-up is called Unit Level Training (ULT).

Following CERTEX, a SEAL Team becomes a SEAL Squadron and is certified for deployment.<ref name=\"Navy.com\"/>\n\nOnce certified, a SEAL Team/Squadron will deploy to a Joint Special Operations Task Force or Area of Responsibility to become a Special Operations Task Force (SOTF), combine with a Joint Task Force (JTF) or Task Force (TF) in support of other National Objectives. Once assigned, the Troops will be given an Area of Operations (AOR) where they will either work as a centralized/intact Troop or task organize into decentralized elements (PLT-20/SQD-10/TM-5) to conduct operations. NSW Troops have ranged in size from 60 personnel to over 200 and can consist of SEAL's and any [[United States Special Operations Command|USSOCOM]] operational element and enablers.

See [[Nebra sky disk]]]]\nTo the [[Bronze Age]] people of Europe, such as the [[Celts]] (and probably considerably earlier), the Pleiades were associated with mourning and with funerals, since at that time in history, on the [[cross-quarter day]] {{Dubious|date=October 2011}} between the [[autumn equinox]] and the [[winter solstice]] (see [[Samhain]], also [[Halloween]] or [[All Souls Day]]), which was a festival devoted to the remembrance of the dead, the cluster rose in the eastern sky as the sun's light faded in the evening. It was from this [[heliacal rising|acronychal rising]] that the Pleiades became associated with tears and mourning. As a result of [[Precession (astronomy)|precession]] over the centuries, the Pleiades no longer marked the festival, but the association has nevertheless persisted, and may account for the significance of the Pleiades astrologically.\n\n=== Baltic mythology ===\n\nIn [[Baltic languages]] the name for this constellation is '''Sietynas''' in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and '''Sieti\u0146\u0161''' in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] which is derived from ''sietas'' meaning \"[[sieve|a sieve]]\". In Lithuanian folk songs this constellation is often [[personification|personified]] as a benevolent brother who helps orphan girls to marry or walks soldiers along the fields. But in Lithuanian folk tales as well as Latvian folk songs this constellation is usually depicted as an inanimate object, a sieve which gets stolen by the devil from the thunder god or is used to conjure light rain by thunder's wife and children.<ref>http://tautosmenta.lt/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Laurinkiene_Nijole/Laurinkiene_LK_2002_5.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Ukrainian folklore ===\n\nIn [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] traditional folklore the Pleiades are known as \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0440\u0438 (Stozhary), \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0440\u0438 (Volosozhary), or \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0438-\u0417\u0432\u0456\u0437\u0434\u0438 (Baby-Zvizdy).\n\n'Stozhary' can be etymologically traced to \"\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044f\" (stozharnya) meaning a 'granary', 'storehouse for hay and crops', or can also be reduced to the root \"\u0441\u0442\u043e-\u0436\u0430\u0440\", (sto-zhar) meaning 'hundredfold glowing' or \"a hundred embers\".<ref>The Comprehensive Dictionary of the Contemporary Ukrainian Language.

According to the legend, seven maids lived long ago. They used to dance the traditional round dances and sing the glorious songs to honor the gods. After their death the gods turned them into water nymphs, and, having taken them to the Heavens, settled them upon the seven stars, where they dance their round dances (symbolic for moving the time) to this day. (see article in Ukrainian Wikipedia)\n\nIn [[Ukraine]] this asterism was considered a female talisman until recent times.\n\n=== Hungarian folklore ===\n\nThe old name of the starcluster in Hungarian is \"Fiasty\u00fak\", meaning 'a hen with chicks'. There is also a version of the story popularized by the song \"A Nap \u00e9s Sz\u00e9p h\u00e1za\" (House of Sun and Wind) of Hungarian folk metal band Dalriada speaking of a poor woman with seven sons who cursed her sons to turn into ravens after the sons wasted their only food. She failed to find them, but received a prophecy that an eighth brother could find the sons. Her eighth son thus went to look for his brothers, died and the brothers as ravens came to feast on his carcass, resulting in them dying as well and the eight of them getting a place in the sky as the Pleiades cluster. \n\n== Indigenous peoples of the Americas ==\n(Alphabetical by people)\n\nIt was common among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] to measure keenness of [[visual perception|vision]] by the number of stars the viewer could see in the Pleiades, a practice which was also used in historical [[Europe]], especially in [[Greece]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n=== Andean cultures ===\n\nIn the ancient [[Andes]], the Pleiades were associated with abundance, because they return to the [[Southern Hemisphere]] sky each year at harvest-time.

Sun Man is angered by the mistreatment of the children and punishes the people with a draught, causing the buffalo to disappear, until the dogs, the only friends of the orphans, intercede on behalf of the people. Because the buffalo are not available while the Lost Boys are in the skies, the cosmical setting of the Pleaides was an assembly signal for Blackfoot hunter to travel to their hunting grounds to conduct the large-scale hunts, culminating in slaughters at buffalo jumps, that characterized their culture.\n\n=== Cherokee ===\n\nA [[Cherokee]] myth (similar to that of the [[Onondaga people]]) indicates that seven boys who would not do their ceremonial chores and wanted only to play, ran around and around the ceremonial ball court in a circle, and rose up into the sky.

One day a monk arrived at the couple's home during his [[Dhutanga]] journey. Worried that they had no suitable food to offer him, the elderly couple contemplated cooking the mother hen. The hen overheard the conversation, and rushed back to the [[Chicken coop|coop]] to say farewell to her children. She told them to take care of themselves, and that her death would repay the kindness of the elderly couple, who had taken care of all of them for so long. As the mother hen's feathers were being burned over a fire, the chicks threw themselves into the fire in order to die along with their mother. The deity, impressed by and in remembrance of their love, immortalized the seven chickens as the stars of the Pleiades. In tellings of the story in which there were only six chicks, the mother is included, but often includes only the seven chicks.<ref>[http://www.prapayneethai.com/th/amusement/north/view.asp?id=0370 Thaiculture.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.rspg.org/fabel/doc3.htm rspg.or.th]</ref>\n\n== Oceania ==\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{further|Australian Aboriginal astronomy#Pleiades}}\nDepending on the language group or clan, there are several stories regarding the origins of the Pleiades among [[Aboriginal Australian]] peoples.

Sun Man is angered by the mistreatment of the children and punishes the people with a draught, causing the buffalo to disappear, until the dogs, the only friends of the orphans, intercede on behalf of the people. Because the buffalo are not available while the Lost Boys are in the skies, the cosmical setting of the Pleaides was an assembly signal for Blackfoot hunter to travel to their hunting grounds to conduct the large-scale hunts, culminating in slaughters at buffalo jumps, that characterized their culture.\n\n=== Cherokee ===\n\nA [[Cherokee]] myth (similar to that of the [[Onondaga people]]) indicates that seven boys who would not do their ceremonial chores and wanted only to play, ran around and around the ceremonial ball court in a circle, and rose up into the sky. Only six of the boys made it to the sky; the seventh was caught by his mother and fell to the ground with such force that he sank into the ground.

The story tells that a poor elderly couple who lived in a forest had raised a family of [[chicken]]s: a mother hen and her six (or alternately seven) chicks. One day a monk arrived at the couple's home during his [[Dhutanga]] journey. Worried that they had no suitable food to offer him, the elderly couple contemplated cooking the mother hen. The hen overheard the conversation, and rushed back to the [[Chicken coop|coop]] to say farewell to her children. She told them to take care of themselves, and that her death would repay the kindness of the elderly couple, who had taken care of all of them for so long. As the mother hen's feathers were being burned over a fire, the chicks threw themselves into the fire in order to die along with their mother. The deity, impressed by and in remembrance of their love, immortalized the seven chickens as the stars of the Pleiades. In tellings of the story in which there were only six chicks, the mother is included, but often includes only the seven chicks.<ref>[http://www.prapayneethai.com/th/amusement/north/view.asp?id=0370 Thaiculture.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.rspg.org/fabel/doc3.htm rspg.or.th]</ref>\n\n== Oceania ==\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{further|Australian Aboriginal astronomy#Pleiades}}\nDepending on the language group or clan, there are several stories regarding the origins of the Pleiades among [[Aboriginal Australian]] peoples.

The attack showed the vulnerability of Australian ports like Sydney to long-range Japanese submarine patrols and the need for heightened security. Many Sydney-siders still recall the moments at night on 31 May\u20131 June 1942 as the harbour lit up with depth charge explosions, tracer fire and criss-crossing harbour defence vessels. The explosion as a Japanese torpedo struck under the depot ferry [[Her Majesty's Australian Ship|HMAS]] [[HMAS Kuttabul (ship)|''Kuttabul'']] was intense, throwing portions of the shattered hull high into the sky and killing twenty-one men.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe attack mirrored the earlier midget submarine operations at [[Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, and the raid on [[Diego-Suarez|Diego Suarez]] in [[Madagascar]] on 30 May 1942. The Sydney raid involved five large ocean-going submarines, I-22, I-24, I-27 with their three midget submarines, and I-21 and I-29 providing support. A sixth submarine I-28 intended for the raid was sunk by the US submarine [[United States Ship|USS]] [[USS Tautog|''Tautog'']] before it could deploy with a fourth midget. The five remaining mother submarines, which had left [[Chuuk Lagoon]] in the Pacific Ocean, arranged themselves in a semi-circle centred on [[Sydney Heads]]. A previous flight on 29 May by a reconnaissance aircraft launched from I-21 spotted potential targets inside the harbour. This [[Yokosuka E14Y|Glen-type twin-float]] [[seaplane]] capsized when returning to its submarine and was scuttled. The remains of the seaplane have not been located.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nAt approximately 8pm on the Sunday evening, the first midget (number 14 from I-27) commanded by Sub Lieutenant Chuman, motored submerged into the harbour. Unfortunately for its crew, the boat became fouled inside the still incomplete anti-submarine boom net laid across the harbour between Georges Head and [[Green Point, New South Wales|Green Point]] near {{NSWcity|Watsons Bay}}. Observed by surface craft near the Western Gate, the two-man Japanese crew decided to commit suicide when escape was hopeless. They fired the forward internal scuttling charge about 10:30pm and totally destroyed the fore end of the submarine. Remains of the wreck and its crew were later recovered.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nMidget A (according to the Allied order of identification) from I-24, commanded by Sub Lieutenant Ban with Petty Officer Ashibe, next entered the harbour and followed a [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] ferry through the boom defences. The exact serial number of this submarine has not been ascertained, but it is now often referred to as M24. The submarine crossed the Indicator Loop system at about 9:48 pm. In a cat-and-mouse play, the submarine manoeuvred around the harbour and was sighted several times around 11:00 pm. Under fire from the heavy Cruiser USS [[USS Chicago|''Chicago'']] and several motor launches, the submarine successfully fired its two torpedoes about 12:30am from near [[Bradleys Head]]. Both missed ''Chicago'' \u2014 the prime target \u2014 one running onto [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island]] and failing to explode. The other struck underneath the ferry HMAS ''Kuttabul'' after passing under the Dutch submarine K-IX at its berth. The explosion sank ''Kuttabul'' and killed 21 of those aboard. Ban's midget submarine never made it back to the planned rendezvous point immediately south of [[Port Hacking]].<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe third midget, Number 21 from I-22 commandeered by Lieutenant Matsuo, crept into the harbour, was sighted near the Heads, and was depth-charged, then laid low before making a belated entry around 3:00am when ''Chicago'' was leaving port, and then variously sighted in the vicinity of Bradleys Head and the [[Taronga Zoo]]. The midget was definitely seen in Taylors Bay by 5:00 am. The boat was attacked with depth charges from HMAS [[HMAS Seamist|''Seamist'']], ''[[Steady Hour]]'' and [[HMAS Yarroma|''Yarroma'']] until 8:30 am on 1 June and crippled. When recovered with its two live torpedoes and unexploded scuttling charges, the crew were found dead, having committed suicide. The remains of Midget 14 and 21 were recovered from the harbour within a week and subjected to military interrogation.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe Type A midget submarines were approximately {{convert|24|m}} in length, carried two 18-inch torpedoes, and could remain submerged for about 12 hours. On display at the Australian War Memorial in [[Canberra]] is a composite craft made up of the remains of midget 14 and 21, while the remaining conning tower (from midget 21) is on display at the Naval Heritage Centre, Garden Island, Sydney. None of the five mother submarines survived wartime operations. I-22 and I-24 had launched their previous midget submarines during the Pearl Harbour attack of 1941.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n===M24 attack and escape===\nThe midget from I-24 (also referred to in the initial Allied reports as \"Midget A\", and colloquially as M24), commanded by Sub Lieutenant Katsuhisa Ban with Petty Officer Mamoru Ashibe, entered the harbour, crossing the indicator loop at 9:48 pm. It apparently followed a Manly ferry also through the Eastern Channel gate in the boom. The submarine ran up the harbour unobserved for an hour until at 10:52 pm when it was spotted near the Garden Island Naval Base, across from Sydney's central business district. This sighting occurred just twenty minutes after Chuman and Ohmori in Ha-14 blew themselves up in the antisubmarine nets at the other end of the harbour. Military authorities finally started to appreciate the scale of the problem.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nM24's [[conning tower]] had been sighted by one of its prime targets, the American heavy cruiser USS ''Chicago'', and soon by the Dockyard Motor Boat Nestor. Now in a position {{convert|200|yd|m|order=flip}} off Garden Island and apparently proceeding in a direction towards the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], USS ''Chicago'' opened up with its five-inch guns and oerlikons. M24 was further attacked by ''Whyalla'' with its machine guns and ''Geelong'' from Bradleys Head. Recent research by historian Peter Grose indicates that one of ''Chicago's'' crew even emptied the clip of his .45 automatic pistol at M24's conning tower.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe historical events have been well covered (e.g. Jenkins, 1992, Carruthers, 2006 and most recently by Grose, 2007), however it is still unclear why it took Ban and Ashibe another hour-and-a-half to run the {{convert|1|mi|m nmi|order=flip}} from just west of ''Chicago'' to an attack position off its eastern-pointing stern.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nEven allowing for the need to complete turns and circles, M24 had sufficient time to transit that limited distance, compared to the hour it had only taken to pass right up through the harbour. It is more surprising that Ban did not attempt to get into a more optimum firing position, immediately broadside of ''Chicago's'' hull. It now appears that Ban fired both his \"fish\" from a position astern of ''Chicago'' using the observed 60-degree deflection setting on his torpedoes \u2014 a tricky shot. This is possibly one reason why he missed. The unexplained time lapse and then apparently-hurried attack may be explained by the fact that M24's crew rested on the seabed for some period prior to attacking their target, perhaps recovering from the earlier volley of fire.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nIt is confirmed that the submarine did successfully fire its two torpedoes about 12:30 am on 1 June from a position near the centre of the harbour abreast of Bradley's Head. The target was USS ''Chicago'', still at its mooring at Man of War anchorage #2 and attempting to build steam to quit the harbour. The workers' lights on Garden Island were extinguished at about the same time Ban was taking his shots. Both missed ''Chicago'', one running onto Garden Island and failing to explode amongst a pile of rope near the Gun Wharf. The other struck the island seawall under the ferry HMAS ''Kuttabul'' and exploded, sinking the vessel. The torpedo had first passed under the Dutch submarine K-IX at its berth alongside. K-IX was later wrecked in 1945 at Submarine Beach, [[Seal Rocks, New South Wales|Seal Rocks]], and located in 1999 by the Heritage Branch via a remote magnetometer survey.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe sinking of ''Kuttabul'' killed twenty-one of those aboard, with ten others injured. Ban's midget submarine was never recovered by the mother submarines. What was later identified as an outer crossing on the harbour indicator loop at 01:58 am on 1 June has generally been regarded as M24 safely exiting Sydney Harbour. It was the only midget to successfully fire its two torpedoes and the only one of the three to escape. Again M24 took one-and-a-half hours to exit the harbour. This is compared to the hour that it took to enter and first be sighted in the vicinity of ''Chicago''. M24 may have again rested inside the harbour for approximately half an hour after its failed attack.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n===Discovery===\nIn November 2006 Sydney-based recreational [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]] from a private group, No Frills Divers, located the remains of Ban and Ashibe's missing M24 midget submarine off Sydney's [[Northern Beaches]]. The wreck was found approximately {{convert|5|km|nmi mi}} offshore from Bungan Head near [[Newport, New South Wales|Newport]] in over {{convert|50|m|spell=on}} of water. Details of the discovery were broadcast on the [[Nine Network]]'s ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' television program on 26 November 2006, and the announcement confirmed by the [[Minister for Planning (New South Wales)|Minister for Planning]], in conjunction with relevant Commonwealth government agencies on 1 December 2006.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n;Management\nA No-entry Protected Zone was declared around the fragile wreck site on 1 December 2006 by the [[Minister for the Environment (Australia)|Federal Minister for the Environment]], under the Commonwealth Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. The No Entry zone has a radius of {{convert|500|m}}, the centre of which is at the intersection of {{coord|33|40|21|S|151|22|58|E|display=inline|type:landmark_regionAU-NSW}} in Australian waters. Entry to the zone is restricted to researchers and site managers while the archaeological survey work is completed. Permits are issued by the Heritage Branch of the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage or the Federal Minister for the Environment, Canberra.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe wreck was also initially subject to an Interim Heritage Order under Section 24 of the NSW (State) Heritage Act 1977. On 7 December 2007, the M24 wreck site and a zone with a radius of {{convert|500|m|adj=on}} was protected as an item of State Heritage significance on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. Penalties of up to AUS $1.1 million apply for disturbance of the wreck and surrounding debris field.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n==Description==\nThe Japanese Imperial Navy Type A midget submarines deployed at Sydney were approximately {{convert|24|m}} in length, of {{convert|46|-|47|ST|t}}, and carried two {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on|order=flip}} torpedoes (Type 97, oxygen-driven, Kure Naval Yard). With a two-man crew, contemporary assessments suggested that they could remain submerged for about 12 hours in most operating circumstances. After this time the crew would be forced to replenish air and stamina levels. The submarines were of single-hull design using welded {{convert|8|mm}} cold-rolled steel plates (MS44 quality, 5/16th inch), with a normal diving depth of up to {{convert|100|m}} and a collapse depth of {{convert|200|m}}. Powered by a {{convert|600|hp|order=flip}} electric motor, the boats could not recharge their initial battery capacity and therefore were totally reliant on the initial charge, careful management of the power reserve, and any technical breakdown or event that might impact the battery-operated electrical circuits. The design achieved an impressive surface speed, reportedly up to {{convert|24|knot|km/h}} on the surface and {{convert|19|knot|km/h}} submerged, far greater than other midget designs of World War II.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe Sydney boats had some design modifications compared to those captured at Pearl Harbour, with a slightly wider hull at {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}}. The vessels were electrically powered by 208 lead-acid wet-cell batteries (72 forward and 136 aft), and had three main sections joined by internal flanges, bolted together. These comprised the Forward Section (containing the torpedo tubes), the Central Section (containing the Forward Battery Room, Conning Tower and Aft Battery Room), and the Aft Section (containing the motor, propeller shaft and gearing). Other improvements included an improved gyro compass, an accessway hatch on the underside to permit crew transfers at sea, and an eyepiece fitted into the side of the Conning Tower. Other fundamental additions included the fitting of an improved nose guard and propeller guard, and the distinctive net cutters at bow and atop the Conning Tower.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe type was designed in Japan during the 1930s, with two experimental boats Ha-1 and Ha-2 built as early as 1936. The building program accelerated from 1938 onwards, when some fifty Type A boats were built at Ourazaki and Kure naval yards, the majority between 1940\u20132 (number sequence Ha-3 to Ha-52). The class was known by many secret names, the most commonly-ascribed being \"Ko-Hyoteki\" or \"Target A\", with the Sydney boats being an improved version, Type A Kai 1 (improved version 1). Records of production are limited and total production numbers are variously reported, with some for example quoting 59 Type As produced. The Japanese designed several variants to the Type A midget during the war, including the important Hei Gata (Type C) and the most prolific Koryu (Type D), fitted with generators to allow battery recharge and additional crew.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nJapanese midget submarines had their own numeric designation based on production sequences (a \"Ha\" number reference is often used today). They could be deployed on any of the mother carrier submarines fitted for them and therefore their identification number was often different to the I-class submarine carrier.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n===Midget submarine dimensions===\n{| {{Table|hide|sort}}\n!

Katsuhisa Ban\n*Petty Officer Mamoru Ashibe\n\n===Condition===\nAs of 19 February 2008, the M24 was generally in reasonable condition, however the external fabric has been damaged by commercial fishing trawling operations.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe wreck lies upright on sand, just under half-buried in the sediment. It appears that the bow is slightly elevated as the lower torpedo tube is approximately a third filled at sand level. Both tubes are empty of their torpedoes, confirming the identification of the vessel as M24, the only midget to successfully fire its two torpedoes. The upper tube has been torn off the vessel back to a substantial bulkhead and lies almost totally buried in sand adjacent to the bow on the port quarter. At the stern, sand levels lie at the centreline of the propeller boss (missing). Both contra-rotating propellers are visible, although all exposed rudders, stabilisers and the protective cage around the propellers have been torn off by fishing nets. Just forward of the stern, the topside manhole that gave access to the motor room appears lost to corrosion, creating a minor cavity in the hull plating.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe internal hull aft of the control room is over half-filled with sand, as evidenced through several significant openings in the pressure hull. These openings extend around the hull immediately aft of the rear control room bulkhead and beyond the conning tower area (see below). They extend from sand level to the roof, with corrosion processes resulting in plate loss back to internal transverse frames. The openings allow water movements through this aft battery room and tend to \"self-flush\" this major compartment, keeping sand levels down. Several fittings and fixtures that adorn the aft battery room are visible through these openings.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nSignificantly, the control room compartment is partly filled with sand up to the original internal casing roof. This sand has apparently entered the space as a result of significant damage to the upper conning tower structure and the aft battery room openings, mentioned above. Externally, all plating that comprised the conning tower has been removed from the hull, including the forward access chute into the control room. This once formed part of the pressure hull, and its removal has formed an artificial opening into the main hull atop the submarine. Only the pressure [[dome]] and periscope standard of the aft portion of the conning tower survives intact, however the damage has created an opening of approximately {{convert|50|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nDrifting sand has probably entered the control room space partly through this opening, and apparently to the same depth as observed in the aft battery room. When the No Frills Divers video footage of the wreck was first examined, there was an indication that the rear bulkhead door into the control room was closed. This led to speculation that both fore and aft doors were probably closed to enable sand accumulation and retention within the control room space. However, the current surveys have suggested that the aft door to the control room is in fact open, though significantly sanded up. It is likely that the forward control room bulkhead door is closed to assist sand build up. If future examination shows this is not the case, the forward battery room and perhaps the torpedo room, must also have significant introduced sand deposits.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nInside the periscope well, the upper portion of the periscope tube is visible transiting into the control room sand deposit. The periscope does not extend externally beyond the periscope standard, suggesting that it has retracted into the periscope well built into the floor of the control room. At no point could the upper lens of the periscope be sighted within the outside opening of the periscope standard.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nAround the internal upper walls of the control room are several gauges and levers that comprise part of the operating controls of the submarine. Of particular interest are the steps built into the forward face of the periscope well that allowed crew egress and ingress, and the clearly-visible retractable two-step crew ladder hinged at the weld joint of the periscope dome and the ceiling of the pressure hull. This ladder is still in its upright or stowed position, once within the cavity of the 1.5 metre-deep access chute, now lost. This is the firmest indication that the crew of M24 are most probably still within the submarine hull. To exit the craft, Ban and Ashibe would have had to pull down this hinged ladder to climb up and out of the Control Room.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe original signature of the external conning tower plating is clearly visible on the upper surfaces of the wreck, marked by the angle iron framework where it was attached to the casing.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nSome elements of the conning tower still survive in the debris field that surrounds the wreck. Almost incredibly, the watertight hatch that once sealed the access chute lies beside the conning tower on sand to port. Once upright, the lid has been turned over by divers to reveal its underside and locking mechanism, which appears to be in the locked position. While there is no sign of the access chute itself (part of the original pressure hull), the net cutter that once adorned the forward conning tower, with its distinctive teeth, lies separated on the sand, also on the port side, slightly abaft the conning tower. Resting against the submarine hull, its wishbone attachment frame is clearly visible.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe main hull forward is mostly intact, and unlike the stern, provides no visual access into either the forward battery room or torpedo room. Apart from some abrasion to the upper hull surfaces caused by fishing nets, and perhaps some modern impact by an anchor or some other foreign object, there is no significant damage to the casing. Hence it is impossible to postulate the condition of their internal spaces, including the presence of sand or relics.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nLike the conning tower, the forward bow area has witnessed significant physical damage. As noted, the upper of two torpedo tubes has been almost half torn off the hull and now lies in the sand to port. The main bulkhead (at frame 7) is clearly exposed, while the lower tube is completely intact to the bow. Running along the forward centreline of the casing, the original hydraulic line that extended to the bow torpedo cap release has been torn off and lies across the hull to port. Most of the front end of the submarine is still concealed by entrapped fishing nets that make inspection difficult. What is clear is that the protective cage around the torpedo tubes has been stripped from the hull, including the forward net-cutting gear and serrated jump cable that ran back to the conning tower. It is possible that some of these elements might be detected with a fuller examination of the major debris field that extends out from the bow of the wreck for some one hundred meters.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe initial archaeological survey taskings have indicated that no scuttling charges have been fired by the crew, nor that there is any obvious battle damage to the hull. The M24 wreck site has retained a significant level of intactness despite being located underwater for 65 years. The hull has suffered some damage from contact with commercial fishing nets.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe date of construction is not known although one of the midgets recovered from the Sydney Harbour raid was reported to have been built in 1942.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nOn 7 February 2007, during [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JMSDF]] Admiral [[Eiji Yoshikawa (admiral)|Eiji Yoshikawa]]'s visit to Australia, Yoshikawa and RAN Vice Admiral [[Russ Shalders]] presided over a ceremony held aboard {{HMAS|Newcastle|FFG 06|6}} to honour M24's crew.<ref name=Wurth>{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Wurth |title=Fallen submariners honored in Australia |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070224f1.html |work=[[The Japan Times]] |page=3 |date=24 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716222405/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20070224f1.html%23.UASUdKgo9Rw |archive-date=16 July 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Relatives of the midget submarines' crews, one of the survivors from ''Kuttabul'', and dignitaries and military personnel from Australia and Japan attended another ceremony on 6 August 2007 at HMAS ''Kuttabul''.<ref name=McNicoll>{{cite news |first=D.

The site is the only ''in situ''-identified cultural relic of the attack on Sydney Harbour in 1942. A complacent Sydney population awoke to the realities of war due to this attack, and the event is strongly remembered today through the wider community. The M24 wreck is representative of Japanese submarine operations off Australia's eastern seaboard during the war and a direct physical reminder of the conflict at Sydney. Internationally, it represents one of only a handful of Japanese midget submarine wreck sites located in their underwater contexts. Remains of a further six are retained as museum or outdoor exhibits. The archaeological site is therefore of considerable importance in the comparative analysis of midget submarines wrecks discovered worldwide. The site also has the ability to contribute generally to studies of submarines as a specialised class of archaeological site type. Only limited archival information related to these vessels survives and therefore the archaeological record is of added importance. In regard to the three submarines that attacked Sydney Harbour, M24 is the only one retained in its original battle context and undisturbed, apart from the obvious effects of net entrapment and corrosion activity.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nM24 Japanese Midget Submarine wreck site was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 7 December 2007, having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Japanese submarine attack on Sydney Harbour was part of a series of pivotal aggressive moves by Japan during the early stages of World War II, and closely followed the attack at Pearl Harbour, Hawai'i just six months prior. The sizeable Japanese naval force of eight submarines comprised the first active attack on Sydney in its history. While the raid was militarily of limited success, it highlighted the vulnerability of important Allied naval station and repair facilities, and ships, to long-range submarine attack. The loss of 21 naval ratings aboard the depot ship HMAS ''Kuttabul'' to one of M24's torpedoes is still remembered by the navy through the annual HMAS ''Kuttabul'' Memorial Service held at Garden Island Naval Base. The raid awoke a complacent Sydney population to the realities of war. The sale of artefacts from and regional tours of one of the captured midget submarines played a major role in raising awareness and in generating financial contributions to the War Bonds Scheme.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe M24 was the only Japanese midget submarine to successfully enter Sydney Harbour, fire its torpedoes and escape. The other two boats, Ha-14 and Ha-21 were disabled in the conflict and later recovered. The final fate of M24 and its brave crew of Sub Lieutenant Ban and Petty Officer Ashibe became one of Australia's enduring naval mysteries until the site was discovered by recreational divers in November 2006.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe M24 wreck site provides an opportunity to document and analyse the form, fit-out and construction of a Japanese Type A midget submarine from World War II. The archaeological record is of added importance with a limited number of archival references relative to this type of vessel. Aesthetically the M24 represents a rare opportunity to see a historically-significant submarine wreck site in its underwater setting, providing scope for world-class photographic documentation and potential controlled visitation by the recreational community.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe attack awoke a relatively complacent Sydney wartime population to the realities of the present conflict. The raid, which included eight Japanese submarines and over 500 Japanese Imperial Navy sailors, was the only direct attack on Sydney in its history. The event is well-remembered by the population nationally. In Sydney, the event is particularly closely felt because so much of the present population were witnesses to the raid. Such was the impact on Sydney that many school children and even whole families temporarily relocated from Sydney to places such as the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] and beyond, fearing another attack, more coastal shelling, or even invasion.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe M24 is the largest surviving archaeological relic ''in situ'' from the Japanese attack on Sydney Harbour on 31 May 1942. The M24 hull and associated relics have been retained in their archaeological context and unaltered, apart from damage by fishing net hook-ups. The site and artefacts have the potential to contribute to technical studies of the construction, fit-out and materials used in Japanese midget submarines of World War II. The site has potential to contribute to studies of corrosion activity of steel shipwrecks in coastal marine environments, and the effects of localised environmental factors.

The [[Ko-hyoteki-class submarine|''Ko-hyoteki''-class]] [[midget submarine]] (also known as a '''Type A midget submarine''') was designed by the [[Japanese Imperial Navy]] and built from 1941 to 1942 by Kure Naval Yard or Ourazaki Naval Yard. The site was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 7 December 2007.<ref name=nswshr-1785>{{cite NSW SHR|5060289|M24 Japanese Midget Submarine wreck site|hr=01785|fn=H05/00279|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe wreck site is located {{convert|55|m}} below sea level and approximately {{convert|5|km|nmi mi}} from [[Bungan Head, New South Wales|Bungan Head]].<ref name=Foundit>{{cite episode |title=Found it! |series=60 Minutes |serieslink=60 Minutes (Australian TV program) |credits=[[Liam Bartlett|Bartlett, Liam]] (reporter); Taylor, Stephen; Timms, Julia (co-producers) |network=[[Nine Network]] |location=Australia |airdate=26 November 2006 |url=http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-au&brand=ninemsn&tab=m163&mediaid=28587&from=39&vid=5a450894-8216-4807-8d5f-c116fb30f3a3&playlist=videoByTag:mk:en-AU:vs:0:tag:aunews_au60minutes:ns:MSNVideo_Top_Cat:ps:10:sd:-1:ind:1:ff:8A }}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Attack on Sydney Harbour}}\nThe Japanese midget submarine attack on [[Sydney Harbour]] was audacious and would have been even more spectacular had the primary military targets been successfully damaged. The attack showed the vulnerability of Australian ports like Sydney to long-range Japanese submarine patrols and the need for heightened security. Many Sydney-siders still recall the moments at night on 31 May\u20131 June 1942 as the harbour lit up with depth charge explosions, tracer fire and criss-crossing harbour defence vessels. The explosion as a Japanese torpedo struck under the depot ferry [[Her Majesty's Australian Ship|HMAS]] [[HMAS Kuttabul (ship)|''Kuttabul'']] was intense, throwing portions of the shattered hull high into the sky and killing twenty-one men.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe attack mirrored the earlier midget submarine operations at [[Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, and the raid on [[Diego-Suarez|Diego Suarez]] in [[Madagascar]] on 30 May 1942. The Sydney raid involved five large ocean-going submarines, I-22, I-24, I-27 with their three midget submarines, and I-21 and I-29 providing support. A sixth submarine I-28 intended for the raid was sunk by the US submarine [[United States Ship|USS]] [[USS Tautog|''Tautog'']] before it could deploy with a fourth midget. The five remaining mother submarines, which had left [[Chuuk Lagoon]] in the Pacific Ocean, arranged themselves in a semi-circle centred on [[Sydney Heads]]. A previous flight on 29 May by a reconnaissance aircraft launched from I-21 spotted potential targets inside the harbour. This [[Yokosuka E14Y|Glen-type twin-float]] [[seaplane]] capsized when returning to its submarine and was scuttled. The remains of the seaplane have not been located.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nAt approximately 8pm on the Sunday evening, the first midget (number 14 from I-27) commanded by Sub Lieutenant Chuman, motored submerged into the harbour. Unfortunately for its crew, the boat became fouled inside the still incomplete anti-submarine boom net laid across the harbour between Georges Head and [[Green Point, New South Wales|Green Point]] near {{NSWcity|Watsons Bay}}. Observed by surface craft near the Western Gate, the two-man Japanese crew decided to commit suicide when escape was hopeless. They fired the forward internal scuttling charge about 10:30pm and totally destroyed the fore end of the submarine. Remains of the wreck and its crew were later recovered.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nMidget A (according to the Allied order of identification) from I-24, commanded by Sub Lieutenant Ban with Petty Officer Ashibe, next entered the harbour and followed a [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] ferry through the boom defences. The exact serial number of this submarine has not been ascertained, but it is now often referred to as M24. The submarine crossed the Indicator Loop system at about 9:48 pm. In a cat-and-mouse play, the submarine manoeuvred around the harbour and was sighted several times around 11:00 pm. Under fire from the heavy Cruiser USS [[USS Chicago|''Chicago'']] and several motor launches, the submarine successfully fired its two torpedoes about 12:30am from near [[Bradleys Head]]. Both missed ''Chicago'' \u2014 the prime target \u2014 one running onto [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island]] and failing to explode. The other struck underneath the ferry HMAS ''Kuttabul'' after passing under the Dutch submarine K-IX at its berth. The explosion sank ''Kuttabul'' and killed 21 of those aboard. Ban's midget submarine never made it back to the planned rendezvous point immediately south of [[Port Hacking]].<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe third midget, Number 21 from I-22 commandeered by Lieutenant Matsuo, crept into the harbour, was sighted near the Heads, and was depth-charged, then laid low before making a belated entry around 3:00am when ''Chicago'' was leaving port, and then variously sighted in the vicinity of Bradleys Head and the [[Taronga Zoo]]. The midget was definitely seen in Taylors Bay by 5:00 am. The boat was attacked with depth charges from HMAS [[HMAS Seamist|''Seamist'']], ''[[Steady Hour]]'' and [[HMAS Yarroma|''Yarroma'']] until 8:30 am in the morning of 1 June and crippled. When recovered with its two live torpedoes and unexploded scuttling charges, the crew were found dead, having committed suicide. The remains of Midget 14 and 21 were recovered from the harbour within a week and subjected to military interrogation.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe Type A midget submarines were approximately {{convert|24|m}} in length, carried two 18-inch torpedoes, and could remain submerged for about 12 hours. On display at the Australian War Memorial in [[Canberra]] is a composite craft made up of the remains of midget 14 and 21, while the remaining conning tower (from midget 21) is on display at the Naval Heritage Centre, Garden Island, Sydney. None of the five mother submarines survived wartime operations. I-22 and I-24 had launched their previous midget submarines during the Pearl Harbour attack of 1941.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n===M24 attack and escape===\nThe midget from I-24 (also referred to in the initial Allied reports as \"Midget A\", and colloquially as M24), commanded by Sub Lieutenant Katsuhisa Ban with Petty Officer Mamoru Ashibe, entered the harbour, crossing the indicator loop at 9:48 pm. It apparently followed a Manly ferry also through the Eastern Channel gate in the boom. The submarine ran up the harbour unobserved for an hour until at 10:52 pm when it was spotted near the Garden Island Naval Base, across from Sydney's central business district. This sighting occurred just twenty minutes after Chuman and Ohmori in Ha-14 blew themselves up in the antisubmarine nets at the other end of the harbour. Military authorities finally started to appreciate the scale of the problem.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nM24's [[conning tower]] had been sighted by one of its prime targets, the American heavy cruiser USS ''Chicago'', and soon by the Dockyard Motor Boat Nestor. Now in a position {{convert|200|yd|m|order=flip}} off Garden Island and apparently proceeding in a direction towards the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], USS ''Chicago'' opened up with its five-inch guns and oerlikons. M24 was further attacked by ''Whyalla'' with its machine guns and ''Geelong'' from Bradleys Head. Recent research by historian Peter Grose indicates that one of ''Chicago's'' crew even emptied the clip of his .45 automatic pistol at M24's conning tower.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe historical events have been well covered (e.g. Jenkins, 1992, Carruthers, 2006 and most recently by Grose, 2007), however it is still unclear why it took Ban and Ashibe another hour-and-a-half to run the {{convert|1|mi|m nmi|order=flip}} from just west of ''Chicago'' to an attack position off its eastern-pointing stern.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nEven allowing for the need to complete turns and circles, M24 had sufficient time to transit that limited distance, compared to the hour it had only taken to pass right up through the harbour. It is more surprising that Ban did not attempt to get into a more optimum firing position, immediately broadside of ''Chicago's'' hull. It now appears that Ban fired both his \"fish\" from a position astern of ''Chicago'' using the observed 60-degree deflection setting on his torpedoes \u2014 a tricky shot. This is possibly one reason why he missed. The unexplained time lapse and then apparently-hurried attack may be explained by the fact that M24's crew rested on the seabed for some period prior to attacking their target, perhaps recovering from the earlier volley of fire.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nIt is confirmed that the submarine did successfully fire its two torpedoes about 12:30 am on 1 June from a position near the centre of the harbour abreast of Bradley's Head. The target was USS ''Chicago'', still at its mooring at Man of War anchorage #2 and attempting to build steam to quit the harbour. The workers' lights on Garden Island were extinguished at about the same time Ban was taking his shots. Both missed ''Chicago'', one running onto Garden Island and failing to explode amongst a pile of rope near the Gun Wharf. The other struck the island seawall under the ferry HMAS ''Kuttabul'' and exploded, sinking the vessel. The torpedo had first passed under the Dutch submarine K-IX at its berth alongside. K-IX was later wrecked in 1945 at Submarine Beach, [[Seal Rocks, New South Wales|Seal Rocks]], and located in 1999 by the Heritage Branch via a remote magnetometer survey.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe sinking of ''Kuttabul'' killed twenty-one of those aboard, with ten others injured. Ban's midget submarine was never recovered by the mother submarines. What was later identified as an outer crossing on the harbour indicator loop at 01:58 am on 1 June has generally been regarded as M24 safely exiting Sydney Harbour. It was the only midget to successfully fire its two torpedoes and the only one of the three to escape. Again M24 took one-and-a-half hours to exit the harbour. This is compared to the hour that it took to enter and first be sighted in the vicinity of ''Chicago''. M24 may have again rested inside the harbour for approximately half an hour after its failed attack.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n===Discovery===\nIn November 2006 Sydney-based recreational [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]] from a private group, No Frills Divers, located the remains of Ban and Ashibe's missing M24 midget submarine off Sydney's [[Northern Beaches]]. The wreck was found approximately {{convert|5|km|nmi mi}} offshore from Bungan Head near [[Newport, New South Wales|Newport]] in over {{convert|50|m|spell=on}} of water. Details of the discovery were broadcast on the [[Nine Network]]'s ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' television program on 26 November 2006, and the announcement confirmed by the [[Minister for Planning (New South Wales)|Minister for Planning]], in conjunction with relevant Commonwealth government agencies on 1 December 2006.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n;Management\nA No-entry Protected Zone was declared around the fragile wreck site on 1 December 2006 by the [[Minister for the Environment (Australia)|Federal Minister for the Environment]], under the Commonwealth Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. The No Entry zone has a radius of {{convert|500|m}}, the centre of which is at the intersection of {{coord|33|40|21|S|151|22|58|E|display=inline|type:landmark_regionAU-NSW}} in Australian waters. Entry to the zone is restricted to researchers and site managers while the archaeological survey work is completed. Permits are issued by the Heritage Branch of the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage or the Federal Minister for the Environment, Canberra.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe wreck was also initially subject to an Interim Heritage Order under Section 24 of the NSW (State) Heritage Act 1977. On 7 December 2007, the M24 wreck site and a zone with a radius of {{convert|500|m|adj=on}} was protected as an item of State Heritage significance on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. Penalties of up to AUS $1.1 million apply for disturbance of the wreck and surrounding debris field.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n==Description==\nThe Japanese Imperial Navy Type A midget submarines deployed at Sydney were approximately {{convert|24|m}} in length, of {{convert|46|-|47|ST|t}}, and carried two {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on|order=flip}} torpedoes (Type 97, oxygen-driven, Kure Naval Yard). With a two-man crew, contemporary assessments suggested that they could remain submerged for about 12 hours in most operating circumstances. After this time the crew would be forced to replenish air and stamina levels. The submarines were of single-hull design using welded {{convert|8|mm}} cold-rolled steel plates (MS44 quality, 5/16th inch), with a normal diving depth of up to {{convert|100|m}} and a collapse depth of {{convert|200|m}}. Powered by a {{convert|600|hp|order=flip}} electric motor, the boats could not recharge their initial battery capacity and therefore were totally reliant on the initial charge, careful management of the power reserve, and any technical breakdown or event that might impact the battery-operated electrical circuits. The design achieved an impressive surface speed, reportedly up to {{convert|24|knot|km/h}} on the surface and {{convert|19|knot|km/h}} submerged, far greater than other midget designs of World War II.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe Sydney boats had some design modifications compared to those captured at Pearl Harbour, with a slightly wider hull at {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}}. The vessels were electrically powered by 208 lead-acid wet-cell batteries (72 forward and 136 aft), and had three main sections joined by internal flanges, bolted together. These comprised the Forward Section (containing the torpedo tubes), the Central Section (containing the Forward Battery Room, Conning Tower and Aft Battery Room), and the Aft Section (containing the motor, propeller shaft and gearing). Other improvements included an improved gyro compass, an accessway hatch on the underside to permit crew transfers at sea, and an eyepiece fitted into the side of the Conning Tower. Other fundamental additions included the fitting of an improved nose guard and propeller guard, and the distinctive net cutters at bow and atop the Conning Tower.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe type was designed in Japan during the 1930s, with two experimental boats Ha-1 and Ha-2 built as early as 1936. The building program accelerated from 1938 onwards, when some fifty Type A boats were built at Ourazaki and Kure naval yards, the majority between 1940\u20132 (number sequence Ha-3 to Ha-52). The class was known by many secret names, the most commonly-ascribed being \"Ko-Hyoteki\" or \"Target A\", with the Sydney boats being an improved version, Type A Kai 1 (improved version 1). Records of production are limited and total production numbers are variously reported, with some for example quoting 59 Type As produced. The Japanese designed several variants to the Type A midget during the war, including the important Hei Gata (Type C) and the most prolific Koryu (Type D), fitted with generators to allow battery recharge and additional crew.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nJapanese midget submarines had their own numeric designation based on production sequences (a \"Ha\" number reference is often used today). They could be deployed on any of the mother carrier submarines fitted for them and therefore their identification number was often different to the I-class submarine carrier.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n===Midget submarine dimensions===\n{| {{Table|hide|sort}}\n!

Katsuhisa Ban\n*Petty Officer Mamoru Ashibe\n\n===Condition===\nAs of 19 February 2008, the M24 was generally in reasonable condition, however the external fabric has been damaged by commercial fishing trawling operations.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe wreck lies upright on sand, just under half-buried in the sediment. It appears that the bow is slightly elevated as the lower torpedo tube is approximately a third filled at sand level. Both tubes are empty of their torpedoes, confirming the identification of the vessel as M24, the only midget to successfully fire its two torpedoes. The upper tube has been torn off the vessel back to a substantial bulkhead and lies almost totally buried in sand adjacent to the bow on the port quarter. At the stern, sand levels lie at the centreline of the propeller boss (missing). Both contra-rotating propellers are visible, although all exposed rudders, stabilisers and the protective cage around the propellers have been torn off by fishing nets. Just forward of the stern, the topside manhole that gave access to the motor room appears lost to corrosion, creating a minor cavity in the hull plating.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe internal hull aft of the control room is over half-filled with sand, as evidenced through several significant openings in the pressure hull. These openings extend around the hull immediately aft of the rear control room bulkhead and beyond the conning tower area (see below). They extend from sand level to the roof, with corrosion processes resulting in plate loss back to internal transverse frames. The openings allow water movements through this aft battery room and tend to \"self-flush\" this major compartment, keeping sand levels down. Several fittings and fixtures that adorn the aft battery room are visible through these openings.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nSignificantly, the control room compartment is partly filled with sand up to the original internal casing roof. This sand has apparently entered the space as a result of significant damage to the upper conning tower structure and the aft battery room openings, mentioned above. Externally, all plating that comprised the conning tower has been removed from the hull, including the forward access chute into the control room. This once formed part of the pressure hull, and its removal has formed an artificial opening into the main hull atop the submarine. Only the pressure [[dome]] and periscope standard of the aft portion of the conning tower survives intact, however the damage has created an opening of approximately {{convert|50|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nDrifting sand has probably entered the control room space partly through this opening, and apparently to the same depth as observed in the aft battery room. When the No Frills Divers video footage of the wreck was first examined, there was an indication that the rear bulkhead door into the control room was closed. This led to speculation that both fore and aft doors were probably closed to enable sand accumulation and retention within the control room space. However, the current surveys have suggested that the aft door to the control room is in fact open, though significantly sanded up. It is likely that the forward control room bulkhead door is closed to assist sand build up. If future examination shows this is not the case, the forward battery room and perhaps the torpedo room, must also have significant introduced sand deposits.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nInside the periscope well, the upper portion of the periscope tube is visible transiting into the control room sand deposit. The periscope does not extend externally beyond the periscope standard, suggesting that it has retracted into the periscope well built into the floor of the control room. At no point could the upper lens of the periscope be sighted within the outside opening of the periscope standard.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nAround the internal upper walls of the control room are several gauges and levers that comprise part of the operating controls of the submarine. Of particular interest are the steps built into the forward face of the periscope well that allowed crew egress and ingress, and the clearly-visible retractable two-step crew ladder hinged at the weld joint of the periscope dome and the ceiling of the pressure hull. This ladder is still in its upright or stowed position, once within the cavity of the 1.5 metre-deep access chute, now lost. This is the firmest indication that the crew of M24 are most probably still within the submarine hull. To exit the craft, Ban and Ashibe would have had to pull down this hinged ladder to climb up and out of the Control Room.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe original signature of the external conning tower plating is clearly visible on the upper surfaces of the wreck, marked by the angle iron framework where it was attached to the casing.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nSome elements of the conning tower still survive in the debris field that surrounds the wreck. Almost incredibly, the watertight hatch that once sealed the access chute lies beside the conning tower on sand to port. Once upright, the lid has been turned over by divers to reveal its underside and locking mechanism, which appears to be in the locked position. While there is no sign of the access chute itself (part of the original pressure hull), the net cutter that once adorned the forward conning tower, with its distinctive teeth, lies separated on the sand, also on the port side, slightly abaft the conning tower. Resting against the submarine hull, its wishbone attachment frame is clearly visible.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nThe main hull forward is mostly intact, and unlike the stern, provides no visual access into either the forward battery room or torpedo room. Apart from some abrasion to the upper hull surfaces caused by fishing nets, and perhaps some modern impact by an anchor or some other foreign object, there is no significant damage to the casing. Hence it is impossible to postulate the condition of their internal spaces, including the presence of sand or relics.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nLike the conning tower, the forward bow area has witnessed significant physical damage. As noted, the upper of two torpedo tubes has been almost half torn off the hull and now lies in the sand to port. The main bulkhead (at frame 7) is clearly exposed, while the lower tube is completely intact to the bow. Running along the forward centreline of the casing, the original hydraulic line that extended to the bow torpedo cap release has been torn off and lies across the hull to port. Most of the front end of the submarine is still concealed by entrapped fishing nets that make inspection difficult. What is clear is that the protective cage around the torpedo tubes has been stripped from the hull, including the forward net-cutting gear and serrated jump cable that ran back to the conning tower.

The site is the only ''in situ''-identified cultural relic of the attack on Sydney Harbour in 1942. A complacent Sydney population awoke to the realities of war due to this attack, and the event is strongly remembered today through the wider community. The M24 wreck is representative of Japanese submarine operations off Australia's eastern seaboard during the war and a direct physical reminder of the conflict at Sydney. Internationally, it represents one of only a handful of Japanese midget submarine wreck sites located in their underwater contexts. Remains of a further six are retained as museum or outdoor exhibits. The archaeological site is therefore of considerable importance in the comparative analysis of midget submarines wrecks discovered worldwide. The site also has the ability to contribute generally to studies of submarines as a specialised class of archaeological site type. Only limited archival information related to these vessels survives and therefore the archaeological record is of added importance. In regard to the three submarines that attacked Sydney Harbour, M24 is the only one retained in its original battle context and undisturbed, apart from the obvious effects of net entrapment and corrosion activity.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\nM24 Japanese Midget Submarine wreck site was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 7 December 2007, having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Japanese submarine attack on Sydney Harbour was part of a series of pivotal aggressive moves by Japan during the early stages of World War II, and closely followed the attack at Pearl Harbour, Hawai'i just six months prior. The sizeable Japanese naval force of eight submarines comprised the first active attack on Sydney in its history. While the raid was militarily of limited success, it highlighted the vulnerability of important Allied naval station and repair facilities, and ships, to long-range submarine attack. The loss of 21 naval ratings aboard the depot ship HMAS ''Kuttabul'' to one of M24's torpedoes is still remembered by the navy through the annual HMAS ''Kuttabul'' Memorial Service held at Garden Island Naval Base. The raid awoke a complacent Sydney population to the realities of war. The sale of artefacts from and regional tours of one of the captured midget submarines played a major role in raising awareness and in generating financial contributions to the War Bonds Scheme.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe M24 was the only Japanese midget submarine to successfully enter Sydney Harbour, fire its torpedoes and escape. The other two boats, Ha-14 and Ha-21 were disabled in the conflict and later recovered. The final fate of M24 and its brave crew of Sub Lieutenant Ban and Petty Officer Ashibe became one of Australia's enduring naval mysteries until the site was discovered by recreational divers in November 2006.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe M24 wreck site provides an opportunity to document and analyse the form, fit-out and construction of a Japanese Type A midget submarine from World War II. The archaeological record is of added importance with a limited number of archival references relative to this type of vessel. Aesthetically the M24 represents a rare opportunity to see a historically-significant submarine wreck site in its underwater setting, providing scope for world-class photographic documentation and potential controlled visitation by the recreational community.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe attack awoke a relatively complacent Sydney wartime population to the realities of the present conflict. The raid, which included eight Japanese submarines and over 500 Japanese Imperial Navy sailors, was the only direct attack on Sydney in its history. The event is well-remembered by the population nationally. In Sydney, the event is particularly closely felt because so much of the present population were witnesses to the raid. Such was the impact on Sydney that many school children and even whole families temporarily relocated from Sydney to places such as the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] and beyond, fearing another attack, more coastal shelling, or even invasion.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe M24 is the largest surviving archaeological relic ''in situ'' from the Japanese attack on Sydney Harbour on 31 May 1942. The M24 hull and associated relics have been retained in their archaeological context and unaltered, apart from damage by fishing net hook-ups. The site and artefacts have the potential to contribute to technical studies of the construction, fit-out and materials used in Japanese midget submarines of World War II. The site has potential to contribute to studies of corrosion activity of steel shipwrecks in coastal marine environments, and the effects of localised environmental factors. The archaeological site is of added value to researchers as a storehouse of information that is not available through the scant archival records that survive for this class of vessel.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe M24 represents the only Type A Imperial Japanese midget submarine located in its original underwater context in Australian territorial waters. The partial remains of only two other examples survive in museum displays within Australia, which have been substantially stripped of fittings and fixtures. The M24 is one of five midget submarine wrecks located underwater internationally and six on museum display.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe wreck site is a representative example of the Type A Japanese midget submarines deployed in the first stages of World War II. The type saw action throughout the war but was superseded by later variants. As an example of the boats deployed in major war theatres such as Pearl Harbour, Sydney and Madagascar, the M24 wreck has the potential to document the main attributes of the class and various design additions.<ref name=nswshr-1785/>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Military of Australia}}}}\n*[[Attack on Sydney Harbour]]\n*[[Military history of Australia during World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|author1=Clarke, H. |author2= Yamashita, T.|date=1966|title=To Sydney by Stealth}}\n* {{cite web|author=Heritage Branch, NSW Department of Planning|date=2007|title=Shipwreck Information Sheet - M24 Japanese midget submarine|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/docs/M24_1942_info_sheet.pdf}}\n* {{cite book|last=Grose|first=Peter|date=2007|title=A Very Rude Awakening}}\n* {{cite book|author=Carruthers, Steven L.|date=2006|title=Japanese Submarine Raiders 1942: A Maritime Mystery}}\n* {{cite web|last=Smith|first=Tim|date=2007|title=Wreck of the Japanese type A midget submarine M24 - archaeological survey report|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/docs/M24_wreck_report_Dec2007.pdf}}\n\n===Attribution===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=M24 Japanese Midget Submarine wreck site|dno=5060289|id=01785|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ag.gov.au/portal/govgazonline.nsf Attorney Generals Department (Commonwealth)]\n* [http://www.environment.gov.au/index.html Department of Environment and Water Resources (Commonwealth)]\n* [http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au Heritage Branch, NSW Department of Planning]\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Sydney]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Midget submarines]]\n[[Category:Naval ships of Australia]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Shipwrecks of the Northern Sydney Region]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Rm repetition", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M24_Japanese_Midget_Submarine_wreck_site"}

In the 1800s, the US switched from charcoal to coke in ore smelting, adopted the [[Bessemer process]], and saw the rise of very large integrated steel mills. In the 20th century, the US industry successively adopted the [[open hearth furnace]], then the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] process. Since the American industry peaked in the 1940s and 1950s, the US industry has shifted to small mini-mills and specialty mills, using iron and steel scrap as feedstock, rather than iron ore.\n\n==Colonial==\n\nIron manufacture before the 19th century required charcoal, and Britain's once-vast forests could no longer supply enough charcoal for the nation's increasing need for iron. By 1700, Britain was becoming increasingly dependent on iron imported from its sometimes-adversary Sweden. Britain looked to the seemingly limitless forests of its American colonies to supply Britain with iron. British investors started an iron furnace near [[Perryville, Maryland]], which in 1718 started exporting iron back to Britain. That success prompted formation of more companies, which built numerous iron furnaces around [[Chesapeake Bay]], supplied by [[bog iron]] ore, which was widespread. By 1751, [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] were exporting 2,950 tons of pig iron to Britain each year; at the time, British iron production was about 20,000 tons per year.<ref>Norman J. G. Pounds and William N Parker, Coal and Steel in Western Europe (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1957) 22.</ref>\n\nWhile the Chesapeake Bay furnaces were established for export, iron furnaces were established in the 1700s throughout the American colonies for domestic consumption. Iron furnaces were located along rivers to supply water power. Also required were forests for charcoal, iron ore, and limestone for flux. In addition, the furnace needed to be close to a major market or close to water transport.\n\nBritish business interests were split on colonial iron: manufacturers appreciated the lower prices due to colonial imports, but the British iron and steel industry objected to the competition. [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] compromised in the [[Iron Act]] of 1750, which eliminated the import duty on colonial pig iron, but barred the manufacture of steel or of iron plate in the colonies. The law was widely ignored by colonial governments.\n\nBy 1776, up to 80 iron furnaces throughout the American colonies were producing about as much iron as Britain itself. If one estimate of 30,000 tons of iron each year is accurate, then the newly formed United States was the world's third-largest iron producer, after Sweden and Russia.\n\n'''Notable pre-19th-century iron furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Boonton Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Boonton, New Jersey]]\n| align=center | circa 1770\n| align=center | 1911\n|-\n| align=center | [[Catoctin Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Catoctin Furnace, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1774\n| align=center | 1903\n|-\n| align=center | [[Falling Creek Ironworks]]\n| align=center | [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1622\n| align=center | 1622\n|-\n| align=center | [[Furnace Mountain (Virginia)|Furnace Mountain]]\n| align=center | [[Loudoun County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1790\n| align=center | circa 1870\n|-\n| align=center | [[Hunter's Ironworks]]\n| align=center | [[Falmouth, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1750\n| align=center | 1782\n|-\n| align=center | [[Huntingdon Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1796\n| align=center | circa 1880\n|-\n| align=center | [[Neabsco Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Woodbridge, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1737\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[New Roxbury Ironworks Site]]\n| align=center | [[Woodstock, Connecticut]]\n| align=center | 1757\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Patuxent Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1705\n| align=center | 1856\n|-\n| align=center | [[Principio Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Cecil County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1719\n| align=center | 1925\n|-\n| align=center | [[Stirling Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Monroe, New York]]\n| align=center | 1761\n| align=center | 1842\n|-\n| align=center | [[Taunton Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Raynham, Massachusetts]]\n| align=center | 1656\n| align=center | 1876\n|-\n| align=center | [[Washington Iron Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Rocky Mount, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1770\n| align=center | \n|-\n|}\n\n==Early republic==\n\nBecause wood for charcoal was available throughout the eastern states, iron smelters were located close to iron ore. Although the bog iron ores mined in colonial days were widespread, the deposits were also small, and quickly exhausted. In the late 1700s the iron furnaces moved away from the bog iron ore of the coastal swamps, to larger iron ore deposits further inland. Inland locations also allowed the furnaces to be closer to sources of limestone, which was used as a flux in iron smelting. The proximity to larger ore deposits favored larger, more permanent iron smelters.<ref>US Geological Survey, 2001, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/silent/silent.pdf Silent reminders], Geologic Wonders of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, No. 3.</ref>\n\nMost US iron smelting before 1850 took place near iron deposits in eastern [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and northern [[New Jersey]].<ref>John S.Brown, \"Ore deposits of the northeastern United States,\" ''in'', John D. Ridge (ed.), ''Ore Deposits of the United States, 1933-1967'' (New York:American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1970) 2-4.</ref> New Jersey's principal iron ore district, at [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], supported iron smelters beginning in 1710. The [[Cornwall Iron Furnace]] in Pennsylvania was established next to an iron deposit. The Adirondack iron ore district of New York also supported iron smelters.<ref>Martha S. Carr and Carl E. Dutton, 1959, ''Iron-Ore Resources of the United States, Including Alaska and Puerto Rico'', US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1082-C, p.66-67.</ref>\n\nThe movement away from charcoal in US iron smelting began in 1827, when a [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] furnace in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]] started using anthracite coal. [[Blast furnaces]] continued to use only charcoal until about 1840, when [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]] started replacing charcoal as the fuel and reducing agent.<ref>James M. Swank, \"The manufacture of iron and steel in the United States,\" in: ''Mineral Resources of the United States, 1883 and 1884'', US Geological Survey, 1885, p.247.</ref> Coke has a higher crushing strength than charcoal, allowing larger smelting furnaces.<ref>W. H. Dennis, ''100 Years of Metallurgy'' (Chicago: Aldine, 1963) 79-80.</ref> Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills moved closer to the coal mines to minimize transportation costs. A problem of coke was that it carried impurities such as sulfur, which degraded the quality of the steel. Although coke quickly became the dominant fuel for iron-smelting, in 1884 charcoal was still used to make ten percent of iron and steel in the US. The use of [[Charcoal iron|charcoal for steelmaking]] survived in the US on a small scale until 1945.\n\nThe [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna Valley]] in [[Pennsylvania]] was rich in [[anthracite]] [[coal]] and [[iron]] deposits. Brothers [[George W. Scranton]] and [[Seldon T. Scranton]] moved to the valley in 1840 and settled in the five-house town of Slocum's Hollow (now Scranton) to establish an iron forge.<ref name=\"Yeomans\">Yeomans, \"36 Hours: Scranton, Pa.,\" ''New York Times,'' November 1, 2002.</ref><ref name=\"Bitter\">\"The Bitter Battle,\" ''Time,'' October 19, 1962.</ref> The most common processes for creating [[cementation process|blister steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were slow and extremely expensive.

The Scrantons also experimented with anthracite to make steel, rather than [[charcoal]] or [[bituminous coal]].<ref name=\"Lewis\">Lewis, \"The Early History of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company: A Study in Technological Adaptation,\" ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography,'' October 1972.</ref>\n\n'''Notable early 19th-century iron furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Bradys Bend Iron Company Furnaces]]\n| align=center | [[Armstrong County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1840\n| align=center | 1873\n|-\n| align=center | [[Catherine Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Newport, Page County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1836\n| align=center | 1885\n|-\n| align=center | [[Curtin Village]]\n| align=center | [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1810\n| align=center | 1921\n|-\n| align=center | [[Elizabeth Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Fort Valley, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1836\n| align=center | 1888\n|-\n| align=center | [[Georges Creek Coal and Iron Company]]\n| align=center | [[Lonaconing, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1837\n| align=center | 1855\n|-\n| align=center | [[Isabella Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1835\n| align=center | 1894\n|-\n| align=center | [[Joppa Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Baltimore County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | circa 1817\n| align=center | circa 1865\n|-\n| align=center | [[Longdale Furnace Historic District]]\n| align=center | [[Clifton Forge, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1827\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Mount Savage Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Mount Savage, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1837\n| align=center | circa 1870\n|-\n| align=center | [[Nassawango Iron Furnace Site]]\n| align=center | [[Snow Hill, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1830\n| align=center | 1849\n|-\n| align=center | [[Richmond Furnace Historical and Archeological District]]\n| align=center | [[Richmond, Massachusetts]]\n| align=center | 1829\n| align=center | 1923\n|-\n| align=center | [[Roaring Run Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Eagle Rock, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1832\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Scranton Iron Furnaces]]\n| align=center | [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1848\n| align=center | 1902\n|-\n| align=center | [[Tredegar Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Richmond, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1837\n| align=center | circa 1950\n|-\n|}\n\n==Pittsburgh==\n\n[[Image:Bethlehem Steel.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bethlehem Steel]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] was one of the world's largest manufacturers of steel.]]\nThe replacement of charcoal with coal in the steel-making process revolutionized the industry, and tied steelmaking to coal-mining areas. In the 1800s, making a ton of steel required a greater weight of coal than iron ore.  Therefore, it was more economical to locate closer to the coal mines. Pittsburgh, surrounded by large coal deposits and at the junction of three navigable rivers, was an ideal location for steelmaking.\n\n==Great Lakes ports==\n\nThe tremendous iron ore deposits around Lake Superior were located far from coal deposits, and so were shipped to ports on the southern Great Lakes that were closer to the coal mines of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Large integrated steel mills were built in Chicago, Detroit, Gary, Cleveland, and Buffalo, to handle the Lake Superior ore.\n\nCleveland's first blast furnace was built in 1859. In 1860, the steel mill employed 374 workers. By 1880, Cleveland was a major steel producer, with ten steel mills and 3,000 steelworkers.<ref>[http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=IASI Iron and steel industry], Encyclopedia of Cleveland, accessed 5 Nov. 2015.</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Gary, Indiana]] was founded in 1906 by [[United States Steel Corporation]] to serve the [[Gary Works]].\n\nThe [[Lackawanna Steel Company]] built a large integrated steel works near Buffalo, which began producing steel from Lake Superior ore in 1903. The company had made steel in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] since 1840, but moved to provide easier access to iron ore, and in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid labor troubles.\n\n==Birmingham, Alabama==\n\nBirmingham, Alabama became a major steel producer in the late 1800s, using locally mined coal and iron ore.

In 1945, the US produced 67% of the world's pig iron, and 72% of the steel. By comparison, 2014 percentages were 2.4% of the pig iron, and 5.3% of the steel production.\n\nAlthough US iron and steel output continued to grow overall through the 1950s and 1960s, the world steel industry grew much faster, and the US share of world production shrank. In the 1960s, the US became a major importer of steel, mostly from Japan.\n\n==Contraction: 1979-1984==\n\nUS production of iron and steel peaked in 1973, when the US industry produced a combined total of 229 million metric tons of iron and steel. But US iron and steel production dropped drastically during the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s. From a combined iron and steel production of 203 million tons in 1979, US output fell almost in half, to 107 million tons in 1982. Some steel companies declared bankruptcy, and many permanently closed steelmaking plants. By 1989, US combined iron and steel production recovered to 142 million tons, a much lower level than in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe causes of the sudden decline are disputed. Among the many causes alleged have been: dumping of foreign imports below cost, high labor costs, poor management, unfavorable tax policies, and costs of environmental controls. One recent study found that hypotheses based on declining domestic production (such as foreign imports displacing domestic product) cannot explain the magnitude of the decline in employment, as shipments of domestic steel products in 2005 were similar to the level of the early 1960s, whereas employment in the domestic sector had plummeted by approximately 75% over the same time period. Instead, the majority of the losses could be accounted for by rising productivity, principally through technological efficiencies and the shift from traditional steel plants to [[mini mill]]s.<ref name=\"CWL2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Collard-Wexler|first1=Allan|last2=De Loecker|first2=Jan|title=Reallocation and Technology: Evidence from the US Steel Industry|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|date=January 2015|volume=105|issue=1|pages=131\u201371|doi=10.1257/aer.20130090}}</ref>\n\nCleveland had nine integrated steel mills in the 1970s. US Steel closed one mill in 1979, then shut down its six remaining Cleveland mills in 1984. Cleveland's two remaining steel producers, [[Republic Steel]] and Jones & Laughlin, merged to form LTV Steel in June 1984. LTV Steel declared bankruptcy in 2000. The operation, on both sides of the [[Cuyahoga River]], is Cleveland's last remaining integrated steel mill, now owned by [[Arcelor Mittal]].\n\n==Transformation==\n\nThe number of integrated steel mills has continued to decline, and in 2014, only 11 integrated mills were operating in the US. Most of the steel produced has been by the growing number of mini-mills, also called specialty mills, which in 2014 numbered 113. In 1981, mini-mills produced an estimated 15% of US steel.<ref>Linda Chaves, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/23/business/the-rise-of-mini-steel-mills.html \"The rise of mini steel mills,\"] ''New York Times'', 23 Sept. 1981.</ref> Since 2002, steel produced by electric arc furnace, the process used by the mini-mills, has produced more than half the steel made in the US. Many companies operating integrated mills also have mini-mills.\n\nA number of bankruptcies and acquisitions between 2000 and 2014 reversed the trend of industry fragmentation. In 2000, the top three steelmakers ([[Nucor]], US Steel, and Bethlehem Steel) had 28% of the steelmaking capacity, and the top ten had 58%. By 2014, the top three (Nucor, ArcelorMittal, and US Steel) accounted for 56% of the steel capacity, and the top ten 87%.<ref>[http://usa.arcelormittal.com/globalassets/arcelormittal-usa/publications-reports/2014-arcelormittalusa-factbook.pdf 2014 Arcelormittal USA Factbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915214341/http://usa.arcelormittal.com/globalassets/arcelormittal-usa/publications-reports/2014-arcelormittalusa-factbook.pdf |date=2015-09-15 }}.</ref>\n\n'''Notable defunct 20th-century steel furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Owners\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Duluth Works]]\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Duluth, Minnesota]]\n| align=center | 1915\n| align=center | 1987\n|-\n| align=center | Fontana blast furnace\n| align=center | [[Kaiser Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Fontana, California]]\n| align=center | 1942\n| align=center | circa 1982<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-09/business/fi-1840_1_kaiser-steel</ref>\n|-\n| align=center | [[Geneva Steel]] mill\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Vineyard, Utah]]\n| align=center | 1944\n| align=center | 2001\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Iron and steel industry in the United States]]\n* [[Iron mining in the United States]]\n* [[History of the steel industry (1850-1970)]]\n* [[History of the steel industry (1970-present)]]\n* [[2002 United States steel tariff]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n==Further reading==\n* Hoerr, John P.

In the 1800s, the US switched from charcoal to coke in ore smelting, adopted the [[Bessemer process]], and saw the rise of very large integrated steel mills. In the 20th century, the US industry successively adopted the [[open hearth furnace]], then the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] process. Since the American industry peaked in the 1940s and 1950s, the US industry has shifted to small mini-mills and specialty mills, using iron and steel scrap as feedstock, rather than iron ore.\n\n==Colonial==\n\nIron manufacture before the 19th century required charcoal, and Britain\u2019s once-vast forests could no longer supply enough charcoal for the nation\u2019s increasing need for iron. By 1700, Britain was becoming increasingly dependent on iron imported from its sometimes-adversary Sweden. Britain looked to the seemingly limitless forests of its American colonies to supply Britain with iron. British investors started an iron furnace near [[Perryville, Maryland]], which in 1718 started exporting iron back to Britain. That success prompted formation of more companies, which built numerous iron furnaces around [[Chesapeake Bay]], supplied by [[bog iron]] ore, which was widespread. By 1751, [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] were exporting 2,950 tons of pig iron to Britain each year; at the time, British iron production was about 20,000 tons per year.<ref>Norman J. G. Pounds and William N Parker, Coal and Steel in Western Europe (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1957) 22.</ref>\n\nWhile the Chesapeake Bay furnaces were established for export, iron furnaces were established in the 1700s throughout the American colonies for domestic consumption. Iron furnaces were located along rivers to supply water power. Also required were forests for charcoal, iron ore, and limestone for flux. In addition, the furnace needed to be close to a major market or close to water transport.\n\nBritish business interests were split on colonial iron: manufacturers appreciated the lower prices due to colonial imports, but the British iron and steel industry objected to the competition. [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] compromised in the [[Iron Act]] of 1750, which eliminated the import duty on colonial pig iron, but barred the manufacture of steel or of iron plate in the colonies. The law was widely ignored by colonial governments.\n\nBy 1776, up to 80 iron furnaces throughout the American colonies were producing about as much iron as Britain itself. If one estimate of 30,000 tons of iron each year is accurate, then the newly formed United States was the world\u2019s third-largest iron producer, after Sweden and Russia.\n\n'''Notable pre-19th-century iron furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Boonton Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Boonton, New Jersey]]\n| align=center | circa 1770\n| align=center | 1911\n|-\n| align=center | [[Catoctin Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Catoctin Furnace, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1774\n| align=center | 1903\n|-\n| align=center | [[Falling Creek Ironworks]]\n| align=center | [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | 1622\n| align=center | 1622\n|-\n| align=center | [[Furnace Mountain (Virginia)|Furnace Mountain]]\n| align=center | [[Loudoun County, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1790\n| align=center | circa 1870\n|-\n| align=center | [[Hunter's Ironworks]]\n| align=center | [[Falmouth, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1750\n| align=center | 1782\n|-\n| align=center | [[Huntingdon Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1796\n| align=center | circa 1880\n|-\n| align=center | [[Neabsco Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Woodbridge, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1737\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[New Roxbury Ironworks Site]]\n| align=center | [[Woodstock, Connecticut]]\n| align=center | 1757\n| align=center | \n|-\n| align=center | [[Patuxent Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1705\n| align=center | 1856\n|-\n| align=center | [[Principio Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Cecil County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1719\n| align=center | 1925\n|-\n| align=center | [[Stirling Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Monroe, New York]]\n| align=center | 1761\n| align=center | 1842\n|-\n| align=center | [[Taunton Iron Works]]\n| align=center | [[Raynham, Massachusetts]]\n| align=center | 1656\n| align=center | 1876\n|-\n| align=center | [[Washington Iron Furnace]]\n| align=center | [[Rocky Mount, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1770\n| align=center | \n|-\n|}\n\n==Early republic==\n\nBecause wood for charcoal was available throughout the eastern states, iron smelters were located close to iron ore. Although the bog iron ores mined in colonial days were widespread, the deposits were also small, and quickly exhausted. In the late 1700s the iron furnaces moved away from the bog iron ore of the coastal swamps, to larger iron ore deposits further inland. Inland locations also allowed the furnaces to be closer to sources of limestone, which was used as a flux in iron smelting. The proximity to larger ore deposits favored larger, more permanent iron smelters.<ref>US Geological Survey, 2001, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/silent/silent.pdf Silent reminders], Geologic Wonders of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, No. 3.</ref>\n\nMost US iron smelting before 1850 took place near iron deposits in eastern [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and northern [[New Jersey]].<ref>John S.Brown, \"Ore deposits of the northeastern United States,\" ''in'', John D. Ridge (ed.), ''Ore Deposits of the United States, 1933-1967'' (New York:American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1970) 2-4.</ref> New Jersey's principal iron ore district, at [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], supported iron smelters beginning in 1710. The [[Cornwall Iron Furnace]] in Pennsylvania was established next to an iron deposit. The Adirondack iron ore district of New York also supported iron smelters.<ref>Martha S. Carr and Carl E. Dutton, 1959, ''Iron-Ore Resources of the United States, Including Alaska and Puerto Rico'', US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1082-C, p.66-67.</ref>\n\nThe movement away from charcoal in US iron smelting began in 1827, when a [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] furnace in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]] started using anthracite coal. [[Blast furnaces]] continued to use only charcoal until about 1840, when [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]] started replacing charcoal as the fuel and reducing agent.<ref>James M. Swank, \"The manufacture of iron and steel in the United States,\" in: ''Mineral Resources of the United States, 1883 and 1884'', US Geological Survey, 1885, p.247.</ref> Coke has a higher crushing strength than charcoal, allowing larger smelting furnaces.<ref>W. H. Dennis, ''100 Years of Metallurgy'' (Chicago: Aldine, 1963) 79-80.</ref> Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills moved closer to the coal mines to minimize transportation costs. A problem of coke was that it carried impurities such as sulfur, which degraded the quality of the steel. Although coke quickly became the dominant fuel for iron-smelting, in 1884 charcoal was still used to make ten percent of iron and steel in the US. The use of [[Charcoal iron|charcoal for steelmaking]] survived in the US on a small scale until 1945.\n\nThe [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna Valley]] in [[Pennsylvania]] was rich in [[anthracite]] [[coal]] and [[iron]] deposits. Brothers [[George W. Scranton]] and [[Seldon T. Scranton]] moved to the valley in 1840 and settled in the five-house town of Slocum's Hollow (now Scranton) to establish an iron forge.<ref name=\"Yeomans\">Yeomans, \"36 Hours: Scranton, Pa.,\" ''New York Times,'' November 1, 2002.</ref><ref name=\"Bitter\">\"The Bitter Battle,\" ''Time,'' October 19, 1962.</ref> The most common processes for creating [[cementation process|blister steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were slow and extremely expensive.

In the 1800s, making a ton of steel required a greater weight of coal than iron ore.  Therefore, it was more economical to locate closer to the coal mines. Pittsburgh, surrounded by large coal deposits and at the junction of three navigable rivers, was an ideal location for steelmaking.\n\n==Great Lakes ports==\n\nThe tremendous iron ore deposits around Lake Superior were located far from coal deposits, and so were shipped to ports on the southern Great Lakes that were closer to the coal mines of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Large integrated steel mills were built in Chicago, Detroit, Gary, Cleveland, and Buffalo, to handle the Lake Superior ore.\n\nCleveland's first blast furnace was built in 1859. In 1860, the steel mill employed 374 workers. By 1880, Cleveland was a major steel producer, with ten steel mills and 3,000 steelworkers.<ref>[http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=IASI Iron and steel industry], Encyclopedia of Cleveland, accessed 5 Nov. 2015.</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Gary, Indiana]] was founded in 1906 by [[United States Steel Corporation]] to serve the [[Gary Works]].\n\nThe [[Lackawanna Steel Company]] built a large integrated steel works near Buffalo, which began producing steel from Lake Superior ore in 1903. The company had made steel in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] since 1840, but moved to provide easier access to iron ore, and in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid labor troubles.\n\n==Birmingham, Alabama==\n\nBirmingham, Alabama became a major steel producer in the late 1800s, using locally mined coal and iron ore. The iron ore was mined from the Clinton Formation of Silurian age.\n\n'''Notable defunct late 19th-century iron and steel furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Owners\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Antrim Iron Company]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Mancelona, Michigan]]\n| align=center | 1886\n| align=center | 1945\n|-\n| align=center | [[Bellefonte Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1888\n| align=center | 1910\n|-\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem Works]]\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1857\n| align=center | 1995\n|-\n| align=center | [[Brierfield Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Brierfield, Alabama]]\n| align=center | 1861\n| align=center | 1894\n|-\n| align=center | [[Callie Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Glen Wilton, Virginia]]\n| align=center | circa 1873\n| align=center | 1884\n|-\n| align=center | [[Cornwall Furnace (Cedar Bluff, Alabama)|Cornwall Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Cedar Bluff, Alabama]]\n| align=center | circa 1862\n| align=center | 1874\n|-\n| align=center | [[Endor Iron Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Cumnock, North Carolina]]\n| align=center | 1861\n| align=center | 1971\n|-\n| align=center | [[Fayette Historic State Park]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Fayette, Michigan]]\n| align=center | 1867\n| align=center | 1891\n|-\n| align=center | [[Homestead Steel Works]]\n| align=center | [[Carnegie Steel]], [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1881\n| align=center | 1986\n|-\n| align=center | [[Janney Furnace Park]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Ohatchee, Alabama]]\n| align=center | 1863\n| align=center | 1864\n|-\n| align=center | [[Nittany Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]]\n| align=center | 1888\n| align=center | 1911\n|-\n| align=center | [[Oregon Iron Company]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]]\n| align=center | 1867\n| align=center | 1893\n|-\n| align=center | [[Sloss Furnace]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center | [[Birmingham, Alabama]]\n| align=center | 1882\n| align=center | 1971\n|-\n| align=center | [[South Works]]\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Chicago, Illinois]]\n| align=center | 1857\n| align=center | 1992\n|-\n| align=center | [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]]\n| align=center | [[Bethlehem Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Baltimore County, Maryland]]\n| align=center | 1889\n| align=center | 2012\n|-\n|}\n\n==World War II and after==\n\n[[File:US Steelmaking Process Percentages 1950-2012.png|thumb|Percentages of US steelmaking processes, 1900-2012. Data from USGS and US Bureau of Mines Minerals Yearbooks]]\nAs the only major steel maker not harmed during the war, the United States iron and steel industry reached its maximum world importance during and just after World War II. In 1945, the US produced 67% of the world's pig iron, and 72% of the steel. By comparison, 2014 percentages were 2.4% of the pig iron, and 5.3% of the steel production.\n\nAlthough US iron and steel output continued to grow overall through the 1950s and 1960s, the world steel industry grew much faster, and the US share of world production shrank. In the 1960s, the US became a major importer of steel, mostly from Japan.\n\n==Contraction: 1979-1984==\n\nUS production of iron and steel peaked in 1973, when the US industry produced a combined total of 229 million metric tons of iron and steel. But US iron and steel production dropped drastically during the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s. From a combined iron and steel production of 203 million tons in 1979, US output fell almost in half, to 107 million tons in 1982. Some steel companies declared bankruptcy, and many permanently closed steelmaking plants. By 1989, US combined iron and steel production recovered to 142 million tons, a much lower level than in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe causes of the sudden decline are disputed. Among the many causes alleged have been: dumping of foreign imports below cost, high labor costs, poor management, unfavorable tax policies, and costs of environmental controls. One recent study found that hypotheses based on declining domestic production (such as foreign imports displacing domestic product) cannot explain the magnitude of the decline in employment, as shipments of domestic steel products in 2005 were similar to the level of the early 1960s, whereas employment in the domestic sector had plummeted by approximately 75% over the same time period. Instead, the majority of the losses could be accounted for by rising productivity, principally through technological efficiencies and the shift from traditional steel plants to [[mini mill]]s.<ref name=\"CWL2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Collard-Wexler|first1=Allan|last2=De Loecker|first2=Jan|title=Reallocation and Technology: Evidence from the US Steel Industry|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|date=January 2015|volume=105|issue=1|pages=131\u201371|doi=10.1257/aer.20130090}}</ref>\n\nCleveland had nine integrated steel mills in the 1970s. US Steel closed one mill in 1979, then shut down its six remaining Cleveland mills in 1984. Cleveland's two remaining steel producers, [[Republic Steel]] and Jones & Laughlin, merged to form LTV Steel in June 1984. LTV Steel declared bankruptcy in 2000. The operation, on both sides of the [[Cuyahoga River]], is Cleveland's last remaining integrated steel mill, now owned by [[Arcelor Mittal]].\n\n==Transformation==\n\nThe number of integrated steel mills has continued to decline, and in 2014, only 11 integrated mills were operating in the US. Most of the steel produced has been by the growing number of mini-mills, also called specialty mills, which in 2014 numbered 113. In 1981, mini-mills produced an estimated 15% of US steel.<ref>Linda Chaves, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/23/business/the-rise-of-mini-steel-mills.html \"The rise of mini steel mills,\"] ''New York Times'', 23 Sept. 1981.</ref> Since 2002, steel produced by electric arc furnace, the process used by the mini-mills, has produced more than half the steel made in the US. Many companies operating integrated mills also have mini-mills.\n\nA number of bankruptcies and acquisitions between 2000 and 2014 reversed the trend of industry fragmentation. In 2000, the top three steelmakers ([[Nucor]], US Steel, and Bethlehem Steel) had 28% of the steelmaking capacity, and the top ten had 58%. By 2014, the top three (Nucor, ArcelorMittal, and US Steel) accounted for 56% of the steel capacity, and the top ten 87%.<ref>[http://usa.arcelormittal.com/globalassets/arcelormittal-usa/publications-reports/2014-arcelormittalusa-factbook.pdf 2014 Arcelormittal USA Factbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915214341/http://usa.arcelormittal.com/globalassets/arcelormittal-usa/publications-reports/2014-arcelormittalusa-factbook.pdf |date=2015-09-15 }}.</ref>\n\n'''Notable defunct 20th-century steel furnaces in the US''' \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" \n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Owners\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | Start Date\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" | End Date\n|-\n| align=center | [[Duluth Works]]\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Duluth, Minnesota]]\n| align=center | 1915\n| align=center | 1987\n|-\n| align=center | Fontana blast furnace\n| align=center | [[Kaiser Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Fontana, California]]\n| align=center | 1942\n| align=center | circa 1982<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-09/business/fi-1840_1_kaiser-steel</ref>\n|-\n| align=center | [[Geneva Steel]] mill\n| align=center | [[US Steel]]\n| align=center | [[Vineyard, Utah]]\n| align=center | 1944\n| align=center | 2001\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Iron and steel industry in the United States]]\n* [[Iron mining in the United States]]\n* [[History of the steel industry (1850-1970)]]\n* [[History of the steel industry (1970-present)]]\n* [[2002 United States steel tariff]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n==Further reading==\n* Hoerr, John P.
