The part had originally been intended for [[Marilyn Monroe]], however problems between Monroe and Fox led to Collins gaining the role.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048119/trivia | title = IMDb | contribution = Trivia}}</ref>\n\nMGM borrowed Collins for ''[[The Opposite Sex]]'' (1956), a musical remake of ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) in which she was cast as the gold digging Crystal, the role played by [[Joan Crawford]] in the original. She then starred as a young nun in ''[[Sea Wife]]'' (1956), top-billed over co-star [[Richard Burton]], followed by the all-star ''[[Island in the Sun (film)|Island in the Sun]]'' (1957), which was a major box-office success.

Next came the tense crime caper ''[[Seven Thieves]]'' (1960) opposite [[Edward G. Robinson]] and [[Rod Steiger]].\n\nIn 1960, Collins became increasingly disillusioned with 20th Century Fox when, having been the original choice to play the title role in ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', the part went instead to [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. Collins withdrew from the studio's production of ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'', and requested a release from her contract, however she agreed to star in one last film for Fox, top-billed again in the biblical epic ''[[Esther and the King]]'' (1960).\n\n===The 1960s===\nAs a freelance actress, Collins made only occasional films in the early 1960s, whilst raising her first two children (she had married the actor/singer [[Anthony Newley]] in 1963). \n \nIn 1961, she returned to London to star opposite [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Bob Hope]] in the last of that film duo's \"road\" pictures, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). Former \"road\" leading lady [[Dorothy Lamour]] was relegated to a guest appearance in the film. In Italy, Collins starred in ''[[Hard Time for Princes]]'' (1965); back in the US she played [[David Janssen]]'s wife in the detective thriller ''[[Warning Shot (1967 film)|Warning Shot]]'' (1967); in the UK she was the leading lady in the spy caper ''[[Subterfuge (1968 film)|Subterfuge]]'' (1968); and made a cameo appearance in the comedy ''[[If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium]]'' (1969).\n\nIn the US, Collins starred opposite her husband in Newley's autobiographical musical ''[[Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?]]'' (1969). Then came the female lead in the Italian drama ''{{Ill|L'amore breve|it}}'' (1969), ''[[The Executioner (1970 film)|The Executioner]]'' (1970), a thriller with George Peppard, and ''[[Up in the Cellar]]'' (1970), a quasisequel to ''[[Three in the Attic]]''.\n\n===Television===\nAlthough she had made several appearances on interview and game shows in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Collins began her television dramatic career with a guest role in ''[[The Human Jungle (TV series)|The Human Jungle]]'' in 1963. Her notable appearances on American television during the 1960s included playing the villainous Siren in ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[Run for Your Life (TV series)|Run For Your Life]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[The Man From U.N.C.L.E.]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''; in the latter, she played Edith Keeler in the episode [[The City on the Edge of Forever]], widely regarded by fans as one of the best episodes across all the Star Trek series, if not the best.\n\nIn the 1970s, Collins remained busy on television. She starred in the TV movies ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' (1972) with [[Orson Welles]] and [[Lee Remick]], and ''Drive Hard, Drive Fast'' (1973) opposite [[Brian Kelly (actor)|Brian Kelly]]. Her many guest appearances during the decade included ''[[The Persuaders!]]'' alongside [[Roger Moore]] and [[Tony Curtis]], ''Fallen Angels'' with [[Susannah York]], ''[[Space 1999]]'', ''[[Orson Welles Great Mysteries]]'', ''[[Police Woman]]'', ''[[The Moneychangers]]'' with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Christopher Plummer]], ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Switch (TV series)|Switch]]'', ''[[Future Cop (TV series)|Future Cop]]'', ''[[Ellery Queen]]'', ''[[The Fantastic Journey]]'', ''[[Baretta]]'' and three separate episodes of ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected|Tales of the Unexpected]]''.  She rounded off the decade playing Cleopatra in an episode of [[Aaron Spelling]]'s  ''[[Fantasy Island]]''.\n\n===British film star===\n[[File:Joan Collins Empire of the Ants.JPG|thumb|Joan Collins in ''[[Empire of the Ants (film)|Empire of the Ants]]'' (1977)]]\nIn 1970, Collins returned to Britain and starred in several films, mostly thrillers and horror films: ''[[Revenge (1971 film)|Revenge]]'' (1971), as the vengeance-seeking mother of murdered child; ''[[Quest for Love (1971 film)|Quest for Love]]'' (1971), a romantic science-fiction piece; ''[[Tales from the Crypt (film)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' (1972), a highly successful horror anthology; ''[[Fear in the Night (1972 film)|Fear in the Night]]'' (1972), a psychological horror from [[Jimmy Sangster]]; ''[[Dark Places (1973 film)|Dark Places]]'' (1973), a thriller with [[Christopher Lee]]; and ''[[Tales That Witness Madness]]'' (1973), another horror anthology.\n\nShe went to Italy for the football-themed comedy ''[[L'arbitro (1974 film)|L'arbitro]]'' (1974), to Spain for ''The Great Adventure'' opposite [[Jack Palance]] and returned to England for yet another horror, playing the mother of a murderous infant in ''[[I Don't Want to Be Born]]'' (1975).\n\nAfter two comedies, ''[[Alfie Darling]]'' (1975) and ''[[The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones]]'' (1976), Collins returned to the US to make what she now refers to as the nadir of her film career, the giant insect science-fiction piece ''[[Empire of the Ants (film)|Empire of the Ants]]'' (1977). In Italy she was the leading lady in the thriller ''[[Fearless (1978 film)|Fearless]]'' (1978); in the US made the lighthearted ''[[Zero to Sixty]]'' (1978); and back in the UK appeared with [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]''.\n\n===''The Stud'' and ''The Bitch''===\nIn 1978, Collins was catapulted back to major stardom in the UK when she starred in the film version of her sister [[Jackie Collins]]'s racy novel ''[[The Stud (film)|The Stud]]''.

It too was a hit.\n\nAfter shooting ''[[Game for Vultures]]'' (1979) opposite [[Richard Harris]] and ''[[Sunburn (1979 film)|Sunburn]]'' (1979) with [[Farrah Fawcett]], Collins returned to the stage for the first time in many years to play the title role in ''[[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (play)|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney]]'' (1980) in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].\n\nCollins' heightened popularity in Europe did not go unnoticed in America. In 1981 she would receive a job offer from US television which would change the course of her career.\n\n===''Dynasty''===\nIn 1981, Collins accepted a role in the second season of the then-struggling soap opera ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (1981\u201389), as [[Alexis Colby|Alexis Carrington]], the beautiful and vengeful ex-wife of oil tycoon [[Blake Carrington]] ([[John Forsythe]]).

Collins had signed a two-book deal with the company for $4 million and they had given her a $1.2 million advance. In September 1991, Collins delivered a 690-page manuscript of a novel entitled ''The Ruling Passion'' to Random House. However, the publishing firm deemed the manuscript to be of poor quality and demanded the return of the $1.2 million advance they had paid to Collins, claiming she had failed to deliver completed books as per her contract. Collins countersued, arguing that her contract required her only to submit a \"complete manuscript\" not an \"acceptable\" one. Since she had turned in two novels to the publishing company, ''A Ruling Passion'' in 1991 and a second novel, ''Hell Hath No Fury'', in 1992, as her contract stipulated, she felt Random House owed her the rest of the $4 million. She contended that Random House had not provided the editorial assistance she had expected.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984142,00.html Time Magazine \u2013 Damsel In Distress], Time.com, 19 February 1996.</ref>\n\nHer Random House contract, negotiated by agent [[Irving Paul Lazar|Irving Lazar]], required that she be paid even if her completed manuscripts were not published. When the case was finally heard in February 1996, a court determined that Collins could keep the advance given to her plus a further $1 million for the first completed manuscript, but that the publisher did not have to pay for the second manuscript, since it was essentially a reworking of the first.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/01/nyregion/joan-collins-to-get-additional-million.html?pagewanted=1 \"Joan Collins to get additional $1m\"], ''The New York Times'', 1 March 1996.</ref> Neither of the books was published.

She made her stage debut at the age of nine, trained at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London, entered British films in 1951 and went to Hollywood under contract to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1955. In 1981, she landed the role of [[Alexis Carrington]], the vengeful and scheming ex-wife of [[John Forsythe]]'s character, in the 1980s prime time [[soap opera]] ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', which made her an international superstar and brought her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]] in 1982.  In 2015, Collins was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] for services to charity.\n \n[[File:Joan Collins and Sophia Loren.jpg|thumb|right|Dame Joan Collins and [[Sophia Loren]]]]\n\n==Early life==\nCollins was born in [[Paddington]], [[London]], and brought up in [[Maida Vale]], the daughter of Elsa Collins (n\u00e9e Bessant, 1906\u20131962), a dance teacher, and Joseph William Collins (1902\u20131988), a talent agent<ref name=\"FilmRef bio\">[http://www.filmreference.com/film/65/Joan-Collins.html Joan Collins profile], FilmReference.com; retrieved 1 December 2008.</ref> whose clients would later include [[Shirley Bassey]], [[the Beatles]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB7C33EC6AB70D8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|work=Newsbank|date=2 April 1988|title=Joan Collins profile}}</ref> Her father, a native of South Africa, was [[Jew]]ish, and her British mother was [[Anglican]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/culture/interviews/my-father-warned-me-not-to-trust-showbiz-men-1.477915|title=Joan Collins: 'My father warned me not to trust showbiz men'|last=White|first=Francine|date=January 3, 2019|website=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]|access-date=January 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/arts/2007/09/20/bolor116.xml Joan Collins: low cunning and high drama], Telegraph.co.uk; accessed 28 December 2014.</ref><ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&p_theme=kc&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF3F1C6E5E94DE&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM \"Queen of Hollywood gossip mill Jackie Collins's novels grow out of the best dirt\"], nl.newsbank.com; accessed 28 December 2014.</ref><ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB718E537DBA35B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM \"Collins returns to an early love, the stage\"], Nl.newsbank.com; accessed 28 December 2014.</ref> She had two younger siblings, [[Jackie Collins|Jackie]] (1937\u20132015),<ref name=\"FilmRef bio\"/> a novelist, and Bill, a property agent.<ref name=\"Times15\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article4562805.ece|title=Jackie Collins|work=The Times|location=London|date=21 September 2015|accessdate=22 September 2015}} (subscription required)</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/books/novelist-jackie-collins-dies-breast-cancer-age-77-n430411|title=Best-Selling Novelist Jackie Collins Dies of Breast Cancer at Age 77|date=19 September 2015|accessdate=20 September 2015|agency=NBC News}}</ref> She was educated at the [[Francis Holland School]], an independent day school for girls in London.<ref name=tatler>[http://www.tatler.com/guides/schools-guide/2014/public/francis-holland-school-nw1 Francis Holland School, NW1 at Tatler Schools Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192025/http://www.tatler.com/guides/schools-guide/2014/public/francis-holland-school-nw1 |date=2 January 2014 }}, Tatler.com; retrieved 28 December 2014.</ref>\n\nShe made her stage debut in the [[Henrik Ibsen]] play ''[[A Doll's House]]'' at the age of nine, and at the age of sixteen trained as an actress at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London.

Her feature debut was as a beauty contestant in ''[[Lady Godiva Rides Again]]'' (1951) followed by ''[[The Woman's Angle]]'' (1952) in a minor role as a Greek maid. Next was a more significant role as a gangster's moll in ''[[Judgment Deferred]]'' (1952).\n\nHer big break came with a major, highly publicised role as a juvenile delinquent in ''[[I Believe in You (film)|I Believe in You]]'' (1952).  Her success in the part led to her initial stardom and the press nickname \"Britain's Bad Girl\".\n\nHer subsequent films whilst under contract to Rank included ''[[Decameron Nights]]'' (1953) with [[Joan Fontaine]]; England's first [[X rating|X certificate]] drama, ''[[Cosh Boy]]'' (1953), directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]]; ''[[Turn the Key Softly]]'' (1953), a drama about three women released from prison on the same day; and the boxing saga ''[[The Square Ring]]'' (1953).\n\nShe was top-billed in the desert island comedy ''[[Our Girl Friday]]'' (1953), then directed again by Lewis Gilbert in ''[[The Good Die Young]]'' (1954) with [[Laurence Harvey]] and [[Gloria Grahame]].\n\nBetween films, she appeared in several plays in London including ''[[The Seventh Veil]]'' (1952), ''Jassy'' (1952), ''[[Claudia and David]]'' (1954), and ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'' (1954), as well as a UK tour of ''The Praying Mantis'' (1953).\n\n===Land of the Pharaohs===\n\nIn 1954, Collins was chosen by American director [[Howard Hawks]] to star as the scheming Princess Nellifer in an first international production, ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]''. The lavish [[Warner Brothers]] historical epic was unsuccessful upon release but has been lauded by [[Martin Scorsese]] and French critics supporting the [[auteur theory]] for numerous elements of its physical production. [[Danny Peary]] in his book ''[[Cult Movies]]'' (1981), selected it as a [[cult classic]].<ref name=\"Peary1\">[[Danny Peary|Peary, Danny]]. ''[[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]]'', Delta Books, 1981. {{ISBN|0-517-20185-2}}</ref> The film's reputation continues to improve with the test of time.\n\nCollins' sultry performance so impressed [[20th Century Fox]] chief [[Darryl Zanuck]] that he signed the young star to a seven-year contract with the Hollywood studio.\n\n[[File:Joan Collins Farley Granger The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing.jpg|thumb|Joan Collins and [[Farley Granger]] for ''[[The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing]]'']]\n\n===Hollywood and 20th Century Fox===\nCollins made her Hollywood film debut in the lavish historical drama ''[[The Virgin Queen (1955 film)|The Virgin Queen]]'' (1955). The British newcomer was given equal billing with established stars [[Bette Davis]] and [[Richard Todd]]. The same year, Collins was cast in the starring role of [[Evelyn Nesbitt]] in ''[[The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing]]'' with [[Ray Milland]] and [[Farley Granger]]. The part had originally been intended for [[Marilyn Monroe]], however problems between Monroe and Fox led to Collins gaining the role.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048119/trivia | title = IMDb | contribution = Trivia}}</ref>\n\nMGM borrowed Collins for ''[[The Opposite Sex]]'' (1956), a musical remake of ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) in which she was cast as the gold digging Crystal, the role played by [[Joan Crawford]] in the original. She then starred as a young nun in ''[[Sea Wife]]'' (1956), top-billed over co-star [[Richard Burton]], followed by the all-star ''[[Island in the Sun (film)|Island in the Sun]]'' (1957), which was a major box-office success. The film earned $5,550,000 worldwide, and finished as the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1957.<ref>LINDSAY ANDERSON, and DAVID DENT. \"Time For New Ideas.\" Times [London, England] January 8, 1958: 9.

Next came the tense crime caper ''[[Seven Thieves]]'' (1960) opposite [[Edward G. Robinson]] and [[Rod Steiger]].\n\nIn 1960, Collins became increasingly disillusioned with 20th Century Fox when, having been the original choice to play the title role in ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', the part went instead to [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. Collins withdrew from the studio's production of ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'', and requested a release from her contract, however she agreed to star in one last film for Fox, top-billed again in the biblical epic ''[[Esther and the King]]'' (1960).\n\n===The 1960s===\nAs a freelance actress, Collins made only occasional films in the early 1960s, whilst raising her first two children (she had married the actor/singer [[Anthony Newley]] in 1963). \n \nIn 1961, she returned to London to star opposite [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Bob Hope]] in the last of that film duo's \"road\" pictures, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). Former \"road\" leading lady [[Dorothy Lamour]] was relegated to a guest appearance in the film. In Italy, Collins starred in ''[[Hard Time for Princes]]'' (1965); back in the US she played [[David Janssen]]'s wife in the detective thriller ''[[Warning Shot (1967 film)|Warning Shot]]'' (1967); in the UK she was the leading lady in the spy caper ''[[Subterfuge (1968 film)|Subterfuge]]'' (1968); and made a cameo appearance in the comedy ''[[If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium]]'' (1969).\n\nIn the US, Collins starred opposite her husband in Newley's autobiographical musical ''[[Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?]]'' (1969). Then came the female lead in the Italian drama ''{{Ill|L'amore breve|it}}'' (1969), ''[[The Executioner (1970 film)|The Executioner]]'' (1970), a thriller with George Peppard, and ''[[Up in the Cellar]]'' (1970), a quasisequel to ''[[Three in the Attic]]''.\n\n===Television===\nAlthough she had made several appearances on interview and game shows in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Collins began her television dramatic career with a guest role in ''[[The Human Jungle (TV series)|The Human Jungle]]'' in 1963. Her notable appearances on American television during the 1960s included playing the villainous Siren in ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[Run for Your Life (TV series)|Run For Your Life]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[The Man From U.N.C.L.E.]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''; in the latter, she played Edith Keeler in the episode [[The City on the Edge of Forever]], widely regarded by fans as one of the best episodes across all the Star Trek series, if not the best.\n\nIn the 1970s, Collins remained busy on television. She starred in the TV movies ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' (1972) with [[Orson Welles]] and [[Lee Remick]], and ''Drive Hard, Drive Fast'' (1973) opposite [[Brian Kelly (actor)|Brian Kelly]]. Her many guest appearances during the decade included ''[[The Persuaders!]]'' alongside [[Roger Moore]] and [[Tony Curtis]], ''Fallen Angels'' with [[Susannah York]], ''[[Space 1999]]'', ''[[Orson Welles Great Mysteries]]'', ''[[Police Woman]]'', ''[[The Moneychangers]]'' with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Christopher Plummer]], ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Switch (TV series)|Switch]]'', ''[[Future Cop (TV series)|Future Cop]]'', ''[[Ellery Queen]]'', ''[[The Fantastic Journey]]'', ''[[Baretta]]'' and three separate episodes of ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected|Tales of the Unexpected]]''.

Collins had signed a two-book deal with the company for $4 million and they had given her a $1.2 million advance. In September 1991, Collins delivered a 690-page manuscript of a novel entitled ''The Ruling Passion'' to Random House. However, the publishing firm deemed the manuscript to be of poor quality and demanded the return of the $1.2 million advance they had paid to Collins, claiming she had failed to deliver completed books as per her contract. Collins countersued, arguing that her contract required her only to submit a \"complete manuscript\" not an \"acceptable\" one. Since she had turned in two novels to the publishing company, ''A Ruling Passion'' in 1991 and a second novel, ''Hell Hath No Fury'', in 1992, as her contract stipulated, she felt Random House owed her the rest of the $4 million. She contended that Random House had not provided the editorial assistance she had expected.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984142,00.html Time Magazine \u2013 Damsel In Distress], Time.com, 19 February 1996.</ref>\n\nHer Random House contract, negotiated by agent [[Irving Paul Lazar|Irving Lazar]], required that she be paid even if her completed manuscripts were not published. When the case was finally heard in February 1996, a court determined that Collins could keep the advance given to her plus a further $1 million for the first completed manuscript, but that the publisher did not have to pay for the second manuscript, since it was essentially a reworking of the first.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/01/nyregion/joan-collins-to-get-additional-million.html?pagewanted=1 \"Joan Collins to get additional $1m\"], ''The New York Times'', 1 March 1996.</ref> Neither of the books was published. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' cites Collins as holding the record for retaining the world's largest unreturned payment for an unpublished manuscript.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Petersen|url=http://internetwritingworkshop.blogspot.com/2012/02/notes-for-february-29th-2012.html|title=This Day In Writing History|date=29 February 2012|website=The INTERNET WRITING WORKSHOP}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cas70.htm |title=Random House v.

{"title_page": "Harry Weinberg", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=March 2019}}\n{{COI|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Harry Weinberg''' (1908 \u2013 1990, aged 82) was an American billionaire businessman who founded ''The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, Inc.'', a private charitable foundation, with over $2 billion in assets in 2018 and headquartered in [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Owings Mills]], [[Maryland]] and [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The foundation is named for Mr. Weinberg and his wife of 58 years, Jeanette Gutman Weinberg (1909 \u2013 1989, aged 80).  \n\n==Beginnings== \nWeinberg was born on August 15, 1908, in the city of Sambor (now called \"Sambir\") , then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. His father Joseph Weinberg came to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] in the United States on November 17, 1911, on the S.S. Breslau. He sent for his family some months later, and his family (Sarah and their four children) arrived in August, 1912, on the S.S. K\u00f6ln. Sambor became part of Poland after World War I and then part of Ukraine after World War II.  \n\nHenry Weinberg was the second of seven children, born between 1906 and 1922, of Joseph and Sarah Weinberg (both born in 1881). The children's names, by order of birth, were Henry, Harry, Betty, William, David, Nathan, and Sidney. Two other children were born but died early, one in 1918 during that year's Influenza Epidemic. David, Nathan, and Sidney were born in the United States, and the other four were born in Sambor. The family lived in Southwest Baltimore City, on 2028 Eagle Street (about four years after arrival), and then a block away on Wilkens Avenue. Sarah Weinberg, a homemaker, died of cancer in 1935 at age 54. Joseph Weinberg, primarily a metal worker who operated a body-and-fender repair business, died of stroke in 1961 at age 80.\n\n== Early years in business ==\nWhen World War I ended in 1918, the ten-year-old Weinberg took advantage of the celebrations by selling small American flags on the street, until the celebrations died down. He either finished, or dropped out of, the sixth grade in a Baltimore public school. Thereafter, he worked in the body-and-fender business of his father, until as a teenager of 16-18, he emancipated himself and moved to Philadelphia to work for a tire retreading company (used tires), which he ultimately purchased from its owner. By 1928, he moved back to Baltimore to start his own used tire business there. At first, he sold used tires from the street, but quickly established credit and opened his Camden Tire Company in a storefront in the 400 block of West Camden Street in 1929. A bit later, he moved his business to a storefront at 211 South Paca Street, a better location. He learned the basic skills about running a retail business -- how to keep books, read a balance sheet, and maximize profits in limited square footage.  \n\nHis business was across the street from a saddlery, located at 501 West Pratt Street (corner of Paca and Pratt) owned by Morris and Herman Gutman, who befriended Weinberg. Weinberg met Morris Gutman's older daughter, Jeanette, and later married her on March 22, 1931, at a local Reform Jewish synagogue of which the Gutmans were members. Harry and Jeanette Weinberg had their only child, Morton Weinberg, in December 1933.  \n\nIn 1936, Weinberg sold his interest in Camden Tire Company to his brother, William (aka \"Willie\"). Harry already had begun to purchase real estate and stocks as investments. After the Great Depression began in late 1929, real estate and stocks could be purchased at relatively low prices. His first commercial property investment was on Hanover Street in Baltimore City. He continued to purchase commercial real estate in Baltimore, obtaining loans often from his father-in-law. Weinberg, his wife Jeanette, and baby Morton moved to 3110 Liberty Heights Avenue in Baltimore City. By the end of 1936, Weinberg's total annual real estate-related income was about $9,200 (inflation-adjusted to 2017, over $162,000), on assets of $63,700 (inflation-adjusted to 2017, over $1.1 million). In addition, he had additional assets in stock holdings.  \n\nIn 1938, he began to manifest philanthropic interest, when he pledged his own stock holdings to help sponsor several of his wife's relatives so they could emigrate from Germany to the United States and avoid Nazi persecution and the genocide of Jews and others that was soon to follow. When the United States declared war on Japan and Germany in late 1941, Weinberg already was 33. He was declared '4F' -- ineligible for service in the armed forces -- because of an inoperable hernia. However, the Weinberg family provided four men to serve in the United States military -- William (Navy), David (Army), Nathan (Army), and Sidney (Navy) -- and all four returned after the war uninjured.  \n\nIn 1939, Weinberg obtained ownership of the New Joyce Hotel, across from Camden Station in Baltimore. The hotel quickly became a popular stop for soldiers and support personnel moving between various military training camps on the Eastern Seaboard during the war. Weinberg hired his older brother, Henry Weinberg, to manage the hotel bar, which was bustling with activity during the war. Weinberg sold the hotel in the late 1950s (the hotel no longer exists, replaced by a portion of the parking lot serving Orioles Park at Camden Yards and the adjacent Hilton Hotel).    \n\nWeinberg's next major investment was to purchase a controlling interest in Baltimore Brickyards (\"BB\"), a local publicly held corporation that owned numerous small brick manufacturers and vacant land in Baltimore. This purchase came about after BB refused to consider his offer to purchase just one abandoned brickyard owned by BB. An acquaintance of his who owned stock in BB confided to Weinberg that the family that dominated the BB board of directors had told the other directors that the company should not sell to a Jew. Outraged, Weinberg commenced a highly motivated and detailed study of the company. That study revealed that BB was asset-rich but earnings-poor, and was a prime takeover target. The company's books listed its various property-holding values at book value (original cost of the land), but not at the much higher current market value; the books made the company appear to be worth less than market value. Yet, BB's publicly traded stock was severely depressed and could be purchased on the open market for below $1 per share. He quietly began to buy as many outstanding shares of BB as possible. After he obtained a 40 % ownership interest by purchasing all the outstanding shares available on the public market, he purchased another 10+ % of the outstanding shares of BB (at double the then-current market price) from a local financial institution that held those shares in trust accounts for some of its clients. Weinberg now had ownership of a majority of BB's stock. When promptly thereafter, he entered BB's offices and announced his intention to take over operating control of the firm, a buy-out of Weinberg's stock interest was negotiated by BB's directors; BB transferred to him the parcel he originally wanted, plus many other land parcels in exchange for his stock. He resisted anti-semitism and made a profit doing so.  \n\n== Transit empire ==\nAt various points in his business career in the 1950s and 1960s, Weinberg owned controlling interests in four mass-transit bus companies -- Scranton, Pennsylvania; Honolulu, Hawaii; Dallas, Texas; and New York City. In the first three cities, Weinberg ensured that the bus companies' extensive holdings of real estate unrelated to their transit operations were spun-off into separate corporations not subject to public utility regulations. When later each company's bus operations were purchased by its city through actual or threatened eminent domain proceedings, Weinberg, at least, retained ownership of the unrelated real estate. To tell the full story would take volumes, so provided here is only a relatively superficial summary of his transit holdings.  \n\nHe was introduced to the mass-transit world in 1948, when the Baltimore Transit Company (\"'''BTC'''\") sold inexpensive ''second''-mortgage bonds backed by BTC's real estate and other assets. Once again, he saw that the difference between those assets' \"book value\" (original cost) and their current fair market value presented him with an arbitrage opportunity to earn a substantial return. Knowing that BTC's real estate was worth far more than reported on BTC financial statements, Weinberg was confident in the repayment of the bonds.    \n\nHis faith in real estate paid off when BTC returned to solvency, paying off much of its debt through the sale of some of BTC's valuable real estate not needed for its transit operations. Weinberg earned a large profit when the second-mortgage bonds were repaid to him. In the process, he learned a wealth of knowledge about the operations of mass transit bus companies and their \"hidden\" real estate assets.    \n\n=== Scranton Transit Company (\"STC\") ===\nIn 1953, Weinberg began investing in the Scranton Transit Company, starting with its bonds. Weinberg researched STC's financial situation and discovered that the market value of STC's real estate and other assets was substantial, notwithstanding low book values. He slowly and steadily purchased more and more of the STC bonds, typically at bargain prices, from the various bondholders. By 1954, now owning a large share of STC's debt, he joined STC's board of directors, which resisted his efforts to reform the company's operations for the benefit of its investors. A transit strike by the unionized employees of STC crippled the company and hurt Scrantonians reliant on bus service. STC missed two straight bond interest payments. Weinberg, as the principal bondholder, forced STC into Pennsylvania state court receivership. Bondholders had first priority over other investors. The state court awarded him control of the reorganization of STC. Weinberg took over control of the company, and through a series of prudent business moves -- including cutting inefficient service, working with the union to keep wages steady, and the like -- brought the company back to financial health. The company returned to private management out of receivership, with Weinberg installed as chief executive officer and chairman of the reborn STC.  \n\nWeinberg made other investments while working on the STC matter; he invested in real estate and the stocks of other companies. He began buying small businesses in the Scranton area. He created diverse holding companies to manage his various properties. One of these holding companies was Scranton Corporation, which, among other things, operated the Scranton Lace Company (''e.g.,'' transparent rubber-coated lace tablecloths) and held controlling interests in the Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, the Mutual Broadcasting System, and Storm Vulcan (a metal-stamping manufacturer) in Dallas, Texas. Weinberg eventually made Scranton one of his three hometowns, at least for eight years (Baltimore and Hawaii being the others), renting a large apartment there.  \n\nIn the latter 1960s, Weinberg sold STC to the City of Scranton, but Weinberg companies retained ownership of former STC real estate holdings, unrelated to transit needs, that had been spun off into separate companies.\n\n===Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (\"HRT\") ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Weinberg quietly began to purchase shares of HRT stock through a local friend. By 1958, he had acquired about ten percent of the outstanding shares of the company and was its largest single shareholder. Most of HRT's assets were in real estate holdings. HRT's financial statements listed only the various properties' book values (original cost), and many of those book values reflected the much lower costs of the 1890s. All non-transportation-related real estate was owned by HRT's wholly owned subsidiary, '''Honolulu Limited''', created in 1954, which became HRT's investment company in 1959.        \n\nAfter a hard-fought battle to obtain a seat on HRT's board of directors, and his purchase of even more of HRT's stock, a Weinberg proxy (the same friend) was elected to the HRT board in 1957. By the end of 1958, Weinberg owned nearly 35 % of HRT's stock. In February, 1959, Weinberg obtained a seat on the board of land-rich Honolulu Limited. By July, 1959, Weinberg also won a board seat on HRT -- the \"parent\" bus company. He gained influence on the Honolulu Limited board as a result of astute business recommendations that were followed by that board. Honolulu Limited, at Weinberg's urging, used some available corporate cash to purchase a 32 % interest in the Dallas Transit Company, a bus company of which Weinberg also had been buying stock separately. Also, at Weinberg's recommendation, HRT's assets were reduced to those reasonably necessary to operate the public bus business and public bus routes, and most other assets unrelated to that purpose were transferred to Honolulu Limited for investment purposes.        \n\nIn March, 1960, Weinberg was elected Chairman of the Boards of HRT and Honolulu Limited. As board members retired or rotated off these boards, Weinberg's associates joined these boards. By March, 1961, Weinberg owned 60 % of HRT stock and eventually would own 95 % of the stock. By the end of his complete takeover of these corporations, he earned the moniker \"Honolulu Harry,\" in the press. It was a moniker by which he would be known by some for the rest of his life.            \n\nEventually, the HRT bus business was purchased by the City & County of Honolulu. As in Scranton, Weinberg and his companies retained ownership of Honolulu Limited and its properties. In addition, Weinberg and his companies independently had been purchasing real estate (mostly commercial) in Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island of Hawaii, and this process continued throughout Weinberg's life.          \n\n===Dallas Transit Company (\"DTC\") ===\nWeinberg's move into Dallas was very similar in principle to that in Hawaii. The combination of Honolulu Limited's and his own ownership of DTC stock amounted to about 44 % of DTC's outstanding common stock. In January, 1960, Weinberg was elected Chairman of the Board of DTC. He relocated three of his brothers -- Nathan, David, and Sidney to Dallas to become full-time executive employees and officers of the company. Soon thereafter, Nathan became president and chief operating officer, David became corporate treasurer, and Sidney became corporate secretary. DTC created a wholly owned subsidiary, Dal-Trans Service Co. (\"'''Dal-Tran'''\"), that was free from regulation by the Dallas Public Utility Commission (\"'''PUC'''\"). DTC began gradually transferring all non-utility assets of DTC into Dal-Tran.  \n\nHe found other inefficiencies in the operation of DTC, most notably that in the pre-Weinberg era, many of DTC's non-union employees had procured their jobs as political favors. These non-productive political types were fired. DTC ordered service reductions on many unprofitable lines, comprising about seven percent of the system's bus mileage. To avoid union strikes in June 1960 over demand for higher wages, he negotiated with union leaders by tying wage hikes to fare increases; if the city would grant the fare increase, then the employees would get a wage increase. When the PUC denied the fare increase request, he avoided a strike by offering smaller but temporary wage increases. By this point, Weinberg controlled 78 % of DTC stock.  \n\nDuring the period of Weinberg's control of DTC, the bus company hired African-American bus drivers for the first time ever in Dallas. This decision, announced by Nathan Weinberg, DTC President, in May 1963 was the subject of front-page news articles, editorial comments, and letters-to-the-editor, largely derogatory. As the ridership was heavily black, Harry and his brothers felt that diversity among the drivers should be a given.  \n\nBy 1964, however, the City of Dallas came to the conclusion that it was impracticable for a private company to operate the mass transit bus lines in the city. This conclusion was typical of those of other cities in the U.S.; to make the buses serve all the people, they would have to be subsidized heavily and managed by the municipality. By the Fall of 1964, the City of Dallas purchased DTC for $5.5 million. DTC was represented by Robert Strauss, later to become a major national figure in law and politics (including chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the Jimmy Carter years). He continued to control Dal-Tran.   \n\n===New York City's Fifth Avenue Coach Company (\"FACC\") ===\nBy the Spring of 1961, Weinberg also held ''non''-controlling interests in transit operations in Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee; Richmond and Roanoke, Virginia; Akron, Ohio; Springfield, Illinois; and Baltimore, Maryland. But the biggest system was in New York City, and Fifth Avenue Coach Company was the largest privately held mass transit bus company in the nation. FACC also had highly valuable real estate assets, most of which were not necessary to the bus operation, and the FACC financial statements listed the properties' value based on \"book value\" -- the original cost of the properties -- not their very substantial fair market value. Weinberg started to purchase shares in the stock of FACC perhaps as early as 1956, but the Dal-Tran purchases of FACC stock brought Weinberg's share of FACC to about 25 % by May 1961; he (including companies he controlled) was the largest single stockholder. On February 14, 1962, with FACC suffering financial stresses and outright deficits from a variety of sources, Weinberg was granted five of the fifteen FACC board seats and was elected Chairman of the Board.                                                                                  \n\nWeinberg set out to restore FACC to financial health. His plan was to obtain a basic fare increase and to reinstate the five-cent transfer (which had been eliminated before he took control), as the company was running a large operational deficit. New York Mayor, Robert Wagner, however resisted with all his might. In addition, the transit workers union called an illegal strike in March 1962 (illegal, as a one-year contract had been entered into in January with the previous management). In New York, unlike in Scranton, Honolulu, and Dallas, New York residents had viable alternatives to buses -- the subway and walking -- and they started using the alternatives. FACC announced plans to eliminate \"all unprofitable night and Sunday service and lay off 1,500 workers,\" although far fewer actually were affected. The union resisted, and the buses remained out of service.                                                                                  \n\nMayor Wagner quickly persuaded Governor Nelson Rockefeller to get a bill passed in the State legislature to begin condemnation proceedings to take over the facilities and operations of FACC. The bill was passed and was signed by Rockefeller on March 22, 1962. Mayor Wagner had the New York Transit Authority operate the FACC lines. Thereafter, an arbitration proceeding determined the amount of compensation shareholders, including Weinberg and his companies, would receive for the taking. Weinberg did not end up with ownership of any New York real estate, as there had not been enough time (only a month of control) to spin off the non-utility real estate into a separate company. Thereafter, Weinberg had no further investments in New York businesses, other than using New York stockbrokers for his securities purchases and sales.                                                                                  \n\n== Real estate empire ==\nBy the time of his passing in late 1990, Weinberg and his companies owned huge real estate holdings in the State of Hawaii, with lesser holdings in Baltimore, Maryland; Dallas, Texas; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Dyersburg, Tennessee; and a sprinkling of small holdings in some other states. By then, he was the largest individual landowner in Hawaii. He undertook an intense study of the major landowning companies in Hawaii and discovered what he already suspected -- that the true value of their real estate holdings was multiples higher than the 19th Century book values reported in their financial statements. He steadily purchased publicly traded stock in these companies, hoping to eventually earn a seat on their respective boards and push their business strategies toward a more profit-conscious goal beneficial to shareholders. A recitation of details here would be voluminous and so will be avoided. Suffice it to say that these companies included American Factors (AmFac), Dillingham Corporation, Maui Land & Pineapple, and Alexander & Baldwin (A&B). In each case, he would acquire substantial stock holdings; the incumbent board would resist (ultimately unsuccessfully) his efforts to gain board seats; he would argue at board and shareholder meetings for a more profit-aggressive, shareholder-friendly business strategy that would require sale or development of raw land (thus, realizing market value); and the companies would trade some of their real estate holdings to Weinberg in exchange for his stock holdings (with a contractual promise from him not to purchase their stock for a few years).  One could call this process \"greenmail\" (a benign takeoff on a similar phrase with a different color and a negative denotation). In the process, Weinberg came to own massive amounts of real estate in Hawaii. He held a non-controlling 39 % stock interest in ''Maui Land & Pineapple'' at the time of his death.\n\n== Other holdings ==\nAlthough he owned real estate worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the majority of Weinberg's assets was in securities. He was a highly focused securities investor who made his own decisions. Wherever he happened to be at the moment -- including Hawaii, which was in a time zone 5-6 hours earlier than that of the East Coast -- he would call his stockbroker each weekday morning at 9:00 Eastern Time to give him orders to buy and/or sell. He enjoyed reading financial statements and other materials about publicly traded companies, and had a knack for figuring out the hidden value in each. In many cases, that hidden value was real estate. In addition, he owned a few metal stamping factories -- in Dallas, Texas; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Dyersburg, Tennessee. Each of these factory operations was sold within five years of his death.\n\n== Personal life ==\nWeinberg married Jeanette Gutman on March 22, 1931. They were both Jewish, attending a Reform Jewish synagogue from time-to-time. Jeanette died in August 1989 at age 80. They were married for 58 years. They had one child, Morton Weinberg, born in December 1933, who died of cancer and complications therefrom in October 2012 at age 79. Morton and his first wife, Joanie (married 1962), had four children \u2013 a girl and three boys. In order of birth, the grandchildren are Catherine, George, John, and Peter. Catherine has two children, Anthony and Chad. Harry and Jeanette had many nieces and nephews.\n\nHarry and Jeanette Weinberg had homes, at various times, in Baltimore, Scranton, and on two Hawaiian islands (Oahu and Kauai). Mr. Weinberg had no hobbies, although he did enjoy watching westerns on television in his free time and loved looking out at the beauty of Hawaii. His political orientation was moderate overall; he was not committed to any party and generally voted for the candidates he thought would be best for the economy and the country. \n\nWeinberg developed multiple myeloma in the early 1980s, and although he was in remission after cancer treatment, he required regular blood transfusions for the remainder of his life. Weinberg died on November 4, 1990, in Honolulu, Hawaii, at the age of 82. He and his wife are buried in Baltimore, Maryland, at the same cemetery as are his parents and Jeanette's Gutman's parents. Other than a modest bequest to his four grandchildren, he left all his assets to charity. Everything except for his non-controlling 39 % stock interest in ''Maui Land & Pineapple'' was added to the assets in his foundation (see below). The stock interest in ''Maui Land & Pineapple'' was left to ''The Harry Weinberg Family Foundation'', a support foundation of ''The Associated: Jewish Community Foundation of Baltimore'', which uses distributions primarily to assist the lower-income Jewish individuals in the Baltimore area. That stock interest later was sold by ''The Harry Weinberg Family Foundation'' to Steve Case, AOL founder (or a corporate entity controlled by him).  \n\n== The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation ==\nThe Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, Inc. was created on June 8, 1959, as a Maryland nonprofit private foundation. At some point after its creation, Weinberg decided to dedicate his fortune to his foundation. The best source for information about the Weinberg Foundation is its website: [http://www.weinbergfoundation.org www.weinbergfoundation.org]. In general, the Weinberg Foundation makes grants ''to public charities'' that provide direct services to people in the lower half of the economic spectrum, especially poor individuals. Grants in 2018 are made primarily to charities in the U.S. and Israel. Both Jewish and non-Jewish individuals benefit from the grants made to the various charities by the foundation. The foundation is managed by a five-member Board of Trustees, a non-Trustee President-CEO, and a support staff in Baltimore and Honolulu.                                                                                      \n* \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weinberg, Harry}}\n[[Category:Foundations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1959]]\n[[Category:Jewish American philanthropists]]\n[[Category:American real estate businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Deaths from multiple myeloma]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=March 2019}}\n{{COI|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Harry Weinberg''' (1908 \u2013 1990, aged 82) was an American billionaire businessman who founded ''The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, Inc.'', a private charitable foundation, with over $2 billion in assets in 2018 and headquartered in [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Owings Mills]], [[Maryland]] and [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The foundation is named for Mr. Weinberg and his wife of 58 years, Jeanette Gutman Weinberg (1909 \u2013 1989, aged 80).  \n\n==Beginnings== \nWeinberg was born on August 15, 1908, in the city of Sambor (now called \"Sambir\") , then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. His father Joseph Weinberg came to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] in the United States on November 17, 1911, on the S.S. Breslau. He sent for his family some months later, and his family (Sarah and their four children) arrived in August, 1912, on the S.S. K\u00f6ln. Sambor became part of Poland after World War I and then part of Ukraine after World War II.  \n\nWeinberg was the second of seven children, born between 1906 and 1922, of Joseph and Sarah Weinberg (both born in 1881). The children's names, by order of birth, were Henry, Harry, Betty, William, David, Nathan, and Sidney. Two other children were born but died early, one in 1918 during that year's Influenza Epidemic. David, Nathan, and Sidney were born in the United States, and the other four were born in Sambor. The family lived in Southwest Baltimore City, on 2028 Eagle Street (about four years after arrival), and then a block away on Wilkens Avenue. Sarah Weinberg, a homemaker, died of cancer in 1935 at age 54. Joseph Weinberg, primarily a metal worker who operated a body-and-fender repair business, died of stroke in 1961 at age 80.\n\n== Early years in business ==\nWhen World War I ended in 1918, the ten-year-old Weinberg took advantage of the celebrations by selling small American flags on the street, until the celebrations died down. He either finished, or dropped out of, the sixth grade in a Baltimore public school. Thereafter, he worked in the body-and-fender business of his father, until as a teenager of 16-18, he emancipated himself and moved to Philadelphia to work for a tire retreading company (used tires), which he ultimately purchased from its owner. By 1928, he moved back to Baltimore to start his own used tire business there. At first, he sold used tires from the street, but quickly established credit and opened his Camden Tire Company in a storefront in the 400 block of West Camden Street in 1929. A bit later, he moved his business to a storefront at 211 South Paca Street, a better location. He learned the basic skills about running a retail business -- how to keep books, read a balance sheet, and maximize profits in limited square footage.  \n\nHis business was across the street from a saddlery, located at 501 West Pratt Street (corner of Paca and Pratt) owned by Morris and Herman Gutman, who befriended Weinberg. Weinberg met Morris Gutman's older daughter, Jeanette, and later married her on March 22, 1931, at a local Reform Jewish synagogue of which the Gutmans were members. Harry and Jeanette Weinberg had their only child, Morton Weinberg, in December 1933.  \n\nIn 1936, Weinberg sold his interest in Camden Tire Company to his brother, William (aka \"Willie\"). Harry already had begun to purchase real estate and stocks as investments. After the Great Depression began in late 1929, real estate and stocks could be purchased at relatively low prices. His first commercial property investment was on Hanover Street in Baltimore City. He continued to purchase commercial real estate in Baltimore, obtaining loans often from his father-in-law. Weinberg, his wife Jeanette, and baby Morton moved to 3110 Liberty Heights Avenue in Baltimore City. By the end of 1936, Weinberg's total annual real estate-related income was about $9,200 (inflation-adjusted to 2017, over $162,000), on assets of $63,700 (inflation-adjusted to 2017, over $1.1 million). In addition, he had additional assets in stock holdings.  \n\nIn 1938, he began to manifest philanthropic interest, when he pledged his own stock holdings to help sponsor several of his wife's relatives so they could emigrate from Germany to the United States and avoid Nazi persecution and the genocide of Jews and others that was soon to follow. When the United States declared war on Japan and Germany in late 1941, Weinberg already was 33. He was declared '4F' -- ineligible for service in the armed forces -- because of an inoperable hernia. However, the Weinberg family provided four men to serve in the United States military -- William (Navy), David (Army), Nathan (Army), and Sidney (Navy) -- and all four returned after the war uninjured.  \n\nIn 1939, Weinberg obtained ownership of the New Joyce Hotel, across from Camden Station in Baltimore. The hotel quickly became a popular stop for soldiers and support personnel moving between various military training camps on the Eastern Seaboard during the war. Weinberg hired his older brother, Henry Weinberg, to manage the hotel bar, which was bustling with activity during the war. Weinberg sold the hotel in the late 1950s (the hotel no longer exists, replaced by a portion of the parking lot serving Orioles Park at Camden Yards and the adjacent Hilton Hotel).    \n\nWeinberg's next major investment was to purchase a controlling interest in Baltimore Brickyards (\"BB\"), a local publicly held corporation that owned numerous small brick manufacturers and vacant land in Baltimore. This purchase came about after BB refused to consider his offer to purchase just one abandoned brickyard owned by BB. An acquaintance of his who owned stock in BB confided to Weinberg that the family that dominated the BB board of directors had told the other directors that the company should not sell to a Jew. Outraged, Weinberg commenced a highly motivated and detailed study of the company. That study revealed that BB was asset-rich but earnings-poor, and was a prime takeover target. The company's books listed its various property-holding values at book value (original cost of the land), but not at the much higher current market value; the books made the company appear to be worth less than market value. Yet, BB's publicly traded stock was severely depressed and could be purchased on the open market for below $1 per share. He quietly began to buy as many outstanding shares of BB as possible. After he obtained a 40 % ownership interest by purchasing all the outstanding shares available on the public market, he purchased another 10+ % of the outstanding shares of BB (at double the then-current market price) from a local financial institution that held those shares in trust accounts for some of its clients. Weinberg now had ownership of a majority of BB's stock. When promptly thereafter, he entered BB's offices and announced his intention to take over operating control of the firm, a buy-out of Weinberg's stock interest was negotiated by BB's directors; BB transferred to him the parcel he originally wanted, plus many other land parcels in exchange for his stock. He resisted anti-semitism and made a profit doing so.  \n\n== Transit empire ==\nAt various points in his business career in the 1950s and 1960s, Weinberg owned controlling interests in four mass-transit bus companies -- Scranton, Pennsylvania; Honolulu, Hawaii; Dallas, Texas; and New York City. In the first three cities, Weinberg ensured that the bus companies' extensive holdings of real estate unrelated to their transit operations were spun-off into separate corporations not subject to public utility regulations. When later each company's bus operations were purchased by its city through actual or threatened eminent domain proceedings, Weinberg, at least, retained ownership of the unrelated real estate. To tell the full story would take volumes, so provided here is only a relatively superficial summary of his transit holdings.  \n\nHe was introduced to the mass-transit world in 1948, when the Baltimore Transit Company (\"'''BTC'''\") sold inexpensive ''second''-mortgage bonds backed by BTC's real estate and other assets. Once again, he saw that the difference between those assets' \"book value\" (original cost) and their current fair market value presented him with an arbitrage opportunity to earn a substantial return. Knowing that BTC's real estate was worth far more than reported on BTC financial statements, Weinberg was confident in the repayment of the bonds.    \n\nHis faith in real estate paid off when BTC returned to solvency, paying off much of its debt through the sale of some of BTC's valuable real estate not needed for its transit operations. Weinberg earned a large profit when the second-mortgage bonds were repaid to him. In the process, he learned a wealth of knowledge about the operations of mass transit bus companies and their \"hidden\" real estate assets.    \n\n=== Scranton Transit Company (\"STC\") ===\nIn 1953, Weinberg began investing in the Scranton Transit Company, starting with its bonds. Weinberg researched STC's financial situation and discovered that the market value of STC's real estate and other assets was substantial, notwithstanding low book values. He slowly and steadily purchased more and more of the STC bonds, typically at bargain prices, from the various bondholders. By 1954, now owning a large share of STC's debt, he joined STC's board of directors, which resisted his efforts to reform the company's operations for the benefit of its investors. A transit strike by the unionized employees of STC crippled the company and hurt Scrantonians reliant on bus service. STC missed two straight bond interest payments. Weinberg, as the principal bondholder, forced STC into Pennsylvania state court receivership. Bondholders had first priority over other investors. The state court awarded him control of the reorganization of STC. Weinberg took over control of the company, and through a series of prudent business moves -- including cutting inefficient service, working with the union to keep wages steady, and the like -- brought the company back to financial health. The company returned to private management out of receivership, with Weinberg installed as chief executive officer and chairman of the reborn STC.  \n\nWeinberg made other investments while working on the STC matter; he invested in real estate and the stocks of other companies. He began buying small businesses in the Scranton area. He created diverse holding companies to manage his various properties. One of these holding companies was Scranton Corporation, which, among other things, operated the Scranton Lace Company (''e.g.,'' transparent rubber-coated lace tablecloths) and held controlling interests in the Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, the Mutual Broadcasting System, and Storm Vulcan (a metal-stamping manufacturer) in Dallas, Texas. Weinberg eventually made Scranton one of his three hometowns, at least for eight years (Baltimore and Hawaii being the others), renting a large apartment there.  \n\nIn the latter 1960s, Weinberg sold STC to the City of Scranton, but Weinberg companies retained ownership of former STC real estate holdings, unrelated to transit needs, that had been spun off into separate companies.\n\n===Honolulu Rapid Transit Company (\"HRT\") ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Weinberg quietly began to purchase shares of HRT stock through a local friend. By 1958, he had acquired about ten percent of the outstanding shares of the company and was its largest single shareholder. Most of HRT's assets were in real estate holdings. HRT's financial statements listed only the various properties' book values (original cost), and many of those book values reflected the much lower costs of the 1890s. All non-transportation-related real estate was owned by HRT's wholly owned subsidiary, '''Honolulu Limited''', created in 1954, which became HRT's investment company in 1959.        \n\nAfter a hard-fought battle to obtain a seat on HRT's board of directors, and his purchase of even more of HRT's stock, a Weinberg proxy (the same friend) was elected to the HRT board in 1957. By the end of 1958, Weinberg owned nearly 35 % of HRT's stock. In February, 1959, Weinberg obtained a seat on the board of land-rich Honolulu Limited. By July, 1959, Weinberg also won a board seat on HRT -- the \"parent\" bus company. He gained influence on the Honolulu Limited board as a result of astute business recommendations that were followed by that board. Honolulu Limited, at Weinberg's urging, used some available corporate cash to purchase a 32 % interest in the Dallas Transit Company, a bus company of which Weinberg also had been buying stock separately. Also, at Weinberg's recommendation, HRT's assets were reduced to those reasonably necessary to operate the public bus business and public bus routes, and most other assets unrelated to that purpose were transferred to Honolulu Limited for investment purposes.        \n\nIn March, 1960, Weinberg was elected Chairman of the Boards of HRT and Honolulu Limited. As board members retired or rotated off these boards, Weinberg's associates joined these boards. By March, 1961, Weinberg owned 60 % of HRT stock and eventually would own 95 % of the stock. By the end of his complete takeover of these corporations, he earned the moniker \"Honolulu Harry,\" in the press. It was a moniker by which he would be known by some for the rest of his life.            \n\nEventually, the HRT bus business was purchased by the City & County of Honolulu. As in Scranton, Weinberg and his companies retained ownership of Honolulu Limited and its properties. In addition, Weinberg and his companies independently had been purchasing real estate (mostly commercial) in Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island of Hawaii, and this process continued throughout Weinberg's life.          \n\n===Dallas Transit Company (\"DTC\") ===\nWeinberg's move into Dallas was very similar in principle to that in Hawaii. The combination of Honolulu Limited's and his own ownership of DTC stock amounted to about 44 % of DTC's outstanding common stock. In January, 1960, Weinberg was elected Chairman of the Board of DTC. He relocated three of his brothers -- Nathan, David, and Sidney to Dallas to become full-time executive employees and officers of the company. Soon thereafter, Nathan became president and chief operating officer, David became corporate treasurer, and Sidney became corporate secretary. DTC created a wholly owned subsidiary, Dal-Trans Service Co. (\"'''Dal-Tran'''\"), that was free from regulation by the Dallas Public Utility Commission (\"'''PUC'''\"). DTC began gradually transferring all non-utility assets of DTC into Dal-Tran.  \n\nHe found other inefficiencies in the operation of DTC, most notably that in the pre-Weinberg era, many of DTC's non-union employees had procured their jobs as political favors. These non-productive political types were fired. DTC ordered service reductions on many unprofitable lines, comprising about seven percent of the system's bus mileage. To avoid union strikes in June 1960 over demand for higher wages, he negotiated with union leaders by tying wage hikes to fare increases; if the city would grant the fare increase, then the employees would get a wage increase. When the PUC denied the fare increase request, he avoided a strike by offering smaller but temporary wage increases. By this point, Weinberg controlled 78 % of DTC stock.  \n\nDuring the period of Weinberg's control of DTC, the bus company hired African-American bus drivers for the first time ever in Dallas. This decision, announced by Nathan Weinberg, DTC President, in May 1963 was the subject of front-page news articles, editorial comments, and letters-to-the-editor, largely derogatory. As the ridership was heavily black, Harry and his brothers felt that diversity among the drivers should be a given.  \n\nBy 1964, however, the City of Dallas came to the conclusion that it was impracticable for a private company to operate the mass transit bus lines in the city. This conclusion was typical of those of other cities in the U.S.; to make the buses serve all the people, they would have to be subsidized heavily and managed by the municipality. By the Fall of 1964, the City of Dallas purchased DTC for $5.5 million. DTC was represented by Robert Strauss, later to become a major national figure in law and politics (including chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the Jimmy Carter years). He continued to control Dal-Tran.   \n\n===New York City's Fifth Avenue Coach Company (\"FACC\") ===\nBy the Spring of 1961, Weinberg also held ''non''-controlling interests in transit operations in Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee; Richmond and Roanoke, Virginia; Akron, Ohio; Springfield, Illinois; and Baltimore, Maryland. But the biggest system was in New York City, and Fifth Avenue Coach Company was the largest privately held mass transit bus company in the nation. FACC also had highly valuable real estate assets, most of which were not necessary to the bus operation, and the FACC financial statements listed the properties' value based on \"book value\" -- the original cost of the properties -- not their very substantial fair market value. Weinberg started to purchase shares in the stock of FACC perhaps as early as 1956, but the Dal-Tran purchases of FACC stock brought Weinberg's share of FACC to about 25 % by May 1961; he (including companies he controlled) was the largest single stockholder. On February 14, 1962, with FACC suffering financial stresses and outright deficits from a variety of sources, Weinberg was granted five of the fifteen FACC board seats and was elected Chairman of the Board.                                                                                  \n\nWeinberg set out to restore FACC to financial health. His plan was to obtain a basic fare increase and to reinstate the five-cent transfer (which had been eliminated before he took control), as the company was running a large operational deficit. New York Mayor, Robert Wagner, however resisted with all his might. In addition, the transit workers union called an illegal strike in March 1962 (illegal, as a one-year contract had been entered into in January with the previous management). In New York, unlike in Scranton, Honolulu, and Dallas, New York residents had viable alternatives to buses -- the subway and walking -- and they started using the alternatives. FACC announced plans to eliminate \"all unprofitable night and Sunday service and lay off 1,500 workers,\" although far fewer actually were affected. The union resisted, and the buses remained out of service.                                                                                  \n\nMayor Wagner quickly persuaded Governor Nelson Rockefeller to get a bill passed in the State legislature to begin condemnation proceedings to take over the facilities and operations of FACC. The bill was passed and was signed by Rockefeller on March 22, 1962. Mayor Wagner had the New York Transit Authority operate the FACC lines. Thereafter, an arbitration proceeding determined the amount of compensation shareholders, including Weinberg and his companies, would receive for the taking. Weinberg did not end up with ownership of any New York real estate, as there had not been enough time (only a month of control) to spin off the non-utility real estate into a separate company. Thereafter, Weinberg had no further investments in New York businesses, other than using New York stockbrokers for his securities purchases and sales.                                                                                  \n\n== Real estate empire ==\nBy the time of his passing in late 1990, Weinberg and his companies owned huge real estate holdings in the State of Hawaii, with lesser holdings in Baltimore, Maryland; Dallas, Texas; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Dyersburg, Tennessee; and a sprinkling of small holdings in some other states.

Mr. Weinberg had no hobbies, although he did enjoy watching westerns on television in his free time and loved looking out at the beauty of Hawaii. His political orientation was moderate overall; he was not committed to any party and generally voted for the candidates he thought would be best for the economy and the country. \n\nWeinberg developed multiple myeloma in the early 1980s, and although he was in remission after cancer treatment, he required regular blood transfusions for the remainder of his life. Weinberg died on November 4, 1990, in Honolulu, Hawaii, at the age of 82. He and his wife are buried in Baltimore, Maryland, at the same cemetery as are his parents and Jeanette's Gutman's parents.

The foundation is managed by a five-member Board of Trustees, a non-Trustee President-CEO, and a support staff in Baltimore and Honolulu.                                                                                      \n* \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weinberg, Harry}}\n[[Category:Foundations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1959]]\n[[Category:Jewish American philanthropists]]\n[[Category:American real estate businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Deaths from multiple myeloma]]\n", "name_user": "Gschadow", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBeginnings:disambiguating Henry from his siblings.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Weinberg"}

The console features a dull green [[Dot-matrix display|dot-matrix screen]] with adjustable contrast dial, five control buttons (a [[d-pad|directional pad]], two game buttons, and \"start\" and \"select\"), a single speaker with adjustable volume dial, and, like its rivals, uses [[Game cartridge|cartridges]] as physical media for games. The color scheme is made from two tones of grey with accents of black, blue, and dark [[magenta]]. All the corners of the portrait-oriented rectangular unit are softly rounded, save for the bottom right, which is curved. At launch, it was sold either as a standalone unit, or [[Pack-in game|bundled]] with one of several games, namely ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' or ''[[Tetris (Game Boy video game)|Tetris]]''. Several accessories were also developed, including a carrying pouch and printer.\n\nDespite being technologically inferior to its [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|fourth-generation]] competitors ([[Sega]]'s [[Game Gear]], [[Atari]]'s [[Atari Lynx|Lynx]], and [[NEC]]'s [[TurboExpress]]), the Game Boy received praise for its [[battery life]] and durability in its construction.

Green is fairly scarce but blue and white are the rarest. Blue was a Europe and Japan only release, white was a Japanese majority release with UK Toys R Us stores also getting it as an exclusive edition to them. The white remains the rarest of all the Play it Loud colors. A rare, limited edition [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] Game Boy is red, with the logos of the team emblazoned on it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} It was released simultaneously with the Play it Loud! handhelds in the United Kingdom. The Play It Loud's screens also have a darker border than the normal Game Boy.\n\n=== Game Boy Pocket ===\n[[File:Game-Boy-Pocket-FL.jpg|thumb|Game Boy Pocket, first release|left|200x200px]]\nOn July 21, 1996, Nintendo released the Game Boy Pocket for US$69.99:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://christmas.musetechnical.com/ShowCatalogPage/1998-Sears-Christmas-Book/161|title=1998 Sears Christmas Book, Page 161 - Christmas Catalogs & Holiday Wishbooks|website=christmas.musetechnical.com|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> a smaller, lighter unit that required fewer batteries.

The Pocket has a smaller link port, which requires an adapter to link with the older Game Boy. The port design is used on all subsequent Game Boy models, excluding the [[Game Boy Micro]]. The screen was changed to a true black-and-white display, rather than the \"pea soup\" monochromatic display of the original Game Boy.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Game Boy Relaunched|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=20 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=August 1996 |page=26}}</ref> Also, the Game Boy Pocket (GBP) has a larger screen than the Game Boy Color (GBC) that later superseded it.

This new line of colored Game Boys set a precedent for later Nintendo handhelds; every one of them since has been available in more than one color. Play It Loud! units were manufactured in red, green, black, yellow, white, blue, and clear (transparent) or sometimes called X-Ray in the UK. Most common are the yellow, red, clear and black. Green is fairly scarce but blue and white are the rarest. Blue was a Europe and Japan only release, white was a Japanese majority release with UK Toys R Us stores also getting it as an exclusive edition to them. The white remains the rarest of all the Play it Loud colors. A rare, limited edition [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] Game Boy is red, with the logos of the team emblazoned on it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} It was released simultaneously with the Play it Loud! handhelds in the United Kingdom.

The Pocket has a smaller link port, which requires an adapter to link with the older Game Boy. The port design is used on all subsequent Game Boy models, excluding the [[Game Boy Micro]].
