In 1940 the school had become overcrowded and the district was divided at the [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk River]], with the west side of town attending the new [[Stonewall Jackson High School (Kanawha County, West Virginia)|Stonewall Jackson High School]] (\"The Wall\").  During the 1980s, enrollment at both schools dropped.  In 1989, Capital High School opened, combining the students of these two longtime rivals.  The name \"Capital\" derives from the fact that the school primarily serves the bulk of West Virginia's capital city, Charleston.\n\nThe first site considered was near [[Laidley Field]], next to the [[West Virginia State Capitol]].  This was abandoned in favor of a Track and Field Hall of Fame (which was never built) and a second site was selected on Greenbrier Street near the airport. However, when an airplane crashed on this site, it was abandoned, and today is an office park. The board then decided on a location on a hilltop about five miles from town that was formerly a [[country club]] for golfing and had a swimming pool. Although located in a rural setting, it is typically considered an inner-city school due the majority of its students coming from an inner-city environment. This system of busing from an urban location to a closed campus in a remote setting was successful in controlling many urban problems and was later copied by [[Huntington High School (West Virginia)|Huntington High School]] and Wheeling Park High School.\n\nIt is a modern school, built in 1989. It has a closed campus. It has a student population of around 1,400. Capital High School is Kanawha County's magnet school for the performing arts. It is the only high school in Kanawha County to offer a performing arts class every period of the day.\n\n==Achievements==\n\nFrom its establishment, Capital High School has a history of excellence in both academic and athletic competitions.   \n\n''<u>Academic</u>''\n\n* State Science Bowl champions in 2006 and 2008 and third runner-up in 2007.\n* S.C.O.R.E.S, a competition involving a multitude of subjects ranging from basic academic subjects to physical conditioning, champions in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. Schools from all over the state participate.\n* First place winners of the Marshall Math Examination in 2007, a three-hour exam using extended reasoning and critical thinking. Schools from West Virginia and the surrounding area participated.\n* Fourth place state Quiz bowl team in 2007 and first place in 2008.\n* First place local ACS (American Chemical Society) Competition winners in 2008.\n* 2015 West Virginia Quiz Bowl Champions\n\n''<u>Athletic</u>''\n\n*1989, 1991, 1995 & 2014 Class AAA Football State Champions\n* 1992, 1998 & 2003 Boys' Soccer State Champions\n* 2000 & 2001 Boys' Basketball State Champions\n*2001 & 2002 Girls' Basketball State Champions \n*2001 Volleyball State Champion\n*1991,1992, 2000 & 2002 Boys' Track & Field State Champions\n*1991, 2000, 2003 & 2004 Girls' Track & Field State Champions\n*2015 Boys' Lacrosse - West Virginia Scholastic Lacrosse Association Champions\n\n==''Phantom of the Opera'' production==\n\nIn 2007, Capital High was chosen by [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] Theatricals as one of six pilot schools to perform ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. The schools were chosen to determine how well amateur groups could perform the musical. The Capital Performing Arts Centre hosted five shows from May 1 to May 4, 2008.  Members of each performing arts group were involved in the production.\n\n==Performing arts==\n\nCapital High is Kanawha County's magnet school for the performing arts, offering a class in performing arts every period of the day. These include The Capital High Dance Company, the Capital High Theatre Department, the Capital High V.I.P.s (Voices In Perfection) Show Choir, the Capital High Orchestra, and \"The Pride of Capital High\" Marching and Concert Band as well as the Capital High School Jazz Ensemble. Each group has won numerous awards throughout the state of West Virginia, as well as outside of the state.\n\nThe Capital High Theatre Department is directed by Jeffery Haught. In 2015, the Capital High School Theatre Department won Outstanding Technical School and Outstanding Technical Theatre student at the West Virginia State Thespian Festival.\n\nThe Capital High Dance Company, accompanied by the Capital High Jazz Band, was selected to perform at \"Arts Alive: The Best of West Virginia,\" held on April 28, 2008 at the Maier Foundation Performance Hall at the [[Clay Center, West Virginia|Clay Center for the Arts and Sciences]]. The Capital High Dance Company has also performed at the WV Dance Festival, the WV Secondary Dance Alliance Weekend Celebration, SCORES, and for Festival 2009. They have also won numerous awards over the years. The director is Tabitha A. Moore.\n\nThe Capital High V.I.P.s (Voices In Perfection) Show Choir have won numerous grand championships and awards since the school's opening in 1989. The director is Kathleen G. Corbett, who has been the Director of Vocal Music since the school's opening. Corbett is also the head of Capital's Performing Arts Department.\n\nThe Capital High Orchestra, combined with the [[South Charleston High School]]  Orchestra, took First Place High School Orchestra and Best Overall Orchestra at Music in the Parks competition. They were also invited to the 2009 National Orchestra Festival held March 18\u201321, 2009 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The director is Dr. Jeffrey Lipscomb.\n\n\"The Pride of Capital High\" Marching Band is the result of hard-working students. With the first marching competition season came two Grand Championships, a marching style second to none, and what is called the trademark bow. Since the school's opening, the Pride of Capital High has won over 70 Grand Championships. The Pride of Capital High, along with the seven other public high schools in Kanawha County, compete in the [[Gazette-Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival]]. 2007 marked the tenth win for the band at the festival and the Class of 2008 became the first in to win the festival every year (including when the school was grades 10 through 12). In 2008, the band won the festival again and became the first band since 1984 to have won the festival for five consecutive years. They broke this record in 2009 and continued a winning streak until 2015, an eleven consecutive win streak with an overall of eighteen wins (1989\u201390, 1993, 1995, 1997, 2002, 2004\u201314, 2016). The band has had five girls named Miss Kanawha Majorette at the festival (in 1991, 1999, 2002, 2009, 2014). In the 2006\u20132007 academic school year, The Pride of Capital High went undefeated with a 5-0 winning streak, the first time the band went undefeated. The band has also performed for numerous Governors of West Virginia, two Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States, including former Vice President [[Al Gore]] and former Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2008. They have marched in the [[Indianapolis 500]] Pageant Parade, the 2005 [[Chicago]] State Street Thanksgiving Day Parade, the [[Citrus Bowl (game)|Citrus Bowl]] Parade (all three were nationally televised) in [[Universal Studios Orlando]], and [[Walt Disney World]]. The current Director of Bands is Brianna Blankenship. Former directors include William R. \"Bobby\" Jenks and Robert M. \"Bob\" Scott; the latter had been the Director of Bands since the school opened in 1989 until his retirement in 2011.\n\nThe Concert Band has received superior ratings at the Region IV High School Adjudications (which is also hosted by the school) since the school's opening in 1989. In 2010, the concert band served as the Honor Band for the West Virginia Music Educators Association All-State Conference festival held in Charleston that year.\n\nThe Jazz Band plays numerous times throughout the school year for community and school events and have won several awards. In 2008, the Jazz Band was the accompaniment for the Capital High Dance Company at Arts Alive: The Best of West Virginia. The two pieces they played for the Dance Company were \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\" and \"Bandstand Boogie\". The Jazz Band meets after school once a week after the marching season has ended and during the club/activity period. The Jazz Band is the first instrumental group formed for Capital High in the spring of 1989, before the school opened. It consisted of musicians from Charleston High School and Stonewall Jackson High School. The ensemble's first performance was in [[Florida]] on spring break of 1989 at [[Boardwalk and Baseball]] in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]]. The Capital High Instrumental Music Department had a performance before there was a school. The Jazz Band has since performed on board premiere Cruise Line & Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, the Governor's Christmas Tree Lighting, the Governor's Inaugural Parade and numerous venues around the city and state.\n\nEvery year, Capital High students have been selected, by audition, to be in one of several honors groups, including the West Virginia All-State Chorus, the West Virginia All-State Orchestra, the West Virginia All-State Band, the Kanawha County All-County Chorus, the Kanawha County All-County Orchestra, the Kanawha County All-County Band, the Kanawha County All-County Jazz Band, the [[West Virginia University|WVU]] Honor Band, the WVU Honor Orchestra, the [[Virginia Tech]] Honor Band, and other honors groups throughout West Virginia.\n\n==Sports==\n\nCapital High offers a number of sports throughout fall, winter, and spring.\n\n;Fall sports:\n*Cheer\n*Cross country\n*Football\n*Golf\n*Boys' soccer\n*Girls' soccer\n*Volleyball\n;Winter sports:\n*Boys' basketball\n*Girls' basketball\n*Swimming\n*Wrestling\n;Spring sports:\n*Baseball\n*Boys' Lacrosse\n*Girls' Lacrosse\n*Softball\n*Tennis\n*Track & field\n*Ice Hockey\n*Halo5 \n*Egames\n\n==Notable alumni==\n<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\nOnly people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here as notable people.

In 1940 the school had become overcrowded and the district was divided at the [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk River]], with the west side of town attending the new [[Stonewall Jackson High School (Kanawha County, West Virginia)|Stonewall Jackson High School]] (\"The Wall\").  During the 1980s, enrollment at both schools dropped.  In 1989, Capital High School opened, combining the students of these two longtime rivals.  The name \"Capital\" derives from the fact that the school primarily serves the bulk of West Virginia's capital city, Charleston.\n\nThe first site considered was near [[Laidley Field]], next to the [[West Virginia State Capitol]].  This was abandoned in favor of a Track and Field Hall of Fame (which was never built) and a second site was selected on Greenbrier Street near the airport. However, when an airplane crashed on this site, it was abandoned, and today is an office park. The board then decided on a location on a hilltop about five miles from town that was formerly a [[country club]] for golfing and had a swimming pool. Although located in a rural setting, it is typically considered an inner-city school due the majority of its students coming from an inner-city environment. This system of busing from an urban location to a closed campus in a remote setting was successful in controlling many urban problems and was later copied by [[Huntington High School (West Virginia)|Huntington High School]] and Wheeling Park High School.\n\nIt is a modern school, built in 1989. It has a closed campus. It has a student population of around 1,400. Capital High School is Kanawha County's magnet school for the performing arts. It is the only high school in Kanawha County to offer a performing arts class every period of the day.\n\n==Achievements==\n\nFrom its establishment, Capital High School has a history of excellence in both academic and athletic competitions.   \n\n''<u>Academic</u>''\n\n* State Science Bowl champions in 2006 and 2008 and third runner-up in 2007.\n* S.C.O.R.E.S, a competition involving a multitude of subjects ranging from basic academic subjects to physical conditioning, champions in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. Schools from all over the state participate.\n* First place winners of the Marshall Math Examination in 2007, a three-hour exam using extended reasoning and critical thinking. Schools from West Virginia and the surrounding area participated.\n* Fourth place state Quiz bowl team in 2007 and first place in 2008.\n* First place local ACS (American Chemical Society) Competition winners in 2008.\n* 2015 West Virginia Quiz Bowl Champions\n\n''<u>Athletic</u>''\n\n*1989, 1991, 1995 & 2014 Class AAA Football State Champions\n* 1992, 1998 & 2003 Boys' Soccer State Champions\n* 2000 & 2001 Boys' Basketball State Champions\n*2001 & 2002 Girls' Basketball State Champions \n*2001 Volleyball State Champion\n*1991,1992, 2000 & 2002 Boys' Track & Field State Champions\n*1991, 2000, 2003 & 2004 Girls' Track & Field State Champions\n*2015 Boys' Lacrosse - West Virginia Scholastic Lacrosse Association Champions\n\n==''Phantom of the Opera'' production==\n\nIn 2007, Capital High was chosen by [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] Theatricals as one of six pilot schools to perform ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. The schools were chosen to determine how well amateur groups could perform the musical. The Capital Performing Arts Centre hosted five shows from May 1 to May 4, 2008.  Members of each performing arts group were involved in the production.\n\n==Performing arts==\n\nCapital High is Kanawha County's magnet school for the performing arts, offering a class in performing arts every period of the day. These include The Capital High Dance Company, the Capital High Theatre Department, the Capital High V.I.P.s (Voices In Perfection) Show Choir, the Capital High Orchestra, and \"The Pride of Capital High\" Marching and Concert Band as well as the Capital High School Jazz Ensemble. Each group has won numerous awards throughout the state of West Virginia, as well as outside of the state.\n\nThe Capital High Theatre Department is directed by Jeffery Haught. In 2015, the Capital High School Theatre Department won Outstanding Technical School and Outstanding Technical Theatre student at the West Virginia State Thespian Festival.\n\nThe Capital High Dance Company, accompanied by the Capital High Jazz Band, was selected to perform at \"Arts Alive: The Best of West Virginia,\" held on April 28, 2008 at the Maier Foundation Performance Hall at the [[Clay Center, West Virginia|Clay Center for the Arts and Sciences]]. The Capital High Dance Company has also performed at the WV Dance Festival, the WV Secondary Dance Alliance Weekend Celebration, SCORES, and for Festival 2009. They have also won numerous awards over the years. The director is Tabitha A. Moore.\n\nThe Capital High V.I.P.s (Voices In Perfection) Show Choir have won numerous grand championships and awards since the school's opening in 1989. The director is Kathleen G. Corbett, who has been the Director of Vocal Music since the school's opening. Corbett is also the head of Capital's Performing Arts Department.\n\nThe Capital High Orchestra, combined with the [[South Charleston High School]]  Orchestra, took First Place High School Orchestra and Best Overall Orchestra at Music in the Parks competition. They were also invited to the 2009 National Orchestra Festival held March 18\u201321, 2009 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The director is Dr. Jeffrey Lipscomb.\n\n\"The Pride of Capital High\" Marching Band is the result of hard-working students. With the first marching competition season came two Grand Championships, a marching style second to none, and what is called the trademark bow. Since the school's opening, the Pride of Capital High has won over 70 Grand Championships. The Pride of Capital High, along with the seven other public high schools in Kanawha County, compete in the [[Gazette-Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival]]. 2007 marked the tenth win for the band at the festival and the Class of 2008 became the first in to win the festival every year (including when the school was grades 10 through 12). In 2008, the band won the festival again and became the first band since 1984 to have won the festival for five consecutive years. They broke this record in 2009 and continued a winning streak until 2015, an eleven consecutive win streak with an overall of eighteen wins (1989\u201390, 1993, 1995, 1997, 2002, 2004\u201314, 2016). The band has had five girls named Miss Kanawha Majorette at the festival (in 1991, 1999, 2002, 2009, 2014). In the 2006\u20132007 academic school year, The Pride of Capital High went undefeated with a 5-0 winning streak, the first time the band went undefeated. The band has also performed for numerous Governors of West Virginia, two Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States, including former Vice President [[Al Gore]] and former Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2008. They have marched in the [[Indianapolis 500]] Pageant Parade, the 2005 [[Chicago]] State Street Thanksgiving Day Parade, the [[Citrus Bowl (game)|Citrus Bowl]] Parade (all three were nationally televised) in [[Universal Studios Orlando]], and [[Walt Disney World]]. The current Director of Bands is Brianna Blankenship. Former directors include William R. \"Bobby\" Jenks and Robert M. \"Bob\" Scott; the latter had been the Director of Bands since the school opened in 1989 until his retirement in 2011.\n\nThe Concert Band has received superior ratings at the Region IV High School Adjudications (which is also hosted by the school) since the school's opening in 1989. In 2010, the concert band served as the Honor Band for the West Virginia Music Educators Association All-State Conference festival held in Charleston that year.\n\nThe Jazz Band plays numerous times throughout the school year for community and school events and have won several awards. In 2008, the Jazz Band was the accompaniment for the Capital High Dance Company at Arts Alive: The Best of West Virginia. The two pieces they played for the Dance Company were \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\" and \"Bandstand Boogie\". The Jazz Band meets after school once a week after the marching season has ended and during the club/activity period. The Jazz Band is the first instrumental group formed for Capital High in the spring of 1989, before the school opened. It consisted of musicians from Charleston High School and Stonewall Jackson High School. The ensemble's first performance was in [[Florida]] on spring break of 1989 at [[Boardwalk and Baseball]] in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]]. The Capital High Instrumental Music Department had a performance before there was a school. The Jazz Band has since performed on board premiere Cruise Line & Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, the Governor's Christmas Tree Lighting, the Governor's Inaugural Parade and numerous venues around the city and state.\n\nEvery year, Capital High students have been selected, by audition, to be in one of several honors groups, including the West Virginia All-State Chorus, the West Virginia All-State Orchestra, the West Virginia All-State Band, the Kanawha County All-County Chorus, the Kanawha County All-County Orchestra, the Kanawha County All-County Band, the Kanawha County All-County Jazz Band, the [[West Virginia University|WVU]] Honor Band, the WVU Honor Orchestra, the [[Virginia Tech]] Honor Band, and other honors groups throughout West Virginia.\n\n==Sports==\n\nCapital High offers a number of sports throughout fall, winter, and spring.\n\n;Fall sports:\n*Cheer\n*Cross country\n*Football\n*Golf\n*Boys' soccer\n*Girls' soccer\n*Volleyball\n;Winter sports:\n*Boys' basketball\n*Girls' basketball\n*Swimming\n*Wrestling\n;Spring sports:\n*Baseball\n*Boys' Lacrosse\n*Girls' Lacrosse\n*Softball\n*Tennis\n*Track & field\n*Ice Hockey\n*Halo5 \n*Egames\n\n==Notable alumni==\n<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\nOnly people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here as notable people.

We're influenced by everyone really... It allows everyone to be creative.\"<ref name=\"Surtees\"/>\n\nCrossfire were the first Australian artists to use [[direct-to-disc recording]] for their aptly titled second album, ''''[[Direct to Disc (Crossfire album)|Direct to Disc]]'', in late 1978.<ref name=\"Foster 1\"/> It was produced and engineered by Alan Thorne and issued by Trafalgar Records/[[RCA]].<ref name=\"Foster 1\"/> For the album, the line-up was Bloxsom; Kenny on Wurlitzer piano and flugelhorn; Lyon;  Kelly on guitar; and Don Reid on saxophones and flute; joined by Doug Gallacher on drums.<ref name=\"Foster 1\"/> Michael Foster of ''[[the Canberra Times]]'' felt \"their music displays many moods \u2014 playful and joyous, eerie and sombre \u2014 always sensitive, reflecting the influences and experiences of each player.\"<ref name=\"Foster 1\"/> He emphasised \"the effect gained by the horns, which seem to hang suspended a lot of the time against a backdrop of the instruments which normally carry rhythm, and the percussion group. The rhythm and percussion instruments often, as is the way since bop, step outside their roles as custodians of time and measure, and establish their own rights to individual actions.\"<ref name=\"Foster 1\"/>\n\nThe group's third album, ''East of Where'' (1980), was issued on [[Warner Music Australasia|WEA]] and was co-produced by Kelly, Kenny and Martin Benge.<ref name=\"Foster 2\"/> All the tracks were written by Kelly or Kenny.<ref name=\"Foster 2\"/> For this album Bloxsom, Buchanan, Hopes, Kelly and Kenny were joined by Phil Scorgie bass guitar.<ref name=\"Foster 2\"/> Foster found there was \"more humour in this album than in the previous one. The music is of the same genre, but there is a certain wryness in the approach to its work, by one of Australia's most exciting bands.\"<ref name=\"Foster 2\"/> Although \"there are times when it gets a little heavy, but generally the music lifts and soars, and is fun to listen to.\"<ref name=\"Foster 2\"/>\n\nCrossfire were the backing band for the American jazz singer [[Michael Franks (musician)|Michael Franks]] on an Australian tour, which provided a live album, ''[[Michael Franks with Crossfire Live]]'' (1980). They were also the backing band for American jazz guitarist [[Lee Ritenour]] during his 1981 Australian tour. Lee was impressed when Michael Franks had played Lee his tapes of his live album back in L.A. In late 1982 they issued their fourth studio album, ''Hysterical Rochords'', again with Kelly, Kenny and Benge co-producing.

Ichimoku takes into consideration the factor of time as an additional element along with the price action, similar to [[William Delbert Gann]]'s trading ideas.\n\nIn the [[Western world]], it is solely known for its \u201cGraphic Environment\u201d, due to the fact that authors have not translated the original manual into English, German, nor Spanish. However, Ichimoku is also integrated by three other theories that improve and enhance the indicator:\n\n* Time Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Time Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/ichimoku-time-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Wave Movement Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Wave Movement Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-3-ichimoku-wave-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Target Price Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Price Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-4-target-price-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n\n==The key elements of Ichimoku's Graphic Environment==\n\n===Tenkan-sen===\nTenkan-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u8ee2\u63db|\u8ee2\u63db]][[:wikt:\u7dda|\u7dda]]}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the last 9 periods.\n\nIt is primarily used as a signal line and a minor support/resistance line. Tenkan Sen (red line): This is also known as the turning line and is derived by averaging the highest high and the lowest low for the past nine periods. ''The Tenkan Sen is an indicator of the market trend. If the red line is moving up or down, it indicates that the market is trending. If it moves horizontally, it signals that the market is ranging''.\n\n===Kijun-sen===\nKijun-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u57fa\u6e96|\u57fa\u6e96]]\u7dda}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the past 26 periods.\n\nThis is a confirmation line, a support/resistance line, and can be used as a trailing stop line. The Kijun Sen acts as an indicator of future price movement. If the price is higher than the blue line, it could continue to climb higher. If the price is below the blue line, it could keep dropping.\n\n===Senkou span A===\nSenkou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u5148\u884c|\u5148\u884c]]}}) span A calculation: (Tenkan-sen + kijun-sen)/2 plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 1, this line forms one edge of the kumo or cloud.\n\nIf the price is above the Senkou span, the top line serves as the first support level while the bottom line serves as the second support level.\n\nIf the price is below the Senkou span, the bottom line forms the first resistance level while the top line is the second resistance level.\n\n===Senkou span B===\nSenkou span B calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 calculated over the past 52 time periods and plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 2, this line forms the other edge of the Kumo.\n\n===Kumo===\nKumo ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u96f2|\u96f2]]}}, cloud) is the space between Senkou span A and B. The cloud edges identify current and potential future support and resistance points.\n\nThe Kumo cloud changes in shape and height based on price changes. This height represents volatility as larger price movements form thicker clouds, which creates stronger support and resistance. As thinner clouds offer only weak support and resistance, prices can and tend to break through such thin clouds.\n\nGenerally, markets are bullish when Senkou Span A is above Senkou Span B and vice versa when markets are bearish.

Ichimoku takes into consideration the factor of time as an additional element along with the price action, similar to [[William Delbert Gann]]'s trading ideas.\n\nIn the [[Western world]], it is solely known for its \u201cGraphic Environment\u201d, due to the fact that authors have not translated the original manual into English, German, nor Spanish. However, Ichimoku is also integrated by three other theories that improve and enhance the indicator:\n\n* Time Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Time Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/ichimoku-time-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Wave Movement Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Wave Movement Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-3-ichimoku-wave-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Target Price Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Price Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-4-target-price-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n\n==The key elements of Ichimoku's Graphic Environment==\n\n===Tenkan-sen===\nTenkan-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u8ee2\u63db|\u8ee2\u63db]][[:wikt:\u7dda|\u7dda]]}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the last 9 periods.\n\nIt is primarily used as a signal line and a minor support/resistance line. Tenkan Sen (red line): This is also known as the turning line and is derived by averaging the highest high and the lowest low for the past nine periods. ''The Tenkan Sen is an indicator of the market trend. If the red line is moving up or down, it indicates that the market is trending. If it moves horizontally, it signals that the market is ranging''.\n\n===Kijun-sen===\nKijun-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u57fa\u6e96|\u57fa\u6e96]]\u7dda}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the past 26 periods.\n\nThis is a confirmation line, a support/resistance line, and can be used as a trailing stop line. The Kijun Sen acts as an indicator of future price movement. If the price is higher than the blue line, it could continue to climb higher. If the price is below the blue line, it could keep dropping.\n\n===Senkou span A===\nSenkou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u5148\u884c|\u5148\u884c]]}}) span A calculation: (Tenkan-sen + kijun-sen)/2 plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 1, this line forms one edge of the kumo or cloud.\n\nIf the price is above the Senkou span, the top line serves as the first support level while the bottom line serves as the second support level.\n\nIf the price is below the Senkou span, the bottom line forms the first resistance level while the top line is the second resistance level.\n\n===Senkou span B===\nSenkou span B calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 calculated over the past 52 time periods and plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 2, this line forms the other edge of the Kumo.\n\n===Kumo===\nKumo ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u96f2|\u96f2]]}}, cloud) is the space between Senkou span A and B. The cloud edges identify current and potential future support and resistance points.\n\nThe Kumo cloud changes in shape and height based on price changes. This height represents volatility as larger price movements form thicker clouds, which creates stronger support and resistance. As thinner clouds offer only weak support and resistance, prices can and tend to break through such thin clouds.\n\nGenerally, markets are bullish when Senkou Span A is above Senkou Span B and vice versa when markets are bearish. Traders often look for Kumo Twists in future clouds, where Senkou Span A and B exchange positions, a signal of potential trend reversals.\n\nIn addition to thickness, the strength of the cloud can also be ascertained by its angle; upwards for bullish and downwards for bearish. Any clouds behind price are also known as Kumo Shadows.\n\n===Chikou span===\nChikou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u9045\u884c|\u9045\u884c]]}}) span calculation: today's closing price projected back 26 days on the chart.\n\nAlso called the lagging span it is used as a support/resistance aid.\n\nIf the Chikou Span or the green line crosses the price in the bottom-up direction, that is a buy signal.

Simba is next seen as a young cub, with Mufasa teaching him about the \"Circle of Life\". Simba's uncle and Mufasa's brother Scar plots to take the throne for himself and tells Simba about an elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has warned Simba not to go. When Simba and his best friend Nala sneak off to the elephant graveyard, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, three hyenas aligned with Scar, attack and try to kill the two cubs, but they are stopped by Mufasa. Scar's next plan is to lure Simba into a gorge while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a cliff, which results in Scar flinging him into the stampede below and killing him. Scar then tricks Simba into thinking that he is responsible for his father's death and tells him to run away, only to later order the hyenas to kill Simba, but they fail. Scar informs the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed and that he is assuming the throne as the next in line. Simba is later found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, who adopt and raise him. It is not until Simba is a young adult lion that he meets Nala again, and the two lions fall in love. Along with Rafiki and Mufasa's ghost, Nala convinces Simba to return to the Pride Lands and claim the throne. Simba, along with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa go to the Pride Rock, where Simba confronts, fights, and defeats Scar, who is later betrayed and killed by his own army of hyenas as a result of Scar's blaming of the hyenas for Mufasa's death. The film concludes with the Pride Lands turning green with life again and Rafiki presenting Simba and Nala's newborn cub.\n\n''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' begins with the presentation of Simba and Nala's daughter named Kiara. Simba is very protective of his daughter and assigns Timon and Pumbaa to be her guardians. One day, the young cub sneaks into the Outlands, the place in which a group of lions loyal to Scar called the Outsiders reside after Simba exiles them from the Pride Lands. In the Outlands, Kiara meets a young male cub named Kovu, Scar's hand-chosen successor, and the two of them befriend each other until Simba and Kovu's mother, Zira arrive and a fight between Pride Landers and Outsiders almost takes place. Later in the film, Zira decides that she can use Kovu's new friendship with Kiara to get her revenge against Simba. Kiara is next seen as an adolescent lioness and is set to go for her first solo-hunt, but discovers that her father still sends Timon and Pumbaa to watch her. Furious, Kiara goes further from home until Zira's other children, Nuka and Vitani, set fire to the plains where Kiara is hunting, causing her to faint and giving Kovu the chance to rescue her. Simba finds that Kovu has helped Kiara and reluctantly allows him into the Pride Lands. While Simba struggles with the idea of accepting Kovu, Kiara and Kovu eventually fall in love. One morning, Simba invites Kovu for a walk but they are ambushed by Zira and her pride. They attack Simba but, while chasing him, Nuka got killed by the logs, resulting in Zira blaming and scratching Kovu for his death giving him a scar over his left eye. A wounded Simba exiles Kovu as he thinks Kovu was behind the ambush, but Kiara, knowing that Kovu would never do such a thing, runs away from Pride Rock against her father's orders and reunites with Kovu and convinces him to return with her to reunite their prides. Meanwhile, Zira leads her pride in a war against Simba and the Pridelanders and a fierce battle breaks out. Kovu and Kiara leap between them and Kiara reminds her father that, by his own words, \"we are one\". Zira refuses to end the battle, but Vitani and the other Outsiders understand Kiara's words and abandon their leader and join the Pridelanders. Now alone, Zira leaps for Simba, but Kiara pushes her away and they fall over a cliff. Kiara lands on a rock, but Zira slips and falls into the lake to death. Simba allows the Outsiders, including Kovu, to return to the Pride Lands, and Kovu is allowed to stand with Kiara at the top of Pride Rock.\n\n''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' is a retelling of the events of the first film from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective.\n\n''The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa'' follows the further adventures of the titular meerkat and warthog duo. The pair is normally seen having misadventures in the jungle, but sometimes find themselves across the globe in various settings. This series also has episodes centering on Rafiki, Zazu, and Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. In the episode \"Once Upon a Timon\", a pre-existing storyline of how Timon met Pumbaa was revealed. This may indicate that ''Timon & Pumbaa'' (or just said episode) and ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' exist in different continuities.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', the majority of the series takes place after Kiara meets Kovu, but before her first hunt. The series follows the adventures of Simba and Nala's son Kion as he assembles the titular group of animals to protect the Pride Lands. In Season 2, Scar, the antagonist of the original film makes his return in the animated series, and plots revenge against Simba and plans to overthrow him as King by gathering up all the Outlanders to form an army. In the special \"Battle for the Pride Lands\" which serves as a prequel and pilot for Season 3, Kion continues to battle the spirit of Scar. In a series of events (ones involving Janja's betrayal of Scar), Kion managed to defeat and destroy Scar forever, but not before receiving a facial wound identical to his great uncle's, courtesy of the cobra Ushari (who is later killed in the fight). Season 3 featured Kion journeying throughout the Pride Lands to the Tree of Life to heal his scar before the venom corrupts him into the lion Scar once was. The last 2 episodes of Season 3 take place after the war between Simba's pride & Zira's outsiders.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of The Lion King characters}}\n\nA total of thirteen supervising animators from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and [[Disney-MGM Studios]] were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the first film's main characters. The animation team studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for the earlier film ''[[Bambi]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/bambi/index.html |title=Bambi Notes |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228102553/http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/bambi/index.html |archivedate=February 28, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The animation of the characters was created with supervision by wildlife experts such as [[Jim Fowler]], who visited the studio on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other jungle inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings an authentic feel. He taught them how lions greet one another by gently butting heads, and show affection by placing one's head under the other's chin, mannerisms that can be appreciated in Simba and Nala's encounter during the song \"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]\". Fowler also talked about how they protect themselves by lying on their backs and using their claws to ward off attackers, and how they fight rivals by rising on their hind legs.<ref name=LionKingProduction>{{cite web |url=http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |title=Lion King Production Notes |accessdate=August 5, 2008 |publisher=Lionking.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026100715/http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |archivedate=October 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Screenwriter [[Irene Mecchi]] joined the directing team to help in the character development process as well as to define each character's personality.

Disch's contract and film treatment |accessdate=November 29, 2008|publisher= www.jamescumminsbookseller.com }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The treatment, inspired by ''[[Hamlet]]'', was written by [[Thomas M. Disch]] (author of ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (novel)|The Brave Little Toaster]]'') as work-for-hire; Disch received no credit or royalties. Production took place at the Walt Disney Animation Studios in [[Glendale, California]]. Also, nearly 20 minutes of the film were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios.<ref name=LionKingProduction/> Ultimately, more than 600 artists, animators and technicians contributed to ''The Lion King'' over its lengthy production schedule. More than one million drawings were created for the film, including 1,197 hand-painted backgrounds and 119,058 individually colored frames of film.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/>\n\nIn October 1991, after finishing work on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' as Head of Story, [[Roger Allers]] joined ''The Lion King'', as the initial director. Allers worked for 6 months on story development and was then joined by co-director, [[Rob Minkoff]]. A 2-day story session was held to revamp the story with the two directors, Allers and Minkoff, joined by [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], directors of ''Beauty and the Beast'', and Producer [[Don Hahn]] who presided over the discussion. The creative think-tank produced a character makeover for Simba and a radically revised second half of the film.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/> [[Irene Mecchi]] joined the team that summer to help further develop the characters and define their personalities. Several months later, she was joined by [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]] in the rewriting process. Working together in the animation department and in conjunction with the directors and story team, they tackled the unresolved emotional issues in the script and also added many comic situations.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/> Some of the lead production crew made a trip to Africa to better understand the environment for the film. The trip gave production designer [[Chris Sanders (director)|Chris Sanders]] a new appreciation for the natural environments and inspired him to find ways to incorporate these elements into the design of the film.<ref name=LionKingProduction /> The filmmakers also made use of computers to better present their vision in new ways. The most notable use of [[computer animation]] is in the \"wildebeest stampede\" sequence. Several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Similar multiplication occurs in the \"[[Be Prepared (song)|Be Prepared]]\" musical number with identical marching hyenas.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Computer Animation|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|date=June 15, 1994}}</ref> Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the 2\u00bd minute stampede sequence.<ref name=LionKingProduction/>\n\nAt one time, the Disney Feature Animation staff felt ''The Lion King'' was less important than ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> Both projects were in production at the same time, and most of the staff preferred to work on ''Pocahontas'', believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> As it turned out, while both films were commercial successes, ''The Lion King'' received more positive feedback and larger grosses than ''Pocahontas''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pocahontas.htm |title=Pocahontas revenue |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219131040/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pocahontas.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"rottentomatoestlk\">{{cite web | website =[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title=The Lion King | url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/ | accessdate=September 24, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902001059/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/ | archive-date=September 2, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"rottentomatoespocahontas\">{{cite web | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title= ''Pocahontas'' | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/ | accessdate=September 17, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210090428/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/ | archive-date=February 10, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe sequel ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' was directed by [[Darrell Rooney]] and produced by Jeannine Roussel, with Flip Kobler and Cindy Marcus writing the screenplay. Disney believed that ''Simba's Pride'' would be so popular that it shipped 15 million copies to stores for the October 27 release date.<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=173545 ''Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes] ''New York Times''</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[The Lion King (1994 soundtrack)|original motion picture soundtrack]] for the first film was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 13, 1994, two days before the film's release. It contains songs by songwriter [[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]], who wrote five original songs, with Elton John performing \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" during the end credits. Additionally, \"The Morning Report\", a song which was not present in the original theatrical film, was later added to the [[IMAX]] theater and to the [[DVD]] Platinum Edition release. The film's score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and supplemented with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by [[Lebo M]].<ref>{{cite video | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 1), Music: African Influence | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] | date=June 15, 1994}}</ref> Elton John thought his career had hit a new low when he was writing the music to the song \"[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legends.disney.go.com/legends/detail?key=Elton+John|title=Disney Legends: Elton John|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=August 5, 2008}}</ref> However, the strongly enthusiastic audience reception to an early [[film trailer]] which consisted solely of the opening sequence with the song \"[[Circle of Life]]\", suggested that the film would be very successful.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} Out of the five original songs, \"Hakuna Matata\" was listed at number 99 in the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] list in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicmovies.org/articles/afi100songs.htm|title=AFI's \"100 Years, 100 Songs|accessdate=August 9, 2008|publisher=Classic Movies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621231625/http://www.classicmovies.org/articles/afi100songs.htm|archive-date=June 21, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and \"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]\" won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for Best Original Song during the [[67th Academy Awards]].

Rhythm of the Pride Lands was initially printed in a very limited quantity. However, it was re-released in 2003, included in some international versions of The Lion King's special edition soundtrack with an additional track, \"Circle of Life\".\n\nAn audio CD entitled ''[[Return to Pride Rock: Songs Inspired by Disney's The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' was released on September 8, 1998. Although not promoted as a soundtrack to ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', it contained all the songs from the film and some additional songs inspired by it by Lebo M. Tina Turner recorded a version of \"He Lives in You\" for the film. On August 31, 2004, Disney released an \"enhanced soundtrack\" to coincide with the release of the film's 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. However, the CD only contains the songs featured in the film, without any of the inspired songs by the first film. ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert]]'' noted that it was best the film was direct-to-video, since the music was lacking and not remotely equal to the original's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/reviews.html?sec=6&subsec=The+Lion+King+II%3A+Simba%27s+Pride+ |title=The Lion King II: Simba's Pride - Siskel & Ebert }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack for the third film, ''The Lion King 1\u00bd: Songs From Timon and Pumbaa's Hilarious Adventure'', was released to CD by Disney on February 10, 2004. It includes two songs from the original film, \"That's All I Need\" and \"Hakuna Matata\", re-performed by Nathan Lane who took over the role of voicing the character Timon. The rest of the soundtrack includes various [[R&B]] tracks, including remakes of the [[Kool and the Gang]] classic \"Jungle Boogie\" by artist French, and two instrumental pieces from film composer [[Don Harper]].

Simba is next seen as a young cub, with Mufasa teaching him about the \"Circle of Life\". Simba's uncle and Mufasa's brother Scar plots to take the throne for himself and tells Simba about an elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has warned Simba not to go. When Simba and his best friend Nala sneak off to the elephant graveyard, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, three hyenas aligned with Scar, attack and try to kill the two cubs, but they are stopped by Mufasa. Scar's next plan is to lure Simba into a gorge while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a cliff, which results in Scar flinging him into the stampede below and killing him. Scar then tricks Simba into thinking that he is responsible for his father's death and tells him to run away, only to later order the hyenas to kill Simba, but they fail. Scar informs the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed and that he is assuming the throne as the next in line. Simba is later found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, who adopt and raise him. It is not until Simba is a young adult lion that he meets Nala again, and the two lions fall in love. Along with Rafiki and Mufasa's ghost, Nala convinces Simba to return to the Pride Lands and claim the throne. Simba, along with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa go to the Pride Rock, where Simba confronts, fights, and defeats Scar, who is later betrayed and killed by his own army of hyenas as a result of Scar's blaming of the hyenas for Mufasa's death. The film concludes with the Pride Lands turning green with life again and Rafiki presenting Simba and Nala's newborn cub.\n\n''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' begins with the presentation of Simba and Nala's daughter named Kiara. Simba is very protective of his daughter and assigns Timon and Pumbaa to be her guardians. One day, the young cub sneaks into the Outlands, the place in which a group of lions loyal to Scar called the Outsiders reside after Simba exiles them from the Pride Lands. In the Outlands, Kiara meets a young male cub named Kovu, Scar's hand-chosen successor, and the two of them befriend each other until Simba and Kovu's mother, Zira arrive and a fight between Pride Landers and Outsiders almost takes place. Later in the film, Zira decides that she can use Kovu's new friendship with Kiara to get her revenge against Simba. Kiara is next seen as an adolescent lioness and is set to go for her first solo-hunt, but discovers that her father still sends Timon and Pumbaa to watch her. Furious, Kiara goes further from home until Zira's other children, Nuka and Vitani, set fire to the plains where Kiara is hunting, causing her to faint and giving Kovu the chance to rescue her. Simba finds that Kovu has helped Kiara and reluctantly allows him into the Pride Lands. While Simba struggles with the idea of accepting Kovu, Kiara and Kovu eventually fall in love. One morning, Simba invites Kovu for a walk but they are ambushed by Zira and her pride. They attack Simba but, while chasing him, Nuka got killed by the logs, resulting in Zira blaming and scratching Kovu for his death giving him a scar over his left eye. A wounded Simba exiles Kovu as he thinks Kovu was behind the ambush, but Kiara, knowing that Kovu would never do such a thing, runs away from Pride Rock against her father's orders and reunites with Kovu and convinces him to return with her to reunite their prides. Meanwhile, Zira leads her pride in a war against Simba and the Pridelanders and a fierce battle breaks out. Kovu and Kiara leap between them and Kiara reminds her father that, by his own words, \"we are one\". Zira refuses to end the battle, but Vitani and the other Outsiders understand Kiara's words and abandon their leader and join the Pridelanders. Now alone, Zira leaps for Simba, but Kiara pushes her away and they fall over a cliff. Kiara lands on a rock, but Zira slips and falls into the lake to death. Simba allows the Outsiders, including Kovu, to return to the Pride Lands, and Kovu is allowed to stand with Kiara at the top of Pride Rock.\n\n''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' is a retelling of the events of the first film from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective.\n\n''The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa'' follows the further adventures of the titular meerkat and warthog duo. The pair is normally seen having misadventures in the jungle, but sometimes find themselves across the globe in various settings. This series also has episodes centering on Rafiki, Zazu, and Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. In the episode \"Once Upon a Timon\", a pre-existing storyline of how Timon met Pumbaa was revealed. This may indicate that ''Timon & Pumbaa'' (or just said episode) and ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' exist in different continuities.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', the majority of the series takes place after Kiara meets Kovu, but before her first hunt. The series follows the adventures of Simba and Nala's son Kion as he assembles the titular group of animals to protect the Pride Lands. In Season 2, Scar, the antagonist of the original film makes his return in the animated series, and plots revenge against Simba and plans to overthrow him as King by gathering up all the Outlanders to form an army. In the special \"Battle for the Pride Lands\" which serves as a prequel and pilot for Season 3, Kion continues to battle the spirit of Scar. In a series of events (ones involving Janja's betrayal of Scar), Kion managed to defeat and destroy Scar forever, but not before receiving a facial wound identical to his great uncle's, courtesy of the cobra Ushari (who is later killed in the fight). Season 3 featured Kion journeying throughout the Pride Lands to the Tree of Life to heal his scar before the venom corrupts him into the lion Scar once was.

He taught them how lions greet one another by gently butting heads, and show affection by placing one's head under the other's chin, mannerisms that can be appreciated in Simba and Nala's encounter during the song \"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]\". Fowler also talked about how they protect themselves by lying on their backs and using their claws to ward off attackers, and how they fight rivals by rising on their hind legs.<ref name=LionKingProduction>{{cite web |url=http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |title=Lion King Production Notes |accessdate=August 5, 2008 |publisher=Lionking.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026100715/http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |archivedate=October 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Screenwriter [[Irene Mecchi]] joined the directing team to help in the character development process as well as to define each character's personality.

Disch's contract and film treatment |accessdate=November 29, 2008|publisher= www.jamescumminsbookseller.com }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The treatment, inspired by ''[[Hamlet]]'', was written by [[Thomas M. Disch]] (author of ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (novel)|The Brave Little Toaster]]'') as work-for-hire; Disch received no credit or royalties. Production took place at the Walt Disney Animation Studios in [[Glendale, California]]. Also, nearly 20 minutes of the film were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios.<ref name=LionKingProduction/> Ultimately, more than 600 artists, animators and technicians contributed to ''The Lion King'' over its lengthy production schedule. More than one million drawings were created for the film, including 1,197 hand-painted backgrounds and 119,058 individually colored frames of film.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/>\n\nIn October 1991, after finishing work on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' as Head of Story, [[Roger Allers]] joined ''The Lion King'', as the initial director. Allers worked for 6 months on story development and was then joined by co-director, [[Rob Minkoff]]. A 2-day story session was held to revamp the story with the two directors, Allers and Minkoff, joined by [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], directors of ''Beauty and the Beast'', and Producer [[Don Hahn]] who presided over the discussion. The creative think-tank produced a character makeover for Simba and a radically revised second half of the film.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/> [[Irene Mecchi]] joined the team that summer to help further develop the characters and define their personalities. Several months later, she was joined by [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]] in the rewriting process. Working together in the animation department and in conjunction with the directors and story team, they tackled the unresolved emotional issues in the script and also added many comic situations.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/> Some of the lead production crew made a trip to Africa to better understand the environment for the film. The trip gave production designer [[Chris Sanders (director)|Chris Sanders]] a new appreciation for the natural environments and inspired him to find ways to incorporate these elements into the design of the film.<ref name=LionKingProduction /> The filmmakers also made use of computers to better present their vision in new ways. The most notable use of [[computer animation]] is in the \"wildebeest stampede\" sequence. Several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Similar multiplication occurs in the \"[[Be Prepared (song)|Be Prepared]]\" musical number with identical marching hyenas.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Computer Animation|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|date=June 15, 1994}}</ref> Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the 2\u00bd minute stampede sequence.<ref name=LionKingProduction/>\n\nAt one time, the Disney Feature Animation staff felt ''The Lion King'' was less important than ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> Both projects were in production at the same time, and most of the staff preferred to work on ''Pocahontas'', believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> As it turned out, while both films were commercial successes, ''The Lion King'' received more positive feedback and larger grosses than ''Pocahontas''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pocahontas.htm |title=Pocahontas revenue |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219131040/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pocahontas.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"rottentomatoestlk\">{{cite web | website =[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title=The Lion King | url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/ | accessdate=September 24, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902001059/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/ | archive-date=September 2, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"rottentomatoespocahontas\">{{cite web | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title= ''Pocahontas'' | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/ | accessdate=September 17, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210090428/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/ | archive-date=February 10, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe sequel ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' was directed by [[Darrell Rooney]] and produced by Jeannine Roussel, with Flip Kobler and Cindy Marcus writing the screenplay.

Additionally, \"The Morning Report\", a song which was not present in the original theatrical film, was later added to the [[IMAX]] theater and to the [[DVD]] Platinum Edition release.

Rhythm of the Pride Lands was initially printed in a very limited quantity. However, it was re-released in 2003, included in some international versions of The Lion King's special edition soundtrack with an additional track, \"Circle of Life\".\n\nAn audio CD entitled ''[[Return to Pride Rock: Songs Inspired by Disney's The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' was released on September 8, 1998. Although not promoted as a soundtrack to ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', it contained all the songs from the film and some additional songs inspired by it by Lebo M. Tina Turner recorded a version of \"He Lives in You\" for the film. On August 31, 2004, Disney released an \"enhanced soundtrack\" to coincide with the release of the film's 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. However, the CD only contains the songs featured in the film, without any of the inspired songs by the first film. ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert]]'' noted that it was best the film was direct-to-video, since the music was lacking and not remotely equal to the original's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/reviews.html?sec=6&subsec=The+Lion+King+II%3A+Simba%27s+Pride+ |title=The Lion King II: Simba's Pride - Siskel & Ebert }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack for the third film, ''The Lion King 1\u00bd: Songs From Timon and Pumbaa's Hilarious Adventure'', was released to CD by Disney on February 10, 2004.

The rest of the soundtrack includes various [[R&B]] tracks, including remakes of the [[Kool and the Gang]] classic \"Jungle Boogie\" by artist French, and two instrumental pieces from film composer [[Don Harper]].
