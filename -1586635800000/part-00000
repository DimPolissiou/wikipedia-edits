It was noted that the five major Conduit OFCs, namely, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Switzerland, all have a top\u2013ten ranking in the 2018 ''[[Global Intellectual Property Center|Global Innovation Property Centre]] (GIPC) IP Index\".<ref name=\"ip\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GIPC_IP_Index_2018.pdf|title=GIPC IP Index 2018|date=February 2018|author=United States Chamber of Commerce|quote=Figure I: U.S. Chamber International IP Index 2018, Overall Scores|page=6|author-link=United States Chamber of Commerce}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pre-Tax Profits of U.S. foreign subsidiaries (2015 BEA Data).jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Profitability of U.S. subsidiaries (2015 [[Bureau of Economic Analysis|BEA]] data).<ref name=\"gabrielzucman\"/>]]\n\nOnce profits are \"shifted\" to the corporate tax haven (or Conduit OFC), additional tools are used to avoid paying ''headline'' tax rates in the haven. Some of the tools are OCED\u2013compliant (e.g. [[patent box]]es, [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] (\"CAIA\") or \"[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]\"), others became OECD\u2013proscribed (e.g. [[Double Irish]] and [[Corporate haven#Dutch \"Double Dip\"|Dutch Double\u2013Dipping]]), while others have not attracted OECD attention (e.g. [[double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|Single Malt]]).\n\nBecause BEPS hubs (or Conduit OFCs) need extensive bilateral [[tax treaties]] (e.g. so that their BEPS tools will be accepted by the higher\u2013tax locations), they go to great lengths to obscure the fact that ''effective tax rates'' paid by multinationals in their jurisdiction are close to zero percent, rather than the ''headline'' corporate tax rate of the haven (see [[#Table 1|Table 1]]).

It was noted that the five major Conduit OFCs, namely, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Switzerland, all have a top\u2013ten ranking in the 2018 ''[[Global Intellectual Property Center|Global Innovation Property Centre]] (GIPC) IP Index\".<ref name=\"ip\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GIPC_IP_Index_2018.pdf|title=GIPC IP Index 2018|date=February 2018|author=United States Chamber of Commerce|quote=Figure I: U.S. Chamber International IP Index 2018, Overall Scores|page=6|author-link=United States Chamber of Commerce}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pre-Tax Profits of U.S. foreign subsidiaries (2015 BEA Data).jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Profitability of U.S. subsidiaries (2015 [[Bureau of Economic Analysis|BEA]] data).<ref name=\"gabrielzucman\"/>]]\n\nOnce profits are \"shifted\" to the corporate tax haven (or Conduit OFC), additional tools are used to avoid paying ''headline'' tax rates in the haven. Some of the tools are OCED\u2013compliant (e.g. [[patent box]]es, [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] (\"CAIA\") or \"[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]\"), others became OECD\u2013proscribed (e.g. [[Double Irish]] and [[Corporate haven#Dutch \"Double Dip\"|Dutch Double\u2013Dipping]]), while others have not attracted OECD attention (e.g. [[double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|Single Malt]]).\n\nBecause BEPS hubs (or Conduit OFCs) need extensive bilateral [[tax treaties]] (e.g. so that their BEPS tools will be accepted by the higher\u2013tax locations), they go to great lengths to obscure the fact that ''effective tax rates'' paid by multinationals in their jurisdiction are close to zero percent, rather than the ''headline'' corporate tax rate of the haven (see [[#Table 1|Table 1]]). Higher\u2013tax jurisdictions do not enter into full bilateral tax treaties with obvious tax havens (e.g. the Cayman Islands, a major Sink OFC). That is achieved with [[Financial Secrecy Index|financial secrecy]] laws, and by the avoidance of ''country\u2013by\u2013country reporting'' (\"CbCr\") or the need to file public accounts, by multinationals in the haven's jurisdiction. BEPS hubs (or Conduit OFCs) strongly deny they are corporate tax havens, and that their use of IP is as a tax avoidance tool.<ref name=\"straits\">{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/spore-is-no-tax-haven-govt-experts-here|title=MOF rejects claim of Singapore as tax haven|work=The Straits Times|date=14 December 2016}}</ref> They call themselves \"[[Corporate haven#The \"Knowledge Economy\"|knowledge economies]]\".<ref name=\"sing\">{{Cite web|title=Singapore's government says it's not a tax haven, it's a value-adding IP hub|url = https://www.smh.com.au/business/singapores-government-says-its-not-a-tax-haven-its-a-valueadding-hub-20150430-1mwvdu.html|work=Sydney Morning Hearald|date=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Make no mistake: the headline rate is not what triggers tax evasion and aggressive tax planning.

Three years later, in 1730, Father Guillaume Martel established a permanent church. He planned and built a {{convert|12|m}} by {{convert|5|m}} church made of solid wood (timber-framed<ref name=\"Gravette2000\"/>) and stone flooring, to meet the growing congregational needs of settlers who had come from France and occupied territory on the south coast of the island nation.\n\nIn April 1796, [[Agostino Brunias]] was buried in the Catholic cemetery, located at the site of the church.<ref name=\"MeeksLindahl2001\">{{cite book|last1=Meeks|first1=Brian|last2=Lindahl|first2=Folke|title=New Caribbean thought: a reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUC4PA7ZedYC&pg=PA250|accessdate=22 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=University of the West Indies Press|isbn=978-976-640-103-0|page=250}}</ref>\n\n;19th century\nThis church survived until 1816 when it was destroyed by hurricane. The present church, which was built 24 years later, located at the same site, was also found to be inadequate to meet the growing needs of church goers. This was a result of abolition of slavery and permitting former slaves to attend church services. Black and white people sat together to worship in the pews without discrimination. The expansion program which began took almost 100 years to complete to its present form. The additions to the cathedral started with a steeple built in 1855, followed by a wooden ceiling for the cathedral in 1865 by the Kalinagos who cut and brought [[Bursera simaruba|simaruba]] trees from the northeast of Roseau; it took them three months to build the wooden ceiling. During this period, a large stone pulpit was also erected. This stone pulpit was carved by prisoners who were kept in [[Devil's Island]] (located off the coast of French Guiana).<ref name=\"Crask2008\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Heidi Sarna & Matt Hannafin |year=2004 |title=Frommer's Caribbean Ports of Call |edition=5th |publisher=[[Frommer's]] |isbn=978-0-7645-6899-2 |chapter=Dominica |pages=174\u2013180 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bFRwEM_IM2IC&pg=PA178}}</ref> In the year 1873, at the southeast end, the Chapel of St. Joseph came to be established along with a [[crypt]] where bishops and priests could be buried.<ref name=\"Crask2008\"/><ref name=\"McCanse2011\"/> In 1853, the town and the parish had a population of 6000 Catholics.

[[Kalina people|Carib people]] built the cathedral in the local building tradition.<ref name=\"McCanse2011\" />\n\n;18th century\nIn 1727, the plot of land was first surveyed for building. Three years later, in 1730, Father Guillaume Martel established a permanent church. He planned and built a {{convert|12|m}} by {{convert|5|m}} church made of solid wood (timber-framed<ref name=\"Gravette2000\"/>) and stone flooring, to meet the growing congregational needs of settlers who had come from France and occupied territory on the south coast of the island nation.\n\nIn April 1796, [[Agostino Brunias]] was buried in the Catholic cemetery, located at the site of the church.<ref name=\"MeeksLindahl2001\">{{cite book|last1=Meeks|first1=Brian|last2=Lindahl|first2=Folke|title=New Caribbean thought: a reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUC4PA7ZedYC&pg=PA250|accessdate=22 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=University of the West Indies Press|isbn=978-976-640-103-0|page=250}}</ref>\n\n;19th century\nThis church survived until 1816 when it was destroyed by hurricane. The present church, which was built 24 years later, located at the same site, was also found to be inadequate to meet the growing needs of church goers. This was a result of abolition of slavery and permitting former slaves to attend church services. Black and white people sat together to worship in the pews without discrimination. The expansion program which began took almost 100 years to complete to its present form. The additions to the cathedral started with a steeple built in 1855, followed by a wooden ceiling for the cathedral in 1865 by the Kalinagos who cut and brought [[Bursera simaruba|simaruba]] trees from the northeast of Roseau; it took them three months to build the wooden ceiling. During this period, a large stone pulpit was also erected. This stone pulpit was carved by prisoners who were kept in [[Devil's Island]] (located off the coast of French Guiana).<ref name=\"Crask2008\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Heidi Sarna & Matt Hannafin |year=2004 |title=Frommer's Caribbean Ports of Call |edition=5th |publisher=[[Frommer's]] |isbn=978-0-7645-6899-2 |chapter=Dominica |pages=174\u2013180 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bFRwEM_IM2IC&pg=PA178}}</ref> In the year 1873, at the southeast end, the Chapel of St. Joseph came to be established along with a [[crypt]] where bishops and priests could be buried.<ref name=\"Crask2008\"/><ref name=\"McCanse2011\"/> In 1853, the town and the parish had a population of 6000 Catholics.

'''Alaska Anchorage Seawolves men's ice hockey''' team is a [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[college ice hockey]] program that represents the [[University of Alaska Anchorage]]. The Seawolves are a member of the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA). They play at the [[Sullivan Arena]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. College Hockey Online|url=http://www.uscho.com/team/alaska-anchorage/mens-hockey/|title=Alaska-Anchorage Seawolves Men's Hockey|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[University of Alaska Anchorage|UAA]] began its ice hockey program in 1979, playing 8 of its 31 games against [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] [[Alaska Nanooks men's ice hockey |Alaska\u2013Fairbanks]] (winning all) before beginning a full D-II schedule the following season. The Seawolves rose quickly in the Division II ranks, narrowly missing out on the NCAA tournament in [[1984 NCAA Division II Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1984]] but promoted the team to [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] that summer when the entire D-II division collapsed.<ref name=ncaa>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncaa.sports.hopeark.com/icehockey-mens |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142938/http://www.ncaa.sports.hopeark.com/icehockey-mens |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-04-13 |title=NCAA page for men's ice hockey |accessdate=2008-05-15 |work=NCAA.com }} </ref>\n\nAnchorage played as an independent for a year before being a founding member of the first west coast conference, the [[Great West Hockey Conference]]. The league was very short-lived, lasting only three seasons before the two non-Alaska schools dropped hockey entirely, but it did provide UAA with its first league title in [[1986\u201387 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|1987]].<ref name=\"CHHA\">{{cite web |title=History of the Great West Hockey Conference |url=http://www.augenblick.org/chha/gwc_his.html |work=College Hockey Historical Archives |accessdate=February 2, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E8cgiw4J?url=http://www.augenblick.org/chha/gwc_his.html |archivedate=February 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Seawolves were once again without a conference in 1988\u201389, but a year later they posted their first 20-win season at the D-I level and were selected to the [[1990 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|NCAA Tournament]].\n\nThe Seawolves dropped both games to [[Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey|Lake Superior State]] but returned the following year after another 20-win campaign and this time they were able to win their first NCAA round, defeating the [[Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey|Boston College Eagles]]. [[1991\u201392 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|1991\u201392]] provided UAA with its best record, with the team going 27\u20138\u20131 and garnering a third consecutive NCAA berth (the last such for UAA as of 2019). After one more winning season the Seawolves joined the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]].\n\nThe stability of their new conference came as a double-edged sword, however, as the Seawolves would spend the next 20 years finishing with losing records. To make matters worse the team would lost both games in the opening round of the [[List of WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament champions|WCHA tournament]] most of the time and only twice could manage a First Round series win.\n\nThe college hockey world changed in 2013 when the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]] collapsed due to the formation of the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and the [[National Collegiate Hockey Conference]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The CCHA is going away, but its history will have a final resting place|url=http://www.uscho.com/2013/03/06/the-ccha-is-going-away-but-its-history-will-have-a-final-resting-place/|publisher=USCHO.com|date=2013-03-06|accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref> This caused the WCHA to replace many of its departing members with weaker teams but even in the new WCHA UAA was still a bottom-half team. After making the conference semifinals the first season the Seawolves missed the playoffs each of the next five years.\n\n==Season-by-season results<ref>{{cite news|title=Alaska Anchorage Hockey Media Guide|url=http://www.goseawolves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=13400&ATCLID=1602924|publisher=Go Seawolves.com|accessdate=2018-05-18}}</ref>==\n\n{{Main article|List of Alaska Anchorage Seawolves men's ice hockey seasons}}\n\n==Head Coaches==\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"80%\"\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | Tenure\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | Coach\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | Years\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | Record\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | Pct.\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1979&ndash;1996 || [[Brush Christiansen]] || 17 || 287\u2013229\u201330 || {{winpct|287|229|30}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1996&ndash;2001 || [[Dean Talafous]] || 5 || 50\u2013108\u201322 || {{winpct|50|108|22}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2001&ndash;2005 || [[John Hill (ice hockey)|John Hill]] || 4 || 39\u201389\u201321 || {{winpct|39|89|21}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2005&ndash;2013 || [[Dave Shyiak]] || 8 || 80\u2013177\u201333 || {{winpct|80|177|33}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2013&ndash;2018|| [[Matt Thomas (ice hockey)|Matt Thomas]] || 5 || 48\u2013105\u201321 || {{winpct|48|105|21}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2018&ndash;Present|| [[Matt Curley]] || 1 || 3\u201328\u20133|| {{winpct|3|28|3}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=center\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | Totals\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | 6 coaches\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | 40 seasons\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | 507-731-130\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Alaska Anchorage Seawolves|color=white}};\" | {{winpct|507|731|130}}\n|}\n<small>As of completion of 2018\u201319 season.

In the 3rd century BC, it was relocated and refounded as the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] city of Berenice. Berenice prospered under the Romans, and after the 3rd century AD it superseded [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] as the center of Cyrenaica. The city went into decline during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period and had already been reduced to a small town before [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|its conquest by the Arabs]]. In 1911, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] captured Benghazi and the rest of [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Under Italian rule, Benghazi witnessed a period of extensive development and modernization, particularly in the second half of the 1930s. The city changed hands several times during [[World War II]] and was heavily damaged in the process. After the war Benghazi was rebuilt and became the co-capital of the newly independent [[Kingdom of Libya]]. Following the [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat|1969 coup d'\u00e9tat]] by [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Benghazi lost its capital status and all government offices relocated to [[Tripoli]].\n\nOn [[Timeline of the 2011 Libyan Civil War before military intervention#Early phase .2815.E2.80.9326 February.29|15 February 2011]],<ref>{{cite news|work=Al Jazeera|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/news/pages/ee1995da-6146-422c-91b5-c546d62999c2|title=\u0628\u0646\u063a\u0627\u0632\u064a-\u0635\u0627\u0646\u0639\u0629-\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e-\u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a|date=2011-02-20}}</ref>  [[First Battle of Benghazi|an uprising]] against the government of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] occurred in the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.indiancolleges.com/campus-stories/buzz//FB-and-Twitter-got-us-from-Tahrir-Square-to-Libya/339 |title=FB and Twitter Got Us from Tahrir Square to Libya|work=Benghazi After Gaddafi}}</ref> The revolts spread by 17 February to [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]], [[Tobruk]], [[Ajdabya]], [[Al Marj]] in the East and [[Zintan]], [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]] in the West, calling for the end of the Gaddafi Regime.

It continues to hold institutions and organizations normally associated with a capital city, including several national government buildings as well as the [[National Library of Libya]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Benghazi|Timeline of Benghazi}}\n\n=== Ancient Greek Colony ===\n[[File:Panathenaic amphora Louvre MN705.jpg|thumb|A [[panathenaic amphora]] found in Benghazi from the times of ''Euesperides'', the ancient Greek city that is now Benghazi.]]\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city that existed within the modern day boundaries of Benghazi was founded around 525 BC; at the time, it was called '''Euesperides''' ({{lang-grc|\u0395\u1f50\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2}})<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/241#E284.19 Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, \u00a7E284.19]</ref> and '''Hesperis''' ({{lang-grc|\u1f19\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c2}}).<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/241#E282.16 Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, \u00a7E282.16]</ref>\nEuesperides was most likely founded by people from [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] or [[Barca (ancient city)|Barce]], which was located on the edge of a lagoon which opened from the sea. At the time, this area may have been deep enough to receive small sailing vessels. The name was attributed to the fertility of the neighborhood, which gave rise to the mythological associations of the garden of the [[Hesperides]]<ref>{{cite book | year = 2002| author = Ham, Anthony | publisher = [[Lonely Planet]] ([[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]; [[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]) | title = Libya | page = 156 | isbn = 978-0-86442-699-4}}</ref> The ancient city existed on a raised piece of land opposite of what is now the Sidi-Abayd graveyard in the Northern Benghazi suburb of Sbikhat al-Salmani (al-Salmani [[Marsh]]).\n\nThe city is first mentioned by ancient sources in [[Herodotus]]' account of the revolt of Barca and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] expedition to [[Cyrenaica]] in c. 515 BC, where it is stated that the punitive force sent by the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|satrap of Egypt]] conquered Cyrenaica as far west as Euesperides.<ref>Herodotus, IV.204.</ref> The oldest coins minted in the city date back to 480 BC. One side of those coins has an engraving of Delphi. The other side is an engraving of a [[silphium]] plant, once the symbol of trade from Cyrenaica because of its use as a rich seasoning and as a medicine. The coinage suggests that the city must have enjoyed some autonomy from Cyrene in the early 5th century BC, when the issues of Euesperides had their own types with the legend EU(ES), distinct from those of Cyrene.\n\nThe city was in hostile territory and was surrounded by inhospitable tribes. The Greek historian [[Thucydides]] mentions a siege of the city in 414 BC, by Libyans who were probably the Nasamones: Euesperides was saved by the unexpected arrival of the [[Sparta]]n general [[Gylippus]] and his fleet, who were blown to Libya by contrary winds on their way to [[Sicily]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Economou, Maria |date=August 1993| url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ElAnt/V1N4/economou.html |title=Euesperides: A Devastated Site| publisher=Digital Library and Archives, [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]]|accessdate= 6 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nOne of the Cyrenean kings whose fate is connected with the city is [[Arcesilaus IV of Cyrene|Arcesilaus IV]]. The king used his [[chariot]] victory at the [[Pythian Games]] of 462 BC to attract new settlers to Euesperides, where Arcesilaus hoped to create a safe refuge for himself against the resentment of the people of Cyrene. This proved ineffective, since when the king fled to Euesperides during the anticipated revolution (around 440 BC), he was assassinated, thus terminating the almost 200-year rule of the [[Battiadae|Battiad dynasty]].\n\nAn inscription found there and dated around the middle of the 4th century BC states that the city had a constitution similar to that of Cyrene, with a board of chief magistrates (''[[ephors]]'') and a council of elders (''gerontes''). Later in the 4th century BC, during the unsettled period which followed Alexander's death, the city backed the losing side in a revolt by the Spartan adventurer Thibron; trying to create an empire for himself, he was defeated by the Cyreneans and their allies.\n\nAfter the marriage around the middle of the 3rd century BC of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes|Ptolemy III]] to [[Berenice II|Berenice]], daughter of the Cyrenean [[Magas of Cyrene|Governor Magas]], many Cyrenaican cities were renamed to mark the occasion. Euesperides became '''Berenice''' and the change of name also involved a relocation. Its desertion was probably due to the [[silting]] up of the lagoons; Berenice, the place they moved to, lies underneath Benghazi's modern city centre. The Greek colony had lasted from the 6th to the mid-3rd centuries BC.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Romans and Christianity===\nModern Benghazi, on the [[Gulf of Sidra]], lies a little southwest of the site of the ancient Greek city of ''Berenice'' or ''Berenicis'' or ''Bernici''.

The new city was later given the name '''''Hesperides''''', in reference to the [[Hesperides]], the guardians of the mythic western paradise. The name may have also referred to green [[Oasis|oases]] in low-lying areas in the nearby coastal plain. \n\nBenghazi later became a Roman city and greatly prospered for 600 years. The city superseded Cyrene and [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] as the chief center of Cyrenaica after the 3rd century AD and during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] attacks; in 642\u2013643 -when was conquered by the Arabs and partially destroyed- it had dwindled to an insignificant village among magnificent historic ruins.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn its more prosperous period, Berenice became a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[bishopric]]. The first of its bishops whose name is recorded in extant documents is Ammon, to whom [[Dionysius of Alexandria]] wrote in about 260.

Benghazi population was made up of more than 35 per cent of Italians in 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dadfeatured.blogspot.com/2018/09/bengasi-italiana.html|title=Dadfeatured: ITALIAN BENGHAZI|last=Bjunior|date=13 September 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\nAs a consequence, there was in Cyrenaica and mostly in Benghazi a huge economic development in the second half of the 1930s. Benghazi grew to be a modern city with a new airport, new railways station, new seaplane station, an enlarged port and many facilities. Benghazi was going to be connected in 1940 by a new railway to Tripoli, but in summer of that year war started between Italians and British and infrastructure development came to a standstill.\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring [[Operation Compass]] in [[World War II]], Benghazi was captured from the Italians by [[Combe Force]] on 6 February 1941.\n\nIt was recaptured by [[Axis powers]], led by general [[Erwin Rommel]] of the [[Afrika Korps|German Africa Corps]], on 4 April.<ref>Keegan, John.

Omar Mukhtar Street.jpg|thumb|right|Omar Al Mukhtar Street in the Italian quarter was traditionally home to an urbane demographic, before many families left the old town to resettle elsewhere in the city.]]\nAs with other cities in Libya, there is a reasonable amount of ethnic diversity in Benghazi. The people of eastern Libya, Benghazi included, have in the past always been of predominantly [[Berbers|Berber]] descent. In recent times, however, there has been an influx of [[Africa]]n immigrants into Benghazi. There are also many [[Egypt]]ian immigrants in Benghazi. A small [[Greek people|Greek]] community also exists in Benghazi. The [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Crete]] is a short distance from Benghazi, and many families in Benghazi today bear Cretan surnames. There are even a few [[Italian people|Italian]]-related families, left from the colonial times before [[World War II]].\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Libyans in Benghazi were of Berber descent until the arrival of Bani Salim (Arabic tribe). In the 11th century, the [[Sa'ada]] tribe from the [[Bani Salim]] migrated to Cyrenaica; each sub-tribe from the Sa'adi historically controlled a section of Cyrenaica. Benghazi and its surrounding areas were controlled by [[Barghathi]] tribe. In modern times, Benghazi has seen a lot of Libyans from different parts of the country move into the city, especially since the Kingdom era. Many came to Benghazi from [[Misrata]]. Thus Benghazi has always been seen as a welcoming city, a city which the local Bedouins refer to as 'Benghazi rabayit al thayih' which can be translated as, 'Benghazi raises the lost', as many immigrants who arrived from the Western Maghreb or the former Al Andalus came with little money, clothes or food and were looked after very generously by the local Bedouin population as well as those arriving following the Italian war from western Libya.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Maydan al Baladiya.jpg|thumb|left|The Atiq Mosque in Maydan al-Baladiya is the oldest mosque in Benghazi. The majority of people in the city are Sunni Muslims.]]\nThe predominant religion in Benghazi is [[Islam]]. Practically all of the city's inhabitants are [[Sunni]] Muslims. During Islamic holidays such as Ramadan, most abstain from food; restaurants are usually empty during the day, with the exception of some expatriates and tourists. Alcohol is banned by law in Benghazi and throughout Libya in accordance with Islamic principles. The conservative Islamic nature of Benghazi creates a strong sense of family life in the city \u2013  practically all teenagers and young adults live at home until they get married. Many Muslims in Benghazi adhere to the traditional [[Maliki]] school of religious law, however much less so than in decades past. In recent years, more people are beginning to practice [[Salafism]] with the spread of literalist inclined Islamic television channels. It is not uncommon therefore to see woman wearing black [[niqab]]s and men with full beards in Benghazi because of the existence of such schools, although not exclusively for that purpose.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/future-shock |title=Future shock |last=Athanasiadis |first=Iason |publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |date=29 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111085704/http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/future-shock |archive-date=2016-11-11 |access-date=6 September 2010 }}Athanasiadis, Iason (29 May 2009).

It was initially housed in the royal Al Manar Palace before receiving its own campus in 1968. It was later split and became known as [[University of Benghazi]]. There are some private universities such as [[Libyan International Medical University]].\n\nEducation in Benghazi, as is throughout Libya, is compulsory and free. Compulsory education continues up until [[ninth grade]]. There are many public primary and secondary schools scattered throughout the city as well as some private schools.\n\nUniversity education is also free for all Libyan citizens in Benghazi. There are many other foreign schools such as [[Benghazi European School]] & private schools but G.International is the best for the wards.\n\nThe country's largest library containing over 300,000 volumes is affiliated with the university.\n\nInternational schools include:\n* [[International School Benghazi]]\n* [[Benghazi European School]]\n* [[British School in Benghazi]]\n\n== Geography ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Benghazi 20.08955E 32.10942N.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Benghazi]]\nBenghazi is one of the sub-regions of the area referred to as [[Cyrenaica]], the others being the [[Jebel Akhdar, Libya|Jebel Akhdar]] and the coastal plain running east of [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]]. Cyrenaica is surrounded by desert on three sides, hence in ancient times the most accessible civilisation was to the North, across the Mediterranean, in [[Crete]] and [[Greece]], only {{convert|400|km|abbr=off}} away.\n\nBenghazi is surrounded by the \"barr\", arid [[steppe]]. The Jebel Akhdar, literally, \"the Green Mountain\", just north of Benghazi, rises to the east. Here the vegetation and climate is more Mediterranean in feel with none of the desert landscapes found further south. A large section of the western Jebel Akhdar is taken up by the fertile Marj plain. Further east is the second level of the Jebel Akhdar, between {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=off}} and over {{convert|875|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, often thickly wooded and cut by [[Canyon|ravines]]. Annual rainfall here, especially around Cyrene, can reach {{convert|500|mm|in|abbr=off}}. It was this fertile site northeast of Benghazi that the Greeks chose for their settlement. The soil in Benghazi is a rich red colour and very [[clay]]ey. [[Sirocco]] winds are not uncommon in the city, and as such, many of Benghazi's smaller streets and buildings can be quite dusty.\n\nTo the north, below the steep cliffs of the [[plateau]], lies a narrow belt of Mediterranean farmland. Olives and other mediterranean fruits and vegetables are grown here. To the south, the forest and farmland gives way to juniper bush [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] and pre-desert scrub with some winter grazing.\n\nAs a [[Districts of Libya|district]], Benghazi borders [[Hizam Al Akhdar]], which surrounds it on land.\n\n=== Natural recreation and parks ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Bodzeera.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Al-Buduzeera is one of the largest and most popular parks in Benghazi.]]\nAlthough Benghazi does not have a high percentage of green space per resident, there are a few public parks and green recreational areas in the city. Perhaps the most famous is the zoological garden and theme park in Al-Fuwayhat; the park is referred to locally as ''al-Bosco'', an Italian name for wood (as in \"Belleau Wood\", not as in \"wood plank\"). The park is a combination of a zoo full of trees built during Italian rule (which contains wild cats, primates, elephants, birds and other animals) and a small theme park of electric rides, added later in the 1980s as part of a redevelopment of the entire site. It is one of the most popular parks in Benghazi, and is very busy on public holidays, as well as amongst school children and [[Public Scout and Girl Guide Movement|scouts]] on outings.\n\nOn Gamal Abdel Nasser Street is 23 July Park, another large green space which faces the Tibesti Hotel and borders the waterfront. The park is popular amongst teenagers, and families on Thursday nights (as Friday is a day off work throughout Libya). Another large and popular park is al-Buduzira in North Benghazi on the al-'Uruba Road in al-Kwayfiya. The park surrounds a natural lake, and is more rugged in nature than the city parks. A section of al-Buduzira is also a water park with large slides, whilst the southern part of the park has picnic areas which are popular in the summers.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBenghazi has a warm [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BSh''). In the north of the city lies the Mediterranean-climate 'Jabal Al-Akhdar' (Green Mountains), and in the south the climate is becoming desert-like. Summers in Benghazi are hot and rainless, but with high levels of humidity. Winters are mild with occasional rain. Annual rainfall is low at {{convert|270|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. The city's local water supply is supplemented by groundwater transported from the aquifers of southern Libya along the [[Great Manmade River]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Benghazi ([[Benina International Airport]])\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 26.3\n|Feb record high C = 31.7\n|Mar record high C = 38.0\n|Apr record high C = 39.0\n|May record high C = 44.8\n|Jun record high C = 45.6\n|Jul record high C = 42.4\n|Aug record high C = 43.9\n|Sep record high C = 42.1\n|Oct record high C = 38.3\n|Nov record high C = 37.2\n|Dec record high C = 30.0\n|year record high C = 45.6\n|Jan high C = 16.7\n|Feb high C = 18.0\n|Mar high C = 20.3\n|Apr high C = 24.7\n|May high C = 28.9\n|Jun high C = 31.8\n|Jul high C = 31.7\n|Aug high C = 32.3\n|Sep high C = 30.8\n|Oct high C = 27.8\n|Nov high C = 23.2\n|Dec high C = 18.4\n|year high C = 25.4\n|Jan mean C = 12.5\n|Feb mean C = 13.2\n|Mar mean C = 14.9\n|Apr mean C = 18.7\n|May mean C = 22.5\n|Jun mean C = 25.5\n|Jul mean C = 25.9\n|Aug mean C = 26.5\n|Sep mean C = 25.1\n|Oct mean C = 22.1\n|Nov mean C = 18.2\n|Dec mean C = 14.1\n|year mean C = 19.9\n|Jan low C = 8.3\n|Feb low C = 8.4\n|Mar low C = 9.5\n|Apr low C = 12.8\n|May low C = 16.0\n|Jun low C = 19.2\n|Jul low C = 20.2\n|Aug low C = 20.8\n|Sep low C = 19.4\n|Oct low C = 16.5\n|Nov low C = 13.3\n|Dec low C = 9.9\n|year low C = 14.5\n|Jan record low C = 1.7\n|Feb record low C = 1.7\n|Mar record low C = 1.7\n|Apr record low C = 3.9\n|May record low C = 6.1\n|Jun record low C = 10.0\n|Jul record low C = 14.8\n|Aug record low C = 14.4\n|Sep record low C = 10.0\n|Oct record low C = 10.8\n|Nov record low C = 5.6\n|Dec record low C = 3.9\n|year record low C = 1.7\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 67\n|Feb rain mm = 42\n|Mar rain mm = 29\n|Apr rain mm = 9\n|May rain mm = 4\n|Jun rain mm = 0\n|Jul rain mm = 0\n|Aug rain mm = 0\n|Sep rain mm = 4\n|Oct rain mm = 18\n|Nov rain mm = 30\n|Dec rain mm = 65\n|year rain mm = 270\n|unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan rain days = 13\n|Feb rain days = 8\n|Mar rain days = 6\n|Apr rain days = 2\n|May rain days = 2\n|Jun rain days = 0\n|Jul rain days = 0\n|Aug rain days = 0\n|Sep rain days = 1\n|Oct rain days = 4\n|Nov rain days = 6\n|Dec rain days = 12\n|year rain days = 55\n|Jan humidity = 76\n|Feb humidity = 73\n|Mar humidity = 67\n|Apr humidity = 58\n|May humidity = 55\n|Jun humidity = 55\n|Jul humidity = 65\n|Aug humidity = 67\n|Sep humidity = 65\n|Oct humidity = 64\n|Nov humidity = 70\n|Dec humidity = 74\n|year humidity = 66\n|Jan sun = 201.5\n|Feb sun = 220.4\n|Mar sun = 244.9\n|Apr sun = 264.0\n|May sun = 325.5\n|Jun sun = 336.0\n|Jul sun = 390.6\n|Aug sun = 365.8\n|Sep sun = 291.0\n|Oct sun = 248.0\n|Nov sun = 222.0\n|Dec sun = 170.5\n|year sun =\n|Jand sun = 6.5\n|Febd sun = 7.8\n|Mard sun = 7.9\n|Aprd sun = 8.8\n|Mayd sun = 10.5\n|Jund sun = 11.2\n|Juld sun = 12.6\n|Augd sun = 11.8\n|Sepd sun = 9.7\n|Octd sun = 8.0\n|Novd sun = 7.4\n|Decd sun = 5.5\n|yeard sun = 9.0\n|source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_620530_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Benina (Bengasi-Flugh.) / Libyen\n| trans-title = Climate table of Benina (Benghazi Airport), Libya\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = 27 March 2016}} Temperatures and precipitation days 1945-1977, precipitation 1961-1990, humidity 1973-1993</ref>\n|source 2 = Arab Meteorology Book (sun only)<ref name=climate>{{cite web\n| url = http://extras.springer.com/2007/978-1-4020-4577-6/Book_Shahin_ISBN_9781402045776_Appendix.pdf\n| title = Appendix I: Meteorological Data\n| publisher = Springer\n| accessdate = 27 March 2016}}</ref>\n|date=July 2012\n}}\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Jeliana Bridge Benghazi.JPG|thumb|The cubic tower block Al Da'waa al-Islamiya is an important office building in Benghazi; many small and large companies in the city are based in the tower.]]\nBenghazi, as the principal city of eastern Libya, is one of Libya's major economic centres. The city has an important port which is vital to the economy, as Libya imports many foodstuffs and manufactured products. Benghazi is also an industrial and commercial centre in Libya. Major manufactured goods include [[processed food]], [[textiles]], tanning, processed salt and [[construction|construction materials]], particularly [[cement]]; a large cement factory is located in al-Hawari. Food processing is based on local fish, imported goods, and the produce of irrigated coastal lowlands and the nearby Jabal al-Akdhar Mountains, including cereal, dates, olives, wool and meat.<ref>Marshall Cavendish Corporation, \"World and Its Peoples, North Africa\". 2006. p. 1,227.</ref>\n\nFinance is also important to the city's economy, with the Libyan Bank of Commerce and Development maintaining branches in Benghazi; the Bank's headquarters is a high office tower on Gamal Abdel Nasser Street in el-Berka. Other large banks include the [[Central Bank of Libya]] office in the city centre.\n\nThe [[oil industry]] drives the city's commerce. Large national companies such as the Al-Brega Oil Marketing Company and the [[Arabian Gulf Oil Company]] are important to the city's economy and employ many people. An increase in consumer prices has been coupled with an increase in the importance of the retail sector to the city's economy.{{When|date=March 2011}} In recent years, international franchises such as [[Benetton Group|United Colors of Benetton]], [[H&M]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] have opened in Benghazi.\n\nTourism is still in its very early stages in Libya. The industry is however growing in importance in Benghazi. The majority of tourists that visit Eastern Libya use Benghazi as a base for which to explore the Greek ruins in Cyrene or to make desert excursions south in [[Kufra]]. The two main hotels in the city are the Tibesti Hotel and Uzu Hotel, and several other hotels have opened in recent years{{When|date=March 2011}} to cater for increased demand. Handicrafts are found in the many [[souk]]s in the city, but are of little significance to the economy.\n\n[[Skanska]] built a good connection of speedways and flyovers in the decades after the Libyan revolution in 1969; this has made the transport of goods between Benghazi and other cities easier. Benghazi's air transport uses [[Benina International Airport]]; numerous daily flights leave for Tripoli and connections are also available to other African, Asian and European cities.\n\nIn April 2012, the Libyan economy ministry announced plans for creating a [[free trade area]] in Benghazi.<ref>Sarrar, Saleh: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-11/libya-to-revive-plan-for-benghazi-free-trade-area-official-says.html ''Libya to Revive Plan for Benghazi Free-Trade Area, Official Says'']. ''bloomberg.com'', 11 April 2012.</ref>\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{main|Transport in Libya}}\n[[File:Jeliana Bridge.JPG|thumb|The Jeliana Bridge connects Jeliana with the city centre and old town.]]\nBenghazi is a transport hub in Eastern Libya and is an important city on the northern coastal road that crosses the country. An efficiently designed system of roads, bridges and underpasses cover Benghazi, however traffic jams and poorly maintained streets are not uncommon. A [[microbus]] system covers many areas of the city and has its base in Al-Funduq. National and international bus services also leave from Al-Fudnuq from the central bus station. {{As of|2010}}, [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] were underway in the city for a rail network which will traverse northern Libya.\n\n[[Benina International Airport]] serves national and international flights.\n\nThe Benghazi port is a vital terminal for the region, and allows for the import and export of national and international goods and food products.\n\nThe city's road network is generally well designed. An efficient system of highways, [[Overpass|flyovers]], [[Ring road|ringroads]] and underpasses serve the city, and allow for the transport of goods and vehicles. The roads are not always well-maintained however, and often have incorrect, poorly visible or no road markings, as well as potholes in some roads and inner-city streets. In recent years, a rapid increase in car ownership has meant that traffic jams, lack of parking spaces and overcrowding are also not uncommon, especially on smaller streets. Road accidents are also on the rise because of the increase in vehicles and the subsequent lax in attention given by authorities to dangerous driving.<ref>Bodalal, Zuhir; Bendardaf, Riyad; Ambarek, Mohammed (2012).

Retrieved 15 February 2015.</ref>\n\nThere is no systemised public transport system in Benghazi despite the city's size and significance. A popular system of microbuses has developed in recent years; bus journeys run on fixed routes and passengers can embark and disembark anywhere on the route. Most microbuses stop at Al-Funduq or have the end of Souq Al-Jarid in Al-Funduq as their final destination. National and international coach services depart and arrive at Benghazi's coach station at Al-Funduq with regular journeys to Tripoli, as well as international services to Cairo, Amman and Damascus.\n\nUntil the 1960s there were two small railways, built by the Italians, departing from Benghazi and served with classical ''Littorine'': Benghazi-Barce and Benghazi-Soluch. But recently huge railway plans were supported by Gaddafi: work started in September 2008 on a new railway network that would connect to major cities of western Libya at [[Sirte]]. [[Russian Railways]] is responsible for the three-year contract. In the future, a rail link may be built to both Tunisia and Egypt forming a North African coastal rail network.\n\n== Cityscape ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Benghazi Tourist Park (Benghazi Zoo).JPG|thumb|left|Benghazi Zoo (al-Bosco) in al-Fuwayhat, one of Benghazi's greenest and wealthiest neighbourhoods.]]\nThe city is divided into many neighbourhoods, some of which were founded during Italian Colonial rule and many which have developed as a result of modern [[urban sprawl]]. The different neighbourhoods vary in their levels of economic prosperity, as well as their cultural, historic and social atmosphere. Generally, the city is roughly divided into the following areas: Central Benghazi (colloquially referred to as al-Blaad by locals) \u2013 includes the medina, and the old quarter, Central Districts which circle the downtown \u2013 Al-Sabri, Sidi Abayd, Sidi Hsayn, Al-Berka, Al-Salmani, Al-Hadaa'ik, Al-Fuwayhat and Al-Keesh, Central Suburbs \u2013 Al-Laythi, Bu Atni, Al-Quwarsha, Al-Hawari, Coastal Districts \u2013 Al-Kwayfiya (North), Garyounis, Bu-Fakhra and Jarrutha (South), and the Distant Suburbs \u2013 Gimeenis, Benina and Sidi Khalifa.\n\nCentral Benghazi is where the majority of Benghazi's historical monuments are located, and has the city's most popular tourist attractions. Virtually all of Benghazi's theatres, libraries, best clothing stores, markets and old mosques can be found there. The Italian quarter is also located in the centre. The central districts are mostly residential and commercial areas such as Sidi Hsayn. The central suburbs are almost entirely residential and more like little towns in their own right; Al-Quwarsha is a good example of this. The coastal districts (especially the southern districts) are where Benghazi's beaches can be found. Some sections have become more popular as residential areas in recent years (such as Qanfuda). These areas are still primarily recreational however, and many beach [[condominium]] resorts (known locally as [[chalet]]s) have been built in previous years such as those at al-Nakheel beach, and the Nayrouz condominiums.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\nBenghazi is one of the cultural centres of Libya and is a base for tourists, visitors and academics in the region. Throughout its history, Benghazi has developed with a certain level of independence from the more [[Maghreb]] oriented capital Tripoli. This has influenced the city, and as such, the cultural atmosphere in Benghazi is more Arab in nature than that in Tripoli. An influx immigrants including Egyptian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Sudanese and Syrian immigrants have also influenced the city's culture to a certain extent in recent years.\n\nThe city centre contains a few local theatres, as well as the Dar al-Kutub National Library in Al-Funduq, where the works of popular local novelists like [[Sadeq Naihoum]] and Khalifa al-Fakhri can be found. Different architectural styles attest to the different empires that have controlled the city throughout history. Sport is also important in the city; two of Libya's most successful football clubs are based in Benghazi.\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThere is a variety of architectural styles in Benghazi, which reflect the number of times the city has changed hands throughout its history. Arab, Ottoman and Italian rule have influenced the different streetscapes, buildings and quarters in Benghazi.\n\nAncient architectural remains of the Greek and later Roman settlement of Berenice can be found by the Italian lighthouse. There is a trace of the 3rd century BC wall built by the Greeks, four Roman peristyle houses, six wine vats. A Byzantine church also exists on the site, with a mosaic still intact. These ruins formed the northern part of the ancient city, which extended south and east but now lies buried beneath the modern city.\n\nThe next oldest section of the city is the [[Medina quarter]], which began to grow sometime under Medieval Arab rule, and is still intact today. This quarter stretches out from the Northern shores of the harbour, and covers an area roughly bounded by Ahmed Rafiq al-Mahdawi Street to the North-west, al-Jezayir Street to the South-east and 23 July Street to the South-west. The heart of the medina is Maydan al-Hurriya (Freedom Square); to the northeast of this is the covered [[Souq]] al-Jareed.<ref>Ham. p. 125.</ref>\n[[File:Ottoman Fort Benghazi.JPG|thumb|left|Al-Berka Palace in Benghazi was built in two parts. The front fa\u00e7ade was built by the Ottomans in the late 19th century, the two side sections were later added during Italian rule.]]\nThe largest Ottoman architectural monument in Benghazi is the late 19th-century Ottoman palace in El-Berka; built during the rule of Rashid Pasha II. The front elevation was completed in 1895, whilst the side sections were added later during Italian rule. The white and green structure houses 360 rooms; and is on a tract of land where [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] Street meets al-Saqzali Street; south of the [[March 28 Stadium|28 March football stadium]].\n\nThe house of Omar Pasha Mansour El Kikhia, an Ottoman Pasha from a prominent Benghazi family, represents a good example of Ottoman residential architecture with several balconies, stone archways, and an open courtyard containing a fountain. The home was recently restored, remodeled and converted into the Bait-al Medina al-Thaqafi museum.\n\n[[File:Italian Lighthouse - Benghazi.jpg|thumb|Italian lighthouse in Benghazi, built in 1922 during Italian colonial rule.]]\nBenghazi came under Italian rule in the early part of the 20th century. Some examples of [[Italianate]], as well as [[modernist]] colonial architecture from this period remain today. Under the governorships of Generals [[Ernesto Mombelli]] and [[Attilio Teruzzi]] in the 1920s, the buildings commissioned in Benghazi had an eclectic architectural language that embodied a Western conception of Eastern architecture. An example of this is the [[Benghazi Municipal Hall|Municipal palace]] built in 1924, which stands in Maydan al-Hurriya (Freedom Square). The building combines [[Moorish Revival|Moorish]] arches with Italianate motifs on the fa\u00e7ade. Italians even did the first architectural plan of Benghazi.<ref>[http://www.paolocason.it/Libia/fotolibia/wpe210.jpg \"Italian Urban Plan of Benghazi\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722044946/http://www.paolocason.it/Libia/fotolibia/wpe210.jpg |date=22 July 2011 }}.</ref> in the 1930s, with a new [[Italian Libya Railways|railway station]] and promenade.\n\nThe largest colonial building from this Italian period is the [[Benghazi Cathedral]] in Maydan El Catedraeya (Cathedral Square), which was built in the 1920s and has two large distinct domes.<ref>McLaren, Brian L. (2006).  ''Architecture and Tourism in Italian Colonial Libya&nbsp;\u2013 An Ambivalent Modernism''. [[University of Washington Press]] ([[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]). p. 158.  {{ISBN|978-0-295-98542-8}}.</ref>\n\nBenghazi was heavily bombed during World War II, and so the majority of buildings in the city are examples of modern or contemporary architecture. The central business district was built mostly in the 1960s and 1970s with Libya's new found oil wealth. The highest building in Benghazi is the Tibesti Hotel on Gamal Abdel Nasser Street built in 1989. Another prominent example of modern architecture in Benghazi is the Da'wah al-Islamiyah Building, which has a series of distinctive cubes piled in the shape of a pyramid.\n\nImportant colonial buildings designed during Italian rule include the Berenice Cinema (currently under renovation) which was designed Marcello Piacentini and Luigi Piccinato in 1928.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== Sports ===\nBenghazi is the second largest city in Libya, and as such, has some of the best sports facilities in the country. The city has various sporting centres of different standards, such as football stadia, beach clubs (where many water sports are played), as well as several other public and private facilities. Benghazi has hosted many national sports events throughout the years, as well as more significant international competitions such as the [[African Cup of Nations]].\n\nFootball is the most-popular sport in Benghazi, and two of Libya's most-successful football clubs, [[Al-Ahly (Benghazi)|Al-Ahly Benghazi]] and [[Al-Nasr SC (Benghazi)|Al-Nasr]] Benghazi, are based in the city. The two teams have won the [[Libyan Premier League]] five times; Al Ahly four and Al Nasr only one. The most-important football event that took place in Benghazi was the [[1982 African Cup of Nations]]. The city hosted six group games and a semifinal in the [[March 28 Stadium]], Libya's second-largest stadium. The city will very likely be the scene of more games when Libya re-hosts the African Cup of Nations in 2013.\n\nThe largest sporting centre in Benghazi is the Medina al-Riyadhia (Sports City). The complex is situated just south of the city centre, and houses the 28 March Stadium, and the Slayman al Tharrat basketball stadium&nbsp;\u2013 several matches of the [[FIBA Africa Championship 2009|2009 FIBA Africa Championship]] were hosted at the arena.<ref>[http://www.fiba-afrique.org/en/lect_actu.php?titre=evene&id=4314 \"Afrobasket 2009&nbsp;\u2013 Libya\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813235059/http://www.fiba-afrique.org/en/lect_actu.php?titre=evene&id=4314 |date=13 August 2009 }}. ''FIBA Afrique''.  Retrieved 26 February 2009.</ref> The complex also has a sports hall for indoor sports, a tennis stadium and several small tennis courts. The facility was built in the 1950s and is therefore quite outdated; the stadia have nonetheless undergone maintenance work in recent years. Sports City was recently closed down for a complete redevelopment of the site. {{As of|2009}}, the 28 March Stadium was undergoing demolition work, and a new 45,000 all seater stadium was to be constructed in its place. A second smaller stadium was to be built on-site, and the entire site was to undergo redevelopment before its reopening in 2011, and its use in the 2013 African Nations Cup.\n\nThe Eastern suburb of Sidi Khalifa accommodates an equestrian sports facility. The 'Martyrs of Benghazi's Riding Club' boasts a number of female members who, at least until 2016, engaged in sportive competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://locallibya.com/en/article/sport/martyrs-benghazi|title=The Martyrs of Benghazi {{!}} Local Libya|website=locallibya.com|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\nBenghazi is a coastal city, and its beaches are an important location for sporting activities. The coast at Jeliana is home to the Milaha Beach Club amongst others. Wind surfing and swimming are two of the most popular water sports. There are also several contact sport clubs in the city&nbsp;\u2013[[judo]] and [[taekwondo]] are popular men's sports in Benghazi. In recent times, [[rugby sevens]] has seen great success with three clubs in the vicinity.  Gyms have also become more popular in the city in recent years, because of a greater concern for healthy living amongst Libyans.\n\n=== Food ===\nFood and drink is very important to the culture of the people of Benghazi, as it is in the rest of Libya. Many of the dishes and ingredients used are passed down as tradition from generation to generation. The main ingredients that are used in their cuisine are olive oil, garlic, palm dates, grains, and milk. These products are natural to this area, and these ingredients are very common to much of North Africa and the Mediterranean. Another tradition of Libyan culinary culture is tea. Tea from Benghazi has a uniquely thick, bitter taste. Tea drinking is a social activity that close friends and relatives usually take part in.\n\nBenghazi is home to many distinctive dishes that can be prepared in the home. Bazin is one of the most well known of these dishes. Bazin is a dish consisting of a small loaf of heated dough and a meat or vegetable sauce. The dough can be ripped into bite-sized pieces and dipped into the sauce. This dish uses essential ingredients such as garlic and oil. Other dishes like Couscous are more well known around the world and adopted by other cultures. One common dessert that can be found in Benghazi is deep fried dates. These are often served with milk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.temehu.com/Libyan-food.htm|title=Libyan Food and the main dishes & meals in

In the 3rd century BC, it was relocated and refounded as the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] city of Berenice. Berenice prospered under the Romans, and after the 3rd century AD it superseded [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] as the center of Cyrenaica. The city went into decline during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period and had already been reduced to a small town before [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|its conquest by the Arabs]]. In 1911, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] captured Benghazi and the rest of [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Under Italian rule, Benghazi witnessed a period of extensive development and modernization, particularly in the second half of the 1930s. The city changed hands several times during [[World War II]] and was heavily damaged in the process. After the war Benghazi was rebuilt and became the co-capital of the newly independent [[Kingdom of Libya]].

It continues to hold institutions and organizations normally associated with a capital city, including several national government buildings as well as the [[National Library of Libya]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Benghazi|Timeline of Benghazi}}\n\n=== Ancient Greek Colony ===\n[[File:Panathenaic amphora Louvre MN705.jpg|thumb|A [[panathenaic amphora]] found in Benghazi from the times of ''Euesperides'', the ancient Greek city that is now Benghazi.]]\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city that existed within the modern day boundaries of Benghazi was founded around 525 BC; at the time, it was called '''Euesperides''' ({{lang-grc|\u0395\u1f50\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2}})<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/241#E284.19 Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, \u00a7E284.19]</ref> and '''Hesperis''' ({{lang-grc|\u1f19\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c2}}).<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/241#E282.16 Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, \u00a7E282.16]</ref>\nEuesperides was most likely founded by people from [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] or [[Barca (ancient city)|Barce]], which was located on the edge of a lagoon which opened from the sea. At the time, this area may have been deep enough to receive small sailing vessels. The name was attributed to the fertility of the neighborhood, which gave rise to the mythological associations of the garden of the [[Hesperides]]<ref>{{cite book | year = 2002| author = Ham, Anthony | publisher = [[Lonely Planet]] ([[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]; [[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]) | title = Libya | page = 156 | isbn = 978-0-86442-699-4}}</ref> The ancient city existed on a raised piece of land opposite of what is now the Sidi-Abayd graveyard in the Northern Benghazi suburb of Sbikhat al-Salmani (al-Salmani [[Marsh]]).\n\nThe city is first mentioned by ancient sources in [[Herodotus]]' account of the revolt of Barca and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] expedition to [[Cyrenaica]] in c. 515 BC, where it is stated that the punitive force sent by the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|satrap of Egypt]] conquered Cyrenaica as far west as Euesperides.<ref>Herodotus, IV.204.</ref> The oldest coins minted in the city date back to 480 BC. One side of those coins has an engraving of Delphi. The other side is an engraving of a [[silphium]] plant, once the symbol of trade from Cyrenaica because of its use as a rich seasoning and as a medicine. The coinage suggests that the city must have enjoyed some autonomy from Cyrene in the early 5th century BC, when the issues of Euesperides had their own types with the legend EU(ES), distinct from those of Cyrene.\n\nThe city was in hostile territory and was surrounded by inhospitable tribes. The Greek historian [[Thucydides]] mentions a siege of the city in 414 BC, by Libyans who were probably the Nasamones: Euesperides was saved by the unexpected arrival of the [[Sparta]]n general [[Gylippus]] and his fleet, who were blown to Libya by contrary winds on their way to [[Sicily]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Economou, Maria |date=August 1993| url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ElAnt/V1N4/economou.html |title=Euesperides: A Devastated Site| publisher=Digital Library and Archives, [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]]|accessdate= 6 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nOne of the Cyrenean kings whose fate is connected with the city is [[Arcesilaus IV of Cyrene|Arcesilaus IV]]. The king used his [[chariot]] victory at the [[Pythian Games]] of 462 BC to attract new settlers to Euesperides, where Arcesilaus hoped to create a safe refuge for himself against the resentment of the people of Cyrene. This proved ineffective, since when the king fled to Euesperides during the anticipated revolution (around 440 BC), he was assassinated, thus terminating the almost 200-year rule of the [[Battiadae|Battiad dynasty]].\n\nAn inscription found there and dated around the middle of the 4th century BC states that the city had a constitution similar to that of Cyrene, with a board of chief magistrates (''[[ephors]]'') and a council of elders (''gerontes''). Later in the 4th century BC, during the unsettled period which followed Alexander's death, the city backed the losing side in a revolt by the Spartan adventurer Thibron; trying to create an empire for himself, he was defeated by the Cyreneans and their allies.\n\nAfter the marriage around the middle of the 3rd century BC of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes|Ptolemy III]] to [[Berenice II|Berenice]], daughter of the Cyrenean [[Magas of Cyrene|Governor Magas]], many Cyrenaican cities were renamed to mark the occasion. Euesperides became '''Berenice''' and the change of name also involved a relocation. Its desertion was probably due to the [[silting]] up of the lagoons; Berenice, the place they moved to, lies underneath Benghazi's modern city centre. The Greek colony had lasted from the 6th to the mid-3rd centuries BC.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Romans and Christianity===\nModern Benghazi, on the [[Gulf of Sidra]], lies a little southwest of the site of the ancient Greek city of ''Berenice'' or ''Berenicis'' or ''Bernici''.

The new city was later given the name '''''Hesperides''''', in reference to the [[Hesperides]], the guardians of the mythic western paradise. The name may have also referred to green [[Oasis|oases]] in low-lying areas in the nearby coastal plain. \n\nBenghazi later became a Roman city and greatly prospered for 600 years. The city superseded Cyrene and [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] as the chief center of Cyrenaica after the 3rd century AD and during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] attacks; in 642\u2013643 -when was conquered by the Arabs and partially destroyed- it had dwindled to an insignificant village among magnificent historic ruins.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn its more prosperous period, Berenice became a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[bishopric]]. The first of its bishops whose name is recorded in extant documents is Ammon, to whom [[Dionysius of Alexandria]] wrote in about 260.

Benghazi grew to be a modern city with a new airport, new railways station, new seaplane station, an enlarged port and many facilities. Benghazi was going to be connected in 1940 by a new railway to Tripoli, but in summer of that year war started between Italians and British and infrastructure development came to a standstill.\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring [[Operation Compass]] in [[World War II]], Benghazi was captured from the Italians by [[Combe Force]] on 6 February 1941.\n\nIt was recaptured by [[Axis powers]], led by general [[Erwin Rommel]] of the [[Afrika Korps|German Africa Corps]], on 4 April.<ref>Keegan, John.

Omar Mukhtar Street.jpg|thumb|right|Omar Al Mukhtar Street in the Italian quarter was traditionally home to an urbane demographic, before many families left the old town to resettle elsewhere in the city.]]\nAs with other cities in Libya, there is a reasonable amount of ethnic diversity in Benghazi. The people of eastern Libya, Benghazi included, have in the past always been of predominantly [[Berbers|Berber]] descent. In recent times, however, there has been an influx of [[Africa]]n immigrants into Benghazi. There are also many [[Egypt]]ian immigrants in Benghazi. A small [[Greek people|Greek]] community also exists in Benghazi. The [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Crete]] is a short distance from Benghazi, and many families in Benghazi today bear Cretan surnames. There are even a few [[Italian people|Italian]]-related families, left from the colonial times before [[World War II]].\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Libyans in Benghazi were of Berber descent until the arrival of Bani Salim (Arabic tribe). In the 11th century, the [[Sa'ada]] tribe from the [[Bani Salim]] migrated to Cyrenaica; each sub-tribe from the Sa'adi historically controlled a section of Cyrenaica. Benghazi and its surrounding areas were controlled by [[Barghathi]] tribe. In modern times, Benghazi has seen a lot of Libyans from different parts of the country move into the city, especially since the Kingdom era. Many came to Benghazi from [[Misrata]]. Thus Benghazi has always been seen as a welcoming city, a city which the local Bedouins refer to as 'Benghazi rabayit al thayih' which can be translated as, 'Benghazi raises the lost', as many immigrants who arrived from the Western Maghreb or the former Al Andalus came with little money, clothes or food and were looked after very generously by the local Bedouin population as well as those arriving following the Italian war from western Libya.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Maydan al Baladiya.jpg|thumb|left|The Atiq Mosque in Maydan al-Baladiya is the oldest mosque in Benghazi. The majority of people in the city are Sunni Muslims.]]\nThe predominant religion in Benghazi is [[Islam]]. Practically all of the city's inhabitants are [[Sunni]] Muslims. During Islamic holidays such as Ramadan, most abstain from food; restaurants are usually empty during the day, with the exception of some expatriates and tourists. Alcohol is banned by law in Benghazi and throughout Libya in accordance with Islamic principles. The conservative Islamic nature of Benghazi creates a strong sense of family life in the city \u2013  practically all teenagers and young adults live at home until they get married. Many Muslims in Benghazi adhere to the traditional [[Maliki]] school of religious law, however much less so than in decades past. In recent years, more people are beginning to practice [[Salafism]] with the spread of literalist inclined Islamic television channels. It is not uncommon therefore to see woman wearing black [[niqab]]s and men with full beards in Benghazi because of the existence of such schools, although not exclusively for that purpose.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/future-shock |title=Future shock |last=Athanasiadis |first=Iason |publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |date=29 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111085704/http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/future-shock |archive-date=2016-11-11 |access-date=6 September 2010 }}Athanasiadis, Iason (29 May 2009).

It was initially housed in the royal Al Manar Palace before receiving its own campus in 1968. It was later split and became known as [[University of Benghazi]]. There are some private universities such as [[Libyan International Medical University]].\n\nEducation in Benghazi, as is throughout Libya, is compulsory and free. Compulsory education continues up until [[ninth grade]]. There are many public primary and secondary schools scattered throughout the city as well as some private schools.\n\nUniversity education is also free for all Libyan citizens in Benghazi. There are many other foreign schools such as [[Benghazi European School]] & private schools but G.International is the best for the wards.\n\nThe country's largest library containing over 300,000 volumes is affiliated with the university.\n\nInternational schools include:\n* [[International School Benghazi]]\n* [[Benghazi European School]]\n* [[British School in Benghazi]]\n\n== Geography ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Benghazi 20.08955E 32.10942N.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Benghazi]]\nBenghazi is one of the sub-regions of the area referred to as [[Cyrenaica]], the others being the [[Jebel Akhdar, Libya|Jebel Akhdar]] and the coastal plain running east of [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]]. Cyrenaica is surrounded by desert on three sides, hence in ancient times the most accessible civilisation was to the North, across the Mediterranean, in [[Crete]] and [[Greece]], only {{convert|400|km|abbr=off}} away.\n\nBenghazi is surrounded by the \"barr\", arid [[steppe]]. The Jebel Akhdar, literally, \"the Green Mountain\", just north of Benghazi, rises to the east. Here the vegetation and climate is more Mediterranean in feel with none of the desert landscapes found further south. A large section of the western Jebel Akhdar is taken up by the fertile Marj plain. Further east is the second level of the Jebel Akhdar, between {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=off}} and over {{convert|875|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, often thickly wooded and cut by [[Canyon|ravines]]. Annual rainfall here, especially around Cyrene, can reach {{convert|500|mm|in|abbr=off}}. It was this fertile site northeast of Benghazi that the Greeks chose for their settlement. The soil in Benghazi is a rich red colour and very [[clay]]ey. [[Sirocco]] winds are not uncommon in the city, and as such, many of Benghazi's smaller streets and buildings can be quite dusty.\n\nTo the north, below the steep cliffs of the [[plateau]], lies a narrow belt of Mediterranean farmland. Olives and other mediterranean fruits and vegetables are grown here. To the south, the forest and farmland gives way to juniper bush [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] and pre-desert scrub with some winter grazing.\n\nAs a [[Districts of Libya|district]], Benghazi borders [[Hizam Al Akhdar]], which surrounds it on land.\n\n=== Natural recreation and parks ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Bodzeera.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Al-Buduzeera is one of the largest and most popular parks in Benghazi.]]\nAlthough Benghazi does not have a high percentage of green space per resident, there are a few public parks and green recreational areas in the city. Perhaps the most famous is the zoological garden and theme park in Al-Fuwayhat; the park is referred to locally as ''al-Bosco'', an Italian name for wood (as in \"Belleau Wood\", not as in \"wood plank\"). The park is a combination of a zoo full of trees built during Italian rule (which contains wild cats, primates, elephants, birds and other animals) and a small theme park of electric rides, added later in the 1980s as part of a redevelopment of the entire site. It is one of the most popular parks in Benghazi, and is very busy on public holidays, as well as amongst school children and [[Public Scout and Girl Guide Movement|scouts]] on outings.\n\nOn Gamal Abdel Nasser Street is 23 July Park, another large green space which faces the Tibesti Hotel and borders the waterfront. The park is popular amongst teenagers, and families on Thursday nights (as Friday is a day off work throughout Libya). Another large and popular park is al-Buduzira in North Benghazi on the al-'Uruba Road in al-Kwayfiya. The park surrounds a natural lake, and is more rugged in nature than the city parks. A section of al-Buduzira is also a water park with large slides, whilst the southern part of the park has picnic areas which are popular in the summers.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBenghazi has a warm [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BSh''). In the north of the city lies the Mediterranean-climate 'Jabal Al-Akhdar' (Green Mountains), and in the south the climate is becoming desert-like. Summers in Benghazi are hot and rainless, but with high levels of humidity. Winters are mild with occasional rain. Annual rainfall is low at {{convert|270|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. The city's local water supply is supplemented by groundwater transported from the aquifers of southern Libya along the [[Great Manmade River]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Benghazi ([[Benina International Airport]])\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 26.3\n|Feb record high C = 31.7\n|Mar record high C = 38.0\n|Apr record high C = 39.0\n|May record high C = 44.8\n|Jun record high C = 45.6\n|Jul record high C = 42.4\n|Aug record high C = 43.9\n|Sep record high C = 42.1\n|Oct record high C = 38.3\n|Nov record high C = 37.2\n|Dec record high C = 30.0\n|year record high C = 45.6\n|Jan high C = 16.7\n|Feb high C = 18.0\n|Mar high C = 20.3\n|Apr high C = 24.7\n|May high C = 28.9\n|Jun high C = 31.8\n|Jul high C = 31.7\n|Aug high C = 32.3\n|Sep high C = 30.8\n|Oct high C = 27.8\n|Nov high C = 23.2\n|Dec high C = 18.4\n|year high C = 25.4\n|Jan mean C = 12.5\n|Feb mean C = 13.2\n|Mar mean C = 14.9\n|Apr mean C = 18.7\n|May mean C = 22.5\n|Jun mean C = 25.5\n|Jul mean C = 25.9\n|Aug mean C = 26.5\n|Sep mean C = 25.1\n|Oct mean C = 22.1\n|Nov mean C = 18.2\n|Dec mean C = 14.1\n|year mean C = 19.9\n|Jan low C = 8.3\n|Feb low C = 8.4\n|Mar low C = 9.5\n|Apr low C = 12.8\n|May low C = 16.0\n|Jun low C = 19.2\n|Jul low C = 20.2\n|Aug low C = 20.8\n|Sep low C = 19.4\n|Oct low C = 16.5\n|Nov low C = 13.3\n|Dec low C = 9.9\n|year low C = 14.5\n|Jan record low C = 1.7\n|Feb record low C = 1.7\n|Mar record low C = 1.7\n|Apr record low C = 3.9\n|May record low C = 6.1\n|Jun record low C = 10.0\n|Jul record low C = 14.8\n|Aug record low C = 14.4\n|Sep record low C = 10.0\n|Oct record low C = 10.8\n|Nov record low C = 5.6\n|Dec record low C = 3.9\n|year record low C = 1.7\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 67\n|Feb rain mm = 42\n|Mar rain mm = 29\n|Apr rain mm = 9\n|May rain mm = 4\n|Jun rain mm = 0\n|Jul rain mm = 0\n|Aug rain mm = 0\n|Sep rain mm = 4\n|Oct rain mm = 18\n|Nov rain mm = 30\n|Dec rain mm = 65\n|year rain mm = 270\n|unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan rain days = 13\n|Feb rain days = 8\n|Mar rain days = 6\n|Apr rain days = 2\n|May rain days = 2\n|Jun rain days = 0\n|Jul rain days = 0\n|Aug rain days = 0\n|Sep rain days = 1\n|Oct rain days = 4\n|Nov rain days = 6\n|Dec rain days = 12\n|year rain days = 55\n|Jan humidity = 76\n|Feb humidity = 73\n|Mar humidity = 67\n|Apr humidity = 58\n|May humidity = 55\n|Jun humidity = 55\n|Jul humidity = 65\n|Aug humidity = 67\n|Sep humidity = 65\n|Oct humidity = 64\n|Nov humidity = 70\n|Dec humidity = 74\n|year humidity = 66\n|Jan sun = 201.5\n|Feb sun = 220.4\n|Mar sun = 244.9\n|Apr sun = 264.0\n|May sun = 325.5\n|Jun sun = 336.0\n|Jul sun = 390.6\n|Aug sun = 365.8\n|Sep sun = 291.0\n|Oct sun = 248.0\n|Nov sun = 222.0\n|Dec sun = 170.5\n|year sun =\n|Jand sun = 6.5\n|Febd sun = 7.8\n|Mard sun = 7.9\n|Aprd sun = 8.8\n|Mayd sun = 10.5\n|Jund sun = 11.2\n|Juld sun = 12.6\n|Augd sun = 11.8\n|Sepd sun = 9.7\n|Octd sun = 8.0\n|Novd sun = 7.4\n|Decd sun = 5.5\n|yeard sun = 9.0\n|source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_620530_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Benina (Bengasi-Flugh.) / Libyen\n| trans-title = Climate table of Benina (Benghazi Airport), Libya\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = 27 March 2016}} Temperatures and precipitation days 1945-1977, precipitation 1961-1990, humidity 1973-1993</ref>\n|source 2 = Arab Meteorology Book (sun only)<ref name=climate>{{cite web\n| url = http://extras.springer.com/2007/978-1-4020-4577-6/Book_Shahin_ISBN_9781402045776_Appendix.pdf\n| title = Appendix I: Meteorological Data\n| publisher = Springer\n| accessdate = 27 March 2016}}</ref>\n|date=July 2012\n}}\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Jeliana Bridge Benghazi.JPG|thumb|The cubic tower block Al Da'waa al-Islamiya is an important office building in Benghazi; many small and large companies in the city are based in the tower.]]\nBenghazi, as the principal city of eastern Libya, is one of Libya's major economic centres. The city has an important port which is vital to the economy, as Libya imports many foodstuffs and manufactured products. Benghazi is also an industrial and commercial centre in Libya. Major manufactured goods include [[processed food]], [[textiles]], tanning, processed salt and [[construction|construction materials]], particularly [[cement]]; a large cement factory is located in al-Hawari. Food processing is based on local fish, imported goods, and the produce of irrigated coastal lowlands and the nearby Jabal al-Akdhar Mountains, including cereal, dates, olives, wool and meat.<ref>Marshall Cavendish Corporation, \"World and Its Peoples, North Africa\". 2006. p. 1,227.</ref>\n\nFinance is also important to the city's economy, with the Libyan Bank of Commerce and Development maintaining branches in Benghazi; the Bank's headquarters is a high office tower on Gamal Abdel Nasser Street in el-Berka. Other large banks include the [[Central Bank of Libya]] office in the city centre.\n\nThe [[oil industry]] drives the city's commerce. Large national companies such as the Al-Brega Oil Marketing Company and the [[Arabian Gulf Oil Company]] are important to the city's economy and employ many people. An increase in consumer prices has been coupled with an increase in the importance of the retail sector to the city's economy.{{When|date=March 2011}} In recent years, international franchises such as [[Benetton Group|United Colors of Benetton]], [[H&M]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] have opened in Benghazi.\n\nTourism is still in its very early stages in Libya. The industry is however growing in importance in Benghazi. The majority of tourists that visit Eastern Libya use Benghazi as a base for which to explore the Greek ruins in Cyrene or to make desert excursions south in [[Kufra]]. The two main hotels in the city are the Tibesti Hotel and Uzu Hotel, and several other hotels have opened in recent years{{When|date=March 2011}} to cater for increased demand. Handicrafts are found in the many [[souk]]s in the city, but are of little significance to the economy.\n\n[[Skanska]] built a good connection of speedways and flyovers in the decades after the Libyan revolution in 1969; this has made the transport of goods between Benghazi and other cities easier. Benghazi's air transport uses [[Benina International Airport]]; numerous daily flights leave for Tripoli and connections are also available to other African, Asian and European cities.\n\nIn April 2012, the Libyan economy ministry announced plans for creating a [[free trade area]] in Benghazi.<ref>Sarrar, Saleh: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-11/libya-to-revive-plan-for-benghazi-free-trade-area-official-says.html ''Libya to Revive Plan for Benghazi Free-Trade Area, Official Says'']. ''bloomberg.com'', 11 April 2012.</ref>\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{main|Transport in Libya}}\n[[File:Jeliana Bridge.JPG|thumb|The Jeliana Bridge connects Jeliana with the city centre and old town.]]\nBenghazi is a transport hub in Eastern Libya and is an important city on the northern coastal road that crosses the country. An efficiently designed system of roads, bridges and underpasses cover Benghazi, however traffic jams and poorly maintained streets are not uncommon. A [[microbus]] system covers many areas of the city and has its base in Al-Funduq. National and international bus services also leave from Al-Fudnuq from the central bus station. {{As of|2010}}, [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] were underway in the city for a rail network which will traverse northern Libya.\n\n[[Benina International Airport]] serves national and international flights.\n\nThe Benghazi port is a vital terminal for the region, and allows for the import and export of national and international goods and food products.\n\nThe city's road network is generally well designed. An efficient system of highways, [[Overpass|flyovers]], [[Ring road|ringroads]] and underpasses serve the city, and allow for the transport of goods and vehicles. The roads are not always well-maintained however, and often have incorrect, poorly visible or no road markings, as well as potholes in some roads and inner-city streets. In recent years, a rapid increase in car ownership has meant that traffic jams, lack of parking spaces and overcrowding are also not uncommon, especially on smaller streets. Road accidents are also on the rise because of the increase in vehicles and the subsequent lax in attention given by authorities to dangerous driving.<ref>Bodalal, Zuhir; Bendardaf, Riyad; Ambarek, Mohammed (2012).

Retrieved 15 February 2015.</ref>\n\nThere is no systemised public transport system in Benghazi despite the city's size and significance. A popular system of microbuses has developed in recent years; bus journeys run on fixed routes and passengers can embark and disembark anywhere on the route. Most microbuses stop at Al-Funduq or have the end of Souq Al-Jarid in Al-Funduq as their final destination. National and international coach services depart and arrive at Benghazi's coach station at Al-Funduq with regular journeys to Tripoli, as well as international services to Cairo, Amman and Damascus.\n\nUntil the 1960s there were two small railways, built by the Italians, departing from Benghazi and served with classical ''Littorine'': Benghazi-Barce and Benghazi-Soluch. But recently huge railway plans were supported by Gaddafi: work started in September 2008 on a new railway network that would connect to major cities of western Libya at [[Sirte]]. [[Russian Railways]] is responsible for the three-year contract. In the future, a rail link may be built to both Tunisia and Egypt forming a North African coastal rail network.\n\n== Cityscape ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Benghazi Tourist Park (Benghazi Zoo).JPG|thumb|left|Benghazi Zoo (al-Bosco) in al-Fuwayhat, one of Benghazi's greenest and wealthiest neighbourhoods.]]\nThe city is divided into many neighbourhoods, some of which were founded during Italian Colonial rule and many which have developed as a result of modern [[urban sprawl]]. The different neighbourhoods vary in their levels of economic prosperity, as well as their cultural, historic and social atmosphere. Generally, the city is roughly divided into the following areas: Central Benghazi (colloquially referred to as al-Blaad by locals) \u2013 includes the medina, and the old quarter, Central Districts which circle the downtown \u2013 Al-Sabri, Sidi Abayd, Sidi Hsayn, Al-Berka, Al-Salmani, Al-Hadaa'ik, Al-Fuwayhat and Al-Keesh, Central Suburbs \u2013 Al-Laythi, Bu Atni, Al-Quwarsha, Al-Hawari, Coastal Districts \u2013 Al-Kwayfiya (North), Garyounis, Bu-Fakhra and Jarrutha (South), and the Distant Suburbs \u2013 Gimeenis, Benina and Sidi Khalifa.\n\nCentral Benghazi is where the majority of Benghazi's historical monuments are located, and has the city's most popular tourist attractions. Virtually all of Benghazi's theatres, libraries, best clothing stores, markets and old mosques can be found there. The Italian quarter is also located in the centre. The central districts are mostly residential and commercial areas such as Sidi Hsayn. The central suburbs are almost entirely residential and more like little towns in their own right; Al-Quwarsha is a good example of this. The coastal districts (especially the southern districts) are where Benghazi's beaches can be found. Some sections have become more popular as residential areas in recent years (such as Qanfuda). These areas are still primarily recreational however, and many beach [[condominium]] resorts (known locally as [[chalet]]s) have been built in previous years such as those at al-Nakheel beach, and the Nayrouz condominiums.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\nBenghazi is one of the cultural centres of Libya and is a base for tourists, visitors and academics in the region. Throughout its history, Benghazi has developed with a certain level of independence from the more [[Maghreb]] oriented capital Tripoli. This has influenced the city, and as such, the cultural atmosphere in Benghazi is more Arab in nature than that in Tripoli. An influx immigrants including Egyptian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Sudanese and Syrian immigrants have also influenced the city's culture to a certain extent in recent years.\n\nThe city centre contains a few local theatres, as well as the Dar al-Kutub National Library in Al-Funduq, where the works of popular local novelists like [[Sadeq Naihoum]] and Khalifa al-Fakhri can be found. Different architectural styles attest to the different empires that have controlled the city throughout history. Sport is also important in the city; two of Libya's most successful football clubs are based in Benghazi.\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThere is a variety of architectural styles in Benghazi, which reflect the number of times the city has changed hands throughout its history. Arab, Ottoman and Italian rule have influenced the different streetscapes, buildings and quarters in Benghazi.\n\nAncient architectural remains of the Greek and later Roman settlement of Berenice can be found by the Italian lighthouse. There is a trace of the 3rd century BC wall built by the Greeks, four Roman peristyle houses, six wine vats. A Byzantine church also exists on the site, with a mosaic still intact. These ruins formed the northern part of the ancient city, which extended south and east but now lies buried beneath the modern city.\n\nThe next oldest section of the city is the [[Medina quarter]], which began to grow sometime under Medieval Arab rule, and is still intact today. This quarter stretches out from the Northern shores of the harbour, and covers an area roughly bounded by Ahmed Rafiq al-Mahdawi Street to the North-west, al-Jezayir Street to the South-east and 23 July Street to the South-west. The heart of the medina is Maydan al-Hurriya (Freedom Square); to the northeast of this is the covered [[Souq]] al-Jareed.<ref>Ham. p. 125.</ref>\n[[File:Ottoman Fort Benghazi.JPG|thumb|left|Al-Berka Palace in Benghazi was built in two parts. The front fa\u00e7ade was built by the Ottomans in the late 19th century, the two side sections were later added during Italian rule.]]\nThe largest Ottoman architectural monument in Benghazi is the late 19th-century Ottoman palace in El-Berka; built during the rule of Rashid Pasha II. The front elevation was completed in 1895, whilst the side sections were added later during Italian rule. The white and green structure houses 360 rooms; and is on a tract of land where [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] Street meets al-Saqzali Street; south of the [[March 28 Stadium|28 March football stadium]].\n\nThe house of Omar Pasha Mansour El Kikhia, an Ottoman Pasha from a prominent Benghazi family, represents a good example of Ottoman residential architecture with several balconies, stone archways, and an open courtyard containing a fountain. The home was recently restored, remodeled and converted into the Bait-al Medina al-Thaqafi museum.\n\n[[File:Italian Lighthouse - Benghazi.jpg|thumb|Italian lighthouse in Benghazi, built in 1922 during Italian colonial rule.]]\nBenghazi came under Italian rule in the early part of the 20th century. Some examples of [[Italianate]], as well as [[modernist]] colonial architecture from this period remain today. Under the governorships of Generals [[Ernesto Mombelli]] and [[Attilio Teruzzi]] in the 1920s, the buildings commissioned in Benghazi had an eclectic architectural language that embodied a Western conception of Eastern architecture. An example of this is the [[Benghazi Municipal Hall|Municipal palace]] built in 1924, which stands in Maydan al-Hurriya (Freedom Square). The building combines [[Moorish Revival|Moorish]] arches with Italianate motifs on the fa\u00e7ade. Italians even did the first architectural plan of Benghazi.<ref>[http://www.paolocason.it/Libia/fotolibia/wpe210.jpg \"Italian Urban Plan of Benghazi\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722044946/http://www.paolocason.it/Libia/fotolibia/wpe210.jpg |date=22 July 2011 }}.</ref> in the 1930s, with a new [[Italian Libya Railways|railway station]] and promenade.\n\nThe largest colonial building from this Italian period is the [[Benghazi Cathedral]] in Maydan El Catedraeya (Cathedral Square), which was built in the 1920s and has two large distinct domes.<ref>McLaren, Brian L. (2006).  ''Architecture and Tourism in Italian Colonial Libya&nbsp;\u2013 An Ambivalent Modernism''. [[University of Washington Press]] ([[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]). p. 158.  {{ISBN|978-0-295-98542-8}}.</ref>\n\nBenghazi was heavily bombed during World War II, and so the majority of buildings in the city are examples of modern or contemporary architecture. The central business district was built mostly in the 1960s and 1970s with Libya's new found oil wealth. The highest building in Benghazi is the Tibesti Hotel on Gamal Abdel Nasser Street built in 1989. Another prominent example of modern architecture in Benghazi is the Da'wah al-Islamiyah Building, which has a series of distinctive cubes piled in the shape of a pyramid.\n\nImportant colonial buildings designed during Italian rule include the Berenice Cinema (currently under renovation) which was designed Marcello Piacentini and Luigi Piccinato in 1928.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== Sports ===\nBenghazi is the second largest city in Libya, and as such, has some of the best sports facilities in the country. The city has various sporting centres of different standards, such as football stadia, beach clubs (where many water sports are played), as well as several other public and private facilities. Benghazi has hosted many national sports events throughout the years, as well as more significant international competitions such as the [[African Cup of Nations]].\n\nFootball is the most-popular sport in Benghazi, and two of Libya's most-successful football clubs, [[Al-Ahly (Benghazi)|Al-Ahly Benghazi]] and [[Al-Nasr SC (Benghazi)|Al-Nasr]] Benghazi, are based in the city. The two teams have won the [[Libyan Premier League]] five times; Al Ahly four and Al Nasr only one. The most-important football event that took place in Benghazi was the [[1982 African Cup of Nations]]. The city hosted six group games and a semifinal in the [[March 28 Stadium]], Libya's second-largest stadium. The city will very likely be the scene of more games when Libya re-hosts the African Cup of Nations in 2013.\n\nThe largest sporting centre in Benghazi is the Medina al-Riyadhia (Sports City). The complex is situated just south of the city centre, and houses the 28 March Stadium, and the Slayman al Tharrat basketball stadium&nbsp;\u2013 several matches of the [[FIBA Africa Championship 2009|2009 FIBA Africa Championship]] were hosted at the arena.<ref>[http://www.fiba-afrique.org/en/lect_actu.php?titre=evene&id=4314 \"Afrobasket 2009&nbsp;\u2013 Libya\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813235059/http://www.fiba-afrique.org/en/lect_actu.php?titre=evene&id=4314 |date=13 August 2009 }}. ''FIBA Afrique''.  Retrieved 26 February 2009.</ref> The complex also has a sports hall for indoor sports, a tennis stadium and several small tennis courts. The facility was built in the 1950s and is therefore quite outdated; the stadia have nonetheless undergone maintenance work in recent years. Sports City was recently closed down for a complete redevelopment of the site. {{As of|2009}}, the 28 March Stadium was undergoing demolition work, and a new 45,000 all seater stadium was to be constructed in its place. A second smaller stadium was to be built on-site, and the entire site was to undergo redevelopment before its reopening in 2011, and its use in the 2013 African Nations Cup.\n\nThe Eastern suburb of Sidi Khalifa accommodates an equestrian sports facility. The 'Martyrs of Benghazi's Riding Club' boasts a number of female members who, at least until 2016, engaged in sportive competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://locallibya.com/en/article/sport/martyrs-benghazi|title=The Martyrs of Benghazi {{!}} Local Libya|website=locallibya.com|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\nBenghazi is a coastal city, and its beaches are an important location for sporting activities. The coast at Jeliana is home to the Milaha Beach Club amongst others. Wind surfing and swimming are two of the most popular water sports. There are also several contact sport clubs in the city&nbsp;\u2013[[judo]] and [[taekwondo]] are popular men's sports in Benghazi. In recent times, [[rugby sevens]] has seen great success with three clubs in the vicinity.  Gyms have also become more popular in the city in recent years, because of a greater concern for healthy living amongst Libyans.\n\n=== Food ===\nFood and drink is very important to the culture of the people of Benghazi, as it is in the rest of Libya. Many of the dishes and ingredients used are passed down as tradition from generation to generation. The main ingredients that are used in their cuisine are olive oil, garlic, palm dates, grains, and milk. These products are natural to this area, and these ingredients are very common to much of North Africa and the Mediterranean. Another tradition of Libyan culinary culture is tea. Tea from Benghazi has a uniquely thick, bitter taste. Tea drinking is a social activity that close friends and relatives usually take part in.\n\nBenghazi is home to many distinctive dishes that can be prepared in the home. Bazin is one of the most well known of these dishes. Bazin is a dish consisting of a small loaf of heated dough and a meat or vegetable sauce.

The first five tanks were issued to the 501st ''R\u00e9giment de Chars de Combat'' (Tank Regiment) in August of that year. The production version of the AMX-30B weighed {{convert|36|MT|ST|sp=us}}, and sacrificed protection for increased mobility. The French believed that it would have required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats, thereby reducing the tank's maneuverability. Protection, instead, was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle, including a height of 2.28 metres. It had a 105&nbsp;mm gun, firing a then advanced [[high explosive anti-tank warhead]] known as the ''Obus G''. The ''Obus G'' used an outer shell, separated from the main charge by ball bearings, to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without affecting the warhead inside. Mobility was provided by the {{convert|720|hp|kW|sp=us}} HS-110 [[diesel engine]], although the troublesome [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] adversely affected the tank's performance.\n\nIn 1979, due to issues caused by the transmission, the French Army began to modernize its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine and the introduction of a new OFL 105 F1 fin-stabilized [[kinetic energy penetrator]]. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D [[armored recovery vehicle]], the AMX-30R [[anti-aircraft gun]] system, a bridge-layer, the [[Pluton (missile)|Pluton]] [[tactical nuclear missile]] launcher and a [[surface-to-air missile]] launcher.\n\nIt was preceded by two post-war French medium tank designs. The first, the [[ARL 44]], was an interim tank. Its replacement, the [[AMX 50]], was cancelled in the mid-1950s in favor of adopting the [[M47 Patton]] tank. In 1956, the French government entered a cooperative development program with [[West Germany]] and [[Italy]] in an effort to design a standardized tank. Although the three nations agreed to a series of specific characteristics that the new tank should have, and both France and Germany began work on distinctive prototypes with the intention of testing them and combining the best of both, the program failed as Germany decided not to adopt the new French {{convert|105|mm|in|adj=on}} [[tank gun]] and France declared that it would postpone production until 1965. As a result, both nations decided to adopt tanks based on their own prototypes. The German tank became known as the [[Leopard 1]], while the French prototype became the AMX-30.\n\nAs early as 1969, the AMX-30 and variants were ordered by [[Greece]], soon followed by [[Spain]]. In the coming years, the AMX-30 would be exported to [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Qatar]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Chile]]. By the end of production, 3,571 units of AMX-30s and its variants had been manufactured. Both Spain and Venezuela later began extensive modernization programs to extend the life of their vehicles and to bring their tanks up to more modern standards. In the 1991 [[Gulf War]], AMX-30s were deployed by both the French and Qatari armies. Qatari AMX-30s saw action against Iraqi forces at the [[Battle of Khafji]]. France and most other nations replaced their AMX-30s with more up-to-date equipment by the end of the 20th century.\n\n==Background==\nAlthough the [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation of France]] during [[World War II]] temporarily interrupted French development of [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, clandestine research allowed the French to quickly recover lost ground after its [[Western Front (World War II)#Liberation of France|liberation]] in mid-1944.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz2\">Ogorkiewicz, p. 2</ref> During the occupation, the French had secretly worked on an armour program that was, in 1944, taken over by the state workshop ''Atelier de Construction de Rueil'' (ARL), resulting in the design and production of the [[ARL 44]], which began production in 1946.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 7</ref> The tank was powered by a [[Maybach]] HL-230 {{convert|575|hp|kW}} engine, and armed with a {{convert|90|mm|in|adj=on}} tank gun.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 7\u20138</ref> Although the {{convert|48|MT|ST|sp=us|adj=on}} vehicle was comparable to contemporary battle tanks in firepower and engine power, it suffered from distinct disadvantages, including an antiquated track design.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz2\" /> While 600 were planned, only 60 were ultimately produced by 1950. That year, these were issued to the French Army's 503rd Tank Regiment.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa8\">de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 8</ref> Given that the ARL 44 had been considered only a stop-gap vehicle for the French Army's armoured forces since inception, work on a new tank had begun as early as March 1945.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz2\" />\n\n[[File:AMX-50.jpg|thumb|left|AMX 50 at the tank museum in [[Saumur]].]]\n\nDevelopment of the new tank was offered to five separate manufacturers: ''Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux'' (AMX), ''Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e'' (FCM), [[Renault]], ''Societe Lorraine de Dietrich'' (SLD-Lorraine) and ''Societ\u00e9 d'Outillage M\u00e9canique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie'' (SOMUA).<ref name=\"Mazarrasa8\" /> The new vehicle was based on the new post-war requirement for a single battle tank.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz2\" /> The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50. Its hull and suspension were similar to that of the [[Germany|German]] [[Panther tank]], which had been used by the [[French Army]] in the immediate post-war.<ref>Miller, pp. 84\u201385</ref> The French government's specifications for the new tank were strongly influenced by both the Panther tank and the heavier [[Tiger I]]; specifically, the French Army was looking for a tank with the protection of the former and the firepower of the latter.<ref name=\"Jeudy 215\">Jeudy, p. 215</ref> Although the design borrowed from German tanks, including the Maybach {{convert|1000|hp|kW|sp=us}} engine, based on an earlier model, and the [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bar]] sprung road wheels, the AMX 50 also included a number of unique features.<ref>Ogorkiewicz, pp. 2\u20133</ref> For example, it included an [[oscillating turret]], mounted on trunnions, which was the first of its kind. The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was mounted on the trunnions of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the automatic loading system.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz3\">Ogorkiewicz, p. 3</ref> Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa8\" /> The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 8\u20139</ref> AMX's first prototype was armed with a {{convert|90|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger {{convert|100|mm|in|adj=on}} gun in July 1950<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz3\" /> Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the [[Western European Union]],<ref name=\"Jeudy 215\" /> financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks<ref>These were delivered between 1954 and 1956; Zaloga (1999), p. 13</ref> caused the original program to be abandoned.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz3\" /><ref name=\"Miller85\">Miller, p. 85</ref> In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a [[heavy tank]] project with an even larger {{convert|120|mm|in|adj=on}} [[tank gun]]; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.<ref name=\"Jeudy 215\" />\n\n[[File:CB2.jpg|thumb|The 1955 [[Batignolles-Chatillon Char 25T|Char Batignolles-Ch\u00e2tillon]].]]\n\nWith the demise of the {{convert|100|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} AMX 50 program in 1951, France temporarily officially abandoned the thought of producing a medium tank.<ref name=\"Jeudy 252\">Jeudy, p. 252</ref> It was expected that West Germany would soon be allowed to rearm, and the Germans had appeared to entertain the concept of equipping their forces with a host of low-cost light, but relatively powerfully armed tanks, their quantity compensating for a lack of full armament parity with the latest medium tanks.<ref name=\"Jeudy 252\" /> The prospect of delivering many thousands of these to the Germans induced the French to adopt the idea and plan to create light tank \"Type 67\" armoured divisions, for which the [[AMX-13|AMX-13/105]] was specially designed.<ref name=\"Jeudy 252\" /> A private enterprise design aimed at fulfilling the same requirement was the somewhat larger Char Batignolles-Ch\u00e2tillon. A derived medium tank prototype of the latter, made in 1955, proved that it was possible to produce a tank with a first-rate gun and frontally protected with {{convert|80|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} steel equivalence within a weight constraint of {{convert|30|MT|ST}}. This revived interest in the medium tank concept.<ref name=\"Jeudy 252\" />\n\nIn 1956, the WEU defence workgroup FINBEL (named after France, [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]), founded in 1953 and consisting of representatives of the various General Staffs,<ref>Spielberger, p. 113</ref> drafted a set of specifications for a new medium tank to eventually replace their American and British tanks. That same year, Germany joined the workgroup, turning it into [[FINABEL]] (the added \"A\" standing for ''Allemagne'', \"Germany\" in French) and on 27 October 1956 at [[Colomb-B\u00e9char]] a bilateral agreement was concluded between France and Germany to collaborate in building a tank.<ref name=\"Jeudy 253\">Jeudy, p. 253</ref> Though the other FINABEL nations did not formally participate,<ref name=\"Jeudy 253\" /> the type was called ''Europa-Panzer'' to indicate its common European nature, and experts from all countries were involved in the design process.<ref>Spielberger, p. 124</ref> The specifications (FINABEL 3A5)<ref name=\"Caiti33\">Caiti, p. 33</ref> for the new tank called for a lightweight and mobile battle tank, setting the weight limit to {{convert|30|MT|ST}} and compromising the ability to heavily armour the vehicle.<ref>Ogorkiewicz, pp. 3\u20135</ref><ref>Hilmes, pp. 16\u201317</ref> French and German engineers, during a conference in [[Bonn]] on 12 February 1957, defined the requirements for the future tank. This included a maximum width of {{convert|3.15|m|ft}}, a height of {{convert|2.15|m|ft}} and a {{convert|105|mm|in|adj=on}} tank gun, to be developed by the Franco-German military research institute at [[Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin|Saint Louis]].<ref>Mercillon, p. 38</ref> The new tank would have an air-cooled, petrol engine, a torsion bar suspension with hydraulic shocks, a power-to-weight ratio of at least {{convert|30|hp|kW}}/metric ton and a road range of at least {{convert|350|km|mi}}. In May, Italy joined the project, though only nominally, without any material contribution, because after the war it had no tank design bureaus.<ref name=\"Jeudy 253\" /> That same year, on 28 November,<ref name=\"Jeudy 253\" /> the French and German ministries of defence in [[Paris]] agreed upon a contract which would allow both countries to produce two prototypes separately.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 9</ref> The next year, however, the project suffered a first setback when [[Charles de Gaulle]] took power in France, creating the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]: the Paris treaty had as its main point developing a common [[nuclear weapon]] and on 17 June 1958 de Gaulle decided to refuse Germany and Italy the atomic bomb, to avoid antagonizing the US and United Kingdom. This made Germany lose much interest in a common tank project also.<ref name=\"Jeudy 253\" />\n\nThe French prototypes were developed and produced by the ''Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux'', under the direction of General Joseph Molini\u00e9 of the ''Direction des \u00c9tudes et Fabrications d'Armements'' (DEFA, the later ''Direction Technique des Armements Terrestres'')<ref>Foss (1986), p. 21</ref> and AMX head engineer Heissler,<ref name=\"Jeudy 254\" /> The first prototype was completed in September 1960 and tested from February 1961; the second, with an improved range finder and track was tested<!--Or was this the production date?--> in July 1961.

Work on the AMX-30D began in 1966, as the French Army researched developing a recovery vehicle to be issued to units receiving the AMX-30 tank. A prototype was produced and delivered for experimentation in 1971, and in February 1973 the first of a pre-series of five vehicles was delivered. That same year, another 100 AMX-30Ds were ordered, and these began production in 1975.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 36</ref> The recovery vehicle includes a winch powered by the vehicle's engine, with the ability to pull a maximum of {{convert|35|MT|ST|sp=us}} of weight. The vehicle also has a {{convert|80|m|yd|sp=us|adj=on}} heavy towing cable, while an auxiliary winch has another {{convert|120|m|yd|sp=us|adj=on}} towing cable, able to tow up to {{convert|20|MT|ST|sp=us}} when working over the front of the AMX-30D. In the latter case the vehicle must be supported by removable props, which are carried on the vehicle, and the bulldozer blade must be lowered on the ground. The crane can lift up the {{convert|3.29|MT|ST|sp=us}} power pack and the {{convert|10|MT|ST|sp=us}} turret. Instead of a turret, the AMX-30D is fitted with a superstructure, and weighs {{convert|36|MT|ST|sp=us}}, although with the extra power pack it can weigh up to {{convert|40|MT|ST|sp=us}}. The vehicle can protect itself with a {{convert|7.62|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} machine gun.<ref>Ogorkiewicz, p. 16</ref> The driver's visibility is aided by the inclusion of three M-223 episcopes.

Although this particular vehicle began production in 1962, the appearance of the AMX-30 offered a larger chassis to which the S 401 A turret could be mounted on, providing superior mobility. The heavier AMX-30 also provided a more stable platform for the guns, and allowed the system to carry much more ammunition (1,200 rounds, as compared to the 600 carried by the AMX-13 version). The guns were designed to fire in 5-round or 15-round bursts, with a cyclic rate of fire of 650 rounds per minute. They were controlled by an analogue computer, receiving information from a [[Doppler radar]], which could be folded into an armoured box when not in use to protect from damage. The fire control depended on visual tracking, and so could only work in daylight and clear weather.<ref>Ogorkiewicz, pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\n[[File:AMX-30 Roland img 2306.jpg|thumb|left|Left side of a [[Roland missile|Roland]] surface-to-air missile launcher.]]\n\nThree missile systems were developed to be mounted on the AMX-30 chassis.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa38\" /> Recognizing the need for tactical nuclear missile mobile launchers, the French Army began developing the Pluton missile in 1963. In 1964, the program was suspended and instead the French Army opted for a missile with a longer range, able to be mounted on the AMX-30. A contract to develop the system was established in 1968. The first prototype was soon delivered and testing occurred between July and August 1970, followed by the production of a second prototype in 1971. Two more prototypes were fabricated in 1972. The next year, the vehicle was put into mass production and by 1 May 1974 four of these vehicles had been delivered to the 3rd Artillery Regiment.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa39\">de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 39</ref> The missile itself weighs {{convert|2.4|MT|ST|sp=us}} and is {{convert|7.6|m|yd|sp=us}} long.

Five vehicles of a pre-series were completed by 1977 and then evaluated, prompting the order of 183 vehicles that same year.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 39\u201340</ref> [[File:AuF1 of Saudi Arabia.JPEG|thumb|A GCT in service of Saudi Arabia.]] The Roland includes a rectangular superstructure, taller than that of both the AMX-30D and the Pluton, which houses the radar system and mounts two launching tubes on either side, with an autoloading system feeding from an eight missile reserve inside the superstructure. The Roland's exploration radar has a detection range of {{convert|16|km|mi|sp=us}}. The third missile system, called the AMX-30SA, was developed in 1975 for Saudi Arabia, to fire the SA-10 ''Shahine'', developed and manufactured by [[Thomson-CSF]]; the launching vehicle was heavily based on the AMX-30R.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 40</ref>\n \nThe [[GCT 155mm|''canon automoteur de 155 GCT'']] (for ''Grande Cadence de Tir'', fast rate of fire) was developed based on the AMX-30 chassis to provide tactical artillery support to units in the French Army, who refer to it as the [[AMX 30 AuF1|AuF1]]. The {{convert|155|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} howitzer was 40 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]] long, and was [[Autoloader|autoloaded]] allowing it a rate of fire of eight rounds per minute, with a maximum range of {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} with the LU211 round.

This heavy manufacturing factory was built during [[World War I]] to produce artillery shells, although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles. Before producing the AMX-30, for example, it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants. The Roanne factory was responsible for final assembly, most components were made elsewhere: the powerplant by the ''Atelier de Construction de Limoges'', the full armour set by the ''Ateliers et Forges de la Loire'', the turret by the ''Atelier de Construction de Tarbes'', the cannon by the ''Atelier de Construction de Bourges'', the cupola and machine-gun by the ''Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne'' and the optics by the ''Atelier de Construction de Puteaux''; all these again used many subcontractors.<ref name=\"Caiti34\" /> In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance, most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT.<ref name=\"Jeudy 256\" />\n\nOriginally, 300 AMX-30s were ordered by the French Army, and by 1971 the order had been increased to 900, divided between eight batches,<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz14\" /> including all variants based on the chassis.<ref name=\"Jeudy 255\" /> Beginning in 1966, ten AMX-30s were assembled per month, and the first five were issued in August 1966 to the 501st ''R\u00e9giment de Chars de Combat''.

'''AMX-30''' is a [[main battle tank]] designed by [[Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux]] (AMX, then [[Nexter|GIAT]]) and first delivered to the [[French Army]] in August 1966. The first five tanks were issued to the 501st ''R\u00e9giment de Chars de Combat'' (Tank Regiment) in August of that year. The production version of the AMX-30B weighed {{convert|36|MT|ST|sp=us}}, and sacrificed protection for increased mobility. The French believed that it would have required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats, thereby reducing the tank's maneuverability. Protection, instead, was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle, including a height of 2.28 metres. It had a 105&nbsp;mm gun, firing a then advanced [[high explosive anti-tank warhead]] known as the ''Obus G''. The ''Obus G'' used an outer shell, separated from the main charge by ball bearings, to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without affecting the warhead inside. Mobility was provided by the {{convert|720|hp|kW|sp=us}} HS-110 [[diesel engine]], although the troublesome [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] adversely affected the tank's performance.\n\nIn 1979, due to issues caused by the transmission, the French Army began to modernize its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine and the introduction of a new OFL 105 F1 fin-stabilized [[kinetic energy penetrator]]. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D [[armored recovery vehicle]], the AMX-30R [[anti-aircraft gun]] system, a bridge-layer, the [[Pluton (missile)|Pluton]] [[tactical nuclear missile]] launcher and a [[surface-to-air missile]] launcher.\n\nIt was preceded by two post-war French medium tank designs. The first, the [[ARL 44]], was an interim tank. Its replacement, the [[AMX 50]], was cancelled in the mid-1950s in favor of adopting the [[M47 Patton]] tank. In 1956, the French government entered a cooperative development program with [[West Germany]] and [[Italy]] in an effort to design a standardized tank. Although the three nations agreed to a series of specific characteristics that the new tank should have, and both France and Germany began work on distinctive prototypes with the intention of testing them and combining the best of both, the program failed as Germany decided not to adopt the new French {{convert|105|mm|in|adj=on}} [[tank gun]] and France declared that it would postpone production until 1965. As a result, both nations decided to adopt tanks based on their own prototypes. The German tank became known as the [[Leopard 1]], while the French prototype became the AMX-30.\n\nAs early as 1969, the AMX-30 and variants were ordered by [[Greece]], soon followed by [[Spain]]. In the coming years, the AMX-30 would be exported to [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Qatar]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Chile]]. By the end of production, 3,571 units of AMX-30s and its variants had been manufactured. Both Spain and Venezuela later began extensive modernization programs to extend the life of their vehicles and to bring their tanks up to more modern standards. In the 1991 [[Gulf War]], AMX-30s were deployed by both the French and Qatari armies. Qatari AMX-30s saw action against Iraqi forces at the [[Battle of Khafji]]. France and most other nations replaced their AMX-30s with more up-to-date equipment by the end of the 20th century.\n\n==Background==\nAlthough the [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation of France]] during [[World War II]] temporarily interrupted French development of [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, clandestine research allowed the French to quickly recover lost ground after its [[Western Front (World War II)#Liberation of France|liberation]] in mid-1944.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz2\">Ogorkiewicz, p. 2</ref> During the occupation, the French had secretly worked on an armour program that was, in 1944, taken over by the state workshop ''Atelier de Construction de Rueil'' (ARL), resulting in the design and production of the [[ARL 44]], which began production in 1946.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 7</ref> The tank was powered by a [[Maybach]] HL-230 {{convert|575|hp|kW}} engine, and armed with a {{convert|90|mm|in|adj=on}} tank gun.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 7\u20138</ref> Although the {{convert|48|MT|ST|sp=us|adj=on}} vehicle was comparable to contemporary battle tanks in firepower and engine power, it suffered from distinct disadvantages, including an antiquated track design.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz2\" /> While 600 were planned, only 60 were ultimately produced by 1950. That year, these were issued to the French Army's 503rd Tank Regiment.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa8\">de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 8</ref> Given that the ARL 44 had been considered only a stop-gap vehicle for the French Army's armoured forces since inception, work on a new tank had begun as early as March 1945.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz2\" />\n\n[[File:AMX-50.jpg|thumb|left|AMX 50 at the tank museum in [[Saumur]].]]\n\nDevelopment of the new tank was offered to five separate manufacturers: ''Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux'' (AMX), ''Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e'' (FCM), [[Renault]], ''Societe Lorraine de Dietrich'' (SLD-Lorraine) and ''Societ\u00e9 d'Outillage M\u00e9canique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie'' (SOMUA).<ref name=\"Mazarrasa8\" /> The new vehicle was based on the new post-war requirement for a single battle tank.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz2\" /> The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50.

The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was mounted on the trunnions of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the automatic loading system.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz3\">Ogorkiewicz, p. 3</ref> Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa8\" /> The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 8\u20139</ref> AMX's first prototype was armed with a {{convert|90|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger {{convert|100|mm|in|adj=on}} gun in July 1950<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz3\" /> Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the [[Western European Union]],<ref name=\"Jeudy 215\" /> financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks<ref>These were delivered between 1954 and 1956; Zaloga (1999), p. 13</ref> caused the original program to be abandoned.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz3\" /><ref name=\"Miller85\">Miller, p. 85</ref> In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a [[heavy tank]] project with an even larger {{convert|120|mm|in|adj=on}} [[tank gun]]; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.<ref name=\"Jeudy 215\" />\n\n[[File:CB2.jpg|thumb|The 1955 [[Batignolles-Chatillon Char 25T|Char Batignolles-Ch\u00e2tillon]].]]\n\nWith the demise of the {{convert|100|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} AMX 50 program in 1951, France temporarily officially abandoned the thought of producing a medium tank.<ref name=\"Jeudy 252\">Jeudy, p. 252</ref> It was expected that West Germany would soon be allowed to rearm, and the Germans had appeared to entertain the concept of equipping their forces with a host of low-cost light, but relatively powerfully armed tanks, their quantity compensating for a lack of full armament parity with the latest medium tanks.<ref name=\"Jeudy 252\" /> The prospect of delivering many thousands of these to the Germans induced the French to adopt the idea and plan to create light tank \"Type 67\" armoured divisions, for which the [[AMX-13|AMX-13/105]] was specially designed.<ref name=\"Jeudy 252\" /> A private enterprise design aimed at fulfilling the same requirement was the somewhat larger Char Batignolles-Ch\u00e2tillon. A derived medium tank prototype of the latter, made in 1955, proved that it was possible to produce a tank with a first-rate gun and frontally protected with {{convert|80|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} steel equivalence within a weight constraint of {{convert|30|MT|ST}}. This revived interest in the medium tank concept.<ref name=\"Jeudy 252\" />\n\nIn 1956, the WEU defence workgroup FINBEL (named after France, [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]), founded in 1953 and consisting of representatives of the various General Staffs,<ref>Spielberger, p. 113</ref> drafted a set of specifications for a new medium tank to eventually replace their American and British tanks. That same year, Germany joined the workgroup, turning it into [[FINABEL]] (the added \"A\" standing for ''Allemagne'', \"Germany\" in French) and on 27 October 1956 at [[Colomb-B\u00e9char]] a bilateral agreement was concluded between France and Germany to collaborate in building a tank.<ref name=\"Jeudy 253\">Jeudy, p. 253</ref> Though the other FINABEL nations did not formally participate,<ref name=\"Jeudy 253\" /> the type was called ''Europa-Panzer'' to indicate its common European nature, and experts from all countries were involved in the design process.<ref>Spielberger, p. 124</ref> The specifications (FINABEL 3A5)<ref name=\"Caiti33\">Caiti, p. 33</ref> for the new tank called for a lightweight and mobile battle tank, setting the weight limit to {{convert|30|MT|ST}} and compromising the ability to heavily armour the vehicle.<ref>Ogorkiewicz, pp. 3\u20135</ref><ref>Hilmes, pp. 16\u201317</ref> French and German engineers, during a conference in [[Bonn]] on 12 February 1957, defined the requirements for the future tank.

In May, Italy joined the project, though only nominally, without any material contribution, because after the war it had no tank design bureaus.<ref name=\"Jeudy 253\" /> That same year, on 28 November,<ref name=\"Jeudy 253\" /> the French and German ministries of defence in [[Paris]] agreed upon a contract which would allow both countries to produce two prototypes separately.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 9</ref> The next year, however, the project suffered a first setback when [[Charles de Gaulle]] took power in France, creating the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]: the Paris treaty had as its main point developing a common [[nuclear weapon]] and on 17 June 1958 de Gaulle decided to refuse Germany and Italy the atomic bomb, to avoid antagonizing the US and United Kingdom.

In contrast to the AMX 50, the AMX-30 was issued a conventional turret, because it was found that it was more difficult to seal oscillating turrets from radioactive dust and against water when the tank was submerged.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz5\"/> Oscillating turrets also had a large ballistic weakness in the area of the skirt and turret ring.<ref>Simpkin, p. 139</ref> Originally, the first two prototypes were powered by a {{convert|720|hp|kW|sp=us}} spark ignition engine, named the SOFAM 12 GSds.

A simplified version of the tank, without the infra-red searchlight and periscopes and a less complex commander's cupola was developed for export, known as the \"basic AMX-30\". This version also came devoid of the pressurized air filtering system, and moved the smaller {{convert|7.62|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} machine gun into the coaxial position and the larger {{convert|12.7|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} M2 to the turret roof. Another version was considered for the French Army, adopting a {{convert|142|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} tank gun able to fire the supersonic {{Interlanguage link|Anti-Char Rapide Autopropuls\u00e9|fr|lt=ACRA}} (''Anti-Char Rapide Autopropuls\u00e9'')<ref>Foss (1976), p. 16</ref> [[anti-tank guided missile]], as well as high explosive rounds. A prototype was finished in 1967 with a new cast turret, wide enough to hold the much larger armament.<ref>Jeudy, p. 260</ref> However, the high costs of the missiles forced the French Army to abandon the program in 1972.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz14\">Ogorkiewicz, p. 14</ref> The vehicles based on the chassis include an [[armoured recovery vehicle]], a bridgelayer, a [[self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle]], a [[tactical nuclear weapon|tactical nuclear]] missile launcher and a self-propelled artillery piece.<ref>Ogorkiewicz, pp. 14\u201316</ref>\n\n[[File:AMX-30D-cote-droit.jpg|thumb|left|Right side of an AMX-30D of the [[French Army]].]]\n\nThe armoured recovery vehicle, known as the AMX-30D (AMX-30 ''D\u00e9panneur-Niveleur''), was designed to recuperate or help maintain vehicles in the field. Work on the AMX-30D began in 1966, as the French Army researched developing a recovery vehicle to be issued to units receiving the AMX-30 tank. A prototype was produced and delivered for experimentation in 1971, and in February 1973 the first of a pre-series of five vehicles was delivered. That same year, another 100 AMX-30Ds were ordered, and these began production in 1975.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 36</ref> The recovery vehicle includes a winch powered by the vehicle's engine, with the ability to pull a maximum of {{convert|35|MT|ST|sp=us}} of weight. The vehicle also has a {{convert|80|m|yd|sp=us|adj=on}} heavy towing cable, while an auxiliary winch has another {{convert|120|m|yd|sp=us|adj=on}} towing cable, able to tow up to {{convert|20|MT|ST|sp=us}} when working over the front of the AMX-30D. In the latter case the vehicle must be supported by removable props, which are carried on the vehicle, and the bulldozer blade must be lowered on the ground. The crane can lift up the {{convert|3.29|MT|ST|sp=us}} power pack and the {{convert|10|MT|ST|sp=us}} turret. Instead of a turret, the AMX-30D is fitted with a superstructure, and weighs {{convert|36|MT|ST|sp=us}}, although with the extra power pack it can weigh up to {{convert|40|MT|ST|sp=us}}. The vehicle can protect itself with a {{convert|7.62|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} machine gun.<ref>Ogorkiewicz, p. 16</ref> The driver's visibility is aided by the inclusion of three M-223 episcopes. The AMX-30D has a maximum on-road velocity of {{convert|60|km/h|mph|sp=us}} and a maximum road range of {{convert|500|km|mi|sp=us}}.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 37</ref>\n\nThe AMX-30 bridgelayer, or ''Poseur de pont'', consists of the AMX-30's chassis with a box-like superstructure, supporting a scissor-type folding bridge. The {{convert|22|m|yd|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} bridge can span {{convert|20|m|yd|sp=us|adj=on}} gaps. The bridge has a width of {{convert|3.1|m|yd|sp=us}}, but can be increased to {{convert|3.95|m|yd|sp=us}} through the use of appliqu\u00e9 panels. It can support weighs of up to {{convert|46|MT|ST|sp=us}}.<ref>Ogorkiewicz, pp. 16\u201318</ref> Bridgelayer development began as early as 1963, although it was not until June 1967 that development began on a prototype. Although a prototype designated AMX-30H was finished in 1968, it was not until 1971 that the vehicle was evaluated. At the end of the evaluations in September 1971, a pre-series of five vehicles was ordered, resulting in a new period of evaluations beginning on 16 October 1972. In 1975, the AMX-30H was declared standard in the French Army, although none of these vehicles were ever ordered.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\n[[File:Pluton 034.jpg|thumb|[[Pluton (missile)|Pluton]] tactical nuclear [[Transporter erector launcher|missile launcher]].]]\n\nThe self-propelled anti-aircraft gun began development in 1969 to provide this type of vehicle to the French Army and for export. Although ultimately none were ordered for France, in 1975 Saudi Arabia ordered an improved version, denominated the AMX-30SA.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa38\">de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 38</ref> Developed to defend against low-altitude attacks, the system included two Hispano-Suiza {{convert|30|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} 831 A automatic guns, coupled to an ''Oeil-noir'' fire control system. This system had already been installed on the AMX-13, in lieu of a heavier chassis, using a turret designated the S 401 A. Although this particular vehicle began production in 1962, the appearance of the AMX-30 offered a larger chassis to which the S 401 A turret could be mounted on, providing superior mobility. The heavier AMX-30 also provided a more stable platform for the guns, and allowed the system to carry much more ammunition (1,200 rounds, as compared to the 600 carried by the AMX-13 version). The guns were designed to fire in 5-round or 15-round bursts, with a cyclic rate of fire of 650 rounds per minute. They were controlled by an analogue computer, receiving information from a [[Doppler radar]], which could be folded into an armoured box when not in use to protect from damage. The fire control depended on visual tracking, and so could only work in daylight and clear weather.<ref>Ogorkiewicz, pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\n[[File:AMX-30 Roland img 2306.jpg|thumb|left|Left side of a [[Roland missile|Roland]] surface-to-air missile launcher.]]\n\nThree missile systems were developed to be mounted on the AMX-30 chassis.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa38\" /> Recognizing the need for tactical nuclear missile mobile launchers, the French Army began developing the Pluton missile in 1963. In 1964, the program was suspended and instead the French Army opted for a missile with a longer range, able to be mounted on the AMX-30. A contract to develop the system was established in 1968. The first prototype was soon delivered and testing occurred between July and August 1970, followed by the production of a second prototype in 1971. Two more prototypes were fabricated in 1972. The next year, the vehicle was put into mass production and by 1 May 1974 four of these vehicles had been delivered to the 3rd Artillery Regiment.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa39\">de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 39</ref> The missile itself weighs {{convert|2.4|MT|ST|sp=us}} and is {{convert|7.6|m|yd|sp=us}} long.

Five vehicles of a pre-series were completed by 1977 and then evaluated, prompting the order of 183 vehicles that same year.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 39\u201340</ref> [[File:AuF1 of Saudi Arabia.JPEG|thumb|A GCT in service of Saudi Arabia.]] The Roland includes a rectangular superstructure, taller than that of both the AMX-30D and the Pluton, which houses the radar system and mounts two launching tubes on either side, with an autoloading system feeding from an eight missile reserve inside the superstructure. The Roland's exploration radar has a detection range of {{convert|16|km|mi|sp=us}}. The third missile system, called the AMX-30SA, was developed in 1975 for Saudi Arabia, to fire the SA-10 ''Shahine'', developed and manufactured by [[Thomson-CSF]]; the launching vehicle was heavily based on the AMX-30R.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 40</ref>\n \nThe [[GCT 155mm|''canon automoteur de 155 GCT'']] (for ''Grande Cadence de Tir'', fast rate of fire) was developed based on the AMX-30 chassis to provide tactical artillery support to units in the French Army, who refer to it as the [[AMX 30 AuF1|AuF1]]. The {{convert|155|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} howitzer was 40 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]] long, and was [[Autoloader|autoloaded]] allowing it a rate of fire of eight rounds per minute, with a maximum range of {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} with the LU211 round. The turret enables the gun to have an elevation of up to 66 degrees, and allows it to traverse a full 360 degrees.[[File:AMX-32 img 2369.jpg|thumb|AMX-32 at Saumur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Estienne museum. ]] The vehicle carries 42 rounds of ammunition, with combustible cartridge cases.<ref>Orgokiewicz, p. 20</ref> The origins of the decision to design a self-propelled howitzer can be traced back to 1969, with the first prototype completed in 1972. By 1979, seven prototypes had been produced, and six pre-series vehicles, followed by the production of 110 vehicles. This order was later increased to 190.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 40\u201341</ref>\n\nThe first prototype of an improved AMX-30 for the export market, known as the [[AMX-32]], was unveiled in June 1979. Originally intended as an alternative for the AMX-30B2, and deliberately imitating the spaced armour concept the Germans had successfully implemented on the Leopard 1A3 and A4,<ref>Jeudy, p. 262</ref> the AMX-32 fielded greater armour protection to offer increased survivability against anti-tank guided missiles{{Citation needed|reason=the French literature specifies only against kinetic rounds|date=February 2020}}.

This heavy manufacturing factory was built during [[World War I]] to produce artillery shells, although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles. Before producing the AMX-30, for example, it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants. The Roanne factory was responsible for final assembly, most components were made elsewhere: the powerplant by the ''Atelier de Construction de Limoges'', the full armour set by the ''Ateliers et Forges de la Loire'', the turret by the ''Atelier de Construction de Tarbes'', the cannon by the ''Atelier de Construction de Bourges'', the cupola and machine-gun by the ''Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne'' and the optics by the ''Atelier de Construction de Puteaux''; all these again used many subcontractors.<ref name=\"Caiti34\" /> In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance, most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT.<ref name=\"Jeudy 256\" />\n\nOriginally, 300 AMX-30s were ordered by the French Army, and by 1971 the order had been increased to 900, divided between eight batches,<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz14\" /> including all variants based on the chassis.<ref name=\"Jeudy 255\" /> Beginning in 1966, ten AMX-30s were assembled per month, and the first five were issued in August 1966 to the 501st ''R\u00e9giment de Chars de Combat''.

Named the Palmier Contract, Saudi Arabia's tanks were delivered between 1973 and 1979, while 59 AMX-30Ds were exported between 1975 and 1979, 12 AMX-30Ps between 1977 and 1979, and finally 51 self-propelled howitzers, delivered between 1979 and 1980. Between 1979 and 1981, Saudi Arabia also received 52 AMX-30SAs and later 50 AMX-30C1 ''Shanine-2''s delivered in two batches, between 1980 and 1989.<ref name=\"de Mazarrasa 1990, pp. 48\u201349\">de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 48\u201349</ref> By the 21st century, 50% of Saudi Arabia's AMX-30 fleet were in storage,<ref>Cordesman, pp. 11\u201312</ref> given that the AMX-30 lacked the capabilities to deal with more modern threats, such as against [[Iraq]]i [[T-62]]s and [[T-72]]s, and [[Israel]]i [[Merkava]] tanks.<ref>Cordesman, p. 11</ref> These were largely displaced by an order for 315 [[M1 Abrams|M1A2]] Abrams tanks in 1989, and the acquisition of 450 [[M60 Patton|M60A3]] Patton tanks.<ref>Cordesman, pp. 13\u201314</ref> Although Saudi Arabia planned to procure more M1 tanks, it was unable to do so for financial reasons and the AMX-30 has still not been retired.<ref>Cordesman, pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\n[[Venezuela]] originally placed an order for 142 tanks in 1972, although this was later reduced to 82 and four AMX-30Ds.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa48\" /> In the mid-1980s, Venezuela adopted a modernization plan for its deprecated AMX-30s, opting to replace the original engine with a new Continental AVDS-1790-5A diesel engine, producing {{convert|908|hp|kW|sp=us}} and exchanging the existing transmission with an Allison CD-850-6A. Venezuelan AMX-30s received new fuel tanks, increasing the tank's road range to {{convert|720|km|mi|sp=us}}, while firepower was improved through the adoption of a modern Lansadot MkI fire control system and Ballistic computer from Elbit Systems.<ref>de Mazarrasa (1990), pp. 72\u201373</ref> In 1977, France and Qatar signed an agreement which garnered France another 24 AMX-30s sold, which would rise to 54 when Qatar ordered a further 30 AMX-30B2s in 1987.<ref name=\"de Mazarrasa 1990, pp. 48\u201349\"/> The [[United Arab Emirates]] placed an order in 1977 for 64 tanks and a single armoured recovery vehicle, to complete an armoured brigade, in 1977. Due to political issues between Chile and [[Argentina]], the former placed an order for 46 tanks, although this was later cut short to 21 when the contract was canceled by the French government in 1981. In 1982, Cyprus acquired a total of 16 AMX-30B2s and a single AMX-30D, and later ordered another 36 AMX-30B2s. Total production of the AMX-30 and variants totaled 3,571 units.<ref name=\"Mazarrasa49\">de Mazarrasa (1990), p. 49</ref>\n\nLater many used vehicles were resold to other nations: in 2005 Cyprus had 102 AMX-30s (obtained from Greece) and 52 AMX-30B2s; [[Bosnia]] 32 AMX-30s (from the UAE). French strength had dwindled to about 250 AMX-30B2s.<ref>Foss (2005), p. 32</ref>\n\n==Combat history==\n[[File:Two AMX-30 main battle tanks in 1991.JPEG|thumb|Two French AMX-30s in Al-Salman.]]\nQatari AMX-30s saw combat during the Gulf War at the [[Battle of Khafji]], where on 30 January 1991 they counter-attacked in an attempt to retake the city of [[Khafji]] from Iraqi forces which had occupied it the night before. During the action, Qatari AMX-30s knocked out three Iraqi T-55s and captured four more.<ref>Westermeyer, p. 27</ref> At least one Qatari AMX-30 was lost during the battle.<ref>Westermeyer, pp. 27\u201328</ref>\n\n[[File:AMX 30 EBD in the Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s pic4.JPG|thumb|One of the six ''AMX 30 Demin'' units.]]\n\nThe French participation in the Persian Gulf War, codenamed ''[[Op\u00e9ration Daguet]]'', saw the deployment of the ''[[6th Light Armoured Brigade (France)|6e Division L\u00e9g\u00e8re Blind\u00e9e]]'' (\"6th Light Armoured Division\"),<ref>Perrett, p. 201</ref> referred to for the duration of the conflict as the ''[[Division Daguet]]''. Most of its armoured component was provided by the [[AMX-10RC]]s of the cavalry reconnaissance regiments, but a heavy armoured unit, the ''4e R\u00e9giment de Dragons'' (\"4th Dragoon Regiment\") was also sent to the region with a complement of 44 AMX-30B2s.<ref>Rottman, p. 26</ref> Experimentally, a new regimental organisational structure was used, with three squadrons of thirteen tanks, a command tank and six reserve vehicles, instead of the then normal strength of 52 units.<ref name=\"Jeudy 263\">Jeudy, p. 263</ref> Also six older AMX-30Bs were deployed, fitted with Soviet [[mine roller]]s provided by Germany from East German stocks, and named ''AMX 30 Demin''.<ref name=\"Jeudy 263\" /> The vehicles were all manned by professional crews, without conscripts.<ref name=\"Jeudy 263\" /> The Daguet Division was positioned to the West of the Coalition forces, to protect the left flank of the U.S. [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]]. This disposition gave the French commander greater autonomy, and also lessened the likelihood of encountering Iraqi T-72s, which were superior both to the AMX-10RCs and the AMX-30B2s.<ref>Cogan, p. 44</ref> With the beginning of the ground offensive of 24 February 1991, French forces moved to attack its first target, \"Objective Rochambeau\", which was defended by a brigade from the Iraqi 45th Infantry Division. A raid by [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle helicopters]] paved the way for an attack by the ''4e R\u00e9giment de Dragons''. Demoralized by heavy coalition bombardments, the Iraqi defenders rapidly surrendered.<ref>Scales, p. 217</ref> The following day, the ''4e Dragons'' moved on to their next objective, \"Chambord\", where they reported destroying ten tanks, three BMPs, fifteen trucks and five [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] with the assistance of [[USAF]] [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10s]], and capturing numerous prisoners. The final objective was the As-Salman air base (\"Objective White\"), that was reported captured by 18:15, after a multi-pronged attack, with the ''4e Dragons'' attacking from the south.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/CHRONOS/28feb91.htm |title=XVIII Airborne Corps Desert Storm Chronology 24\u201328 February 1991 |accessdate=2008-12-18 |publisher=United States Army Center of Military History}}</ref> In all, the AMX-30s fired 270 main gun rounds.<ref name=\"Jeudy 263\" />\n\nIn the 2010s, Saudi Arabia's AMX-30s have been deployed in a defensive role to [[Saudi Arabian\u2013Yemeni border conflict (2015\u2013present)|protect the border with Yemen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Principaux mat\u00e9riels saoudiens engag\u00e9s dans le conflit y\u00e9m\u00e9nite|language=fr|url=https://made-in-france.disclose.ngo/assets/files/liste-des-armes.pdf|author=[[Direction du renseignement militaire]]|via=disclose.ngo|date=25 September 2018}}</ref> Two of them were lost in 2015.<ref>{{cite journal|language=fr|first=Arnaud |last=Delalande|title=Retour sur l\u2019intervention de la coalition arabe|journal=D\u00e9fense et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 internationale|volume=|issue=119|date=November 2015|pages=63}}</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:AMX-30 operators.png|thumb|300px|Map of AMX-30 operators in blue with former operators in red]]\n\n===Current operators===\n* {{flag|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}: 50 units donated by the UAE in 1997. 36 in service, others in storage for spare parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyrecognition.com/bosnia_herzegovina_army_land_ground_forces_uk/bosnia_herzegovina_army_land_ground_armed_defense_forces_military_equipment_armored_vehicle_uk.html|title=Bosnia Herzegovina army land ground armed defense forces military equipment armored vehicle UK - Bosnia Herzegovina army land ground forces UK - East Europe UK|first=|last=Administrator|date=|website=www.armyrecognition.com}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Nigeria}}: 16 units<ref name=\"ZA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32118:nigerian-armed-forces&catid=119:african-militaries|title=Nigerian Armed Forces - defenceWeb|first=Guy|last=Martin|publisher=}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Qatar}}: In 1977, Qatar ordered 30 AMX-30Bs and 24 additional AMX-30B2s in 1987. {{As of|2019}}, 30 units are in service alongside 32 [[Leopard 2]]A7+.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le Qatar aurait command\u00e9 100 chars Altay \u00e0 la Turquie|url=http://www.opex360.com/2019/03/13/le-qatar-aurait-commande-100-chars-altay-a-la-turquie/|date=13 March 2019|language=fr|first=Laurent|last=Lagneau|website=opex360.com}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Saudi Arabia}}: 250 units\n* {{VEN}}: 80 AMX-30V2 units from 82 AMX-30B purchased and 4 AMX-30D after upgrade (on modernization as January 2019).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://elpais.com/politica/2018/12/30/actualidad/1546199089_511448.html|title=Espa\u00f1a moderniza los tanques de Venezuela pese al embargo de la UE|accessdate=2019-01-02 |publisher=El Pa\u00eds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://talcualdigital.com/index.php/2018/12/31/rajoy-autorizo-venta-de-repuestos-para-tanques-del-ejercito-venezolano-pese-al-embargo/|title=Rajoy autoriz\u00f3 venta de repuestos para tanques del Ej\u00e9rcito venezolano pese al embargo|accessdate=2019-01-02 |publisher=Tal Cual}}</ref>\n* {{flag|United Arab Emirates}}: 45 units in storage<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/nigeria/army.htm|title=Nigerian Army|first=John|last=Pike|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Former operators===\n* {{flag|Chile}} : 29-50 AMX-30B, reserve in 2004 (status unknown).\n* {{flag|Cyprus}} : 52 AMX-30, retired in 2018.

Although it is the language of the Gond people, only one fifth of Gonds can speak the language, making it vulnerable to extinction. Gondi has a rich folk literature, examples of which are marriage songs and narrations.\n\n==Characteristics==\nGondi has a two-gender system, [[substantive]]s being either masculine or nonmasculine. Gondi departed from the parent Proto-Dravidian language by developing initial voiced [[stop consonant|stops]] (''g'', ''j'', ''\u1e0d'', ''d'', ''b'') and aspirated stops (''gh'', ''jh'', ''\u1e0dh'', ''dh'', ''bh'').\n\n==Dialects==\nMost of the Gondi dialects are still inadequately recorded and described. The more important dialects are Dorla, [[Koya language|Koya]], [[Madiya language|Madiya]], [[Muria language|Muria]], and Raj Gond.

Gondi has a rich folk literature, examples of which are marriage songs and narrations.\n\n==Characteristics==\nGondi has a two-gender system, [[substantive]]s being either masculine or nonmasculine. Gondi departed from the parent Proto-Dravidian language by developing initial voiced [[stop consonant|stops]] (''g'', ''j'', ''\u1e0d'', ''d'', ''b'') and aspirated stops (''gh'', ''jh'', ''\u1e0dh'', ''dh'', ''bh'').\n\n==Dialects==\nMost of the Gondi dialects are still inadequately recorded and described.

English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]], originally released on the album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' in December 1971 and as a single on 7 January 1972, the day before Bowie's 25th birthday. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior.<ref name=MEMag>\"Watch that Man\" by Tina Clarke, Music Express magazine, March 1990, page 9</ref> \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].

''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s contemporary review of ''Hunky Dory'' considered that \"Changes\" could be \"construed as a young man's attempt to reckon how he'll react when it's his time to be on the maligned side of the generation schism\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone review\">{{cite web |first=John |last=Mendelsohn |title=Hunky Dory |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=6 January 1972 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |access-date=2 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110180003/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |archive-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Release and aftermath==\n\"Changes\" was released on 17 December 1971 as the opening track on Bowie's fourth studio album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Hunky Dory|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1971|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8244}}</ref> It was subsequently released as the first single of the album (and the label itself{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}}) on 7 January 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2160) with fellow album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"Single liner notes\" /> Like the album, it flopped commercially, peaking at number 66 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts and failing to chart in the UK.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} It wasn't until the success of Bowie's following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972) that recognition was brought upon ''Hunky Dory'' and \"Changes\", which according to Pegg quickly became a \"turntable favorite\" and \"embedded\" itself into the \"pop-culture psyche\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} Commentators have later argued that \"[[Oh!
