It was available to pre-order on October 27, 2017 and was released on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone X was intended to showcase what Apple considered the technology of the future. Using a glass and stainless-steel form factor and \"[[bezel (screen)|bezel-less]]\" design, shrinking the bezels, and not having a \"chin\", unlike many Android phones.  It was the first iPhone to use an [[OLED]] screen. The home button was replaced with a new type of authentication called [[Face ID]], which used sensors to [[Facial recognition system|scan the user's face]] to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of $999 USD also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes.\n\nThe iPhone X received generally positive reviews. Its display and build quality were widely praised, and the camera also scored positively on tests. The phone received polarized reception due to the sensor housing \"[[notch (engineering)|notch]]\" at the top of the screen and the introduction of an all-new authentication method. The notch was heavily mocked by users on social media, although app developers responded either neutrally or positively to the changes it brought to the user experience in their apps and games. Reviewers had mixed reactions, with some condemning it and others acknowledging it as unusual in the first moments of use before getting accustomed to its presence. [[Face ID]] facial recognition was praised for its simple setup, but criticized for requiring direct eyes on the screen, though that option can be disabled within the [[system preferences]].\n\nAlong with the [[iPhone 6s]], its Plus variant, and the [[iPhone SE]], the iPhone X was discontinued on September 12, 2018 following the announcement of the new [[iPhone XS|iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max]] and [[iPhone XR]] devices. As a result, with a shelf life of just over 10 months, the iPhone X had the shortest ever tenure as the flagship device in the history of the iPhone.\n\nOn November 22, 2018, Apple reportedly resumed production of the iPhone X due to weak sales of its successors.

Patel highlighted the fact that apps required updates to fit the new screen, writing that not all popular apps had received updates by the time of the review, resulting in some apps with \"huge black borders\" resembling iPhone 8.

It was available to pre-order on October 27, 2017 and was released on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone X was intended to showcase what Apple considered the technology of the future. Using a glass and stainless-steel form factor and \"[[bezel (screen)|bezel-less]]\" design, shrinking the bezels, and not having a \"chin\", unlike many Android phones.  It was the first iPhone to use an [[OLED]] screen. The home button was replaced with a new type of authentication called [[Face ID]], which used sensors to [[Facial recognition system|scan the user's face]] to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of $999 USD also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes.\n\nThe iPhone X received generally positive reviews. Its display and build quality were widely praised, and the camera also scored positively on tests. The phone received polarized reception due to the sensor housing \"[[notch (engineering)|notch]]\" at the top of the screen and the introduction of an all-new authentication method. The notch was heavily mocked by users on social media, although app developers responded either neutrally or positively to the changes it brought to the user experience in their apps and games. Reviewers had mixed reactions, with some condemning it and others acknowledging it as unusual in the first moments of use before getting accustomed to its presence. [[Face ID]] facial recognition was praised for its simple setup, but criticized for requiring direct eyes on the screen, though that option can be disabled within the [[system preferences]].\n\nAlong with the [[iPhone 6s]], its Plus variant, and the [[iPhone SE]], the iPhone X was discontinued on September 12, 2018 following the announcement of the new [[iPhone XS|iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max]] and [[iPhone XR]] devices. As a result, with a shelf life of just over 10 months, the iPhone X had the shortest ever tenure as the flagship device in the history of the iPhone.\n\nOn November 22, 2018, Apple reportedly resumed production of the iPhone X due to weak sales of its successors. The iPhone X remains discontinued,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/11/22/18107795/iphone-x-production-resumed-weak-demand-2018-models-rumor|title=Apple resumes iPhone X

Patel highlighted the fact that apps required updates to fit the new screen, writing that not all popular apps had received updates by the time of the review, resulting in some apps with \"huge black borders\" resembling iPhone 8.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=\"ref4\">{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=\"ref9\"/> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=\"ref8\"/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=\"ref16\">{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=\"ref11\">{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=\"ref4\">{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=\"ref9\"/> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=\"ref8\"/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=\"ref16\">{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

Fermentation of straw was tried, creating a sticky goo. There were attempts to make paper from other than rags in the 19th century and an early commercial success was achieved by Samuel Hook and his son, Charles Townsend Hook, using straw at Upper Tovil Mill in the 1850s. The road next to Upper Tovil Mill became known, and was later named, as Straw Mill Hill. To produce pulp, the straw was cooked in hot alkali. After separation of the fibre, the remaining liquid looked like black treacle. Upper Tovil Mill closed in the 1980s and the site was used for a housing estate.\n\n[[Tudeley]] and [[Frittenden]] in Kent are also said to have had treacle mines.

P. Martin]], the main character (an elephant named \"Uncle\") discovers the true meaning of a cryptic sign which reads \"Treac Levat\"; the characters soon discover that it relates to a vast hidden treacle vat.\n*Treacle mining features in several novels by [[Terry Pratchett]]. On the fictional [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]] treacle is mined from buried deposits of compressed ancient sugarcane. In the city of [[Ankh-Morpork]] there is a street named Treacle Mine Road, with the current watch house (analogous to a police station) found in the building formerly housing the entrance to a treacle mine. The books also make references to \"deep treacle\" deposits beneath the city. As with many features of the Discworld, treacle mines exist ''because'' people believe in them, according to the Discworld's Theory of Narrative Causality.\n*''[[The Treacle People]]'' was a children's TV show from 1995 based around the treacle mines of [[Sabden]] in [[Lancashire]].\n*All the members of the Seven Champions [[Molly dance|Molly Dancers]] <ref name=SevenChamps>[http://www.sevenchampions.org.uk Seven Champions Molly Dancers]</ref> from [[Kent]] are reputed to be treacle miners.\n*Some of [[Ken Dodd]]'s [[Diddy Men]] were said to work in a [[Jam sandwich (food)|jam butty]] mine.

Fermentation of straw was tried, creating a sticky goo. There were attempts to make paper from other than rags in the 19th century and an early commercial success was achieved by Samuel Hook and his son, Charles Townsend Hook, using straw at Upper Tovil Mill in the 1850s. The road next to Upper Tovil Mill became known, and was later named, as Straw Mill Hill. To produce pulp, the straw was cooked in hot alkali. After separation of the fibre, the remaining liquid looked like black treacle. Upper Tovil Mill closed in the 1980s and the site was used for a housing estate.\n\n[[Tudeley]] and [[Frittenden]] in Kent are also said to have had treacle mines.

In the city of [[Ankh-Morpork]] there is a street named Treacle Mine Road, with the current watch house (analogous to a police station) found in the building formerly housing the entrance to a treacle mine. The books also make references to \"deep treacle\" deposits beneath the city. As with many features of the Discworld, treacle mines exist ''because'' people believe in them, according to the Discworld's Theory of Narrative Causality.\n*''[[The Treacle People]]'' was a children's TV show from 1995 based around the treacle mines of [[Sabden]] in [[Lancashire]].\n*All the members of the Seven Champions [[Molly dance|Molly Dancers]] <ref name=SevenChamps>[http://www.sevenchampions.org.uk Seven Champions Molly Dancers]</ref> from [[Kent]] are reputed to be treacle miners.\n*Some of [[Ken Dodd]]'s [[Diddy Men]] were said to work in a [[Jam sandwich (food)|jam butty]] mine.

Hirsch graduated from the [[California Institute of the Arts]], and was hired to work as writer and storyboard artist for the [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'', where he was paired up with [[Pendleton Ward]], the creator of ''[[Adventure Time]]''. Afterwards, he moved on to co-develop the Disney Channel animated series ''[[Fish Hooks]]''; shortly before he pitched (and was subsequently [[green-light|green-lit]]) ''Gravity Falls''.<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\">{{cite news | first = Erik | last = Adams | title = Comedy Showrunners Week: Alex Hirsch on the real in the unreal of ''Gravity Falls'' | date = September 28, 2012 | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/alex-hirsch-gravity-falls-showrunner-comedy,85801/ | work = A.V.

Club]]'' during production of season 1, that a typical episode is conceived in a room reserved for writers, where a simple synopsis is presented, and from then on [[dramatic structure]] is defined, and the plot is modified to include a character-driven subplot, which Hirsch expresses as \"the hardest thing ... to find a character story that actually uncovers, explores, or pushes tension\u2014on something our characters care about\u2014that is properly explored via the magic or monster or impossibility of the week.\"<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/>\n\n[[Subplot|B-]] and [[Plot (narrative)|A-stories]] are created, and are given to a writer to produce an [[Outline (list)|outline]], which is then subsequently checked-off by Hirsch for feedback. The writer produces a draft from these edits, where more notes may be given. Hirsch states that he and [[creative director]] Mike Rianda may personally create a draft for themselves before a final script is produced, in which the dialogue from the draft received from the writer is majorly revised; Hirsch states that the revising process \"is not a discredit to our writers\u2014it's just we have a very particular vision. In particular, I usually rewrite almost all of Dipper's dialogue and most of Mabel's dialogue, just because I have them in my head.

The second season began airing a year later in August 2014, transitioning over to [[Disney XD]], but again without any regularity to when new episodes would be first broadcast. The first nine episodes aired from August to November 2014, the following two in February and March 2015, the next eight from July to November 2015, and the finale aired in February 2016. According to Disney XD, as each episode took about six months of work to complete, they opted against stockpiling episodes to show weekly but instead take advantage of the serial nature of the show, broadcasting each episode as it was completed and making an event out of it.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2015/11/gravity-falls-ending/ | title = Gravity Falls' Many Fans Couldn't Save it from an Early End | first = K.M. | last = McFarland | date = November 23, 2015 | accessdate = July 21, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> On April 2, 2018, reruns of the show  started airing on [[Disney Channel]], although reruns of the show still air on [[Disney XD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0shvQZpLU9M|title=Gravity Falls Returns to Disney  Channel - Promo|first=|last=Disney Channel Central|date=April 6, 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n<!--All additions require a date and a source.

That animation didn't have to just be for kids. That it could be satirical and observational and grounded in a sense of character interaction\". Hirsch graduated from the [[California Institute of the Arts]], and was hired to work as writer and storyboard artist for the [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'', where he was paired up with [[Pendleton Ward]], the creator of ''[[Adventure Time]]''. Afterwards, he moved on to co-develop the Disney Channel animated series ''[[Fish Hooks]]''; shortly before he pitched (and was subsequently [[green-light|green-lit]]) ''Gravity Falls''.<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\">{{cite news | first = Erik | last = Adams | title = Comedy Showrunners Week: Alex Hirsch on the real in the unreal of ''Gravity Falls'' | date = September 28, 2012 | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/alex-hirsch-gravity-falls-showrunner-comedy,85801/ | work = A.V.

Club]]'' during production of season 1, that a typical episode is conceived in a room reserved for writers, where a simple synopsis is presented, and from then on [[dramatic structure]] is defined, and the plot is modified to include a character-driven subplot, which Hirsch expresses as \"the hardest thing ... to find a character story that actually uncovers, explores, or pushes tension\u2014on something our characters care about\u2014that is properly explored via the magic or monster or impossibility of the week.\"<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/>\n\n[[Subplot|B-]] and [[Plot (narrative)|A-stories]] are created, and are given to a writer to produce an [[Outline (list)|outline]], which is then subsequently checked-off by Hirsch for feedback. The writer produces a draft from these edits, where more notes may be given. Hirsch states that he and [[creative director]] Mike Rianda may personally create a draft for themselves before a final script is produced, in which the dialogue from the draft received from the writer is majorly revised; Hirsch states that the revising process \"is not a discredit to our writers\u2014it's just we have a very particular vision. In particular, I usually rewrite almost all of Dipper's dialogue and most of Mabel's dialogue, just because I have them in my head. Me and Mike will stay up for about 24 hours prior to the delivery of every script. We'll take the weekend, we'll work all night, we'll drink [[Red Bull]], we'll sleep on the couch in shifts like maniacs, we'll slap each other in the face.\"<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/>\n\nA script is delivered, which then gets translated into a [[storyboard]], where feedback is received from Hirsch to the board artists if a certain element, such as a [[Visual gag|gag]], doesn't work. Afterwards, a [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for the episode is given to the network, where they do a read-through, and then the episode is either checked out by the network, or retooled in the small amount of time allocated before an [[animation studio]] must receive something to work with.<ref name=\"Adams 2012-09-28\"/> The series is animated by [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]], Digital eMation and [[Yearim Productions]].\n\n===Initial broadcast===\nThe first twelve episodes of ''Gravity Falls'' aired in a regular weekly slot on [[Disney Channel]] starting in mid-2012, but subsequent episodes were broadcast without similar regularity; it took until August 2013 to broadcast the remaining eight episodes of the first season. The second season began airing a year later in August 2014, transitioning over to [[Disney XD]], but again without any regularity to when new episodes would be first broadcast. The first nine episodes aired from August to November 2014, the following two in February and March 2015, the next eight from July to November 2015, and the finale aired in February 2016. According to Disney XD, as each episode took about six months of work to complete, they opted against stockpiling episodes to show weekly but instead take advantage of the serial nature of the show, broadcasting each episode as it was completed and making an event out of it.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2015/11/gravity-falls-ending/ | title = Gravity Falls' Many Fans Couldn't Save it from an Early End | first = K.M. | last = McFarland | date = November 23, 2015 | accessdate = July 21, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> On April 2, 2018, reruns of the show  started airing on [[Disney Channel]], although reruns of the show still air on [[Disney XD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0shvQZpLU9M|title=Gravity Falls Returns to Disney  Channel - Promo|first=|last=Disney Channel Central|date=April 6, 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n<!--All additions require a date and a source.
