The Jets were bannered by actors and showbiz personalities, while the BAP team was supposed to have been sent to represent the country in an international tournament. This led to calls from [[Philippine Olympic Committee]] President Jose \"Peping\" Cojuangco to reform the BAP's programs and send a national team made up of professional players from the [[Philippine Basketball Association]].\n\nHowever, disagreements became bitter in mid-2005 as both groups wanted to have their own groups represent the country to the SEABA Men's Basketball tournament in Malaysia. The BAP also replaced Quintellano \"Tiny\" Literal with former Philippine senator and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] governor Joey Lina as President of the basketball body. As the dispute continued, other National Sports Associations of  the POC expelled the association as the National Sports Association for basketball in the country and created the Philippine Basketball Federation, Inc. as the new basketball governing body. The FIBA, meanwhile, continued to recognize only the BAP and instructed its leaders to sort out the issue.\n\nIn July 2005, [[FIBA]] suspended the country from all-FIBA sanctioned events, denying an opportunity to defend the SEABA crown, a qualifying round for the [[FIBA Asian Championship]]s.\n\nTalks of unity would resurface as major basketball stakeholders the [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]], [[Philippine Basketball League|PBL]], [[UAAP]] and [[NCAA]] and Joey Lina, then-BAP President to represent the BAP to form another new association, which materialized in March 2006, and was eventually known as [[Pilipinas Basketball]].\n\nHowever, the talks stalled when Lina backed out from the formation of the group. It was reported that several members of the BAP were not willing to cooperate with the limited power sharing with Pilipinas Basketball. Pilipinas Basketball tried its luck to gain FIBA recognition from FIBA Secretary-General Patrick Baumann but was denied, urging them to \"keep the course\".\n\nAfter another dispute between POC and Lina in forming [[Pilipinas Basketball]] in March 2006, both groups agreed to a joint communique to form a new cage body, later named as the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]], in order to resolve the conflict.\n\nHowever, resurfaced disagreements led to Lina quitting as BAP head after 1\u00bd years at the helm, claiming POC's intervention in the formation of the SBP. Secretary-General Graham Lim also resigned in the SBP Board.\n\nAfter Lina's resignation, Philippine senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]], son of former Philippine president [[Joseph Estrada]], became the new president of the BAP. One of the first moves he tried to make was to request for the padlocked BAP office at the Philippine Sports Commission building to be reopened and to convince the POC to reinstate the BAP. However, those requests were denied, but Estrada was given explanation by POC President Jose Cojuangco about the reasons for the BAP expulsion.\n\nEstrada would later work with the SBP on an agreement to unify the two organizations. The BAP board became irate and fired Estrada as its president. Once again, several members of the BAP were not willing to cooperate with the limited power sharing with the SBP. Estrada stayed with the SBP as a special consultant. [[Philippine Amateur Track and Field Association]] president [[Go Teng Kok]] was named as the association's interim president.\n\nFIBA Secretary-General Patrick Baumann, however, fast-tracked the form the SBP, saying that the BAP cannot back out of the \"Joint Communique\" which stated that the BAP had to cooperate, and be merged with Pilipinas Basketball to form the SBP.\n\nThe association was intended to be dissolved and merged with Pilipinas Basketball to form a new basketball body.

Furthermore, Roche claimed that Mars One is asking finalists for donations from any money earned from guest appearances (which would amount to a minimal portion of the estimated $6 billion required for the mission). Finally, despite being one of 100 finalists, Roche himself has never spoken to any Mars One employee or representative in person, and instead of psychological or psychometric testing as is normal for astronaut candidates (especially for a lengthy, one-way mission), his interview process consisted of a 10-minute [[Skype]] conversation.<ref name=\"techspot.com\"/><ref>{{cite web| last1=Roche| first1=Joseph| title=I'm on list to be a Mars One astronaut \u2013 but I won't see the red planet| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/18/mars-one-astronaut-joseph-roche-space-missions| website=The Guardian| accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, Mars One's CEO Bas Lansdorp admitted that their 12-year plan for landing humans on Mars by 2027 is mostly fiction.<ref name=\"iflscience_2015-08-21\"/>\n\n=== Space advocacy and policy ===\n[[Robert Zubrin]], advocate for crewed Martian exploration, said \"I don't think the business plan closes it.

The PhD candidates estimated the need for spare parts in a Mars colony based on the failure rates of parts on the ISS.

These claims include that the organization lied about the number of applicants, stating that 200,000 individuals applied versus Roche's claim of 2,761, and that many of the applicants had paid to be put on the list. Furthermore, Roche claimed that Mars One is asking finalists for donations from any money earned from guest appearances (which would amount to a minimal portion of the estimated $6 billion required for the mission). Finally, despite being one of 100 finalists, Roche himself has never spoken to any Mars One employee or representative in person, and instead of psychological or psychometric testing as is normal for astronaut candidates (especially for a lengthy, one-way mission), his interview process consisted of a 10-minute [[Skype]] conversation.<ref name=\"techspot.com\"/><ref>{{cite web| last1=Roche| first1=Joseph| title=I'm on list to be a Mars One astronaut \u2013 but I won't see the red planet| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/18/mars-one-astronaut-joseph-roche-space-missions| website=The Guardian| accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, Mars One's CEO Bas Lansdorp admitted that their 12-year plan for landing humans on Mars by 2027 is mostly fiction.<ref name=\"iflscience_2015-08-21\"/>\n\n=== Space advocacy and policy ===\n[[Robert Zubrin]], advocate for crewed Martian exploration, said \"I don't think the business plan closes it.

The film stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as an Israeli [[Mossad]] agent who runs a covert operation that helps Ethiopian-Jewish refugees escape to safe haven in Israel. [[Michael K. Williams|Michael Kenneth Williams]], [[Haley Bennett]], [[Alessandro Nivola]], [[Michiel Huisman]], [[Chris Chalk]], [[Greg Kinnear]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] are in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the events of [[Operation Brothers|Operation Moses]] and [[Operation Joshua]] in 1984-1985, in which the Mossad covertly evacuated [[Beta Israel|Jewish Ethiopian]] refugees to [[Israel]].\n\n''The Red Sea Diving Resort'' premiered at the [[San Francisco Jewish Film Festival]] on July 28, 2019, and was released on July 31, 2019, by [[Netflix]]. Critical reaction to the film was predominantly negative.\n\n==Plot==\nKabede Bimro, an [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jew]], works with the [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Mossad]] agent Ari Levinson to evacuate Jewish-Ethiopian refugees to Israel. Ari realizes that his ability to operate in Ethiopia would be improved if he had a cover activity that would give him a reason for having a building and vehicles. He proposes to Israeli intelligence officer Ethan Levin a plan that would allow him to evacuate significantly more refugees: rent the Red Sea Diving Resort, an abandoned Sudanese coastal hotel, and run it as a [[Front organization|front]] to facilitate moving refugees out of the country. The unorthodox plan is reluctantly approved, and Ari recruits his former Mossad colleagues Rachel Reiter, Jake Wolf, Max Rose, and Sammy Navon, to assist him.\n\nShortly after the team's arrival in the Islamic country of Sudan, the brochures they had printed inspire actual tourists to begin arriving at the resort. Although hosting guests was not originally part of the plan, Levinson realizes the tourists will provide cover for the team's operations, so the team runs the resort as a legitimate business while simultaneously evacuating refugees to a waiting Israeli ship off the coast. The plan is initially successful, and multiple extraction operations are carried out, but the [[Sudan|Sudanese]] Colonel Abdel Ahmed learns of Bimro after interrogating and then killing a group of refugees. Ahmed visits the resort to investigate but does not discover the refugee operation.\n\nOne night, Ari and Sammy are arrested after an evacuation mission narrowly escapes from Sudanese soldiers. They are released and return to the resort to find Levin awaiting them; he tells the group the mission has been compromised and that it is canceled.\n\nAhmed again visits the resort, and Rachel is forced to kill one of his men after the soldier discovers a group of refugees hiding there. To evacuate them, Ari decides to perform a final refugee extraction by cargo plane with assistance from Walton Bowen, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer. Ari and his team transport the refugees to an abandoned British airfield. The team and Bimro narrowly escape Ahmed and extract themselves and the refugees.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Ari Levinson\n* [[Michael K.

The film stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as an Israeli [[Mossad]] agent who runs a covert operation that helps Ethiopian-Jewish refugees escape to safe haven in Israel. [[Michael K. Williams|Michael Kenneth Williams]], [[Haley Bennett]], [[Alessandro Nivola]], [[Michiel Huisman]], [[Chris Chalk]], [[Greg Kinnear]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] are in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the events of [[Operation Brothers|Operation Moses]] and [[Operation Joshua]] in 1984-1985, in which the Mossad covertly evacuated [[Beta Israel|Jewish Ethiopian]] refugees to [[Israel]].\n\n''The Red Sea Diving Resort'' premiered at the [[San Francisco Jewish Film Festival]] on July 28, 2019, and was released on July 31, 2019, by [[Netflix]]. Critical reaction to the film was predominantly negative.\n\n==Plot==\nKabede Bimro, an [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jew]], works with the [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Mossad]] agent Ari Levinson to evacuate Jewish-Ethiopian refugees to Israel. Ari realizes that his ability to operate in Ethiopia would be improved if he had a cover activity that would give him a reason for having a building and vehicles. He proposes to Israeli intelligence officer Ethan Levin a plan that would allow him to evacuate significantly more refugees: rent the Red Sea Diving Resort, an abandoned Sudanese coastal hotel, and run it as a [[Front organization|front]] to facilitate moving refugees out of the country. The unorthodox plan is reluctantly approved, and Ari recruits his former Mossad colleagues Rachel Reiter, Jake Wolf, Max Rose, and Sammy Navon, to assist him.\n\nShortly after the team's arrival in the Islamic country of Sudan, the brochures they had printed inspire actual tourists to begin arriving at the resort. Although hosting guests was not originally part of the plan, Levinson realizes the tourists will provide cover for the team's operations, so the team runs the resort as a legitimate business while simultaneously evacuating refugees to a waiting Israeli ship off the coast. The plan is initially successful, and multiple extraction operations are carried out, but the [[Sudan|Sudanese]] Colonel Abdel Ahmed learns of Bimro after interrogating and then killing a group of refugees. Ahmed visits the resort to investigate but does not discover the refugee operation.\n\nOne night, Ari and Sammy are arrested after an evacuation mission narrowly escapes from Sudanese soldiers. They are released and return to the resort to find Levin awaiting them; he tells the group the mission has been compromised and that it is canceled.\n\nAhmed again visits the resort, and Rachel is forced to kill one of his men after the soldier discovers a group of refugees hiding there. To evacuate them, Ari decides to perform a final refugee extraction by cargo plane with assistance from Walton Bowen, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer. Ari and his team transport the refugees to an abandoned British airfield. The team and Bimro narrowly escape Ahmed and extract themselves and the refugees.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Ari Levinson\n* [[Michael K.
