In 1853, Colonel [[William Duckett Bowie]] obtained a charter from the [[Maryland General Assembly|Maryland legislature]] to construct a rail line into Southern Maryland. In 1869, the [[Baltimore & Potomac Railroad|Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Company]] began the construction of a railroad from Baltimore to Southern Maryland, terminating in [[Popes Creek, Maryland|Pope's Creek]]. The area had already been dotted with small farms and large tobacco plantations in an economy based on agriculture and slavery. In 1870, Ben Plumb, a land speculator and developer, sold building lots around the railroad junction and named the settlement Huntington City. By 1872, the line was completed, together with a \"spur\" to Washington, D.C. and the entire line through Southern Maryland was completed in 1873.\n\nIn 1880, Huntington City was rechartered as Bowie, named for Colonel Bowie's son and business partner [[Oden Bowie]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cityofbowie.org/business/revitalization.asp\n|title=Revitalization of Old Town Bowie\n|publisher=City of Bowie, Maryland\n|accessdate=2007-10-02\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720142757/http://www.cityofbowie.org/business/revitalization.asp\n|archivedate=2007-07-20\n}}</ref><ref name=hall>\n{{cite web\n  | title =The Prince George's Hall of Fame\n  | publisher =Prince George's County Historical Society\n  | year =2003\n  | url =http://www.pghistory.org/HallofFame\n  | accessdate =2007-08-16\n  | url-status =dead\n  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070924204547/http://www.pghistory.org/HallofFame\n  | archivedate =2007-09-24\n  }}\n</ref><ref name=pg300>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.pghistory.org/PG/PG300/obowie.html\n|title=Prince George's County: Over 300 years of History&nbsp;\u2013 Oden Bowie\n| publisher =Prince George's County Historical Society\n|year=1996\n|accessdate= 2007-10-02}}</ref><ref name=penn>\n{{cite book\n  | last =Wilson\n  | first =William Bender\n  | title =History of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company: With Plan of Organization\n  | url =https://archive.org/details/historypennsylv03wilsgoog\n  | publisher =Henry T.

A second railroad entered the community when the [[Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway]] electric trolley line commenced service in 1908. The large interurban cars brought rapid transit to the area, with trains running hourly. Bowie area stations included High Bridge, Hillmeade, and the Race Track.\n\nThe convergence of the two rail systems induced the Southern Maryland Agricultural Society to build the [[Bowie Race Track]] in 1914. The track enabled the [[Belair Stud]] to become one of Maryland's premier areas for [[thoroughbreds]]. Also in 1914, a teacher-training college, or [[normal school]] as it was referred to then, was built for African-Americans, just outside the town. This now has become [[Bowie State University]].  The town of Bowie was incorporated in 1916.\n\n====Belair at Bowie====\nIn 1957, the firm of [[William Levitt|Levitt and Sons]] acquired the nearby Belair Estate, the original colonial plantation of the [[Province of Maryland|Provincial Governor of Maryland]], [[Samuel Ogle]], and developed the residential community of Belair at Bowie. Two years later the town of Bowie annexed the Levitt properties, and then re-incorporated the now-larger area as a city in 1963. The overwhelming majority of Bowie residents today live in this 1960s Levitt planned community, whose street names are arranged in alliterative sections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacobs |first1=James A. |title=Belair at Bowie |url=http://sah-archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FMD-01-033-0004.xml?q=%28section%3AMD-01%29%20AND%20city%3ABowie |website=[[Society of Architectural Historians]] Archipedia |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |accessdate=28 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829072201/http://sah-archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FMD-01-033-0004.xml?q=%28section%3AMD-01%29%20AND%20city%3ABowie |archive-date=29 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Levitt & Sons had a long history of prohibiting the sale of houses (including resale by owners) to African Americans which led to protests during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in Bowie in 1963.<ref name = \"Time200\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989781-1,00.html Suburban Legend WILLIAM LEVITT]</ref>\n\n====Belair Estate====\nThe original Belair Estate contains the [[Belair Mansion (Bowie, Maryland)|Belair Mansion]] (circa 1745), the five-part Georgian plantation house of Governor [[Samuel Ogle]] and his son Governor [[Benjamin Ogle]].

Restored to reflect its 250-year-old legacy, the Mansion is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n[[Belair Stable Museum|Belair Stable]], on the Estate, was part of the famous [[Belair Stud]], one of the premier [[Thoroughbred horse racing|racing stables]] in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. Owned and operated by [[William Woodward, Sr.]] (1876\u20131953), it closed in 1957 following the death of his son, [[William Woodward, Jr.|Billy Woodward]].

In 1853, Colonel [[William Duckett Bowie]] obtained a charter from the [[Maryland General Assembly|Maryland legislature]] to construct a rail line into Southern Maryland. In 1869, the [[Baltimore & Potomac Railroad|Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Company]] began the construction of a railroad from Baltimore to Southern Maryland, terminating in [[Popes Creek, Maryland|Pope's Creek]]. The area had already been dotted with small farms and large tobacco plantations in an economy based on agriculture and slavery. In 1870, Ben Plumb, a land speculator and developer, sold building lots around the railroad junction and named the settlement Huntington City. By 1872, the line was completed, together with a \"spur\" to Washington, D.C. and the entire line through Southern Maryland was completed in 1873.\n\nIn 1880, Huntington City was rechartered as Bowie, named for Colonel Bowie's son and business partner [[Oden Bowie]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cityofbowie.org/business/revitalization.asp\n|title=Revitalization of Old Town Bowie\n|publisher=City of Bowie, Maryland\n|accessdate=2007-10-02\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720142757/http://www.cityofbowie.org/business/revitalization.asp\n|archivedate=2007-07-20\n}}</ref><ref name=hall>\n{{cite web\n  | title =The Prince George's Hall of Fame\n  | publisher =Prince George's County Historical Society\n  | year =2003\n  | url =http://www.pghistory.org/HallofFame\n  | accessdate =2007-08-16\n  | url-status =dead\n  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070924204547/http://www.pghistory.org/HallofFame\n  | archivedate =2007-09-24\n  }}\n</ref><ref name=pg300>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.pghistory.org/PG/PG300/obowie.html\n|title=Prince George's County: Over 300 years of History&nbsp;\u2013 Oden Bowie\n| publisher =Prince George's County Historical Society\n|year=1996\n|accessdate= 2007-10-02}}</ref><ref name=penn>\n{{cite book\n  | last =Wilson\n  | first =William Bender\n  | title =History of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company: With Plan of Organization\n  | url =https://archive.org/details/historypennsylv03wilsgoog\n  | publisher =Henry T.

A second railroad entered the community when the [[Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway]] electric trolley line commenced service in 1908. The large interurban cars brought rapid transit to the area, with trains running hourly. Bowie area stations included High Bridge, Hillmeade, and the Race Track.\n\nThe convergence of the two rail systems induced the Southern Maryland Agricultural Society to build the [[Bowie Race Track]] in 1914. The track enabled the [[Belair Stud]] to become one of Maryland's premier areas for [[thoroughbreds]]. Also in 1914, a teacher-training college, or [[normal school]] as it was referred to then, was built for African-Americans, just outside the town. This now has become [[Bowie State University]].  The town of Bowie was incorporated in 1916.\n\n====Belair at Bowie====\nIn 1957, the firm of [[William Levitt|Levitt and Sons]] acquired the nearby Belair Estate, the original colonial plantation of the [[Province of Maryland|Provincial Governor of Maryland]], [[Samuel Ogle]], and developed the residential community of Belair at Bowie. Two years later the town of Bowie annexed the Levitt properties, and then re-incorporated the now-larger area as a city in 1963. The overwhelming majority of Bowie residents today live in this 1960s Levitt planned community, whose street names are arranged in alliterative sections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacobs |first1=James A. |title=Belair at Bowie |url=http://sah-archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FMD-01-033-0004.xml?q=%28section%3AMD-01%29%20AND%20city%3ABowie |website=[[Society of Architectural Historians]] Archipedia |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |accessdate=28 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829072201/http://sah-archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FMD-01-033-0004.xml?q=%28section%3AMD-01%29%20AND%20city%3ABowie |archive-date=29 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Levitt & Sons had a long history of prohibiting the sale of houses (including resale by owners) to African Americans which led to protests during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in Bowie in 1963.<ref name = \"Time200\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989781-1,00.html Suburban Legend WILLIAM LEVITT]</ref>\n\n====Belair Estate====\nThe original Belair Estate contains the [[Belair Mansion (Bowie, Maryland)|Belair Mansion]] (circa 1745), the five-part Georgian plantation house of Governor [[Samuel Ogle]] and his son Governor [[Benjamin Ogle]].

Restored to reflect its 250-year-old legacy, the Mansion is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n[[Belair Stable Museum|Belair Stable]], on the Estate, was part of the famous [[Belair Stud]], one of the premier [[Thoroughbred horse racing|racing stables]] in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. Owned and operated by [[William Woodward, Sr.]] (1876\u20131953), it closed in 1957 following the death of his son, [[William Woodward, Jr.|Billy Woodward]].

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]].

UMHK officials privately told Tshombe they were withdrawing their support for succession.<ref name=\"othen\" /> General Moke vainly attempted to organise the 140 mercenaries and 2,000 gendarmes under his command to prepare a final defence of Kolwezi. His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and indiscipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Discipline in the garrison increasingly faltered; in once instance, two mercenaries attempted to steal Puren's jeep. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of [[Baudouinville]] to surrender to besieging UN and ANC forces. Instead, they and most of the population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near [[Kongolo, Katanga|Kongolo]] laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers. On 14 January, Indian troops found the last intact bridge into Kolwezi. After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.<ref name=\"othen\" /> At a final meeting with his mercenary commanders, Tshombe ordered all remaining Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. [[Jean Schramme]] was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January.<ref name=\"othen\" />\n\nOn 15 January, Tshombe sent a formal message to Thant, \"I am ready to proclaim immediately before the world that the Katanga's secession is ended.\"{{sfn|Meisler|2011|p=133}} He offered to return to \u00c9lisabethville to oversee the implementation of Thant's proposal for reunification if Prime Minister Adoula granted amnesty to himself and his government.

Following the operation the UN was able to confirm that Portuguese Angola, South Africa, and Northern Rhodesia had assisted the Katangese in arming their air force.{{sfn|Dorn|2016|p=32}}\n\n=== Exile, return, and the Simba rebellion ===\n{{Further|Simba rebellion}}\nAfter the defeat of the State of Katanga, plans to disarm or integrate the gendarmes were made. On 8 February 1963, General Moke and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000-17,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000-3,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the Kwilu and Simba rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} They were used successfully against the insurgencies, and, following Tshombe's ousting from power, they retained significant political distance from Mobutu's regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in [[Stanleyville mutinies|a bloody mutiny]] in July 1966.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}}\n\nA March 1967 trial of Tshombe ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' criminalized the actions of the gendarmes retrospectively. After the trial, the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and [[Kisangani]], after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes, led by Belgian mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Tough the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo. The mercenaries were expelled from Africa and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}{{Sfn|Arnold|1999|p=15}}\n\nA brief rebellion was executed by [[Bob Denard]] from November 1 to 5, 1967.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Genarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.

{"title_page": "Referendums in New Zealand", "text_new": "{{Politics of New Zealand}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n[[Referendum]]s (or referenda) are held only occasionally by the Government of [[New Zealand]]. Referendums may be government-initiated or held in accordance with the [[Electoral Act 1993]] or the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993]. Ten [[referendum]]s have been held so far (excluding referendums on alcohol licensing, which were held triennially between 1894 and 1989). Seven were government-led, and three were indicative citizen initiatives.\n\n==Government referendums==\nThe government of New Zealand may, at any time, call for a referendum on any issue. This requires enabling legislation to determine whether the outcome will be binding on the government or merely indicative. This allows parliamentary scrutiny of the issue and wording of the question. There is no constraint on whether an issue is to be decided by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] or by the public, except for where the reserved provisions of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] are engaged. [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310495.html Section 268] of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] protects some of the provisions of the Act from amendment except in accordance with s 268(2) which requires a majority vote in a referendum of a 75% majority of Members of Parliament.<ref>Electoral Act 1993, s 268.</ref> The protected provisions include, ''inter alia'', the term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], the voting age and the voting method. The provision itself is not protected from ordinary amendment or repeal.\n\nThis has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, as there is in other countries like [[Australia]] or [[Switzerland]] that have codified [[constitution]]s.\n\nRecent examples are the [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag referendums]] held across 2015 and 2016, conducted by postal vote.\n\n===Constitutional referendums===\nThere is no requirement for a referendum to enact constitutional change in New Zealand. Referendums were held in 1992 and 1993 to decide the nature of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]]. Many groups advocate approval of constitutional reforms by referendums; the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|Republican Movement]] supports a referendum on whether [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand should become a republic]].\n\nThere are frequent calls for the use of referendums to decide other constitutional matters, rather than by regular Acts of Parliament. In 2003 the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] replaced the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] as New Zealand's highest court of appeal with a new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]], despite calls from [[New Zealand First]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] for a referendum to be held on the issue. In 1950 the abolition of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] was done by Act of Parliament; with additional members of the Legislative Council (MLC) appointed to ensure approval by the upper house, the ''suicide squad''.\n\n{{See also|Constitution of New Zealand}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''Turnout''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || 69.7 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 68.1% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 27 October 1990 || 85.2 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 69.3% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 19 September 1992 || 55.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 84.7% for change, 70.5% to MMP\n|-\n| 6 November 1993 || 85.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 53.9% for MMP\n|-\n| 26 November 2011 || 73.5 || [[2011 New Zealand voting method referendum|Voting system]] || 57.8% for keeping MMP\n|}\n\n===Liquor licensing referendums===\nIn New Zealand, alcohol licensing has historically been decided by referendum. The first of these were compulsory local licensing referendums, held in 1894 and then with each main parliamentary election between 1896 and 1914. Local licensing referendums were eliminated after 1914, apart from 'local restoration polls' to legalise liquor sales in 'dry' districts. In 1910 a referendum on national prohibition of alcohol was introduced, and held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1987 inclusive (except [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] and [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). An extra referendum on prohibition was held on 10 April 1919. From 17 December 1919 the additional option of ''state purchase and control'' of liquor (i.e. nationalisation) was added to the ballot. The Sale of Liquor Act 1989 abolished the national liquor referendum. Local restoration polls were still held in areas that were still 'dry', but the last three, [[Mount Eden]], [[Mount Roskill, New Zealand|Mount Roskill]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], all became 'wet' in 1999. There have been two referendums on [[pub]] closing times.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Three-to-one majority to retain\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Two-to-one majority for later opening\n|}\n\n===Other referendums===\nThe government may call referendums on any issues on which it wishes. These will usually be on issues on which the government is split. For the 1997 referendum on retirement savings, the decision to hold it was part of the coalition agreement between [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand First]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || 54.3 || Allow off-course [[betting]] || 68.0% in favour\n|-\n| 3 August 1949 || 63.5 || [[Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand|Compulsory military training]] || 77.9% in favour\n|-\n| 5 September 1997 || 80.3 || Compulsory [[Retirement plan|Retirement Savings]] Scheme || 91.8% against\n|-\n| 20 November \u2013 11 December 2015 || 48.2 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], first stage || 50.58% for [[File:NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White & Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg|25px|border]] [[Lockwood silver fern flag|Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue)]] after 4 counts\n|-\n| 3\u201324 March 2016 || 67.8 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], second stage || 56.6% for retaining the existing [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|}\n\n==Citizens Initiated Referenda==\n{{anchor|Citizens initiated referendums|Citizens-initiated referenda||Citizens-initiated referendums}}\nThe [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993] allows for citizens to propose a [[Initiative|referendum]]. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months. There were [http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/2017-general-election-results/voter-turnout-statistics 3,298,009 voters enrolled] for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], so at least 329,801 signatures would be required at a rate of approximately 904 signatures per day. In reality, more signatures would be required to account for variances in electoral roll numbers, duplicate signatures and signatures that cannot be matched to a registered elector.\n\nThere are procedural requirements governing this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/seek-a-referendum/|title=Seek a referendum|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> It costs [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500 to file a petition asking for a referendum with the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Clerk formally determines the wording of the question, which may be quite different from the original. Once the Clerk receives the completed petition, the number of signatures is initially counted, followed by sample groups of signatures being taken and the signatories' names and addresses checked against the electoral roll. The sampling of signatures is used to estimate the number of valid signatures for the whole petition with confidence, and if the lower confidence interval is more than ten percent of the electoral roll, the petition is presented to the House of Representatives.\n\nWithin one month of the petition's presentation to the House, a date for the poll must be determined. The poll must be held within 12 months of the petition's presentation, unless 75 percent of MPs vote to delay the poll for one year. There is also a $50,000 spending limit on promoting the petition.\n\nNew Zealand, [[Italy]], and [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)#Federal popular initiative|Switzerland]] are among countries whose laws allow for citizen-initiated referendums (CIRs) nationally. Its defenders view it as a form of \"direct democracy\". However, the Citizens Initiated Referendum 1993 went against the advice of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] 1986. The Commission stated, speaking about referenda more broadly, \"In general, initiatives and referendums are blunt and crude devices.... [that] would blur the lines of accountability and responsibility of Governments\".<ref>Royal Commission on the Electoral System \"Towards a Better Democracy\" [1986\u20131987] IX AJHR H3 at [7.30].</ref>\n\nA total of 33 petitions have been launched since 1993 on a wide range of topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Only five (one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009, one in 2013) have come to a vote. The other petitions failed to gain enough signatures to force a referendum. Achieving the target number of signatures is a requirement for forcing a vote on an initiative proposed by citizens.\n\n===Firefighters===\nThe first citizens initiated referendum was held on 2 December 1995. The question \"Should the number of professional fire-fighters employed full-time in the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] be reduced below the number employed on 1 January 1995?\" aimed to elicit a \"no\" response{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Turnout was low as the referendum was not held in conjunction with a general election. Just over 12% voted \"Yes\" and almost 88% voted \"No\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1995.electionresults.govt.nz/1995_citizens_referenda/|format=PDF|title=Return of Citizens Initiated Referendum Poll Votes|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]}}</ref>\n\n===1999 election===\nAt the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] two referendums were put before voters. One was on whether the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced from 120 to 99. Electors overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal, with 81.47% voting for this proposal. However, there were no moves to amend the [[Electoral Act 1993]] in line with this result until 2006 when a bill was introduced by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Barbara Stewart]] to reduce the size of Parliament to 100. The bill passed its first reading, 61 votes to 60 and was referred to Select Committee. The Select Committee returned recommending the bill to not be passed, citing reasons including public misconception on the MMP voting system, population growth, and international comparability.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/067094C5-47A4-43AA-AE7F-5D7C15B55D3E/36327/DBSCH_SCR_3542_3576.pdf |title= Electoral (Reduction in Number of Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill: Report of the Justice and Electoral Committee |year= 2006 |accessdate= 15 August 2012}}</ref> The bill was subsequently voted down 112 to 9 at its second reading.\n\nThe other referendum held in 1999 asked \"Should there be a reform of our Justice system placing greater emphasis on the needs of victims, providing restitution and compensation for them and imposing minimum sentences and hard labour for all serious violent offences?\". This measure passed by 91.78%. There was some debate over the phrasing of the referendum, as the question actually contains five separate questions; voters could agree with some, but not with others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/_2001/publications_2001/Massey_News/February/Feb_26/stories/referendum.html|title=Referendum Confuses Voters|year=2007|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Parental corporal punishment===\n{{main|2009 New Zealand corporal punishment referendum}}\nFollowing the submission of a petition on 22 August 2008, the Clerk of the House verified to Parliament that the threshold for a CIR had been reached.

The only clear cases of non-implementation are the 99MP and smacking CIRs----> of successful referendums has led to calls for such referendums to be made binding on the government of the day, similar to the direct democracy said to exist in [[Swiss#Direct democracy|Switzerland]]. [[ACT New Zealand]], [[Family First New Zealand]], the [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] and [[Kiwi Party]] all advocate binding referendums.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, [[Kiwi Party]] President [[Larry Baldock]] failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]] and its leader, [[Colin Craig]].\n\nBy contrast, [[GayNZ.com]] has run articles strongly critical of the CIR lobby, as well as expressing concerns that CIRs could be abused to strip vulnerable minorities of their legislative protections, as has occurred frequently with referendums against [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] and similar proposals that target [[illegal immigrants]] in that country. In some New Zealand media outlets, the [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland]] has also been cited as one current example of anti-minoritarian abuse of the 'citizens' referendum process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/31/article_8116.php |title=The case against Citizens Initiated Referenda |publisher=Gaynz.com |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"3News_131865\">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Swiss-ban-mosque-minarets-in-surprise-vote/tabid/417/articleID/131865/cat/268/Default.aspx |title=Swiss ban mosque minarets in surprise vote |date=30 November 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Joanne Black: \"Heidi Ho\": New Zealand Listener: 12.12.09: 94</ref>\n\nEven amongst conservatives, the issue has become contentious.

Referendums may be government-initiated or held in accordance with the [[Electoral Act 1993]] or the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993]. Ten [[referendum]]s have been held so far (excluding referendums on alcohol licensing, which were held triennially between 1894 and 1989). Seven were government-led, and three were indicative citizen initiatives.\n\n==Government referendums==\nThe government of New Zealand may, at any time, call for a referendum on any issue. This requires enabling legislation to determine whether the outcome will be binding on the government or merely indicative. This allows parliamentary scrutiny of the issue and wording of the question. There is no constraint on whether an issue is to be decided by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] or by the public, except for where the reserved provisions of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] are engaged. [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310495.html Section 268] of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] protects some of the provisions of the Act from amendment except in accordance with s 268(2) which requires a majority vote in a referendum of a 75% majority of Members of Parliament.<ref>Electoral Act 1993, s 268.</ref> The protected provisions include, ''inter alia'', the term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], the voting age and the voting method. The provision itself is not protected from ordinary amendment or repeal.\n\nThis has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, as there is in other countries like [[Australia]] or [[Switzerland]] that have codified [[constitution]]s.\n\nRecent examples are the [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag referendums]] held across 2015 and 2016, conducted by postal vote.\n\n===Constitutional referendums===\nThere is no requirement for a referendum to enact constitutional change in New Zealand. Referendums were held in 1992 and 1993 to decide the nature of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]]. Many groups advocate approval of constitutional reforms by referendums; the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|Republican Movement]] supports a referendum on whether [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand should become a republic]].\n\nThere are frequent calls for the use of referendums to decide other constitutional matters, rather than by regular Acts of Parliament. In 2003 the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] replaced the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] as New Zealand's highest court of appeal with a new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]], despite calls from [[New Zealand First]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] for a referendum to be held on the issue. In 1950 the abolition of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] was done by Act of Parliament; with additional members of the Legislative Council (MLC) appointed to ensure approval by the upper house, the ''suicide squad''.\n\n{{See also|Constitution of New Zealand}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''Turnout''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || 69.7 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 68.1% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 27 October 1990 || 85.2 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 69.3% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 19 September 1992 || 55.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 84.7% for change, 70.5% to MMP\n|-\n| 6 November 1993 || 85.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 53.9% for MMP\n|-\n| 26 November 2011 || 73.5 || [[2011 New Zealand voting method referendum|Voting system]] || 57.8% for keeping MMP\n|}\n\n===Liquor licensing referendums===\nIn New Zealand, alcohol licensing has historically been decided by referendum. The first of these were compulsory local licensing referendums, held in 1894 and then with each main parliamentary election between 1896 and 1914. Local licensing referendums were eliminated after 1914, apart from 'local restoration polls' to legalise liquor sales in 'dry' districts. In 1910 a referendum on national prohibition of alcohol was introduced, and held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1987 inclusive (except [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] and [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). An extra referendum on prohibition was held on 10 April 1919. From 17 December 1919 the additional option of ''state purchase and control'' of liquor (i.e. nationalisation) was added to the ballot. The Sale of Liquor Act 1989 abolished the national liquor referendum. Local restoration polls were still held in areas that were still 'dry', but the last three, [[Mount Eden]], [[Mount Roskill, New Zealand|Mount Roskill]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], all became 'wet' in 1999. There have been two referendums on [[pub]] closing times.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Three-to-one majority to retain\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Two-to-one majority for later opening\n|}\n\n===Other referendums===\nThe government may call referendums on any issues on which it wishes. These will usually be on issues on which the government is split. For the 1997 referendum on retirement savings, the decision to hold it was part of the coalition agreement between [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand First]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || 54.3 || Allow off-course [[betting]] || 68.0% in favour\n|-\n| 3 August 1949 || 63.5 || [[Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand|Compulsory military training]] || 77.9% in favour\n|-\n| 5 September 1997 || 80.3 || Compulsory [[Retirement plan|Retirement Savings]] Scheme || 91.8% against\n|-\n| 20 November \u2013 11 December 2015 || 48.2 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], first stage || 50.58% for [[File:NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White & Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg|25px|border]] [[Lockwood silver fern flag|Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue)]] after 4 counts\n|-\n| 3\u201324 March 2016 || 67.8 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], second stage || 56.6% for retaining the existing [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|}\n\n==Citizens Initiated Referenda==\n{{anchor|Citizens initiated referendums|Citizens-initiated referenda||Citizens-initiated referendums}}\nThe [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993] allows for citizens to propose a [[Initiative|referendum]]. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months. There were [http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/2017-general-election-results/voter-turnout-statistics 3,298,009 voters enrolled] for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], so at least 329,801 signatures would be required at a rate of approximately 904 signatures per day. In reality, more signatures would be required to account for variances in electoral roll numbers, duplicate signatures and signatures that cannot be matched to a registered elector.\n\nThere are procedural requirements governing this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/seek-a-referendum/|title=Seek a referendum|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> It costs [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500 to file a petition asking for a referendum with the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Clerk formally determines the wording of the question, which may be quite different from the original. Once the Clerk receives the completed petition, the number of signatures is initially counted, followed by sample groups of signatures being taken and the signatories' names and addresses checked against the electoral roll. The sampling of signatures is used to estimate the number of valid signatures for the whole petition with confidence, and if the lower confidence interval is more than ten percent of the electoral roll, the petition is presented to the House of Representatives.\n\nWithin one month of the petition's presentation to the House, a date for the poll must be determined. The poll must be held within 12 months of the petition's presentation, unless 75 percent of MPs vote to delay the poll for one year. There is also a $50,000 spending limit on promoting the petition.\n\nNew Zealand, [[Italy]], and [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)#Federal popular initiative|Switzerland]] are among countries whose laws allow for citizen-initiated referendums (CIRs) nationally. Its defenders view it as a form of \"direct democracy\". However, the Citizens Initiated Referendum 1993 went against the advice of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] 1986. The Commission stated, speaking about referenda more broadly, \"In general, initiatives and referendums are blunt and crude devices.... [that] would blur the lines of accountability and responsibility of Governments\".<ref>Royal Commission on the Electoral System \"Towards a Better Democracy\" [1986\u20131987] IX AJHR H3 at [7.30].</ref>\n\nA total of 33 petitions have been launched since 1993 on a wide range of topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Only five (one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009, one in 2013) have come to a vote. The other petitions failed to gain enough signatures to force a referendum. Achieving the target number of signatures is a requirement for forcing a vote on an initiative proposed by citizens.\n\n===Firefighters===\nThe first citizens initiated referendum was held on 2 December 1995. The question \"Should the number of professional fire-fighters employed full-time in the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] be reduced below the number employed on 1 January 1995?\" aimed to elicit a \"no\" response{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Turnout was low as the referendum was not held in conjunction with a general election. Just over 12% voted \"Yes\" and almost 88% voted \"No\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1995.electionresults.govt.nz/1995_citizens_referenda/|format=PDF|title=Return of Citizens Initiated Referendum Poll Votes|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]}}</ref>\n\n===1999 election===\nAt the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] two referendums were put before voters. One was on whether the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced from 120 to 99. Electors overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal, with 81.47% voting for this proposal. However, there were no moves to amend the [[Electoral Act 1993]] in line with this result until 2006 when a bill was introduced by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Barbara Stewart]] to reduce the size of Parliament to 100. The bill passed its first reading, 61 votes to 60 and was referred to Select Committee. The Select Committee returned recommending the bill to not be passed, citing reasons including public misconception on the MMP voting system, population growth, and international comparability.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/067094C5-47A4-43AA-AE7F-5D7C15B55D3E/36327/DBSCH_SCR_3542_3576.pdf |title= Electoral (Reduction in Number of Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill: Report of the Justice and Electoral Committee |year= 2006 |accessdate= 15 August 2012}}</ref> The bill was subsequently voted down 112 to 9 at its second reading.\n\nThe other referendum held in 1999 asked \"Should there be a reform of our Justice system placing greater emphasis on the needs of victims, providing restitution and compensation for them and imposing minimum sentences and hard labour for all serious violent offences?\". This measure passed by 91.78%. There was some debate over the phrasing of the referendum, as the question actually contains five separate questions; voters could agree with some, but not with others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/_2001/publications_2001/Massey_News/February/Feb_26/stories/referendum.html|title=Referendum Confuses Voters|year=2007|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Parental corporal punishment===\n{{main|2009 New Zealand corporal punishment referendum}}\nFollowing the submission of a petition on 22 August 2008, the Clerk of the House verified to Parliament that the threshold for a CIR had been reached.

[[ACT New Zealand]], [[Family First New Zealand]], the [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] and [[Kiwi Party]] all advocate binding referendums.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, [[Kiwi Party]] President [[Larry Baldock]] failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]] and its leader, [[Colin Craig]].\n\nBy contrast, [[GayNZ.com]] has run articles strongly critical of the CIR lobby, as well as expressing concerns that CIRs could be abused to strip vulnerable minorities of their legislative protections, as has occurred frequently with referendums against [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] and similar proposals that target [[illegal immigrants]] in that country. In some New Zealand media outlets, the [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland]] has also been cited as one current example of anti-minoritarian abuse of the 'citizens' referendum process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/31/article_8116.php |title=The case against Citizens Initiated Referenda |publisher=Gaynz.com |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"3News_131865\">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Swiss-ban-mosque-minarets-in-surprise-vote/tabid/417/articleID/131865/cat/268/Default.aspx |title=Swiss ban mosque minarets in surprise vote |date=30 November 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Joanne Black: \"Heidi Ho\": New Zealand Listener: 12.12.09: 94</ref>\n\nEven amongst conservatives, the issue has become contentious. The [[Maxim Institute]] has announced its opposition to binding citizens referendums, citing the adverse fiscal management consequences that have ensued in the state of [[California]] in a recent paper from Richard Ekins, a [[University of Auckland]] legal academic.<ref>Richard Ekins: \"A Government for the People: The Value of Representative Democracy\": http://www.maxim.org.nz/files/pdf/a_government_for_the_people.pdf</ref> Former New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] also opposes binding referendums on fiscal grounds, noting that California's contradictory tax cap and public spending referendums have made state fiscal management chaotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Binding-referenda-not-a-good-idea---Key/tabid/419/articleID/130818/Default.aspx |title=New Zealand's latest news, sport, entertainment, politics, business |publisher=3 News |date= |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> However, a key problem with that argument is that ballot initiatives only make up 2% of the Californian state budget, once Proposition 98 is removed from the equation (Proposition 98 locks in education spending which probably would have been spent anyways and had always occupied about one-third of the Californian budget).<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=476443</ref>\n\nDuring 2009, there was additional criticism from prominent New Zealand legal academics, such as Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton at [[Otago University]]. They argue that CIRs are no substitute for more deliberative processes within the existing framework of [[representative democracy]], such as joining political parties, protest marches, voting within general elections and parliamentary select committee submissions.<ref>Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton: \"Citizens Initiated Referenda\" New Zealand Law Journal (October 2009): 334-6</ref>\n\n===Table
