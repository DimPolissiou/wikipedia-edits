His first guitar was his mother's, a [[Yamaha]] classical guitar bought with money from his father's bar tips, which he started to play at age \"11 or 12.\"<ref name=\"pg3\" />\n\nThompson's family moved around, first with his father, and then his stepfather, a religious man who \"pursued real estate on both coasts\"; his parents had separated twice by the time he was in first grade.<ref name=\"sp10\">Sisario, 2006. p. 10</ref> When Thompson was 12, his mother and stepfather joined an evangelical church that was tied to the  Pentecostal denomination [[General Council of the Assemblies of God in the United States of America|Assemblies of God]],<ref name=\"sp10\" /> a move that influenced many of his songs written with the Pixies, which often refer to the Bible.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 11</ref>\n\nHe discovered the music of [[Christian rock]] singer-songwriter [[Larry Norman]] at 13 when Norman played at a religious [[summer camp]] that Thompson attended. Norman's music influenced Thompson to the extent that he named the Pixies' first [[Extended play|EP]] and a lyric in the band's song \"Levitate Me\" after one of Norman's catchphrases, \"[[Come On Pilgrim|Come on, pilgrim]]!\" Thompson later described the music he listened to during his youth:<ref name=\"pg4\" />\n\n{{quote|I used to hang out with some misfits.

As a teenager, he mostly listened to 1960s folk and religious music, including the Christian singer-songwriter [[Larry Norman]]. For playing on his junior high baseball team, he was given [[Leon Russell]]'s [[Leon Russell (album)|1970 debut album]], which he says influenced some of his vocalizing. Later in high school and in college, he discovered [[Punk rock|punk music]] ([[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]), along with bands from other genres, such as the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[The Cars]] and the obscure [[Angst (American band)|Angst]]. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, he listened to [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]]'s ''[[Zen Arcade]]'', ''[[The Spotlight Kid]]'' by [[Captain Beefheart]], and ''I'm Sick of You'', an [[Iggy Pop]] bootleg.<ref name=\"fgpg11\"/> Thompson was also greatly influenced by the [[The Beatles (album)|Beatles self-titled 1968 release]] with regards to the experimental nature of his compositions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/beatles-white-album-alt-rock-2619809240.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1 |title=Bleached: The Beatles' White Album Effect on the US Alt-rock Explosion of 1988-95 |last=Mason |first=Adam |date=November 19, 2018 |website=Pop Matters |publisher=Pop Matters |access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThompson's lyrics have also featured references to the Bible, especially in his career with the Pixies; most notably in the [[incest]]uous tale of [[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]] in \"Nimrod's Son\", the stories of [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]] and [[Bathsheba]] in \"Dead\", [[Samson]] in \"Gouge Away\" and references to the [[Tower of Babel]] in songs such as \"Build High\" and \"Old Black Dawning\".<ref name=\"bcinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2002/09/09/202154.php |title=The Blogcritics Frank Black Interview Is Here! |accessdate=2006-12-15 |author=Olsen, Eric |date=September 9, 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090715081106/http://blogcritics.org/music/article/the-blogcritics-frank-black-interview-is/ |archivedate=July 15, 2009 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> He cited [[surrealism|surrealist]] films ''[[Eraserhead]]'' and ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (as mentioned in \"In Heaven\" and \"Debaser\" respectively) as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dag.wieers.com/debaser/lyrics/Debaser.php | title=Pixies&nbsp;\u2013 Debaser | accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in the Pixies' ''Doolittle''), saying he \"didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels\", but found it easier to watch 20-minute films.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 29</ref>\n\n===Songwriting and lyrics===\nDuring his stay in Puerto Rico, Thompson acquired a fairly fluent, although informal and at times incorrect, use of Spanish, which he has continued throughout his career. Several early Pixies songs, including \"Isla de Encanta\" and \"Vamos\", reference his experiences in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and the lyrics are often heavily seasoned with the island's slang. The island's influence in his work is most notable in the song \"Isla De Encanta\", named after the island's [[motto]], \"Isla Del Encanto\". Other Pixies songs drawn from his experiences there include \"Vamos\" (''[[Come On Pilgrim]]''), \"Oh My Golly!\", \"[[Where Is My Mind?]]\" (''[[Surfer Rosa]]''), \"[[Crackity Jones]]\" (''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'') and the B-side \"Bailey's Walk\".

Lyrics. \"[http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=70947 Evil Hearted You (Corazon De Diablo)]\".</ref> From his later works with the Pixies onwards, his use of Spanish drifted westward, reflecting places and aspects of the state of California and its culture.<ref name=\"freew\" />\n\nThompson's lyrics are noted for their obscure references to off-beat topics such as [[outer space]], [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s, and [[The Three Stooges]]\u2014the last of these being the subject of \"Two Reelers\", a song from ''Teenager of the Year''.<ref name=\"pg188\" /> Lyrics with a focus on science fiction were particularly prominent on the later Pixies records, as well as his early solo albums.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.25.96/frank-black-9617.html | title=Metroactive Music > Frank Black | accessdate=2006-12-15 | author=Baxter, Nicky | date=April 25, 1996}}</ref> With the Catholics, his lyrics have tended towards historical topics; for example, the song \"St. Francis Dam Disaster\" (from ''Dog in the Sand'') details the catastrophic collapse of the [[St. Francis Dam]] near Los Angeles in March 1928,<ref name=\"bcinterview\" /> and the ''All My Ghosts'' [[Extended play|EP]] featured an account of the [[1860 Wiyot Massacre|Humboldt County Massacre]] of [[Wiyot people|Wiyot]] Indians in 1860 near [[Eureka, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frankblack.net/songs/db.asp?mode=release-song-details&releaseID=749&songID=136 |title=FrankBlack.Net Discopedia&nbsp;\u2013 Humboldt County Massacre |accessdate=2007-01-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208205314/http://www.frankblack.net/songs/db.asp?mode=release-song-details&releaseID=749&songID=136 |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n==Television appearances and videos==\n{{see also|Pixies (band)#Television appearances and videos|l1=Pixies' television appearances and videos}}\n\nThompson has appeared on a range of television shows solo and as part of the Pixies, ranging from ''[[120 Minutes]]'' and ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/late-show-with-david-letterman/show-2286/episode/384246/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;65 | title=Late Show with David Letterman: Show #2286 | accessdate=2007-04-25 | publisher=TV.com}}</ref> to ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]'' in the UK.<ref name=\"pixiesvideos\">{{cite web | url=http://www.broszkowski.com/tv/pixies/pixiesvideodownload.html | title=Download Obscure Pixies TV appearances | accessdate=2006-11-06 | author=Broszkowski, Matthew | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104121014/http://broszkowski.com/tv/pixies/pixiesvideodownload.html | archivedate=November 4, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Pixies, he was reluctant to film music videos for singles.

Norman's music influenced Thompson to the extent that he named the Pixies' first [[Extended play|EP]] and a lyric in the band's song \"Levitate Me\" after one of Norman's catchphrases, \"[[Come On Pilgrim|Come on, pilgrim]]!\" Thompson later described the music he listened to during his youth:<ref name=\"pg4\" />\n\n{{quote|I used to hang out with some misfits.

For playing on his junior high baseball team, he was given [[Leon Russell]]'s [[Leon Russell (album)|1970 debut album]], which he says influenced some of his vocalizing. Later in high school and in college, he discovered [[Punk rock|punk music]] ([[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]), along with bands from other genres, such as the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[The Cars]] and the obscure [[Angst (American band)|Angst]]. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, he listened to [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]]'s ''[[Zen Arcade]]'', ''[[The Spotlight Kid]]'' by [[Captain Beefheart]], and ''I'm Sick of You'', an [[Iggy Pop]] bootleg.<ref name=\"fgpg11\"/> Thompson was also greatly influenced by the [[The Beatles (album)|Beatles self-titled 1968 release]] with regards to the experimental nature of his compositions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/beatles-white-album-alt-rock-2619809240.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1 |title=Bleached: The Beatles' White Album Effect on the US Alt-rock Explosion of 1988-95 |last=Mason |first=Adam |date=November 19, 2018 |website=Pop Matters |publisher=Pop Matters |access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThompson's lyrics have also featured references to the Bible, especially in his career with the Pixies; most notably in the [[incest]]uous tale of [[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]] in \"Nimrod's Son\", the stories of [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]] and [[Bathsheba]] in \"Dead\", [[Samson]] in \"Gouge Away\" and references to the [[Tower of Babel]] in songs such as \"Build High\" and \"Old Black Dawning\".<ref name=\"bcinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2002/09/09/202154.php |title=The Blogcritics Frank Black Interview Is Here! |accessdate=2006-12-15 |author=Olsen, Eric |date=September 9, 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090715081106/http://blogcritics.org/music/article/the-blogcritics-frank-black-interview-is/ |archivedate=July 15, 2009 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> He cited [[surrealism|surrealist]] films ''[[Eraserhead]]'' and ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (as mentioned in \"In Heaven\" and \"Debaser\" respectively) as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dag.wieers.com/debaser/lyrics/Debaser.php | title=Pixies&nbsp;\u2013 Debaser | accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in the Pixies' ''Doolittle''), saying he \"didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels\", but found it easier to watch 20-minute films.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 29</ref>\n\n===Songwriting and lyrics===\nDuring his stay in Puerto Rico, Thompson acquired a fairly fluent, although informal and at times incorrect, use of Spanish, which he has continued throughout his career. Several early Pixies songs, including \"Isla de Encanta\" and \"Vamos\", reference his experiences in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and the lyrics are often heavily seasoned with the island's slang. The island's influence in his work is most notable in the song \"Isla De Encanta\", named after the island's [[motto]], \"Isla Del Encanto\".

Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]] and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore.

'''Metal Planet Music''' voiced that \"the first thing that strikes you is the music, great hard rock with melody and class, but it\u2019s the heart and emotion that will stay with you long after the last note rings out. Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]] and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=[[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]]  Background=\nFollowing the initial announcement of the album's release in July 2012, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' revealed that the project originated with a band, named [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]], which Harris had been mentoring in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |title=Maiden's Harris announces solo album |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=18 July 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119104531/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 }}</ref> Harris confirmed this during an interview with ''Classic Rock'' the following month, explaining that he became involved after \"Graham Leslie [guitar] came to me with a cassette of songs... and I thought they were really good, so I said I\u2019d try to help his band do something. I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]] \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial. There's all kinds of stuff going on, with nods to [[the Who]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting.\"<ref

Hunter has died mysteriously while in Witness [[Police custody in the United Kingdom|custody]] following her [[interrogation]], a process where Hunter's memories were forcibly extracted.

In one narrative/memory thread, Neith sees the life of [[Greek]] [[investment banker]] Constantine Kyriakos in the early 21st century where he has a fateful encounter with a [[great white shark]]. In another, Neith sees the [[5th century]] [[Alchemy|alchemist]] lover of [[Augustine of Hippo]], Athenais Karthagonensis, as she endeavors to uncover the secrets of a chamber that could lead to the fabled [[Alcahest]] following the death of her son. In yet another, Neith sees [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] painter Berihun Bekele, who lives in [[London]] in the early 21st century and assists his granddaughter Annie with the development of a [[video game]], ''Witnessed,'' that bears striking resemblance to Neith's actual world.\n\n==Reception==\nIn [[The Independent|''The Independent'']], Darragh McManus gave a negative review,<ref>{{cite web |last1=McManus |first1=Darragh |title=Baffling utopian epic ladled with elegant nonsense |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/book-reviews/baffling-utopian-epic-ladled-with-elegant-nonsense-36305841.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> calling the book a \"baffling utopian epic ladled with elegant nonsense.\" While praising Harkaway for \"writing women extremely well\" (\"Hunter, Neith and Athenais are the book's most vivid creations and strongest elements\"), and saying \"there are a lot of things to enjoy in ''Gnomon'',\" she nevertheless felt it was \"hugely confusing.\"\n\n<blockquote>It's not the length, though the novel is much too long.

They refused to pay tribute to the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]]s and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s so they were marked as rebel land (Bandi Mulk). Due to their strategic position between [[Surat]] and [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], Marathas made peace with them. In 1818, they attacked a British police party passing through their state. The British retaliated and captured the chief Malhar Rao and hanged him in 1819.

The descendants of Malharrao were allowed the share in revenues of the state in 1846 and were granted an allowance grant in 1877. The chief of the state had powers to elect a Representative Member of the Chambers of Princes from 1921 to 1947. In March 1948, the last chief Dhairyashil Rao signed the Gujarat States Merger Agreement and ceded the state to Union of India.\n\nLater Dhairyashil Rao also served as the Member of the [[Rajya Sabha]] in 1952\u20131968 and 1972\u20131978.\n\nThe Princely State was bordered on the south by Peinth in Nasik, and in the west by the [[Bansda State|Bansda]] and [[Dharampur State]]s.\n\n===Rulers===\nThe rulers of the state bore the title '[[Deshmukh]]'.

Wednesdays and Saturdays, however, are half-days, with athletic games or practices in the afternoons. The school has four grades, known at St. Paul's as \"forms\". For example, \"Third Form\" corresponds to ninth grade, up through \"Sixth Form\", which corresponds to twelfth grade.\n\nFor Paulies, as St. Paul's students are colloquially known, the four full days each week begin with Chapel. The mandatory [[interfaith]] half-hour meeting involves a reading, speech or music presentation, and community-wide announcements.\n\nSt. Paul's conducts its Humanities classes using the [[Harkness table|Harkness method]], which encourages discussion between students and the teacher, and between students.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Harkness Table: Schools |url=http://www.theharknesstable.com/p/schools.html |accessdate=26 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510091829/http://www.theharknesstable.com/p/schools.html |archivedate=10 May 2014 }}</ref> The average class size according to the school's website is 10\u201312 students.\n\nRather than having physical education classes, St. Paul's requires all its students to play sports. These sports range from the internationally competing crew team to intramural hockey.\n\nThroughout the Fall, Winter and Spring Terms, students attend twelve seated meals, at which formal attire is required. Seven students and a faculty member are randomly assigned to each table for a family-style dinner, and the table is excused only after everyone has eaten. In the winter, students have dinner with their advisers and advisee groups (a group of 5-6 students are assigned a faculty member to be their adviser), either at the adviser's home or at the Upper Dining Hall. The school supplies money for one meal in town.\n\nIn the evenings, meetings are held for clubs and activities, music ensembles like the Chorus and Band, theater rehearsals, [[a capella]] groups (the all-male Testostertones, the all-female Mad Hatters, and the co-ed Deli Line), the Debate Team, and other extra-curriculars.\n\n==Socialization==\nAccording to [[Shamus Khan]], author of ''Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School'' (2010) and a [[sociology|sociologist]] who is a St. Paul's alumnus, students are [[socialization|socialized]] to function as privileged holders of power and status in an open society. Privilege in [[meritocracy]] is acquired through talent, hard work, and a wide variety of cultural and social experiences.<ref name = Khan/>{{rp|15,16}} [[Economic inequality]] and [[social inequality]] are explained by the lack of talent, hard work, and limited cultural and social experience of the less privileged.{{Outdated inline|date=October 2018}} Thus high status is earned, not based on entitlement.<ref name = Khanhoipoloi >Page 16, ''Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School'', [[Shamus Khan]]. \"From this perspective, inequality is explained not by the practices of the elite but instead by the character of the disadvantaged.\"</ref> According to Khan, \"Today what is distinct among the elite is not their exclusivity but their ease within and broad acceptance of a more open world.\"<ref name = KhanOpen >\"Today what is distinct among the elite is not their exclusivity but their ease within and broad acceptance of a more open world.\" Khan, Shamus Rahman (2010-12-28).

There is a school prayer:<poem>\"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life, we may never forget to be kind.\nHelp us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others.\nThrough Jesus Christ our Savior, Amen.\"<ref name = Khan/>{{rp|75}}<ref name = SPSPrayer >[https://www.sps.edu/ftpimages/36/download/download_group4028_id133462.pdf The School Prayer] PDF file from the website of the school, accessed August 22, 2015</ref></poem>\n\n===Traditions===\n[[File:Alumni Parade.JPG|left|thumbnail|x228px|The 2005 Alumni Parade (see below) from all the way in the back.]]\nSt. Paul's is home to many long-standing traditions. Near the start of the school year, the Rector announces a surprise holiday&nbsp;\u2014 Cricket Holiday&nbsp;\u2014 in morning Chapel. Classes are canceled for the day and the Rector leads new students and faculty on a tour of the woods surrounding the School. Tuesdays are generally preferred for the holiday by the Rector as students who leave the grounds are forced to return by the start time of Seated Meal or Advisee Dinner. The tradition dates back to the first Rector, Henry Augustus Coit, who preferred [[cricket]] over [[baseball]] as a \"more refined sport\".\n\nDuring February, the Missionary Society (the school's community service organization) plans and announces Mish Holiday. The holiday is announced the day before, the evening is given over to a theme dance, and the next day is a day off from school. The Missionary Society has used extravagant stunts to announce the holiday, including, in the past, fireworks over the Lower School Pond and a plane trailing a \"Happy Mish!\" banner.\n\nStudents at St. Paul's are assigned to one of three \"clubs\" for their time at St. Paul's&nbsp;\u2014 \"Isthmian,\" \"Delphian\" or \"Old Hundred\". Those who participate in \"club sports\" (intramural) play for their club. Students who participate in crew are also assigned to one of two \"Boat Clubs\"&nbsp;\u2014 \"Halcyon\" or \"Shattuck\". Descendants of graduates are assigned to the same clubs as their relatives.\n\nThe annual Inter-House Inter-Club Race, known among students as the \"Dorm Run\" but now officially named the \"Charles B. Morgan Run\", takes place late in Fall Term, usually in early to mid-November. Students are invited to earn points for their dorm and club by running in a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} cross country race. The current student record is 9:48, set in 2006 by Peter Harrison '07.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sps.edu/common/news_detail.asp?newsid=412066&L4=2&tabs=athletics |title=''SPS Today'': 'School Pride Shows in Annual Club/House Race', 15 Nov 2007 |publisher= |accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring a weekend in the Fall Term, the Student Council holds Fall Ball, a dinner/dance known among students as the Cocktails. On the same night, there is a talent show that focuses on fifth formers (eleventh graders). Fifth former MCs are selected by their form representatives to host the show.\n\nDuring the Winter Term, the school holds the annual Fiske Cup Competition. Each participating dorm produces a student-directed and performed play. Most plays are held in dorm common rooms.\n\nIn the Spring Term, St. Paul's holds a school-wide public speaking contest called the Hugh Camp Cup. The finalists' speeches are delivered before the entire school, and the student body votes on a winner, whose name is engraved on the prize. Alumnus [[John Kerry]] achieved this distinction during his sixth form year.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/us/prep-school-peers-found-kerry-talented-ambitious-and-apart.html|title=Prep School Peers Found Kerry Talented, Ambitious and Apart|first=Todd S.|last=Purdum|date=16 May 2004|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn the last night of the term, students gather in the Chapel at 9 p.m. for the Last Night service. At the Last Night service for Spring Term, the last night of school before summer vacation, the faculty lines up outside the Chapel after the service and students shake hands with every member as they exit. On the Sixth Formers' last night on campus, they gather as a class in the Old Chapel. At the conclusion of the service, the rest of the student body waits outside to congratulate them and say their goodbyes.\n\nDuring Anniversary Weekend, held on the first weekend of June, alumni converge on the school for get-togethers, reunions, and the annual Alumni Parade. Each form (class) marches down Chapel Road in chronological order, starting with the oldest living alumni. In the back of this long column is the about-to-graduate Sixth Form.\n\nSt. Paul's students once had a close relationship with [[jam band]]s like the [[Grateful Dead]]. Some of the slang peculiar to St. Paul's originated as the \"Pyramid Dialect\" among St. Paul's students and alumni who followed the [[Grateful Dead]]'s 1978 shows in Egypt.<ref>Shenk, D. and Silberman, S.

Wednesdays and Saturdays, however, are half-days, with athletic games or practices in the afternoons. The school has four grades, known at St. Paul's as \"forms\". For example, \"Third Form\" corresponds to ninth grade, up through \"Sixth Form\", which corresponds to twelfth grade.\n\nFor Paulies, as St. Paul's students are colloquially known, the four full days each week begin with Chapel. The mandatory [[interfaith]] half-hour meeting involves a reading, speech or music presentation, and community-wide announcements.\n\nSt. Paul's conducts its Humanities classes using the [[Harkness table|Harkness method]], which encourages discussion between students and the teacher, and between students.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Harkness Table: Schools |url=http://www.theharknesstable.com/p/schools.html |accessdate=26 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510091829/http://www.theharknesstable.com/p/schools.html |archivedate=10 May 2014 }}</ref> The average class size according to the school's website is 10\u201312 students.\n\nRather than having physical education classes, St. Paul's requires all its students to play sports. These sports range from the internationally competing crew team to intramural hockey.\n\nThroughout the Fall, Winter and Spring Terms, students attend twelve seated meals, at which formal attire is required. Seven students and a faculty member are randomly assigned to each table for a family-style dinner, and the table is excused only after everyone has eaten. In the winter, students have dinner with their advisers and advisee groups (a group of 5-6 students are assigned a faculty member to be their adviser), either at the adviser's home or at the Upper Dining Hall. The school supplies money for one meal in town.\n\nIn the evenings, meetings are held for clubs and activities, music ensembles like the Chorus and Band, theater rehearsals, [[a capella]] groups (the all-male Testostertones, the all-female Mad Hatters, and the co-ed Deli Line), the Debate Team, and other extra-curriculars.\n\n==Socialization==\nAccording to [[Shamus Khan]], author of ''Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School'' (2010) and a [[sociology|sociologist]] who is a St. Paul's alumnus, students are [[socialization|socialized]] to function as privileged holders of power and status in an open society. Privilege in [[meritocracy]] is acquired through talent, hard work, and a wide variety of cultural and social experiences.<ref name = Khan/>{{rp|15,16}} [[Economic inequality]] and [[social inequality]] are explained by the lack of talent, hard work, and limited cultural and social experience of the less privileged.{{Outdated inline|date=October 2018}} Thus high status is earned, not based on entitlement.<ref name = Khanhoipoloi >Page 16, ''Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School'', [[Shamus Khan]]. \"From this perspective, inequality is explained not by the practices of the elite but instead by the character of the disadvantaged.\"</ref> According to Khan, \"Today what is distinct among the elite is not their exclusivity but their ease within and broad acceptance of a more open world.\"<ref name = KhanOpen >\"Today what is distinct among the elite is not their exclusivity but their ease within and broad acceptance of a more open world.\" Khan, Shamus Rahman (2010-12-28).

There is a school prayer:<poem>\"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life, we may never forget to be kind.\nHelp us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others.\nThrough Jesus Christ our Savior, Amen.\"<ref name = Khan/>{{rp|75}}<ref name = SPSPrayer >[https://www.sps.edu/ftpimages/36/download/download_group4028_id133462.pdf The School Prayer] PDF file from the website of the school, accessed August 22, 2015</ref></poem>\n\n===Traditions===\n[[File:Alumni Parade.JPG|left|thumbnail|x228px|The 2005 Alumni Parade (see below) from all the way in the back.]]\nSt. Paul's is home to many long-standing traditions. Near the start of the school year, the Rector announces a surprise holiday&nbsp;\u2014 Cricket Holiday&nbsp;\u2014 in morning Chapel. Classes are canceled for the day and the Rector leads new students and faculty on a tour of the woods surrounding the School. Tuesdays are generally preferred for the holiday by the Rector as students who leave the grounds are forced to return by the start time of Seated Meal or Advisee Dinner. The tradition dates back to the first Rector, Henry Augustus Coit, who preferred [[cricket]] over [[baseball]] as a \"more refined sport\".\n\nDuring February, the Missionary Society (the school's community service organization) plans and announces Mish Holiday. The holiday is announced the day before, the evening is given over to a theme dance, and the next day is a day off from school. The Missionary Society has used extravagant stunts to announce the holiday, including, in the past, fireworks over the Lower School Pond and a plane trailing a \"Happy Mish!\" banner.\n\nStudents at St. Paul's are assigned to one of three \"clubs\" for their time at St. Paul's&nbsp;\u2014 \"Isthmian,\" \"Delphian\" or \"Old Hundred\". Those who participate in \"club sports\" (intramural) play for their club. Students who participate in crew are also assigned to one of two \"Boat Clubs\"&nbsp;\u2014 \"Halcyon\" or \"Shattuck\". Descendants of graduates are assigned to the same clubs as their relatives.\n\nThe annual Inter-House Inter-Club Race, known among students as the \"Dorm Run\" but now officially named the \"Charles B. Morgan Run\", takes place late in Fall Term, usually in early to mid-November. Students are invited to earn points for their dorm and club by running in a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} cross country race. The current student record is 9:48, set in 2006 by Peter Harrison '07.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sps.edu/common/news_detail.asp?newsid=412066&L4=2&tabs=athletics |title=''SPS Today'': 'School Pride Shows in Annual Club/House Race', 15 Nov 2007 |publisher= |accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring a weekend in the Fall Term, the Student Council holds Fall Ball, a dinner/dance known among students as the Cocktails. On the same night, there is a talent show that focuses on fifth formers (eleventh graders). Fifth former MCs are selected by their form representatives to host the show.\n\nDuring the Winter Term, the school holds the annual Fiske Cup Competition. Each participating dorm produces a student-directed and performed play. Most plays are held in dorm common rooms.\n\nIn the Spring Term, St. Paul's holds a school-wide public speaking contest called the Hugh Camp Cup. The finalists' speeches are delivered before the entire school, and the student body votes on a winner, whose name is engraved on the prize. Alumnus [[John Kerry]] achieved this distinction during his sixth form year.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/16/us/prep-school-peers-found-kerry-talented-ambitious-and-apart.html|title=Prep School Peers Found Kerry Talented, Ambitious and Apart|first=Todd S.|last=Purdum|date=16 May 2004|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn the last night of the term, students gather in the Chapel at 9 p.m. for the Last Night service. At the Last Night service for Spring Term, the last night of school before summer vacation, the faculty lines up outside the Chapel after the service and students shake hands with every member as they exit. On the Sixth Formers' last night on campus, they gather as a class in the Old Chapel. At the conclusion of the service, the rest of the student body waits outside to congratulate them and say their goodbyes.\n\nDuring Anniversary Weekend, held on the first weekend of June, alumni converge on the school for get-togethers, reunions, and the annual Alumni Parade. Each form (class) marches down Chapel Road in chronological order, starting with the oldest living alumni. In the back of this long column is the about-to-graduate Sixth Form.\n\nSt. Paul's students once had a close relationship with [[jam band]]s like the [[Grateful Dead]]. Some of the slang peculiar to St. Paul's originated as the \"Pyramid Dialect\" among St. Paul's students and alumni who followed the [[Grateful Dead]]'s 1978 shows in Egypt.<ref>Shenk, D. and Silberman, S.

In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are logical constructions that do not have to be factual.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was not factual, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology. The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper says that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.  He is aware that we have a lot of problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be factual. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He says that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Yet another example is \"this angel has large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are logical constructions that do not have to be factual.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was not factual, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology. The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper is aware that we have a lot of problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. He says that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.  The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be factual. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He says that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Yet another example is \"this angel has large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].
