The anthem was composed by Bonifacio J. Linay, a native of Cavinti.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\nCavinti is situated on the eastern side of the province of Laguna. The town is bounded by the municipality of [[Lumban, Laguna|Lumban]] in the north, by the municipalities of [[Sampaloc, Quezon]] and [[Mauban, Quezon]]  in the east, [[Pagsanjan]] in the west, and by [[Luisiana, Laguna|Luisiana]] in the south. It has 19 barangays.\n\n===Climate===\nLike most areas in the province of Laguna, the Climate of Cavinti is characterized by two pronounced seasons: dry from March to May and wet during the rest of the year.\n* High temperature : {{convert|27|C}}\n* Low temperature : {{convert|21|C}}\n\n==Barangays==\n\nCavinti is politically subdivided into 2 urban and 17 rural [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{{Div col}}\n* Anglas\n* Bangco\n* Bukal\n* Bulajo\n* Cansuso\n* Duhat (urban)\n* Inao-Awan\n* Kanluran Talaongan\n* Labayo\n* Layasin\n* Layug\n* Lumot/Mahipon\n* Paowin\n* [[Poblacion]] (urban)\n* Sisilmin\n* Silangan Talaongan\n* Sumucab\n* Tibatib\n* Udia\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Poblacion===\nIt is the center of commercial and business activities in Cavinti. Almost all of the basic municipal facilities are located in Poblacion including the Municipal Hall, Town Plaza, ABC Multi-Purpose Hall, the Public Market, and many commercial and business establishments. The Catholic Church (Transfiguration Parish) and [[Philippine Independent Church|Aglipayan Church]] are also located in Poblacion.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Town of Cavinti was originally a part of Lumban, Laguna. It was only in 1619 when the town gained complete and independent status as a parish by virtue of a [[papal bull]] believed to have come directly from Rome. In fact, this was why, again according to the legends, the two Puhawan brothers of Lumban, in search of food in early 1600, reached Cavinti where they found an image which turned out to be that of El Salvador. They brought the image to their home in Lumban. But in no time, it got lost only to be found again the very same place where it was first discovered. Today on that hallowed grounds stands majestically the centuries-old Catholic Church in honor of El Salvador built by the town's forebears for all the generations to enjoy and cherish.\n\nThe church's early structures were made of light materials. For many times they had to rebuild it on account of destruction wrought by natural calamities such as earthquakes, typhoons, and fires.\n\nThe ecclesiastical supervision of the church also belonged to Lumban since its founding. Even at the time of the construction of the first stone church in 1621.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}.

The population is very low and no significant development was recorded since during that time development was focused on Municipality of Lumban. The town of Cavinti serves that time as a hunting ground for hunters.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}. Cavinti.gov.ph. Retrieved on 01-12-17.</ref>\n\n===The American Period===\n\nCavinti became one of the municipalities with high [[insurgency]] due to the construction of hydropower dam where several lands were submerged.\n\nTwo connected man-made lakes (Lake Lumot and Lake Caliraya) were built by American engineers in 1943 to supply water to the Caliraya Hydroelectric Plant. As the dams were constructed, entrepreneurs with foresight created two adjacent communities which were envisioned to be ecological communities, where one can enjoy the beauty and richness of unspoiled nature. The results were man-made mountain lakes complete with coves and sandbars - Lake Caliraya and Lake Lumot. The Americans also seeded the lake with Largemouth Black Bass imported from the US, which continues to proliferate and provide game fishers with year-round weekend excitement.\nIn fact, the two lakes are some of the places in the whole country where Philippine anglers can attempt to catch the famed Largemouth Black Bass, one of the top freshwater gamefish of the United States of America.\nDuring this regime, no further economic and infrastructure projects were implemented in the town of Cavinti.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}.

Shortage of food, limited infrastructure, limited medical services and limited educational services were rampant in the whole country.  The Philippines was run by a \u2018puppet\u2019 government as it was being governed by the watchful eyes of the Japanese Imperial Army.\n\nDuring this regime, insurgency becomes rampant and no further economic and infrastructure was implemented in the town of Cavinti.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}.

However, due to the effect of war, there was an extensive problem in infrastructure specifically roads, bridges and the construction of schools alongside with the problem in pestilence and starvation. Thus, there was no further development for the town of Cavinti right until the 1960s, when ground was broken on the Lake Caliraya shoreline for the building of the resort communities which began a period of economic rebirth, despite occasional threats of insurgency by the New People's Army.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}.

Almost all of the basic municipal facilities are located in Poblacion including the Municipal Hall, Town Plaza, ABC Multi-Purpose Hall, the Public Market, and many commercial and business establishments. The Catholic Church (Transfiguration Parish) and [[Philippine Independent Church|Aglipayan Church]] are also located in Poblacion.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Town of Cavinti was originally a part of Lumban, Laguna. It was only in 1619 when the town gained complete and independent status as a parish by virtue of a [[papal bull]] believed to have come directly from Rome. In fact, this was why, again according to the legends, the two Puhawan brothers of Lumban, in search of food in early 1600, reached Cavinti where they found an image which turned out to be that of El Salvador. They brought the image to their home in Lumban. But in no time, it got lost only to be found again the very same place where it was first discovered. Today on that hallowed grounds stands majestically the centuries-old Catholic Church in honor of El Salvador built by the town's forebears for all the generations to enjoy and cherish.\n\nThe church's early structures were made of light materials. For many times they had to rebuild it on account of destruction wrought by natural calamities such as earthquakes, typhoons, and fires.\n\nThe ecclesiastical supervision of the church also belonged to Lumban since its founding. Even at the time of the construction of the first stone church in 1621.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}.

The population is very low and no significant development was recorded since during that time development was focused on Municipality of Lumban. The town of Cavinti serves that time as a hunting ground for hunters.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}. Cavinti.gov.ph.

As the dams were constructed, entrepreneurs with foresight created two adjacent communities which were envisioned to be ecological communities, where one can enjoy the beauty and richness of unspoiled nature. The results were man-made mountain lakes complete with coves and sandbars - Lake Caliraya and Lake Lumot. The Americans also seeded the lake with Largemouth Black Bass imported from the US, which continues to proliferate and provide game fishers with year-round weekend excitement.\nIn fact, the two lakes are some of the places in the whole country where Philippine anglers can attempt to catch the famed Largemouth Black Bass, one of the top freshwater gamefish of the United States of America.\nDuring this regime, no further economic and infrastructure projects were implemented in the town of Cavinti.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}.

The Philippines was run by a \u2018puppet\u2019 government as it was being governed by the watchful eyes of the Japanese Imperial Army.\n\nDuring this regime, insurgency becomes rampant and no further economic and infrastructure was implemented in the town of Cavinti.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}.

However, due to the effect of war, there was an extensive problem in infrastructure specifically roads, bridges and the construction of schools alongside with the problem in pestilence and starvation. Thus, there was no further development for the town of Cavinti right until the 1960s, when ground was broken on the Lake Caliraya shoreline for the building of the resort communities which began a period of economic rebirth, despite occasional threats of insurgency by the New People's Army.<ref>[http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029000604/http://www.cavinti.gov.ph/index.php/about-cavinti/history |date=2017-10-29 }}.

He was Social Chairman of St. Anthony Hall, Aurelian Honor Society and completed his Anthropology honors thesis, \u201cSteersman and the Stars: A Cybernetic Analysis of Myth.\u201d\n\n==Graduate school and early career==\n\nClippinger received a fellowship to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School]], where he studied cybernetics and information theory, completing his master\u2019s thesis on a computer simulation and statistical analysis of adaptation strategies for \u201cself-organizing symbolic system\u201d. While in graduate school in Philadelphia, he worked with the Black Panther Breakfast program and Hispanic Young Lords and North Philadelphia gangs to mitigate youth violence. He entered the University of Pennsylvania doctoral program to study content analysis, computational linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. While in graduate school he worked as a Research Associate at the [[Brandeis University#The Heller School|Brandeis University Florence Heller School]], where he applied cybernetics, systems theory and simulation models to the design and delivery of integrated and accountable human services. From 1972- 1975, he undertook his thesis research at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab working with Terry Winograd, and with the support of Stephen Kosslyn, he published it as a book, Meaning and Discourse: A Computational Model of Psychoanalytic Cognition and Discourse, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Henry Clippinger Jr|title=Meaning and discourse: a computer model of psychoanalytic speech and cognition|year=1977|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801819431|url=https://archive.org/details/meaningdiscourse0000clip}}</ref> It was the first computer model of distributed, multi-agent cognition and discourse composition derived from the transcribed discourse. In 1976\u20131979, Clippinger became a Research Fellow at Harvard\u2019s Information Resources Policy Program working with Professor Anthony Oettinger, where he conducted research on cross border data flow, telecommunications and development and information privacy. In 1978-80, he became an Expert Advisor for the formation of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and Art Bushnell helped formulate some of the United States' first information policy.\n\nIn 1980 Clippinger founded one of the first artificial NLP (natural language processing) software companies, Brattle Research Corp. The company was an early innovator in natural language processing, content categorization, object-oriented databases, financial trading compliance and oversight, [[Libor|LIBOR]] interest rate swaps, and \u201cinformation refining\u201d strategies. The company was funded by competing LISP machine vendors, Texas Instruments and Symbolics, and partnered with Dow Jones online services to prototype a bitmap graphic, semantically indexed and linked version of the Wall Street Journal. When the company was sold, Clippinger joined for seven years Coopers & Lybrand, where he became Director, Intellectual Capital and developed one of the first fully automated semantic classification intranet services, called CLIPS (Coopers & Lybrand Intellectual Property Service). Clippinger founded three other companies (Context Media, Lexeme/LingoMotors/ EcoCap/Azigo) and he then consulted on networked organizations to the [[Command and Control Research Program]] (CCRP) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks, Information and Integration) before becoming a Senior Fellow at the Harvard Law School Berkman Center for Internet and Society. During this time, he was also active as an Aspen Institute Fellow and member of the Santa Fe Business Network. At the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, he founded the Social Physics project and co-founded Project Higgins {{cite web|url=http://www.socialphysics.org | title=the Social Physics project and co-founded Project Higgins | last=Clippinger | first=John | website=Waybackmachine| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413031832/http://www.socialphysics.org | archive-date=2019-04-13 }} for user control over personal data and the Law Lab with a grant from the Kauffman Foundation.\n\nHe is co-founder and executive director of ID3 (Institute for Innovation & Data Driven Design), a 501 C(3) non-profit organization formed to develop and field test legal and software trust frameworks for distributed, self-signing digital assets, currencies, and data-driven services, infrastructures, and enterprises.

His name is cited in the inscriptions of [[Shapur I]] (as well as in the ''[[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht|Res Gestae Divi Saporis]]'') and the [[Paikuli inscription]] of [[Narseh]]. Kartir also had inscriptions of his own made in the present-day [[Fars Province]] (then known as [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Pars]]). His inscriptions narrates his rise to power throughout the reigns of Shapur I ({{reign|240|270}}), [[Hormizd I]] ({{reign|270|271}}), [[Bahram I]] ({{reign|271|274}}), and [[Bahram II]] ({{reign|274|293}}). During the brief reign of Bahram II's son and successor [[Bahram III]], Kartir was amongst the nobles who supported the rebellion of Narseh, who overthrew Bahram III and ascended the throne. During Narseh's reign, Kartir fades into obscurity, due not doing anything noteworthy as high priest.\n\n== Name ==\nKartir's name is spelled in several ways in the engravings; Middle Persian <kltyl, kltyly, krtyr, kltyr>, [[Parthian language|Parthian]] <krtyr>, [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Karteir'', and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Kardel''. The name was also used in the northeastern Iranian world, being spelt <krt'yr> in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and as ''Kirdira'' in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]].{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}}\n\n== Biography ==\n===Under Shapur I and Hormizd I===\n[[Image:Gold coin of Shapur I, Ctesiphon mint.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Shapur I]].]]\nKartir may have been a [[eunuch]], due to being depicted without a beard in the Sasanian reliefs.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} He first appears in historical records in [[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], which was most likely created between 260\u2013262. Kartir is the only religious bureaucrat mentioned in the inscription.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Shapur I, a \"lukewarm Zoroastrian\",{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} was known for his tolerance towards other religions. Although admiring the teachings of his own religion and encouraging the [[Zoroastrian]] clergy, Shapur I let the [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] to freely practice their religion.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} He was also friendly towards the founder of [[Manichaeism]], [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], whom he allowed to preach freely and even to be an escort in his military expeditions.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} \n[[Image:Rare coin of Hormizd I.jpg|left|thumb|Coin of [[Hormizd I]].]]\nShapur I religious practices seems to have been somewhat unusual, with animal sacrifice being made for the soul of the kings and queens of the Sasanian family.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=9}}{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} This presumably seemed \"pagan\" to Zoroastrian priests. {{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=9}} Kartir, who \"abhorred animal sacrifice\" was unable to stop Shapur I from doing them.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Shapur I died in 270, and was succeeded by [[Hormizd I]], who gave Kartir clothes that were worn by the upper class, the cap and belt (''kul\u0101f ud kamarband'') and appointed him as the chief priest (''[[mobad|mowbed]]'').{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=76}}\n\nHormizd I died the following year; Bahram I, who was never considered a candidate for succession of the throne by his father, ascended the throne with the aid of Kartir, whose authority and influence had greatly increased.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}} Bahram I then made a settlement with his brother [[Narseh]] to give up his entitlement to the throne in return for the governorship of the important frontier province of [[Sasanian Armenia|Armenia]], which was constantly the subject of war between the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and Sasanian Empires.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} Narseh held the title of ''Vazurg \u0160\u0101h Armin\u0101n'' (\"Great King of Armenia\"), which was used by the heir to the throne.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}} Nevertheless, Narseh still most likely viewed Bahram I as a usurper.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}\n\n===Under Bahram I===\n[[Image:Coin of the Sasanian king Bahram I, Ctesiphon mint.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Bahram I]].]]\nThe previous Sasanian shahs had pursued a policy of religious tolerance towards the non-Zoroastrian minorities in the empire. However, with Bahram I's accession to the throne, and the rise of the authority of the Zoroastrian priesthood and the increasing influence of Kartir, this changed; when Mani reached the city of [[Gundishapur]], much uproar occurred, in the same fashion as [[Jesus]]' entry into [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=74}} Kartir, along with other Zoroastrian priests protested and made Bahram I have Mani imprisoned and sentenced to death in 274.{{sfn|Daniel|2012|p=61}}{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}\n\nMani's death was followed by the persecution of his followers by Kartir and the Zoroastrian clergy, who used the persecution of religious minorities as a method to increase and spread their vast influence.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} Mani was seen by the Zoroastrian clergy as heterogeneous philosopher and a threatening pagan who was presenting an obscure perception of Zoroastrianism, which had been tainted by non-Zoroastrian (i.e., Jewish, Buddhist, and Christian) ideas.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} With the backing of Bahram I, Kartir laid foundations to a Zoroastrian state church.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} As a result, Bahram I became applauded in Sasanian-based sources as a \"benevolent and worthy king.\"{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}} His son [[Bahram II]] succeeded him as shah; he may have been aided by Kartir to ascend the throne instead of Narseh.{{sfn|Daryaee|Rezakhani|2017|p=157}}{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} This most likely frustrated Narseh, who had now been neglected from succession several times.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}}\n\n=== Under Bahram II, Bahram III and Narseh ===\n[[Image:Silver coin of Bahram II.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Bahram II]].]]\n[[Image:NarsehCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Narseh]].]]\nBahram II, like his father, received Kartir well. He saw him as his mentor, and handed out several honors to Kartir, giving him the rank of grandee (''[[wuzurgan]]''), and appointing him as the supreme judge (''dadwar'') of the whole empire, which indicates that thenceforth priests were given the office of judge.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=76}} Kartir was also appointed the steward of the [[Anahid fire-temple]] at [[Istakhr]], which had originally been under the care of the Sasanian family.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}} The Sasanian kings thus lost much of their religious authority in the empire. The clergy from now on served as judges all over the country, with court cases most likely being based on Zoroastrian jurisprudence, with the expection of when representatives of other religions had conflicts with each other.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}}\n\nIt is thus under Bahram II that Kartir unquestionably becomes a powerful figure in the empire; the latter claimed on his inscription that he \"struck down\" the non-Zoroastrian minorities, such as the [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Jews]], [[Mandaeans]], [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} According to the modern historian Parvaneh Pourshariati: \"it is not clear, however, to what extent Kartir's declarations reflect the actual implementation, or for that matter, success, of the measures he is supposed to have promoted.\"{{sfn|Pourshariati|2018|p=348}} Indeed, Jewish and Christian sources, for example, makes no mention of persecutions during this period.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2018|p=348}}{{sfn|Payne|2015|p=24}} Before Bahram II, all the previous Sasanian shahs had been \"lukewarm Zoroastrians.\"{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} He died in 293 and was succeeded by his son [[Bahram III]].\n\nFour months into Bahram III's reign, Narseh was summoned to [[Mesopotamia]] at the request of many members of the Iranian nobility. He met them in the passage of Paikuli in the province of [[Beth Garmai|Garamig]], where he was firmly approved and likely also declared shah for the first time.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} The reasons behind the nobles favour of Narseh might have been due to his jurisdiction as governor, his image as an advocate of the [[Zoroastrian]] religion and as an insurer for harmony and prosperity of the empire.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} His ancestry from the early Sasanian family probably also played a role.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} Kartir was one of those nobles who supported Narseh, which is attested in the [[Paikuli inscription]].{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Narseh's reign marked the return to the policy of religious tolerance which had been practiced by his father.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} Kartir fades into obscurity in historical records under Narseh, due to not doing anything noteworthy as high priest.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}}\n\n== Legacy and assessment ==\nAccording to the modern historian Prods Oktor Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8, \"In both Iranist and non-Iranist literature, there has been a tendency to elaboration and hyperbole. Several scholars have taken a strict and critical view of Kartir from their modern, and so irrelevant, vantage point.\"{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Zaehner called Kartir a \"religious zealot of quite uncommon ardour\" and to \"the process of intolerance initiated and zestfully developed by Kartir\".{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Russell called him a \"a ruthless fanatic, Kartir, [who] promoted the xenophobic state cult\", while Folz refers to him as \"fanatical\".{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} More positive views of Kartir are also found in modern sources, such as Hinz, who called him a \"spiritual man yearning for a religious truth that ought to be revealed to all\", while Neusner described \"the [Sasanian] government\u2019s enthusiasm for Kartir\u2019s program\".{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Kartir's inscription at Naqsh-e Rajab]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=Some reflections on Zurvanism|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|publisher=SOAS|location=London|year=1957|volume=19|issue=2|pages=304\u2013316|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00133063 }}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=On the Zoroastrian Temple Cult of Fire|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|publisher=AOS/UMich.

His name is cited in the inscriptions of [[Shapur I]] (as well as in the ''[[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht|Res Gestae Divi Saporis]]'') and the [[Paikuli inscription]] of [[Narseh]]. Kartir also had inscriptions of his own made in the present-day [[Fars Province]] (then known as [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Pars]]). His inscriptions narrates his rise to power throughout the reigns of Shapur I ({{reign|240|270}}), [[Hormizd I]] ({{reign|270|271}}), [[Bahram I]] ({{reign|271|274}}), and [[Bahram II]] ({{reign|274|293}}). During the brief reign of Bahram II's son and successor [[Bahram III]], Kartir was amongst the nobles who supported the rebellion of Narseh, who overthrew Bahram III and ascended the throne. During Narseh's reign, Kartir fades into obscurity, due not doing anything noteworthy as high priest.\n\n== Name ==\nKartir's name is spelled in several ways in the engravings; Middle Persian <kltyl, kltyly, krtyr, kltyr>, [[Parthian language|Parthian]] <krtyr>, [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Karteir'', and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Kardel''. The name was also used in the northeastern Iranian world, being spelt <krt'yr> in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and as ''Kirdira'' in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]].{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}}\n\n== Biography ==\n===Under Shapur I and Hormizd I===\n[[Image:Gold coin of Shapur I, Ctesiphon mint.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Shapur I]].]]\nKartir may have been a [[eunuch]], due to being depicted without a beard in the Sasanian reliefs.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} He first appears in historical records in [[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]], which was most likely created between 260\u2013262. Kartir is the only religious bureaucrat mentioned in the inscription.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Shapur I, a \"lukewarm Zoroastrian\",{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} was known for his tolerance towards other religions. Although admiring the teachings of his own religion and encouraging the [[Zoroastrian]] clergy, Shapur I let the [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] to freely practice their religion.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} He was also friendly towards the founder of [[Manichaeism]], [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], whom he allowed to preach freely and even to be an escort in his military expeditions.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} \n[[Image:Rare coin of Hormizd I.jpg|left|thumb|Coin of [[Hormizd I]].]]\nShapur I religious practices seems to have been somewhat unusual, with animal sacrifice being made for the soul of the kings and queens of the Sasanian family.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=9}}{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} This presumably seemed \"pagan\" to Zoroastrian priests. {{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=9}} Kartir, who \"abhorred animal sacrifice\" was unable to stop Shapur I from doing them.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Shapur I died in 270, and was succeeded by [[Hormizd I]], who gave Kartir clothes that were worn by the upper class, the cap and belt (''kul\u0101f ud kamarband'') and appointed him as the chief priest (''[[mobad|mowbed]]'').{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=76}}\n\nHormizd I died the following year; Bahram I, who was never considered a candidate for succession of the throne by his father, ascended the throne with the aid of Kartir, whose authority and influence had greatly increased.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}} Bahram I then made a settlement with his brother [[Narseh]] to give up his entitlement to the throne in return for the governorship of the important frontier province of [[Sasanian Armenia|Armenia]], which was constantly the subject of war between the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and Sasanian Empires.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} Narseh held the title of ''Vazurg \u0160\u0101h Armin\u0101n'' (\"Great King of Armenia\"), which was used by the heir to the throne.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}} Nevertheless, Narseh still most likely viewed Bahram I as a usurper.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}\n\n===Under Bahram I===\n[[Image:Coin of the Sasanian king Bahram I, Ctesiphon mint.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Bahram I]].]]\nThe previous Sasanian shahs had pursued a policy of religious tolerance towards the non-Zoroastrian minorities in the empire. However, with Bahram I's accession to the throne, and the rise of the authority of the Zoroastrian priesthood and the increasing influence of Kartir, this changed; when Mani reached the city of [[Gundishapur]], much uproar occurred, in the same fashion as [[Jesus]]' entry into [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=74}} Kartir, along with other Zoroastrian priests protested and made Bahram I have Mani imprisoned and sentenced to death in 274.{{sfn|Daniel|2012|p=61}}{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}\n\nMani's death was followed by the persecution of his followers by Kartir and the Zoroastrian clergy, who used the persecution of religious minorities as a method to increase and spread their vast influence.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} Mani was seen by the Zoroastrian clergy as heterogeneous philosopher and a threatening pagan who was presenting an obscure perception of Zoroastrianism, which had been tainted by non-Zoroastrian (i.e., Jewish, Buddhist, and Christian) ideas.{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} With the backing of Bahram I, Kartir laid foundations to a Zoroastrian state church.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}}{{sfn|Kia|2016|p=234}} As a result, Bahram I became applauded in Sasanian-based sources as a \"benevolent and worthy king.\"{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514\u2013522}} His son [[Bahram II]] succeeded him as shah; he may have been aided by Kartir to ascended the throne instead of Narseh.{{sfn|Daryaee|Rezakhani|2017|p=157}}{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} This most likely frustrated Narseh, who had now been neglected from succession several times.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}}\n\n=== Under Bahram II, Bahram III and Narseh ===\n[[Image:Silver coin of Bahram II.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Bahram II]].]]\n[[Image:NarsehCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Narseh]].]]\nBahram II, like his father, received Kartir well. He saw him as his mentor, and handed out several honors to Kartir, giving him the rank of grandee (''[[wuzurgan]]''), and appointing him as the supreme judge (''dadwar'') of the whole empire, which indicates that thenceforth priests were given the office of judge.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=76}} Kartir was also appointed the steward of the [[Anahid fire-temple]] at [[Istakhr]], which had originally been under the care of the Sasanian family.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}}{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}} The Sasanian kings thus lost much of their religious authority in the empire. The clergy from now on served as judges all over the country, with court cases most likely being based on Zoroastrian jurisprudence, with the expection of when representatives of other religions had conflicts with each other.{{sfn|Daryaee|2014|p=11}}\n\nIt is thus under Bahram II that Kartir unquestionably becomes a powerful figure in the empire; the latter claimed on his inscription that he \"struck down\" the non-Zoroastrian minorities, such as the [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Jews]], [[Mandaeans]], [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} According to the modern historian Parvaneh Pourshariati: \"it is not clear, however, to what extent Kartir's declarations reflect the actual implementation, or for that matter, success, of the measures he is supposed to have promoted.\"{{sfn|Pourshariati|2018|p=348}} Indeed, Jewish and Christian sources, for example, makes no mention of persecutions during this period.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2018|p=348}}{{sfn|Payne|2015|p=24}} Before Bahram II, all the previous Sasanian shahs had been \"lukewarm Zoroastrians.\"{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} He died in 293 and was succeeded by his son [[Bahram III]].\n\nFour months into Bahram III's reign, Narseh was summoned to [[Mesopotamia]] at the request of many members of the Iranian nobility. He met them in the passage of Paikuli in the province of [[Beth Garmai|Garamig]], where he was firmly approved and likely also declared shah for the first time.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} The reasons behind the nobles favour of Narseh might have been due to his jurisdiction as governor, his image as an advocate of the [[Zoroastrian]] religion and as an insurer for harmony and prosperity of the empire.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} His ancestry from the early Sasanian family probably also played a role.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} Kartir was one of those nobles who supported Narseh, which is attested in the [[Paikuli inscription]].{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Narseh's reign marked the return to the policy of religious tolerance which had been practiced by his father.{{sfn|Weber|2016}} Kartir fades into obscurity in historical records under Narseh, due to not doing anything noteworthy as high priest.{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}}\n\n== Legacy and assessment ==\nAccording to the modern historian Prods Oktor Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8, \"In both Iranist and non-Iranist literature, there has been a tendency to elaboration and hyperbole. Several scholars have taken a strict and critical view of Kartir from their modern, and so irrelevant, vantage point.\"{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Zaehner called Kartir a \"religious zealot of quite uncommon ardour\" and to \"the process of intolerance initiated and zestfully developed by Kartir\".{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} Russell called him a \"a ruthless fanatic, Kartir, [who] promoted the xenophobic state cult\", while Folz refers to him as \"fanatical\".{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}} More positive views of Kartir are also found in modern sources, such as Hinz, who called him a \"spiritual man yearning for a religious truth that ought to be revealed to all\", while Neusner described \"the [Sasanian] government\u2019s enthusiasm for Kartir\u2019s program\".{{sfn|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2011|pp=608-628}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Kartir's inscription at Naqsh-e Rajab]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=Some reflections on Zurvanism|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|publisher=SOAS|location=London|year=1957|volume=19|issue=2|pages=304\u2013316|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00133063 }}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=On the Zoroastrian Temple Cult of Fire|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|publisher=AOS/UMich.

The series was broadcast on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] from October 5, 1979 to October 10, 1980. The series was a co-production between [[Toei Company|Toei]] and [[Ishinomori Productions]], and was created by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]. It aired every Saturday at 7:00 PM.\n\n''The New Kamen Rider'' was intended as a revival of the original ''[[Kamen Rider]]'', going back to the basic, essential themes established in that series, as opposed to the more complex and unique series that came before it, such as ''[[Kamen Rider Amazon]]'' and ''[[Kamen Rider Stronger]]''.\n\n==Story==\nDoctor Keitar\u014d Shido, an acclaimed scientist, has been kidnapped by the terrorist organization Neo-Shocker in order to exploit his expertise in robotics technology.

Explaining that he can turn the camper, Hiroshi Tsukuba into a powerful Neo-Shocker warrior, they allow Doctor Shido to operate.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref>. Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India | Eastern India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69.

With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nIn late 2018 to early 2019, the band went for recording their debut album in a studio based in their hometown Ranchi. They were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n\nLineData =\n at:01/01/2013\n at:01/01/2014\n at:01/01/2015\n at:01/01/2016\n at:01/01/2017\n at:01/01/2018\n at:01/01/2019\n at:01/01/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India | Eastern India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69.

With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nIn late 2018 to early 2019, the band went for recording their debut album in a studio based in their hometown Ranchi. They were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n\nLineData =\n at:01/01/2013\n at:01/01/2014\n at:01/01/2015\n at:01/01/2016\n at:01/01/2017\n at:01/01/2018\n at:01/01/2019\n at:01/01/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.
