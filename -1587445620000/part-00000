A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

[[Wuhan]], the capital of [[Hubei]] province, China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite

Arizona (1966).jpg|thumb|Page of the manuscript written by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] regarding the Miranda v. Arizona decision. This page established the basic requirements of the \"''Miranda'' warning\".]]\n\n{{Law enforcement in the United States}}\n\nIn the [[United States]], the '''''Miranda'' warning''' is a type of notification customarily given by [[Law enforcement in the United States|police]] to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a [[custodial interrogation]]) advising them of their [[right to silence]]; that is, their right to refuse to answer questions or provide information to law enforcement or other officials. These rights are often referred to as '''''Miranda''''' '''rights'''. The purpose of such notification is to preserve the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility of their statements]] made during custodial interrogation in later criminal proceedings.\n\nThe language used in a ''Miranda'' warning is derived from the 1966 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 US 436 (1966).<ref name=Miranda>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1965/759|title=Miranda v.

Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions. You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish. If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering at any time.}}\n\nThe ''Miranda'' warning is part of a preventive criminal procedure rule that law enforcement are required to administer to protect an individual who is in custody and subject to direct questioning or its functional equivalent from a violation of their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against compelled self-incrimination. In ''Miranda v. Arizona'', the Supreme Court held that the [[admissible evidence|admission]] of an elicited incriminating statement by a suspect not informed of these rights violates the Fifth Amendment and the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment right to counsel]], through the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation]] of these rights into state law.{{#tag:ref|The 2004 United States Supreme Court ruling ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' upheld state \"[[Stop and Identify statutes|stop-and-identify]]\" laws, allowing police in those jurisdictions engaging in a [[Terry stop]] to require biographical information such as name and address, without arresting suspects or providing them Miranda warnings.|group=\"Note\"}} Thus, if law enforcement officials decline to offer a ''Miranda'' warning to an individual in their custody, they may interrogate that person and act upon the knowledge gained, but may not use that person's statements as evidence against them in a criminal trial.\n\n==Origin and development of ''Miranda'' rights==\n[[File:CBP Border Patrol agent reads the Miranda rights.jpg|thumb|A [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] agent reading the Miranda rights to a suspect]]\nThe concept of \"''Miranda'' rights\" was enshrined in U.S. law following the 1966 ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' Supreme Court decision, which found that the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights of [[Ernesto Miranda|Ernesto Arturo Miranda]] had been violated during his arrest and trial for armed robbery, kidnapping, and rape of a mentally handicapped young woman. \n\nMiranda was subsequently retried and convicted, based primarily on his estranged ex-partner, who had been tracked down by the original arresting officer via Miranda's own parents, suddenly claiming that Miranda had confessed to her when she had visited him in jail; Miranda's lawyer later confessed that he 'goofed' the trial.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S5y-y-0qpa4C&pg=PA262&dq=goofed#v=onepage&q=goofed&f=false|title=The Devil's Advocates: Greatest Closing Arguments in Criminal Law|last=Lief|first=Michael S.|last2=Caldwell|first2=H. Mitchell|date=2006-08-29|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743246682|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards, i.e. Miranda rights, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The Supreme Court did not specify the exact wording to use when informing a suspect of their rights. However, the Court did create a set of guidelines that must be followed. The ruling states:\n\n{{quote|...The person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be clearly informed that he/she has the [[right to silence|right to remain silent]], and that anything the person says will be used against that person in court; the person must be clearly informed that he/she has the right to consult with an attorney and to have that attorney present during questioning, and that, if he/she is [[poverty|indigent]], an attorney will be provided at no cost to represent him/her.}}\n\nIn ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'' (1984), the Supreme Court decided that a person subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the procedural safeguards enunciated in ''Miranda'', regardless of the nature or severity of the offense of which they are suspected or for which they were arrested.<ref>''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', {{ussc|468|420|1984}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, [[American English]] developed the [[verb]] ''Mirandize'', meaning \"read the ''Miranda'' rights to\" a suspect (when the suspect is arrested).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title=Mirandize |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mirandize |accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>\n\nNotably, the ''Miranda'' rights do not have to be read in any particular order, and they do not have to precisely match the language of the ''Miranda'' case as long as they are adequately and fully conveyed (''[[California v. Prysock]]'', {{ussc|453|355|1981}}<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/453/355/ ''California v. Prysock'', 453 U.S. 355 (1981)].</ref>).\n\nIn ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' (2010), the Supreme Court held that unless a suspect expressly states that they are invoking this right, subsequent voluntary statements made to an officer can be used against them in court, and police can continue to interact with (or question) the alleged criminal.\n\n==The warnings==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\nEvery U.S. jurisdiction has its own regulations regarding what, precisely, must be said to a person arrested or placed in a custodial situation. The typical warning states:<ref>{{cite news|title=Typical reading of Miranda rights|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/29/loc_typical_reading_of.html|date=August 29, 2001}}</ref>\n* You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.\n* Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.\n* You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.\n* If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.\n* If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney.\n* Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?\n\nThe courts have since ruled that the warning must be \"meaningful\", so it is usually required that the suspect be asked if they understand their rights. Sometimes, firm answers of \"yes\" are required. Some departments and jurisdictions require that an officer ask \"do you understand?\" after every sentence in the warning. An arrestee's silence is not a waiver, but on June 1, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that police are allowed to interrogate suspects who have invoked or waived their rights ambiguously, and any statement given during questioning prior to invocation or waiving is admissible as evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704875604575280392747737022|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=Jess|last=Bravin|title=Justices Narrow Miranda Rule|date=June 2, 2010}}</ref> Evidence has in some cases been ruled inadmissible because of an arrestee's poor knowledge of English and the failure of arresting officers to provide the warning in the arrestee's language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Einesman |first=Floralynn |title=Confessions and Culture: The Interaction of ''Miranda'' and Diversity |journal=[[Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology]] |year=1999 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201348 [p. 41] |jstor=1144162 |id={{NCJ|182327}} |doi=10.2307/1144162 |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol90/iss1/1 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the exact language above is not required by ''Miranda'', the police must advise the suspect that:\n# they have the right to remain silent;\n# anything the suspect ''does'' say can and may be used against them in a court of law;\n# they have the right to have an attorney present before and during the questioning; and\n# they have the right, if they cannot afford the services of an attorney, to have one appointed, at public expense and without cost to them, to represent them before and during the questioning.<ref>State and Federal courts have consistently rejected challenges to Miranda warnings on grounds that defendant was not advised of additional rights. See, e.g., ''United States v. Coldwell'', 954 F.2d 496(8th Cir. 1992) For example, police are not required to advise a suspect that if he decides to answer questions without an attorney present, he still has the right to stop answering at any time until he talks to an attorney. Note that the Miranda warnings are not part of the arrest procedure. There is no constitutional requirement that the officer advise the defendant of their Miranda rights when they place the defendant under arrest.</ref>\nThere is no precise language that must be used in advising a suspect of their Miranda rights.<ref>''California v. Prysock'', 453 U.S. 355, 101 S. Ct. 2806, 69 L. Ed. 2d 696 (1981); ''Brown v. Crosby'', 249 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (S.D. Fla. 2003).</ref> The point is that whatever language is used the substance of the rights outlined above must be communicated to the suspect.<ref>''Duckworth v. Eagan'', 492 U.S. 195, 109 S. Ct. 2875, 106 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1989) While a \"talismanic incantation\" of the exact language of the original Miranda warnings is not required, [Bloom and Brodin, Criminal Procedure, 5th ed. (Aspen 2006) 268] deviations and omission can result in suppression of the statement.</ref> The suspect may be advised of their rights orally or in writing.<ref>''U.S. v. Labrada-Bustamante'', 428 F.3d 1252 (9th Cir. 2005).</ref> Also, officers must make sure the suspect understands what the officer is saying, taking into account potential education levels. It may be necessary to \"translate\" to the suspect's level of understanding. Courts have ruled this admissible as long as the original waiver is said and the \"translation\" is recorded either on paper or on tape.\n\nThe Supreme Court has resisted efforts to require officers to more fully advise suspects of their rights. For example, the police are not required to advise the suspect that they can stop the interrogation at any time, that the decision to exercise the right cannot be used against the suspect, or that they have a right to talk to a lawyer before being asked any questions. Nor have the courts required to explain the rights. For example, the standard Miranda right to counsel states ''You have a right to have an attorney present during the questioning''. Police are not required to explain that this right is not merely a right to have a lawyer present while the suspect is being questioned. The right to counsel includes:\n* the right to talk to a lawyer before deciding whether to talk to police,\n* if the defendant decides to talk to the police, the right to consult with a lawyer before being interrogated,\n* the right to answer police only through an attorney.<ref>Gregory Declue, [http://www.aele.org/law/2009-08MLJ501.html Oral Miranda warnings: A checklist and a model presentation], ''The Journal of Psychiatry & Law'' (2007) at 421.</ref>\n\n===Circumstances triggering the ''Miranda'' requisites===\nThe circumstances triggering the ''Miranda'' safeguards, i.e. Miranda warnings, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Suspects in \"custody\" who are about to be interrogated must be properly advised of their Miranda rights\u2014namely, the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination (and, in furtherance of this right, the right to counsel while in custody). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel means that the suspect has the right to consult with an attorney before questioning begins and have an attorney present during the interrogation. The Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination is the right to remain silent\u2014the right to refuse to answer questions or to otherwise communicate information.\n\nThe duty to warn only arises when police officers conduct custodial interrogations. The Constitution does not require that a defendant be advised of the Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure, or once an officer has probable cause to arrest, or if the defendant has become a suspect of the focus of an investigation. Custody and interrogation are the events that trigger the duty to warn.\n\n===Use in various U.S. state jurisdictions===\n[[File:Fugitive felon life magazine.jpg|thumb|Police detectives read the Miranda rights to a fugitive felon, 1984 (photography: J. Ross Baughman)]]\nSome jurisdictions provide the right of a juvenile to remain silent if their parent or guardian is not present. Some departments in [[New Jersey]], [[Nevada]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Alaska]] modify the \"providing an attorney\" clause as follows:\n\n{{quote|We have no way of giving you a lawyer, but one will be appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to court.}}\n\nEven though this sentence may be somewhat ambiguous to some laypersons, who can, and who ''have'' actually interpreted it as meaning that they will not get a lawyer until they confess and are arraigned in court, the U.S. Supreme Court has approved of it as an accurate description of the procedure in those states.<ref>''[[Duckworth v. Eagan]]'', {{ussc|492|195|1989}} (upholding use of sentence by [[Hammond, Indiana]] police).</ref>\n\nIn states bordering Mexico, including [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and California, suspects who are not United States citizens are given an additional warning:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/28931-miranda-rights.html |title=What Are Miranda Rights &#124; Miranda Ruling |publisher=Livescience.com |date=April 22, 2013 |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hUrRoq5_sb8C&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=Miranda+Warning+If+you+are+not+a+United+States+citizen,+you+may+contact+your+country%27s+consulate+prior+to+any+questioning.#v=onepage&q=Miranda%20Warning%20If%20you%20are%20not%20a%20United%20States%20citizen%2C%20you%20may%20contact%20your%20country's%20consulate%20prior%20to%20any%20questioning.&f=false |title=Police and Law Enforcement \u2013 Google Books |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=2014-07-09|isbn=9781412978590 |last1=Chambliss |first1=William J. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vincentwdavis.com/blog/247/when-stopped-by-police-you-must-assert-your-rights-clearly-or-risk-waiving-them.html|title=When Stopped By Police You Must Assert Your Rights Clearly or Risk Waiving Them... - The Law Office Of Vincent W Davis And Associates|author=|date=November 7, 2013|website=vincentwdavis.com}}</ref><ref name=\"lawyerment1\">{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.lawyerment.com/topic/Miranda_warning/ |title=Miranda warning Definition at Lawyerment Online Dictionary of Legal Terms |publisher=Dictionary.lawyerment.com |date=June 1, 2010 |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref><ref name=\"expertlaw1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/miranda_rights.html |title=What Are Your Miranda Rights |publisher=ExpertLaw |date=2017-05-01 |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref><ref name=\"thelaw1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelaw.com/guide/criminal/miranda-rights-and-police-questioning/ |title=Miranda Rights and Police Questioning |publisher=Thelaw.com |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|If you are not a United States citizen, you may contact your country's consulate prior to any questioning.}}\n\nSome states including [[Virginia]] require the following sentence, ensuring that the suspect knows that waiving Miranda rights is not a one-time absolute occurrence:<ref name=\"lawyerment1\"/><ref name=\"expertlaw1\"/><ref name=\"thelaw1\"/><ref>http://www.una.edu/police/docs/forms/miranda.pdf</ref>\n\n{{quote|You can decide at any time from this moment on to terminate the interview and exercise these rights.}}\n\nCalifornia, [[Texas]], New York, Florida, [[Illinois]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Pennsylvania]] also add the following questions, presumably to comply with the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]:<ref name=\"lawyerment1\"/><ref name=\"expertlaw1\"/><ref name=\"thelaw1\"/>\n\n{{quote|Question 1: Do you understand each of these rights I have explained to you?\n\nQuestion 2: Having these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to us now?}}\n\nAn affirmative answer to both of the above questions waives the rights. If the suspect responds \"no\" to the first question, the officer is required to re-read the Miranda warning, while saying \"no\" to the second question invokes the right at that moment; in either case the interviewing officer or officers cannot question the suspect until the rights are waived.\n\nGenerally, when defendants invoke their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination and refuse to testify or submit to cross-examination at trial, the prosecutor cannot indirectly punish them for the exercise of a constitutional right by commenting on their silence and insinuating that it is an implicit admission of guilt.<ref>''[[Griffin v. California]]'', {{ussc|380|609|1965}}.</ref> Since ''Miranda'' rights are simply a judicial gloss upon the Fifth Amendment which protects against coercive interrogations, the same rule also prevents prosecutors from commenting about the post-arrest silence of suspects who invoke their ''Miranda'' rights immediately after arrest.<ref>''[[Wainwright v. Greenfield]]'', {{ussc|474|284|1986}}.</ref> However, neither the Fifth Amendment nor ''Miranda'' extend to ''pre-arrest'' silence, which means that if a defendant takes the witness stand at trial (meaning he just waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent), the prosecutor can attack his credibility with his pre-arrest silence (based on his failure to immediately turn himself in and confess to the things he voluntarily testified about at trial).<ref>''[[Jenkins v. Anderson]]'', {{ussc|447|231|1980}}.</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], Article 31<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/831- Article 31].</ref> provides for the right against compelled self-incrimination. Interrogation subjects under Army jurisdiction must first be given Department of the Army Form 3881, which informs them of the charges and their rights, and the subjects must sign the form. The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps require that all arrested personnel be read the \"rights of the accused\" and must sign a form waiving those rights if they so desire; a verbal waiver is not sufficient.\n\nIt has been discussed{{by whom|date=November 2010}} whether a Miranda warning\u2014if spoken or in writing\u2014could be appropriately given to [[disability|disabled persons]]. For example, \"the right to remain silent\" means little to a [[deaf]] individual and the word \"constitutional\" may not be understood by people with only an elementary education. In one case, a deaf murder suspect was kept at a therapy station until he was able to understand the meaning of the Miranda warning and other judicial proceedings.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Deaf Murderers: Clinical and Forensic Issues |journal=Behavioral Sciences & the Law |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=495\u2013516 |year=1999 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0798(199910/12)17:4<495::AID-BSL361>3.0.CO;2-6 |first1=McCay |last1=Vernon |first2=Annie G. |last2=Steinberg |first3=Louise A. |last3=Montoya}}</ref>\n\n==The six rules==\nThe Miranda rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings that is the product of custodial police interrogation. The Miranda right to counsel and right to remain silent are derived from the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>The Miranda rule is not an element of a valid arrest. The Fifth Amendment does not require an officer to give an arrestee his Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure. The Miranda rights are triggered by custody and interrogation. At the time the Supreme Court decided Miranda the Fifth Amendment had already been applied to the states in ''Malloy v. Hogan'', 378 U.S. 1 (1964)</ref> Therefore, for Miranda to apply, six requirements must be fulfilled:\n\n; 1. Evidence must have been gathered.\n: If the suspect did not make a statement during the interrogation the fact that he was not advised of his Miranda rights is of no importance.<ref>Note that post warning silence cannot be used as evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's trial testimony. ''Doyle v. Ohio'', 426 U.S. 610 (1976).</ref> Nor can the state offer evidence that the defendant asserted his rights\u2014that he refused to talk.\n; 2. The evidence must be testimonial.<ref name=\"Pennsylvania v. Muniz 1990\">''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S. 582 (1990)</ref>\n: Miranda applies only to \"testimonial\" evidence as that term is defined under the Fifth Amendment.<ref name=\"Pennsylvania v. Muniz 1990\"/> For purposes of the Fifth Amendment, testimonial statements mean communications that explicitly or implicitly relate a factual assertion [an assertion of fact or belief] or disclose information.<ref>''Doe v. United States'', 487 U.S. 201 (1988).</ref><ref>See also ''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218 (1967).</ref> The Miranda rule does not prohibit compelling a person to engage in non-assertive conduct that is incriminating or may produce incriminating evidence. Thus, requiring a suspect to participate in identification procedures such as giving [[handwriting exemplar|handwriting]]<ref>See Adams and Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (Lexis)331 n. 203 citing ''United States v. Daughenbaugh'', 49 F.3d 171, 173 (5th Cir. 1995).</ref> or voice exemplars,<ref>''United States v. Mitchell'', 556 F.2d 382 (6th Cir. 1977).</ref> fingerprints, DNA samples, hair samples, and dental impressions is not within the Miranda rule. Such physical or real evidence is non-testimonial and not protected by the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause.<ref>''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S 582 (1990).</ref> On the other hand, certain non-verbal conduct may be testimonial. For example, if the suspect nodded their head up and down in response to the question \"did you kill the victim\", the conduct is testimonial, is the same as saying \"yes I did\", and Miranda would apply.<ref>See ''Schmerber v.

Arizona'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966)</ref>\n: The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody. This limitation follows from the fact that Miranda's purpose is to protect suspects from the compulsion inherent in the police-dominated atmosphere attendant to arrest. Custody means either that the suspect was under arrest or that his freedom of movement was restrained to an extent \"associated with a formal arrest\".<ref>''[[Stansbury v. California]]'', 114 S. Ct. 1526 (1994); ''[[New York v. Quarles]]'', 467 U.S. 649, 655 (1984). Some courts phrased the requirement as the defendant did not believe that he was \"free to leave\". This standard is comparable to the detention standard for purposes of the fourth amendment\u2014not the functional arrest standard for purposes of the fifth amendment.<!-- Unable to verify 'detention standard' annotation in cited cases. --></ref> A formal arrest occurs when an officer, with the intent to make an arrest, takes a person into custody by the use of physical force or the person submits to the control of an officer who has indicated his intention to arrest the person. Telling a person he is \"under arrest\" is sufficient to satisfy this requirement even though the person may not be otherwise physically restrained.<ref>Adams & Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (LEXIS 1998) at 306.</ref> Absent a formal arrest, the issue is whether a reasonable person in the suspect's position would have believed that he was under \"full custodial\" arrest.<ref>In deciding whether a person is in \"constructive custody\" the courts use a totality of the circumstances test. Factors frequently examined include\n# the location of the interrogation\n# the force used to stop or detain the suspect\n# the number officer and police vehicles involved\n# whether the officers were in uniform\n# whether the officers were visibly armed\n# the tone of officer's voice\n# whether the suspect was told they were free to leave\n# the length of the detention and/or interrogation\n# whether the suspect was confronted with incriminating evidence and\n# whether the accused was the focus of the investigation.</ref> Applying this objective test, the Court has held Miranda does not apply to roadside questioning of a stopped motorist or to questioning of a person briefly detained on the street\u2014a [[Terry stop]].<ref>See ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', 468 U.S. 420 (1984) (brief roadside investigatory detention is not custody) and ''California v. Beheler'', 463 U.S. 1121 (1983) (''per curiam'').</ref> Even though neither the motorist nor the pedestrian is free to leave, this interference with the freedom of action is not considered actual arrest or its functional equivalent for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>''Berkemer v. McCarty'', 468 U.S. 420 (1984).</ref> The court has similarly held that a person who voluntarily comes to the police station for purposes of questioning is not in custody and thus not entitled to Miranda warnings particularly when the police advise the suspect that he is not under arrest and free to leave.<ref>Miranda is not offense or investigation-specific. Therefore, absent a valid waiver, a person in custody cannot be interrogated about the offense they are held in custody for, or any other offense.</ref>\n; 4. The evidence must have been the product of interrogation.<ref>''[[Rhode Island v. Innis]]'', 446 U.S. 291 (1980)</ref>\n: The evidence must have been the product of interrogation. A defendant who seeks to challenge the admissibility of a statement under Miranda must show that the statement was \"prompted by police conduct that constituted 'interrogation'\".<ref>Imwinkelried and Blinka, Criminal Evidentiary Foundations, 2d ed. (Lexis 2007) {{ISBN|1-4224-1741-7}} at 620.</ref> A volunteered statement by a person in custody does not implicate Miranda. In ''[[Rhode Island v. Innis]]'', the Supreme Court defined interrogation as express questioning and \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect\". Thus, a practice that the police \"should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect ... amounts to interrogation\". For example, confronting the suspect with incriminating evidence may be sufficiently evocative to amount to interrogation because the police are implicitly communicating a question: \"How do you explain this?\"<ref>See ''[[Edwards v. Arizona]]'', 451 U.S. 477 (1981).</ref> On the other hand, \"unforeseeable results of police words or actions\" do not constitute interrogation. Under this definition, routine statements made during the administration of sobriety tests would not implicate Miranda. For example, a police officer arrests a person for impaired driving and takes him to the police station to administer an intoxilyzer test. While at the station the officer also asks the defendant to perform certain psycho-physical tests such as the walk and turn, one leg stand or finger to nose test. It is standard practice to instruct the arrestee on how to perform the test and to demonstrate the test. (Note that the police ''will not'' tell the person that they have the right to refuse to perform the test, and the refusal cannot be used in evidence against them, nor can they be in any way punished for refusing to perform it, same as the police will not tell someone that they may refuse to perform a roadside sobriety test without penalty). An incriminating statement made by an arrestee during the instruction, \"I couldn't do that even if I was sober\", would not be the product of interrogation. Similarly, incriminating statements made in response to requests for consent to search a vehicle or other property are not considered to be the product of interrogation.<ref>See Adams and Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (Lexis 1998)331 n. 204 citing United States v. Smith, 3 F.3d. 1088 (7th Cir. 1993)</ref>\n; 5. The interrogation must have been conducted by state-agents.<ref>''[[Escobedo v. Illinois]]'', 378 U.S. 478 (1964); ''Illinois v. Perkins'', 110 S. Ct. 2394 (1990). See also Latzer, State Constitutions and Criminal Justice, (Greenwood Press 1991), citing ''Walter v. United States'', 447 U.S. 649 (1980)</ref>\n: To establish a violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, the defendant must show state action, so the interrogation must have been conducted by state-agents.<ref>See Latzer, State Constitutions and Criminal Justice, 97 n. 86 (Goodwood Press 1991) quoting Kamisar, LaFave & Israel, Basic Criminal Procedure 598 (6th ed. 1986) \"whatever may lurk in the heart or mind of the fellow prisoner ..., if it is not 'custodial police interrogation' ''in the eye of the beholder'', then it is not ... interrogation within the meaning of Miranda\".</ref> If the interrogation was conducted by a person known by the suspect to be a law enforcement officer the state action requirement is unquestionably met. On the other hand, where a private citizen obtains a statement there is no state action regardless of the custodial circumstances surrounding the statement. A confession obtained through the interrogation by an undercover police officer or a paid informant does not violate ''Miranda'' because there is no coercion, no police dominated atmosphere if the suspect does not know that they are being questioned by the police. Private security guards and \"private\" police present special problems. They are generally not regarded as state-agents. However, an interrogation conducted by a police officer moonlighting as a security guard may well trigger Miranda's safeguards since an officer is considered to be \"on duty\" at all times.<ref>See ''Commonwealth v. Leone'', 386 Mass. 329 (1982).</ref>\n; 6. The evidence must be offered by the state during a criminal prosecution.<ref>The Fifth Amendment applies only to compelled statements used in criminal proceedings</ref>\n: The evidence is being offered during a criminal proceeding. Under the exclusionary rule, a Miranda-defective statement cannot be used by the prosecution as substantive evidence of guilt. However, the Fifth Amendment exclusionary rule applies only to criminal proceedings. In determining whether a particular proceeding is criminal, the courts look at the punitive nature of the sanctions that could be imposed. Labels are irrelevant. The question is whether the consequences of an outcome adverse to the defendant could be characterized as punishment. Clearly a criminal trial is a criminal proceeding since if convicted the defendant could be fined or imprisoned. However, the possibility of loss of liberty does not make the proceeding criminal in nature. For example, commitment proceedings are not criminal proceedings even though they can result in long confinement because the confinement is considered rehabilitative in nature and not punishment. Similarly, ''Miranda'' does not apply directly to probation revocation proceedings because the evidence is not being used as a basis for imposing additional punishment.\n\n===Application of the prerequisites===\nAssuming that the six requirements are present and ''Miranda'' applies, the statement will be subject to suppression unless the prosecution can demonstrate:\n* that the suspect was advised of their ''Miranda'' rights, and\n* that the suspect voluntarily waived those rights or that the circumstances fit an exception to the ''Miranda'' rule.\nThe defendant may also be able to challenge the admissibility of the statement under provisions of state constitutions and state criminal procedure statutes.<ref>Other bases for exclusion include that the confession was the product of an unconstitutional arrest [See Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590 (1975); [[Dunaway v. New York]], 442 U.S. 200 (1979)], the confession was obtained in violation of the defendant's sixth amendment right to counsel or the confession was involuntary under the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that immigrants who live in the United States illegally are also protected and should receive their Miranda warnings as well when being interrogated or placed under arrest. \"[[Alien (law)|Aliens]] receive constitutional protections when they have come within the territory of the United States and [have] developed substantial connections with this country\".<ref>Einesman, F: \"Confessions and Culture: The Interaction of Miranda and Diversity\", p. 9. ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', 1999.</ref>\n\nThe Fifth Amendment right to counsel, a component of the ''Miranda'' Rule, is different from the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In the context of the law of confessions the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is defined by the [[Massiah v. United States|Massiah]] Doctrine (''Massiah v. United States'', 377 U.S. 201 (1964)).\n\n==Waiver==\nSimply advising the suspect of their rights does not fully comply with the Miranda rule. The suspect must also voluntarily waive their Miranda rights before questioning can proceed.<ref name=Miranda /> An express waiver is not necessary.<ref>''United States v. Melanson'', 691 F.2d 579 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 856 (1981).</ref> However, most law enforcement agencies use written waiver forms. These include questions designed to establish that the suspect expressly waived their rights. Typical waiver questions are\n* \"Do you understand each of these rights?\" \nand\n* \"Understanding each of these rights, do you now wish to speak to the police without a lawyer being present?\"\n\nThe waiver must be \"knowing and intelligent\" and it must be \"voluntary\". These are separate requirements. To satisfy the first requirement the state must show that the suspect generally understood their rights (right to remain silent and right to counsel) and the consequences of forgoing those rights (that anything they said could be used against them in court). To show that the waiver was \"voluntary\" the state must show that the decision to waive the rights was not the product of police coercion. If police coercion is shown or evident, then the court proceeds to determine the voluntariness of the waiver under the [[totality of the circumstances|totality of circumstances]] test focusing on the personal characteristics of the accused and the particulars of the coercive nature of the police conduct. The ultimate issue is whether the coercive police conduct was sufficient to overcome the will of a person under the totality of the circumstances. As noted previously, courts traditionally focused on two categories of factors in making this determination: (1) the personal characteristics of the suspect and (2) the circumstances attendant to the waiver. However, the Supreme Court significantly altered the voluntariness standard in the case of ''[[Colorado v. Connelly]]''.<ref>479 U.S. 157 (1987)</ref> In ''Connelly'', the Court held that \"Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to a finding that a confession is not 'voluntary' within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"<ref>479 U.S. at 166.</ref> The Court has applied this same standard of voluntariness in determining whether a waiver of a suspect's Fifth Amendment Miranda rights was voluntary. Thus, a waiver of Miranda rights is voluntary unless the defendant can show that their decision to waive their rights and speak to the police was the product of [[police misconduct]] and coercion that overcame the defendant's free will. After ''Connelly'', the traditional totality of circumstances analysis is not even reached unless the defendant can first show such coercion by the police.<ref>Bloom and Brodin, Criminal Procedure 2nd ed. (Little Brown 1986) 250.</ref> Under ''Connelly'', a suspect's decisions need not be the product of rational deliberations.<ref>''[[Moran v. Burbine]]'', 475 U.S.</ref> In addition to showing that the waiver was \"voluntary\", the prosecution must also show that the waiver was \"knowing\" and \"intelligent\". Essentially this means the prosecution must prove that the suspect had a basic understanding of their rights and an appreciation of the consequences of forgoing those rights. The focus of the analysis is directly on the personal characteristics of the suspect. If the suspect was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or suffered from an emotional or mental condition that substantially impaired their capacity to make rational decisions, the courts may well decide that the suspect's waiver was not knowing and intelligent.\n\nA waiver must also be clear and unequivocal. An equivocal statement is ineffective as a waiver and the police may not proceed with the interrogation until the suspect's intentions are made clear. The requirement that a waiver be unequivocal must be distinguished from situations in which the suspect made an equivocal assertion of their Miranda rights after the interrogation began. Any post-waiver assertion of a suspect's Miranda rights must be clear and unequivocal.<ref>''[[Davis v. United States (1994)|Davis v. United States]]'', 512 U.S. 452 (1994)</ref> Any ambiguity or equivocation will be ineffective. If the suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the interrogating officers are permitted to ask questions to clarify the suspect's intentions, although they are not required to.<ref name=\"Davis v. United States 1994\">''Davis v. United States'' (1994)</ref> In other words, if a suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the police may either attempt to clarify the suspect's intentions or they may simply ignore the ineffective assertion and continue with the interrogation.<ref name=\"Davis v. United States 1994\"/> The timing of the assertion is significant. Requesting an attorney prior to arrest is of no consequence because ''Miranda'' applies only to custodial interrogations. The police may simply ignore the request and continue with the questioning; however, the suspect is also free to leave.\n\n==Assertion==\nIf the defendant asserts his right to remain silent all interrogation must immediately stop and the police may not resume the interrogation unless they have \"scrupulously honored\" the defendant's assertion and subsequently obtained a valid waiver before resuming the interrogation.<ref>\"Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear: if the individual indicates, in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point, he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody.\" ''Michigan v. Moseley'', 423 U.S. 96 (1975) quoting ''Miranda v. Arizona'', 384 U. S. 436 (1966) at 384 U.S. 473\u201374. Note the defendant's assertion of their fifth amendment [[right to silence]] cannot be used as substantive evidence of guilt, or to impeach the defendant's testimony. (''Doyle v. Ohio'')</ref> In determining whether the police \"scrupulously honored\" the assertion the courts apply a totality of the circumstances test. The most important factors are the length of time between termination of the original interrogation and the commencement of the second, and issuing a new set of Miranda warnings before resumption of interrogation.\n\nThe consequences of assertion of Sixth Amendment right to counsel are stricter.<ref>A request to speak to a third person who is not an attorney does not invoke right to counsel. ''Fare v. Michael C.'', 442 U.S. 707 (1979)</ref> The police must immediately cease all interrogation and the police cannot reinitiate interrogation unless counsel is present (merely consulting with counsel is insufficient) or the defendant of his own volition contacts the police.<ref>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear ''Maryland v. Shatzer'' to determine how long the protections afforded by the Edwards rule last. [http://www.crimeandconsequences.com/crimblog/2009/01/tackling-edwards-v-arizona-one.html Tackling ''Edwards v. Arizona'' One More Time]</ref> If the defendant does reinitiate contact, a valid waiver must be obtained before interrogation may resume.\n\nIn ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' (2010), the Supreme Court declared in a 5\u20134 decision that criminal defendants who have been read their ''Miranda'' rights (and who have indicated they understand them and have not already waived them), must explicitly state during or before an interrogation begins that they wish to be silent and not speak to police for that protection against self-incrimination to apply. If they speak to police about the incident before invoking the Miranda right to remain silent, or afterwards at any point during the interrogation or detention, the words they speak may be used against them if they have not stated they do not want to speak to police. Those who oppose the ruling contend that the requirement that the defendant must speak to indicate his intention to remain silent further erodes the ability of the defendant to stay completely silent about the case. This opposition must be put in context with the second option offered by the majority opinion, which allowed that the defendant had the option of remaining silent, saying: \"Had he wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation.\" Thus, having been \"Mirandized\", a suspect may avow explicitly the invocation of these rights, or, alternatively, simply remain silent. Absent the former, \"anything [said] can and will be used against [the defendant] in a court of law\".\n\n==Exceptions==\nAssuming that the six factors are present, the Miranda rule would apply unless the prosecution can establish that the statement falls within an exception to the Miranda rule.<ref>The statement of the defendant is admissible when offered by the state as substantive evidence of guilt as an admission of a party opponent. This exception or exemption from the hearsay rules is not available to the defendant\u2014the defendant must resort to some other exception if he attempts to offer his own statement into evidence. Further if the defendant is successful in offering his own statement as substantive evidence, then the defendant is the hearsay declarant and the state can impeach the defendant as it would any other witness including the use of potentially devastating evidence of prior convictions.</ref> The three exceptions are:\n\n# the routine booking question exception<ref>See ''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S. 582 (1990)</ref>\n# the jail house informant exception\n# the public safety exception.<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649 (1984)</ref>\n\nArguably only the last is a true exception\u2014the first two can better be viewed as consistent with the ''Miranda'' factors. For example, questions that are routinely asked as part of the administrative process of arrest and custodial commitment are not considered \"interrogation\" under Miranda because they are not intended or likely to produce incriminating responses. Nonetheless, all three circumstances are treated as exceptions to the rule. The jail house informant exception applies to situations where the suspect does not know that he is speaking to a state-agent; either a police officer posing as a fellow inmate, a cellmate working as an agent for the state or a family member or friend who has agreed to cooperate with the state in obtaining incriminating information.<ref>See ''Illinois v. Perkins'', 496 U.S. 292 (1990)</ref>\n\n===Public safety exception===\nThe \"public safety\" exception is a limited and case-specific exception, allowing certain unadvised statements (given without Miranda warnings) to be admissible into evidence at trial when they were elicited in circumstances where there was great danger to public safety; thus, the ''Miranda'' rule provides some elasticity.<ref name=\"Stigall, Dan E. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Stigall|first=Dan E.|title=Counterterrorism and the Comparative Law of Investigative Detention|publisher=Cambria|year=2009|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1-60497-618-2}}</ref>\n\nThe public safety exception derives from ''[[New York v. Quarles]]'' (1984), a case in which the Supreme Court considered the admissibility of a statement elicited by a police officer who apprehended a rape suspect who was thought to be carrying a firearm. The arrest took place during the middle of the night in a supermarket that was open to the public but apparently deserted except for the clerks at the checkout counter. When the officer arrested the suspect, he found an empty shoulder holster, handcuffed the suspect, and asked him where the gun was. The suspect nodded in the direction of the gun (which was near some empty cartons) and said, \"The gun is over there\". The Supreme Court found that such an unadvised statement was admissible in evidence because \"[i]n a kaleidoscopic situation such as the one confronting these officers, where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day, the application of the exception we recognize today should not be made to depend on ''[[:wikt:post hoc|post hoc]]'' findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the police officer\".<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649 (1984).</ref> Thus, the jurisprudential rule of ''Miranda'' must yield in \"a situation where concern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in Miranda\".\n\nUnder this exception, to be admissible in the government's direct case at a trial, the questioning must not be \"actually compelled by police conduct which overcame his will to resist\", and must be focused and limited, involving a situation \"in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety\".<ref>Benoit, Carl A.

Once the suspect is formally charged, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel would attach and surreptitious interrogation would be prohibited.<ref name=Massiah>''[[United States v. Massiah]]'', 377 U.S. 201 (1964).</ref> The public safety exception applies where circumstances present a clear and present danger to the public's safety and the officers have reason to believe that the suspect has information that can end the emergency.<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649, 655 (1984).</ref>\n\n==Consequences of violation==\nAssuming that a Miranda violation occurred\u2014the six factors are present and no exception applies\u2014the statement will be subject to suppression under the Miranda exclusionary rule.<ref>A common misconception is that a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights warrants dismissal of the charges. Generally, a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights will not result in dismissal of the charges unless the defendant can show that the violation was especially egregious.</ref> That is, if the defendant objects or files a motion to suppress, the exclusionary rule would prohibit the prosecution from offering the statement as proof of guilt. However, the statement can be used to impeach the defendant's testimony.<ref>The statement must be \"voluntary\" under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. An involuntary statement cannot be used for any purpose.</ref> Further, the [[fruit of the poisonous tree]] doctrine does not apply to Miranda violations.<ref>Note that if the seizure of the defendant violated the fourth amendment any confession that resulted from the seizure would be subject to suppression. For example, an officer stops a defendant because the officer has a \"gut feeling\" that the defendant is driving while impaired. After the stop the officer asks the defendant if he had been drinking and the defendant says: \"Yes\". The officer then arrests the defendant and takes him to the law enforcement center to administer a breathalyzer test. While in the breathalyzer room the officer asks the defendant the questions on his alcohol influence report. The defendant's responses are incriminating. Under this scenario because the initial stop was unconstitutional all evidence that resulted from the stop would be subject to suppression.</ref> Therefore, the exclusionary rule exceptions, attenuation, independent source and inevitable discovery, do not come into play, and derivative evidence would be fully admissible. For example, suppose the police continue with a custodial interrogation after the suspect has asserted his right to silence. During his post-assertion statement the suspect tells the police the location of the gun he used in the murder. Using this information the police find the gun. Forensic testing identifies the gun as the murder weapon, and fingerprints lifted from the gun match the suspect's. The contents of the Miranda-defective statement could not be offered by the prosecution as substantive evidence, but the gun itself and all related forensic evidence could be used as evidence at trial.\n\n===Procedural requirements===\nAlthough the rules vary by jurisdiction, generally a person who wishes to contest the admissibility of evidence<ref>Evidence includes physical evidence, confessions and identification evidence.

Specifically, the Massiah rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings deliberately elicited by the police from a defendant after formal charges have been filed. The events that trigger the Sixth Amendment safeguards under ''Massiah'' are (1) the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings and (2) deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant a right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are to protect a defendant's right to a fair trial and to assure that the adversarial system of justice functions properly by providing competent counsel as an advocate for the defendant in his contest against the \"prosecutorial forces\" of the state.\n\n====Commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings====\nThe Sixth Amendment right \"attaches\" once the government has committed itself to the prosecution of the case by the initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings \"by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information or arraignment\".<ref>''United States v. Gouveia'', 467 U.S. 180, 187\u201388, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 2297, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984). \"In a line of constitutional cases in this Court stemming back to the Court's landmark opinion in ''Powell v. Alabama'', 287 U.S. 45, it has been firmly established that a person's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him. See ''Powell v. Alabama'', supra; ''Johnson v. Zerbst'', 304 U.S. 458; ''Hamilton v. Alabama'', 368 U.S. 52; ''Gideon v. Wainwright'', 372 U.S. 335; ''White v. Maryland'', 373 U.S. 59; ''Massiah v. United States'', 377 U.S. 201; ''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218; ''Gilbert v. California'', 388 U.S. 263; ''Coleman v. Alabama'', 399 U.S. 1.\" \"... [W]hile members of the Court have differed as to the existence of the right to counsel in the contexts of some of the above cases, all of those cases have involved points of time at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u2014whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\"</ref> Determining whether a particular event or proceeding constitutes the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings requires both an examination of the rules of criminal procedure for the jurisdiction in which the crime is charged and the Supreme Courts cases dealing with the issue of when formal prosecution begins.<ref>''Michigan v. Jackson'', 475 U.S. 625, 632 (1986); see also ''Brewer v. Williams'', 430 U.S. 387, 398 (1977). In ''Maine v. Moulton'' the court stated \"By its very terms, it becomes applicable only when the government's role shifts from investigation to accusation. For it is only then that the assistance of one versed in the intricacies ... of law,\" ibid., is needed to assure that the prosecution's case encounters \"the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing\". The Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach until such time as the \"government has committed itself to prosecute, and ... the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified ...'\" ''Kirby v. Illinois'', 406 U. S. 689 (1972).</ref> Once adversarial criminal proceedings commence the right to counsel applies to all critical stages of the prosecution and investigation. A critical stage is \"any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel's absence might derogate from the accused's right to a fair trial\".<ref>''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218, 226, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1932, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); see also, ''United States v. Hidalgo'', 7 F.3d 1566 (11th Cir. 1993). Under the critical stage analysis, virtually every phase of the criminal trial is a critical stage. Additionally courts have generally held that pretrial hearings regarding conditions of pretrial release and suppression of evidence are considered critical stages. ''Smith v. Lockhart'', 923 F.2d 1314 (8th Cir. 1991) on the other hand courts have generally held that certain pre-trial post accusation investigative procedures are not critical stages. Analysis of fingerprints, blood samples, clothing, hair, handwriting, and voice samples have all been ruled to be noncritical stages. FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, (2001)</ref>\n\nGovernment attempts to obtain incriminating statement related to the offense charged from the defendant by overt interrogation or surreptitious means is a critical stage and any information thus obtained is subject to suppression unless the government can show that an attorney was present or the defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel.<ref>''Brewer v. Williams'', 97 S. Ct. 1232 (1977) \"That the incriminating statements were elicited surreptitiously in the ''Massiah'' case, and otherwise here, is constitutionally irrelevant. See ibid.; ''McLeod v. Ohio'', 381 U. S. 356; ''United States v. Crisp'', 435 F.2d 354, 358 (CA7)\"</ref>\n\n====Deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents====\nDeliberate elicitation is defined as the intentional creation of circumstances by government agents that are likely to produce incriminating information from the defendant.<ref>''Illinois v. Perkins'', 496 U.S. 292 (1990).</ref> Clearly express questioning (interrogation) would qualify but the concept also extends to surreptitious attempts to acquire information from the defendant through the use of undercover agents or paid informants.<ref>''Massiah'' does not prohibit the government's use of a cellmate as a \"silent listening post\"\u2014a person who is simply placed in a position to hear any incriminating statements the defendant might make about the charged offense but who does not do anything to coax or induce the defendant to talk about the charged crime. Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436 (1986).</ref>\n\nThe definition of \"deliberate elicitation\" is not the same as the definition of \"interrogation\" under the Miranda rule. Miranda interrogation includes express questioning and any actions or statements that an officer would reasonably foresee as likely to cause an incriminating response. Massiah applies to express questioning and any attempt to deliberately and intentionally obtain incriminating information from the defendant regarding the crime charged. The difference is purposeful creation of an environment likely to produce incriminating information (Massiah) and action likely to induce an incriminating response even if that was not the officer's purpose or intent (Miranda).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific&nbsp;\u2013 the right only applies to post-commencement attempts to obtain information relating to the crime charged.<ref>''McNeil v. Wisconsin'', 111 S. Ct. 2204 (1991). Lower federal courts has extended the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to factually related offenses. In Texas v. Cobb, the Supreme Court made clear that the right to counsel applied only to the crime charged and did not apply to attempts to gather information about \"other offenses 'closely related factually' to the charged offense\". ''Texas v. Cobb'', 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001).</ref> The right does not extend to uncharged offenses if factually related to the charged crime.<ref>''Texas v. Cobb'', 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001).</ref>\n\nAs noted, information obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is subject to suppression unless the government can establish that the defendant waived his right to counsel. The waiver must be knowing, intelligent and voluntary.<ref>''Brewer v. Williams'', 430 U.S. 387 (1977)</ref> A valid Miranda waiver operates as a waiver of Sixth Amendment right.\n\n====Miranda and Massiah compared====\n# ''' Constitutional basis''':\n#* Miranda is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\n#* Massiah is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n# '''Attachment''':\n#* Miranda: Custody + interrogation (charging status irrelevant).\n#* Massiah: Formally charged + deliberate elicitation (custodial status irrelevant).\n# '''Scope''':\n#*a. Miranda applies to custodial interrogation by known governmental agents. Surreptitious acquisition of incriminating information allowed.\n#*a. Massiah applies to overt and surreptitious interrogation.\n#*b. Miranda is not offense specific.<ref>''Mathis v. United States'', 391 U.S. 1 (1968)</ref>\n#*b. Massiah is offense specific.<ref>See ''McNeil v. Wisconsin'', 501 U.S. 171 (1991)</ref>\n#*c. Miranda: interrogation + \"functional equivalent\"\n#*c. Massiah: interrogation + \"deliberate elicitation\"\n# '''Waiver''': Both Miranda and Massiah rights may be waived.\n# '''Assertion''': In each case, the assertion must be clear and unequivocal. The effects of assertion are not identical. For purposes of Miranda, the police must immediately cease the interrogation and cannot resume interrogating the defendant about any offense charged or uncharged unless counsel is present or defendant initiates contact for purposes of resuming interrogation and valid waiver obtained. Because Massiah is offense-specific, an assertion of the sixth amendment right to counsel requires the police to cease interrogating the defendant about any charged offense. Apparently the police could continue questioning the defendant about uncharged crimes assuming that the defendant was not in custody. The defendant's remedy would be to leave or to refuse to answer questions.<ref>Under ''Michigan v. Jackson'', a defendant's request for counsel at a preliminary hearing constituted an assertion of his sixth amendment right to counsel. However, ''Michigan v. Jackson'' was overruled by ''Montejo v. Louisiana .''</ref>\n# '''Remedy for violation''': The remedy for violation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel is identical: the statements and testimonial information are subject to suppression. Derivative evidence is not subject to suppression under Miranda&nbsp;\u2013 fruit of poisonous tree doctrine may apply to Massiah violation.<ref>''Fellers v. United States'', 124 S.Ct. 1019 (2004)</ref> Both Miranda and Massiah defective statements can be used for impeachment purposes.\n# '''Exceptions''': The primary exceptions to Miranda are (1) the routine booking questions exception (2) the jail house informant exception and (3) the public safety exception. In ''Moulton v. Maine'' the Supreme Court refused to recognize a public safety exception to the Massiah rule.<ref>474 U.S. 159 (1989)</ref> Massiah allows for the use of jail house informants provided the informants serve merely as \"passive listeners\".<ref>The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide another basis for challenging the admissibility of confessions. The test is whether the statement was \"voluntary\". A statement is not voluntary if it was the product of police misconduct. That is a due process claim requires that the defendant establish that there was police misconduct and that this misconduct induced the confession. The \"voluntariness\" test is implicated in any police interrogation\u2014neither Miranda \"custody\" or Massiah \"commencement of formal criminal proceedings\" is a necessary conditions (state action is required). Further, there are no issues of waiver or assertion. Finally the remedy is complete\u2014an involuntary statement cannot be used for any purpose.</ref>\n\n===The voluntariness standard===\nThe voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and regardless of whether the suspect has been formally charged. The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement. The statement cannot be used as either substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's testimony.<ref>Originally Miranda was regarded as a \"prophylactic\" rule\u2014the rule itself was not a constitutional right but a \" judicially\u2013created enforcement mechanism\" devised to protect the underlying constitutional rights. In Dickerson v. United States, the Court \"constitutionalized\" the Miranda rule\u2014although the decision did not perforce change the rule concerning the use of a Miranda-defective statement for impeachment purposes.</ref> The reason for the strictness is the common law's aversion to the use of coerced confessions because of their inherent unreliability. Further the rights to be free from coerced confession cannot be waived nor is it necessary that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right. In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court's decision in ''Colorado v. Connelly''.<ref>''Colorado v. Connelly'', 479 U.S. 157 (1986)</ref> Although federal courts' application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case, Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard. Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances.<ref>See ''Mincey v. Arizona'', 437 U.S. 385 (1978); ''Greenwald v. Wisconsin'', 390 U. S. 519, 390 U.S. 521 (1968) (\"Considering the totality of these circumstances, we do not think it credible that petitioner's statements were the product of his free and rational choice\"); Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 367 U.S. 440 (1961) (\"If [a defendant's will was overborne], the confession cannot be deemed 'the product of a rational intellect and a free will'\")</ref> \"Voluntary\" carried its everyday meaning: the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant's free will rather than police coercion.<ref>See e.g., ''Culombe v. Connecticut'', 367 U.S. 568, 367 U.S. 583 (1961) (\"[A]n extrajudicial confession, if it was to be offered in evidence against a man, must be the product of his own free choice\")</ref> After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct.<ref>Bloom & Brodin, ''Criminal Procedure'' (Aspen 1996) at 247.</ref> Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession.<ref>Bloom & Brodin, ''Criminal Procedure'' (Aspen 1996)</ref>\n\n===State constitutional challenges===\nEvery state constitution has articles and provision guaranteeing individual rights.<ref>Latzer, ''State Constitutions and Criminal Justice'' (Greenwood 1991)</ref> In most cases the subject matter is similar to the federal bill of rights.<ref>Id. at 2. This similarity is hardly surprising since the federal constitution and many state constitutions had common sources the state constitutions of some of the more important states such as Virginia.</ref> Most state courts interpretation of their constitution is consistent with the interpretation federal court's of analogous provisions of the federal constitution. With regard to Miranda issues, state courts have exhibited significant resistance to incorporating into their state jurisprudence some of the limitations on the Miranda rule that have been created by the federal courts.<ref>Id. at 89\u201391.</ref> As a consequence a defendant may be able to circumvent the federal limitation on the Miranda rule and successfully challenge the admissibility under state constitutional provisions. Practically every aspect of the Miranda rule has drawn state court criticism. However the primary point of contention involve the following limitations on the scope of the Miranda rule: (1) the Harris exception<ref>In ''Harris'' the United States Supreme Court allowed a Miranda-defective statement to be used to impeach the trial testimony of a defendant. Note the Harris rule does not permit the use of a statement that fails to meet the voluntariness standards of the due process clause to be used for any purpose. The basis for the distinction is that a Miranda-defective statement does not raise the questions of unreliability as does an involuntary statement.</ref> (2) the Burbine rule<ref>In ''Moran v. Burbine'', 475 U.S. 412 (1986) the Court held that officers are not required to tell a suspect in custody that third parties had retained an attorney for the suspect. The failure of the police to inform the suspect of this fact did not render the waiver involuntary. ''Burbine'' decision was not well-received by the state courts. Six states specifically rejected the Burbine rule.</ref> and (3) the Fare rule.<ref>id. at 91\u201398. The specific holding in Fare was that a juvenile's request to have his probation officer present during an interrogation was not an invocation of the juvenile's right to counsel. The Supreme Court stated that juveniles were essentially to be treated the same as adults for the purposes of Miranda. Many states adopted special rules concerning police interrogation of juveniles not true</ref>\n\n===State statutory challenges===\nIn addition to constitutionally based challenge, states permit a defendant to challenge the admissibility of a confession on the grounds that the confession was obtained in violation of a defendant's statutory rights. For example, North Carolina Criminal Procedure Act permits a defendant to move to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a \"substantial\" violation of the provision of the North Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n==Confusion regarding use==\nDue to the prevalence of American television programs and motion pictures in which the police characters frequently read suspects their rights, it has become an expected element of arrest procedure\u2014in the 2000 ''Dickerson'' decision, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] wrote that Miranda warnings had \"become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture\".<ref>''[[Dickerson v. United States]]'' {{ussc|530|428|2000}}.</ref>\n\nWhile arrests and interrogations can legally occur without the Miranda warning being given, this procedure would generally make the arrestee's pre-Miranda statements inadmissible at trial. (However, pursuant to the plurality opinion in ''[[United States v. Patane]]'', physical evidence obtained as a result of pre-Miranda statements may still be admitted. There was no majority opinion of the Court in that case.)\n\nIn some jurisdictions,{{where|date=July 2011}} a ''detention'' differs at law from an ''arrest'', and police are not required to give the Miranda warning until the person is arrested for a crime. In those situations, a person's statements made to police are generally admissible even though the person was not advised of their rights. Similarly, statements made while an arrest is in progress before the Miranda warning was given or completed are also generally admissible.\n\nBecause ''Miranda'' applies only to custodial interrogations, it does not protect detainees from standard booking questions such as name and address. Because it is a protective measure intended to safeguard the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, it does not prevent the police from taking blood without a warrant from persons suspected of [[Drunk driving (United States)|driving under the influence of alcohol]]. (Such evidence may be self-incriminatory, but are not considered statements of self-incrimination.)\n\nIf an inmate is in jail and invoked ''Miranda'' on one case, it is unclear whether this extends to any other cases that they may be charged with while in custody. For example: a subject is arrested, charged with cattle rustling, and is held in county jail awaiting trial. He invoked his Miranda rights on the cow case. While in custody, he is involved in a fight where a staff member loses his ability to walk. He speaks to the custodial staff regarding the fight without staff first invoking Miranda. It is unclear if this statement is admissible because of the original Miranda statement.\n\nMany police departments give special training to interrogators with regard to the Miranda warning; specifically, how to influence a suspect's decision to waive the right. For instance, the officer may be required to specifically ask if the rights are understood and if the suspect wishes to talk. The officer is allowed, before asking the suspect a question, to speak at length about evidence collected, witness statements, etc. The officer will ''then'' ask if the suspect wishes to talk, and the suspect is then more likely to talk in an attempt to refute the evidence presented. Another tactic commonly taught is never to ask a question; the officer may simply sit the suspect down in an interrogation room, sit across from him and do paperwork, and wait for the suspect to begin talking.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724033316/http://www.regent.edu/admin/media/schlaw/LawPreview/ Prof. James Duane and Officer George Bruch \u2013 Fifth Amendment Lecture at Regent University].</ref> These tactics are intended to mitigate the restrictions placed on law officers against compelling a suspect to give evidence, and have stood up in court as valid lawful tactics. Nevertheless, such tactics are condemned by legal rights groups as deceptive.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n===Exemption for interrogations conducted by undercover agents===\nIn [[''Illinois v. Perkins'']], 496 U.S. 292 (1990), the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that undercover officers do not have to give suspects a ''Miranda'' warning prior to asking questions that may elicit incriminating responses. In this case, an undercover agent posed as an inmate and carried on a 35-minute conversation with another inmate that he suspected of committing a murder that was being investigated. During this conversation, the suspect implicated himself in the murder that the undercover agent was investigating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/496/292 |title=Supreme.justia.com |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court came to this conclusion despite the government's admission that a custodial interrogation had been conducted by a government agent.\n\n===Report of warnings being given to detainees in Afghanistan===\nBeginning in 2009, some detainees captured in [[Afghanistan]] have been read their Miranda rights by the [[FBI]], according to Congressman [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Michael Rogers]] of Michigan, who claims to have witnessed this himself.

These rights are often referred to as '''''Miranda''''' '''rights'''. The purpose of such notification is to preserve the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility of their statements]] made during custodial interrogation in later criminal proceedings.\n\nThe language used in a ''Miranda'' warning is derived from the 1966 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Miranda v.

In ''Miranda v.

Arizona]]'' Supreme Court decision, which found that the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights of [[Ernesto Miranda|Ernesto Arturo Miranda]] had been violated during his arrest and trial for armed robbery, kidnapping, and rape of a mentally handicapped young woman. \n\nMiranda was subsequently retried and convicted, based primarily on his estranged ex-partner, who had been tracked down by the original arresting officer via Miranda's own parents, suddenly claiming that Miranda had confessed to her when she had visited him in jail; Miranda's lawyer later confessed that he 'goofed' the trial.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S5y-y-0qpa4C&pg=PA262&dq=goofed#v=onepage&q=goofed&f=false|title=The Devil's Advocates: Greatest Closing Arguments in Criminal Law|last=Lief|first=Michael S.|last2=Caldwell|first2=H. Mitchell|date=2006-08-29|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743246682|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards, i.e. Miranda rights, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. The Supreme Court did not specify the exact wording to use when informing a suspect of their rights. However, the Court did create a set of guidelines that must be followed. The ruling states:\n\n{{quote|...The person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be clearly informed that he/she has the [[right to silence|right to remain silent]], and that anything the person says will be used against that person in court; the person must be clearly informed that he/she has the right to consult with an attorney and to have that attorney present during questioning, and that, if he/she is [[poverty|indigent]], an attorney will be provided at no cost to represent him/her.}}\n\nIn ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'' (1984), the Supreme Court decided that a person subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the procedural safeguards enunciated in ''Miranda'', regardless of the nature or severity of the offense of which they are suspected or for which they were arrested.<ref>''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', {{ussc|468|420|1984}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, [[American English]] developed the [[verb]] ''Mirandize'', meaning \"read the ''Miranda'' rights to\" a suspect (when the suspect is arrested).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title=Mirandize |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mirandize |accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>\n\nNotably, the ''Miranda'' rights do not have to be read in any particular order, and they do not have to precisely match the language of the ''Miranda'' case as long as they are adequately and fully conveyed (''[[California v. Prysock]]'', {{ussc|453|355|1981}}<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/453/355/ ''California v. Prysock'', 453 U.S. 355 (1981)].</ref>).\n\nIn ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' (2010), the Supreme Court held that unless a suspect expressly states that they are invoking this right, subsequent voluntary statements made to an officer can be used against them in court, and police can continue to interact with (or question) the alleged criminal.\n\n==The warnings==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\nEvery U.S. jurisdiction has its own regulations regarding what, precisely, must be said to a person arrested or placed in a custodial situation. The typical warning states:<ref>{{cite news|title=Typical reading of Miranda rights|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/29/loc_typical_reading_of.html|date=August 29, 2001}}</ref>\n* You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.\n* Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.\n* You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.\n* If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.\n* If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney.\n* Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?\n\nThe courts have since ruled that the warning must be \"meaningful\", so it is usually required that the suspect be asked if they understand their rights. Sometimes, firm answers of \"yes\" are required. Some departments and jurisdictions require that an officer ask \"do you understand?\" after every sentence in the warning. An arrestee's silence is not a waiver, but on June 1, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that police are allowed to interrogate suspects who have invoked or waived their rights ambiguously, and any statement given during questioning prior to invocation or waiving is admissible as evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704875604575280392747737022|work=The Wall Street Journal|first=Jess|last=Bravin|title=Justices Narrow Miranda Rule|date=June 2, 2010}}</ref> Evidence has in some cases been ruled inadmissible because of an arrestee's poor knowledge of English and the failure of arresting officers to provide the warning in the arrestee's language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Einesman |first=Floralynn |title=Confessions and Culture: The Interaction of ''Miranda'' and Diversity |journal=[[Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology]] |year=1999 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201348 [p. 41] |jstor=1144162 |id={{NCJ|182327}} |doi=10.2307/1144162 |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol90/iss1/1 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the exact language above is not required by ''Miranda'', the police must advise the suspect that:\n# they have the right to remain silent;\n# anything the suspect ''does'' say can and may be used against them in a court of law;\n# they have the right to have an attorney present before and during the questioning; and\n# they have the right, if they cannot afford the services of an attorney, to have one appointed, at public expense and without cost to them, to represent them before and during the questioning.<ref>State and Federal courts have consistently rejected challenges to Miranda warnings on grounds that defendant was not advised of additional rights. See, e.g., ''United States v. Coldwell'', 954 F.2d 496(8th Cir. 1992) For example, police are not required to advise a suspect that if he decides to answer questions without an attorney present, he still has the right to stop answering at any time until he talks to an attorney. Note that the Miranda warnings are not part of the arrest procedure. There is no constitutional requirement that the officer advise the defendant of their Miranda rights when they place the defendant under arrest.</ref>\nThere is no precise language that must be used in advising a suspect of their Miranda rights.<ref>''California v. Prysock'', 453 U.S. 355, 101 S. Ct. 2806, 69 L. Ed. 2d 696 (1981); ''Brown v. Crosby'', 249 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (S.D. Fla. 2003).</ref> The point is that whatever language is used the substance of the rights outlined above must be communicated to the suspect.<ref>''Duckworth v. Eagan'', 492 U.S. 195, 109 S. Ct. 2875, 106 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1989) While a \"talismanic incantation\" of the exact language of the original Miranda warnings is not required, [Bloom and Brodin, Criminal Procedure, 5th ed. (Aspen 2006) 268] deviations and omission can result in suppression of the statement.</ref> The suspect may be advised of their rights orally or in writing.<ref>''U.S. v. Labrada-Bustamante'', 428 F.3d 1252 (9th Cir. 2005).</ref> Also, officers must make sure the suspect understands what the officer is saying, taking into account potential education levels. It may be necessary to \"translate\" to the suspect's level of understanding. Courts have ruled this admissible as long as the original waiver is said and the \"translation\" is recorded either on paper or on tape.\n\nThe Supreme Court has resisted efforts to require officers to more fully advise suspects of their rights. For example, the police are not required to advise the suspect that they can stop the interrogation at any time, that the decision to exercise the right cannot be used against the suspect, or that they have a right to talk to a lawyer before being asked any questions. Nor have the courts required to explain the rights. For example, the standard Miranda right to counsel states ''You have a right to have an attorney present during the questioning''. Police are not required to explain that this right is not merely a right to have a lawyer present while the suspect is being questioned. The right to counsel includes:\n* the right to talk to a lawyer before deciding whether to talk to police,\n* if the defendant decides to talk to the police, the right to consult with a lawyer before being interrogated,\n* the right to answer police only through an attorney.<ref>Gregory Declue, [http://www.aele.org/law/2009-08MLJ501.html Oral Miranda warnings: A checklist and a model presentation], ''The Journal of Psychiatry & Law'' (2007) at 421.</ref>\n\n===Circumstances triggering the ''Miranda'' requisites===\nThe circumstances triggering the ''Miranda'' safeguards, i.e. Miranda warnings, are \"custody\" and \"interrogation\". Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Suspects in \"custody\" who are about to be interrogated must be properly advised of their Miranda rights\u2014namely, the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination (and, in furtherance of this right, the right to counsel while in custody). The Sixth Amendment right to counsel means that the suspect has the right to consult with an attorney before questioning begins and have an attorney present during the interrogation. The Fifth Amendment right against compelled self incrimination is the right to remain silent\u2014the right to refuse to answer questions or to otherwise communicate information.\n\nThe duty to warn only arises when police officers conduct custodial interrogations. The Constitution does not require that a defendant be advised of the Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure, or once an officer has probable cause to arrest, or if the defendant has become a suspect of the focus of an investigation. Custody and interrogation are the events that trigger the duty to warn.\n\n===Use in various U.S. state jurisdictions===\n[[File:Fugitive felon life magazine.jpg|thumb|Police detectives read the Miranda rights to a fugitive felon, 1984 (photography: J. Ross Baughman)]]\nSome jurisdictions provide the right of a juvenile to remain silent if their parent or guardian is not present. Some departments in [[New Jersey]], [[Nevada]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Alaska]] modify the \"providing an attorney\" clause as follows:\n\n{{quote|We have no way of giving you a lawyer, but one will be appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to court.}}\n\nEven though this sentence may be somewhat ambiguous to some laypersons, who can, and who ''have'' actually interpreted it as meaning that they will not get a lawyer until they confess and are arraigned in court, the U.S. Supreme Court has approved of it as an accurate description of the procedure in those states.<ref>''[[Duckworth v.

If the suspect responds \"no\" to the first question, the officer is required to re-read the Miranda warning, while saying \"no\" to the second question invokes the right at that moment; in either case the interviewing officer or officers cannot question the suspect until the rights are waived.\n\nGenerally, when defendants invoke their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination and refuse to testify or submit to cross-examination at trial, the prosecutor cannot indirectly punish them for the exercise of a constitutional right by commenting on their silence and insinuating that it is an implicit admission of guilt.<ref>''[[Griffin v. California]]'', {{ussc|380|609|1965}}.</ref> Since ''Miranda'' rights are simply a judicial gloss upon the Fifth Amendment which protects against coercive interrogations, the same rule also prevents prosecutors from commenting about the post-arrest silence of suspects who invoke their ''Miranda'' rights immediately after arrest.<ref>''[[Wainwright v. Greenfield]]'', {{ussc|474|284|1986}}.</ref> However, neither the Fifth Amendment nor ''Miranda'' extend to ''pre-arrest'' silence, which means that if a defendant takes the witness stand at trial (meaning he just waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent), the prosecutor can attack his credibility with his pre-arrest silence (based on his failure to immediately turn himself in and confess to the things he voluntarily testified about at trial).<ref>''[[Jenkins v. Anderson]]'', {{ussc|447|231|1980}}.</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], Article 31<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/831- Article 31].</ref> provides for the right against compelled self-incrimination. Interrogation subjects under Army jurisdiction must first be given Department of the Army Form 3881, which informs them of the charges and their rights, and the subjects must sign the form. The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps require that all arrested personnel be read the \"rights of the accused\" and must sign a form waiving those rights if they so desire; a verbal waiver is not sufficient.\n\nIt has been discussed{{by whom|date=November 2010}} whether a Miranda warning\u2014if spoken or in writing\u2014could be appropriately given to [[disability|disabled persons]]. For example, \"the right to remain silent\" means little to a [[deaf]] individual and the word \"constitutional\" may not be understood by people with only an elementary education. In one case, a deaf murder suspect was kept at a therapy station until he was able to understand the meaning of the Miranda warning and other judicial proceedings.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Deaf Murderers: Clinical and Forensic Issues |journal=Behavioral Sciences & the Law |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=495\u2013516 |year=1999 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0798(199910/12)17:4<495::AID-BSL361>3.0.CO;2-6 |first1=McCay |last1=Vernon |first2=Annie G. |last2=Steinberg |first3=Louise A. |last3=Montoya}}</ref>\n\n==The six rules==\nThe Miranda rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings that is the product of custodial police interrogation. The Miranda right to counsel and right to remain silent are derived from the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>The Miranda rule is not an element of a valid arrest. The Fifth Amendment does not require an officer to give an arrestee his Miranda rights as part of the arrest procedure. The Miranda rights are triggered by custody and interrogation. At the time the Supreme Court decided Miranda the Fifth Amendment had already been applied to the states in ''Malloy v. Hogan'', 378 U.S. 1 (1964)</ref> Therefore, for Miranda to apply, six requirements must be fulfilled:\n\n; 1. Evidence must have been gathered.\n: If the suspect did not make a statement during the interrogation the fact that he was not advised of his Miranda rights is of no importance.<ref>Note that post warning silence cannot be used as evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's trial testimony. ''Doyle v. Ohio'', 426 U.S. 610 (1976).</ref> Nor can the state offer evidence that the defendant asserted his rights\u2014that he refused to talk.\n; 2. The evidence must be testimonial.<ref name=\"Pennsylvania v. Muniz 1990\">''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S. 582 (1990)</ref>\n: Miranda applies only to \"testimonial\" evidence as that term is defined under the Fifth Amendment.<ref name=\"Pennsylvania v. Muniz 1990\"/> For purposes of the Fifth Amendment, testimonial statements mean communications that explicitly or implicitly relate a factual assertion [an assertion of fact or belief] or disclose information.<ref>''Doe v. United States'', 487 U.S. 201 (1988).</ref><ref>See also ''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218 (1967).</ref> The Miranda rule does not prohibit compelling a person to engage in non-assertive conduct that is incriminating or may produce incriminating evidence. Thus, requiring a suspect to participate in identification procedures such as giving [[handwriting exemplar|handwriting]]<ref>See Adams and Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (Lexis)331 n. 203 citing ''United States v. Daughenbaugh'', 49 F.3d 171, 173 (5th Cir. 1995).</ref> or voice exemplars,<ref>''United States v. Mitchell'', 556 F.2d 382 (6th Cir. 1977).</ref> fingerprints, DNA samples, hair samples, and dental impressions is not within the Miranda rule. Such physical or real evidence is non-testimonial and not protected by the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause.<ref>''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S 582 (1990).</ref> On the other hand, certain non-verbal conduct may be testimonial. For example, if the suspect nodded their head up and down in response to the question \"did you kill the victim\", the conduct is testimonial, is the same as saying \"yes I did\", and Miranda would apply.<ref>See ''Schmerber v. California'', 384 U.S. 757, 761 n. 5 (1966).</ref>\n; 3. The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody.<ref>''Miranda v. Arizona'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966)</ref>\n: The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody. This limitation follows from the fact that Miranda's purpose is to protect suspects from the compulsion inherent in the police-dominated atmosphere attendant to arrest. Custody means either that the suspect was under arrest or that his freedom of movement was restrained to an extent \"associated with a formal arrest\".<ref>''[[Stansbury v. California]]'', 114 S. Ct. 1526 (1994); ''[[New York v. Quarles]]'', 467 U.S. 649, 655 (1984). Some courts phrased the requirement as the defendant did not believe that he was \"free to leave\". This standard is comparable to the detention standard for purposes of the fourth amendment\u2014not the functional arrest standard for purposes of the fifth amendment.<!-- Unable to verify 'detention standard' annotation in cited cases. --></ref> A formal arrest occurs when an officer, with the intent to make an arrest, takes a person into custody by the use of physical force or the person submits to the control of an officer who has indicated his intention to arrest the person. Telling a person he is \"under arrest\" is sufficient to satisfy this requirement even though the person may not be otherwise physically restrained.<ref>Adams & Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (LEXIS 1998) at 306.</ref> Absent a formal arrest, the issue is whether a reasonable person in the suspect's position would have believed that he was under \"full custodial\" arrest.<ref>In deciding whether a person is in \"constructive custody\" the courts use a totality of the circumstances test. Factors frequently examined include\n# the location of the interrogation\n# the force used to stop or detain the suspect\n# the number officer and police vehicles involved\n# whether the officers were in uniform\n# whether the officers were visibly armed\n# the tone of officer's voice\n# whether the suspect was told they were free to leave\n# the length of the detention and/or interrogation\n# whether the suspect was confronted with incriminating evidence and\n# whether the accused was the focus of the investigation.</ref> Applying this objective test, the Court has held Miranda does not apply to roadside questioning of a stopped motorist or to questioning of a person briefly detained on the street\u2014a [[Terry stop]].<ref>See ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', 468 U.S. 420 (1984) (brief roadside investigatory detention is not custody) and ''California v. Beheler'', 463 U.S. 1121 (1983) (''per curiam'').</ref> Even though neither the motorist nor the pedestrian is free to leave, this interference with the freedom of action is not considered actual arrest or its functional equivalent for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>''Berkemer v. McCarty'', 468 U.S. 420 (1984).</ref> The court has similarly held that a person who voluntarily comes to the police station for purposes of questioning is not in custody and thus not entitled to Miranda warnings particularly when the police advise the suspect that he is not under arrest and free to leave.<ref>Miranda is not offense or investigation-specific. Therefore, absent a valid waiver, a person in custody cannot be interrogated about the offense they are held in custody for, or any other offense.</ref>\n; 4. The evidence must have been the product of interrogation.<ref>''[[Rhode Island v. Innis]]'', 446 U.S. 291 (1980)</ref>\n: The evidence must have been the product of interrogation. A defendant who seeks to challenge the admissibility of a statement under Miranda must show that the statement was \"prompted by police conduct that constituted 'interrogation'\".<ref>Imwinkelried and Blinka, Criminal Evidentiary Foundations, 2d ed. (Lexis 2007) {{ISBN|1-4224-1741-7}} at 620.</ref> A volunteered statement by a person in custody does not implicate Miranda. In ''[[Rhode Island v. Innis]]'', the Supreme Court defined interrogation as express questioning and \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect\". Thus, a practice that the police \"should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect ... amounts to interrogation\". For example, confronting the suspect with incriminating evidence may be sufficiently evocative to amount to interrogation because the police are implicitly communicating a question: \"How do you explain this?\"<ref>See ''[[Edwards v. Arizona]]'', 451 U.S. 477 (1981).</ref> On the other hand, \"unforeseeable results of police words or actions\" do not constitute interrogation. Under this definition, routine statements made during the administration of sobriety tests would not implicate Miranda. For example, a police officer arrests a person for impaired driving and takes him to the police station to administer an intoxilyzer test. While at the station the officer also asks the defendant to perform certain psycho-physical tests such as the walk and turn, one leg stand or finger to nose test. It is standard practice to instruct the arrestee on how to perform the test and to demonstrate the test. (Note that the police ''will not'' tell the person that they have the right to refuse to perform the test, and the refusal cannot be used in evidence against them, nor can they be in any way punished for refusing to perform it, same as the police will not tell someone that they may refuse to perform a roadside sobriety test without penalty). An incriminating statement made by an arrestee during the instruction, \"I couldn't do that even if I was sober\", would not be the product of interrogation. Similarly, incriminating statements made in response to requests for consent to search a vehicle or other property are not considered to be the product of interrogation.<ref>See Adams and Blinka, Pretrial Motions in Criminal Prosecutions, 2d ed. (Lexis 1998)331 n. 204 citing United States v. Smith, 3 F.3d. 1088 (7th Cir. 1993)</ref>\n; 5. The interrogation must have been conducted by state-agents.<ref>''[[Escobedo v. Illinois]]'', 378 U.S. 478 (1964); ''Illinois v. Perkins'', 110 S. Ct. 2394 (1990). See also Latzer, State Constitutions and Criminal Justice, (Greenwood Press 1991), citing ''Walter v. United States'', 447 U.S. 649 (1980)</ref>\n: To establish a violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, the defendant must show state action, so the interrogation must have been conducted by state-agents.<ref>See Latzer, State Constitutions and Criminal Justice, 97 n. 86 (Goodwood Press 1991) quoting Kamisar, LaFave & Israel, Basic Criminal Procedure 598 (6th ed. 1986) \"whatever may lurk in the heart or mind of the fellow prisoner ..., if it is not 'custodial police interrogation' ''in the eye of the beholder'', then it is not ... interrogation within the meaning of Miranda\".</ref> If the interrogation was conducted by a person known by the suspect to be a law enforcement officer the state action requirement is unquestionably met. On the other hand, where a private citizen obtains a statement there is no state action regardless of the custodial circumstances surrounding the statement. A confession obtained through the interrogation by an undercover police officer or a paid informant does not violate ''Miranda'' because there is no coercion, no police dominated atmosphere if the suspect does not know that they are being questioned by the police. Private security guards and \"private\" police present special problems. They are generally not regarded as state-agents. However, an interrogation conducted by a police officer moonlighting as a security guard may well trigger Miranda's safeguards since an officer is considered to be \"on duty\" at all times.<ref>See ''Commonwealth v. Leone'', 386 Mass. 329 (1982).</ref>\n; 6. The evidence must be offered by the state during a criminal prosecution.<ref>The Fifth Amendment applies only to compelled statements used in criminal proceedings</ref>\n: The evidence is being offered during a criminal proceeding. Under the exclusionary rule, a Miranda-defective statement cannot be used by the prosecution as substantive evidence of guilt. However, the Fifth Amendment exclusionary rule applies only to criminal proceedings. In determining whether a particular proceeding is criminal, the courts look at the punitive nature of the sanctions that could be imposed. Labels are irrelevant. The question is whether the consequences of an outcome adverse to the defendant could be characterized as punishment. Clearly a criminal trial is a criminal proceeding since if convicted the defendant could be fined or imprisoned. However, the possibility of loss of liberty does not make the proceeding criminal in nature. For example, commitment proceedings are not criminal proceedings even though they can result in long confinement because the confinement is considered rehabilitative in nature and not punishment. Similarly, ''Miranda'' does not apply directly to probation revocation proceedings because the evidence is not being used as a basis for imposing additional punishment.\n\n===Application of the prerequisites===\nAssuming that the six requirements are present and ''Miranda'' applies, the statement will be subject to suppression unless the prosecution can demonstrate:\n* that the suspect was advised of their ''Miranda'' rights, and\n* that the suspect voluntarily waived those rights or that the circumstances fit an exception to the ''Miranda'' rule.\nThe defendant may also be able to challenge the admissibility of the statement under provisions of state constitutions and state criminal procedure statutes.<ref>Other bases for exclusion include that the confession was the product of an unconstitutional arrest [See Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590 (1975); [[Dunaway v. New York]], 442 U.S. 200 (1979)], the confession was obtained in violation of the defendant's sixth amendment right to counsel or the confession was involuntary under the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that immigrants who live in the United States illegally are also protected and should receive their Miranda warnings as well when being interrogated or placed under arrest. \"[[Alien (law)|Aliens]] receive constitutional protections when they have come within the territory of the United States and [have] developed substantial connections with this country\".<ref>Einesman, F: \"Confessions and Culture: The Interaction of Miranda and Diversity\", p. 9. ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', 1999.</ref>\n\nThe Fifth Amendment right to counsel, a component of the ''Miranda'' Rule, is different from the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In the context of the law of confessions the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is defined by the [[Massiah v. United States|Massiah]] Doctrine (''Massiah v. United States'', 377 U.S. 201 (1964)).\n\n==Waiver==\nSimply advising the suspect of their rights does not fully comply with the Miranda rule. The suspect must also voluntarily waive their Miranda rights before questioning can proceed.<ref name=Miranda /> An express waiver is not necessary.<ref>''United States v. Melanson'', 691 F.2d 579 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 856 (1981).</ref> However, most law enforcement agencies use written waiver forms. These include questions designed to establish that the suspect expressly waived their rights. Typical waiver questions are\n* \"Do you understand each of these rights?\" \nand\n* \"Understanding each of these rights, do you now wish to speak to the police without a lawyer being present?\"\n\nThe waiver must be \"knowing and intelligent\" and it must be \"voluntary\". These are separate requirements. To satisfy the first requirement the state must show that the suspect generally understood their rights (right to remain silent and right to counsel) and the consequences of forgoing those rights (that anything they said could be used against them in court). To show that the waiver was \"voluntary\" the state must show that the decision to waive the rights was not the product of police coercion. If police coercion is shown or evident, then the court proceeds to determine the voluntariness of the waiver under the [[totality of the circumstances|totality of circumstances]] test focusing on the personal characteristics of the accused and the particulars of the coercive nature of the police conduct. The ultimate issue is whether the coercive police conduct was sufficient to overcome the will of a person under the totality of the circumstances. As noted previously, courts traditionally focused on two categories of factors in making this determination: (1) the personal characteristics of the suspect and (2) the circumstances attendant to the waiver. However, the Supreme Court significantly altered the voluntariness standard in the case of ''[[Colorado v. Connelly]]''.<ref>479 U.S. 157 (1987)</ref> In ''Connelly'', the Court held that \"Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to a finding that a confession is not 'voluntary' within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"<ref>479 U.S. at 166.</ref> The Court has applied this same standard of voluntariness in determining whether a waiver of a suspect's Fifth Amendment Miranda rights was voluntary. Thus, a waiver of Miranda rights is voluntary unless the defendant can show that their decision to waive their rights and speak to the police was the product of [[police misconduct]] and coercion that overcame the defendant's free will. After ''Connelly'', the traditional totality of circumstances analysis is not even reached unless the defendant can first show such coercion by the police.<ref>Bloom and Brodin, Criminal Procedure 2nd ed. (Little Brown 1986) 250.</ref> Under ''Connelly'', a suspect's decisions need not be the product of rational deliberations.<ref>''[[Moran v. Burbine]]'', 475 U.S.</ref> In addition to showing that the waiver was \"voluntary\", the prosecution must also show that the waiver was \"knowing\" and \"intelligent\". Essentially this means the prosecution must prove that the suspect had a basic understanding of their rights and an appreciation of the consequences of forgoing those rights. The focus of the analysis is directly on the personal characteristics of the suspect. If the suspect was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or suffered from an emotional or mental condition that substantially impaired their capacity to make rational decisions, the courts may well decide that the suspect's waiver was not knowing and intelligent.\n\nA waiver must also be clear and unequivocal. An equivocal statement is ineffective as a waiver and the police may not proceed with the interrogation until the suspect's intentions are made clear. The requirement that a waiver be unequivocal must be distinguished from situations in which the suspect made an equivocal assertion of their Miranda rights after the interrogation began. Any post-waiver assertion of a suspect's Miranda rights must be clear and unequivocal.<ref>''[[Davis v. United States (1994)|Davis v. United States]]'', 512 U.S. 452 (1994)</ref> Any ambiguity or equivocation will be ineffective. If the suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the interrogating officers are permitted to ask questions to clarify the suspect's intentions, although they are not required to.<ref name=\"Davis v. United States 1994\">''Davis v. United States'' (1994)</ref> In other words, if a suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the police may either attempt to clarify the suspect's intentions or they may simply ignore the ineffective assertion and continue with the interrogation.<ref name=\"Davis v. United States 1994\"/> The timing of the assertion is significant. Requesting an attorney prior to arrest is of no consequence because ''Miranda'' applies only to custodial interrogations. The police may simply ignore the request and continue with the questioning; however, the suspect is also free to leave.\n\n==Assertion==\nIf the defendant asserts his right to remain silent all interrogation must immediately stop and the police may not resume the interrogation unless they have \"scrupulously honored\" the defendant's assertion and subsequently obtained a valid waiver before resuming the interrogation.<ref>\"Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear: if the individual indicates, in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point, he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody.\" ''Michigan v. Moseley'', 423 U.S. 96 (1975) quoting ''Miranda v. Arizona'', 384 U. S. 436 (1966) at 384 U.S. 473\u201374. Note the defendant's assertion of their fifth amendment [[right to silence]] cannot be used as substantive evidence of guilt, or to impeach the defendant's testimony. (''Doyle v. Ohio'')</ref> In determining whether the police \"scrupulously honored\" the assertion the courts apply a totality of the circumstances test. The most important factors are the length of time between termination of the original interrogation and the commencement of the second, and issuing a new set of Miranda warnings before resumption of interrogation.\n\nThe consequences of assertion of Sixth Amendment right to counsel are stricter.<ref>A request to speak to a third person who is not an attorney does not invoke right to counsel. ''Fare v. Michael C.'', 442 U.S. 707 (1979)</ref> The police must immediately cease all interrogation and the police cannot reinitiate interrogation unless counsel is present (merely consulting with counsel is insufficient) or the defendant of his own volition contacts the police.<ref>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear ''Maryland v. Shatzer'' to determine how long the protections afforded by the Edwards rule last. [http://www.crimeandconsequences.com/crimblog/2009/01/tackling-edwards-v-arizona-one.html Tackling ''Edwards v. Arizona'' One More Time]</ref> If the defendant does reinitiate contact, a valid waiver must be obtained before interrogation may resume.\n\nIn ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' (2010), the Supreme Court declared in a 5\u20134 decision that criminal defendants who have been read their ''Miranda'' rights (and who have indicated they understand them and have not already waived them), must explicitly state during or before an interrogation begins that they wish to be silent and not speak to police for that protection against self-incrimination to apply. If they speak to police about the incident before invoking the Miranda right to remain silent, or afterwards at any point during the interrogation or detention, the words they speak may be used against them if they have not stated they do not want to speak to police. Those who oppose the ruling contend that the requirement that the defendant must speak to indicate his intention to remain silent further erodes the ability of the defendant to stay completely silent about the case. This opposition must be put in context with the second option offered by the majority opinion, which allowed that the defendant had the option of remaining silent, saying: \"Had he wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation.\" Thus, having been \"Mirandized\", a suspect may avow explicitly the invocation of these rights, or, alternatively, simply remain silent. Absent the former, \"anything [said] can and will be used against [the defendant] in a court of law\".\n\n==Exceptions==\nAssuming that the six factors are present, the Miranda rule would apply unless the prosecution can establish that the statement falls within an exception to the Miranda rule.<ref>The statement of the defendant is admissible when offered by the state as substantive evidence of guilt as an admission of a party opponent. This exception or exemption from the hearsay rules is not available to the defendant\u2014the defendant must resort to some other exception if he attempts to offer his own statement into evidence. Further if the defendant is successful in offering his own statement as substantive evidence, then the defendant is the hearsay declarant and the state can impeach the defendant as it would any other witness including the use of potentially devastating evidence of prior convictions.</ref> The three exceptions are:\n\n# the routine booking question exception<ref>See ''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'', 496 U.S. 582 (1990)</ref>\n# the jail house informant exception\n# the public safety exception.<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649 (1984)</ref>\n\nArguably only the last is a true exception\u2014the first two can better be viewed as consistent with the ''Miranda'' factors. For example, questions that are routinely asked as part of the administrative process of arrest and custodial commitment are not considered \"interrogation\" under Miranda because they are not intended or likely to produce incriminating responses. Nonetheless, all three circumstances are treated as exceptions to the rule. The jail house informant exception applies to situations where the suspect does not know that he is speaking to a state-agent; either a police officer posing as a fellow inmate, a cellmate working as an agent for the state or a family member or friend who has agreed to cooperate with the state in obtaining incriminating information.<ref>See ''Illinois v. Perkins'', 496 U.S. 292 (1990)</ref>\n\n===Public safety exception===\nThe \"public safety\" exception is a limited and case-specific exception, allowing certain unadvised statements (given without Miranda warnings) to be admissible into evidence at trial when they were elicited in circumstances where there was great danger to public safety; thus, the ''Miranda'' rule provides some elasticity.<ref name=\"Stigall, Dan E. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Stigall|first=Dan E.|title=Counterterrorism and the Comparative Law of Investigative Detention|publisher=Cambria|year=2009|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1-60497-618-2}}</ref>\n\nThe public safety exception derives from ''[[New York v. Quarles]]'' (1984), a case in which the Supreme Court considered the admissibility of a statement elicited by a police officer who apprehended a rape suspect who was thought to be carrying a firearm. The arrest took place during the middle of the night in a supermarket that was open to the public but apparently deserted except for the clerks at the checkout counter. When the officer arrested the suspect, he found an empty shoulder holster, handcuffed the suspect, and asked him where the gun was. The suspect nodded in the direction of the gun (which was near some empty cartons) and said, \"The gun is over there\". The Supreme Court found that such an unadvised statement was admissible in evidence because \"[i]n a kaleidoscopic situation such as the one confronting these officers, where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day, the application of the exception we recognize today should not be made to depend on ''[[:wikt:post hoc|post hoc]]'' findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the police officer\".<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649 (1984).</ref> Thus, the jurisprudential rule of ''Miranda'' must yield in \"a situation where concern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in Miranda\".\n\nUnder this exception, to be admissible in the government's direct case at a trial, the questioning must not be \"actually compelled by police conduct which overcame his will to resist\", and must be focused and limited, involving a situation \"in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety\".<ref>Benoit, Carl A.

Once the suspect is formally charged, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel would attach and surreptitious interrogation would be prohibited.<ref name=Massiah>''[[United States v. Massiah]]'', 377 U.S. 201 (1964).</ref> The public safety exception applies where circumstances present a clear and present danger to the public's safety and the officers have reason to believe that the suspect has information that can end the emergency.<ref>''New York v. Quarles'', 467 U.S. 649, 655 (1984).</ref>\n\n==Consequences of violation==\nAssuming that a Miranda violation occurred\u2014the six factors are present and no exception applies\u2014the statement will be subject to suppression under the Miranda exclusionary rule.<ref>A common misconception is that a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights warrants dismissal of the charges. Generally, a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights will not result in dismissal of the charges unless the defendant can show that the violation was especially egregious.</ref> That is, if the defendant objects or files a motion to suppress, the exclusionary rule would prohibit the prosecution from offering the statement as proof of guilt. However, the statement can be used to impeach the defendant's testimony.<ref>The statement must be \"voluntary\" under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. An involuntary statement cannot be used for any purpose.</ref> Further, the [[fruit of the poisonous tree]] doctrine does not apply to Miranda violations.<ref>Note that if the seizure of the defendant violated the fourth amendment any confession that resulted from the seizure would be subject to suppression. For example, an officer stops a defendant because the officer has a \"gut feeling\" that the defendant is driving while impaired. After the stop the officer asks the defendant if he had been drinking and the defendant says: \"Yes\". The officer then arrests the defendant and takes him to the law enforcement center to administer a breathalyzer test. While in the breathalyzer room the officer asks the defendant the questions on his alcohol influence report. The defendant's responses are incriminating. Under this scenario because the initial stop was unconstitutional all evidence that resulted from the stop would be subject to suppression.</ref> Therefore, the exclusionary rule exceptions, attenuation, independent source and inevitable discovery, do not come into play, and derivative evidence would be fully admissible. For example, suppose the police continue with a custodial interrogation after the suspect has asserted his right to silence. During his post-assertion statement the suspect tells the police the location of the gun he used in the murder. Using this information the police find the gun. Forensic testing identifies the gun as the murder weapon, and fingerprints lifted from the gun match the suspect's. The contents of the Miranda-defective statement could not be offered by the prosecution as substantive evidence, but the gun itself and all related forensic evidence could be used as evidence at trial.\n\n===Procedural requirements===\nAlthough the rules vary by jurisdiction, generally a person who wishes to contest the admissibility of evidence<ref>Evidence includes physical evidence, confessions and identification evidence.

United States]]'') prohibits the admission of a confession obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Specifically, the Massiah rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings deliberately elicited by the police from a defendant after formal charges have been filed. The events that trigger the Sixth Amendment safeguards under ''Massiah'' are (1) the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings and (2) deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant a right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are to protect a defendant's right to a fair trial and to assure that the adversarial system of justice functions properly by providing competent counsel as an advocate for the defendant in his contest against the \"prosecutorial forces\" of the state.\n\n====Commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings====\nThe Sixth Amendment right \"attaches\" once the government has committed itself to the prosecution of the case by the initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings \"by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information or arraignment\".<ref>''United States v. Gouveia'', 467 U.S. 180, 187\u201388, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 2297, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984). \"In a line of constitutional cases in this Court stemming back to the Court's landmark opinion in ''Powell v. Alabama'', 287 U.S. 45, it has been firmly established that a person's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him. See ''Powell v. Alabama'', supra; ''Johnson v. Zerbst'', 304 U.S. 458; ''Hamilton v. Alabama'', 368 U.S. 52; ''Gideon v. Wainwright'', 372 U.S. 335; ''White v. Maryland'', 373 U.S. 59; ''Massiah v. United States'', 377 U.S. 201; ''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218; ''Gilbert v. California'', 388 U.S. 263; ''Coleman v. Alabama'', 399 U.S. 1.\" \"... [W]hile members of the Court have differed as to the existence of the right to counsel in the contexts of some of the above cases, all of those cases have involved points of time at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u2014whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\"</ref> Determining whether a particular event or proceeding constitutes the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings requires both an examination of the rules of criminal procedure for the jurisdiction in which the crime is charged and the Supreme Courts cases dealing with the issue of when formal prosecution begins.<ref>''Michigan v. Jackson'', 475 U.S. 625, 632 (1986); see also ''Brewer v. Williams'', 430 U.S. 387, 398 (1977). In ''Maine v. Moulton'' the court stated \"By its very terms, it becomes applicable only when the government's role shifts from investigation to accusation. For it is only then that the assistance of one versed in the intricacies ... of law,\" ibid., is needed to assure that the prosecution's case encounters \"the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing\". The Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach until such time as the \"government has committed itself to prosecute, and ... the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified ...'\" ''Kirby v. Illinois'', 406 U. S. 689 (1972).</ref> Once adversarial criminal proceedings commence the right to counsel applies to all critical stages of the prosecution and investigation. A critical stage is \"any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel's absence might derogate from the accused's right to a fair trial\".<ref>''United States v. Wade'', 388 U.S. 218, 226, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1932, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); see also, ''United States v. Hidalgo'', 7 F.3d 1566 (11th Cir. 1993). Under the critical stage analysis, virtually every phase of the criminal trial is a critical stage. Additionally courts have generally held that pretrial hearings regarding conditions of pretrial release and suppression of evidence are considered critical stages. ''Smith v. Lockhart'', 923 F.2d 1314 (8th Cir. 1991) on the other hand courts have generally held that certain pre-trial post accusation investigative procedures are not critical stages. Analysis of fingerprints, blood samples, clothing, hair, handwriting, and voice samples have all been ruled to be noncritical stages. FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, (2001)</ref>\n\nGovernment attempts to obtain incriminating statement related to the offense charged from the defendant by overt interrogation or surreptitious means is a critical stage and any information thus obtained is subject to suppression unless the government can show that an attorney was present or the defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel.<ref>''Brewer v. Williams'', 97 S. Ct. 1232 (1977) \"That the incriminating statements were elicited surreptitiously in the ''Massiah'' case, and otherwise here, is constitutionally irrelevant. See ibid.; ''McLeod v.

Perkins'', 496 U.S. 292 (1990).</ref> Clearly express questioning (interrogation) would qualify but the concept also extends to surreptitious attempts to acquire information from the defendant through the use of undercover agents or paid informants.<ref>''Massiah'' does not prohibit the government's use of a cellmate as a \"silent listening post\"\u2014a person who is simply placed in a position to hear any incriminating statements the defendant might make about the charged offense but who does not do anything to coax or induce the defendant to talk about the charged crime. Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436 (1986).</ref>\n\nThe definition of \"deliberate elicitation\" is not the same as the definition of \"interrogation\" under the Miranda rule. Miranda interrogation includes express questioning and any actions or statements that an officer would reasonably foresee as likely to cause an incriminating response. Massiah applies to express questioning and any attempt to deliberately and intentionally obtain incriminating information from the defendant regarding the crime charged. The difference is purposeful creation of an environment likely to produce incriminating information (Massiah) and action likely to induce an incriminating response even if that was not the officer's purpose or intent (Miranda).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific&nbsp;\u2013 the right only applies to post-commencement attempts to obtain information relating to the crime charged.<ref>''McNeil v. Wisconsin'', 111 S. Ct. 2204 (1991). Lower federal courts has extended the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to factually related offenses. In Texas v. Cobb, the Supreme Court made clear that the right to counsel applied only to the crime charged and did not apply to attempts to gather information about \"other offenses 'closely related factually' to the charged offense\". ''Texas v. Cobb'', 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001).</ref> The right does not extend to uncharged offenses if factually related to the charged crime.<ref>''Texas v. Cobb'', 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001).</ref>\n\nAs noted, information obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is subject to suppression unless the government can establish that the defendant waived his right to counsel. The waiver must be knowing, intelligent and voluntary.<ref>''Brewer v. Williams'', 430 U.S. 387 (1977)</ref> A valid Miranda waiver operates as a waiver of Sixth Amendment right.\n\n====Miranda and Massiah compared====\n# ''' Constitutional basis''':\n#* Miranda is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\n#* Massiah is based on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n# '''Attachment''':\n#* Miranda: Custody + interrogation (charging status irrelevant).\n#* Massiah: Formally charged + deliberate elicitation (custodial status irrelevant).\n# '''Scope''':\n#*a.

Massiah: interrogation + \"deliberate elicitation\"\n# '''Waiver''': Both Miranda and Massiah rights may be waived.\n# '''Assertion''': In each case, the assertion must be clear and unequivocal. The effects of assertion are not identical. For purposes of Miranda, the police must immediately cease the interrogation and cannot resume interrogating the defendant about any offense charged or uncharged unless counsel is present or defendant initiates contact for purposes of resuming interrogation and valid waiver obtained. Because Massiah is offense-specific, an assertion of the sixth amendment right to counsel requires the police to cease interrogating the defendant about any charged offense. Apparently the police could continue questioning the defendant about uncharged crimes assuming that the defendant was not in custody. The defendant's remedy would be to leave or to refuse to answer questions.<ref>Under ''Michigan v. Jackson'', a defendant's request for counsel at a preliminary hearing constituted an assertion of his sixth amendment right to counsel. However, ''Michigan v. Jackson'' was overruled by ''Montejo v. Louisiana .''</ref>\n# '''Remedy for violation''': The remedy for violation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel is identical: the statements and testimonial information are subject to suppression. Derivative evidence is not subject to suppression under Miranda&nbsp;\u2013 fruit of poisonous tree doctrine may apply to Massiah violation.<ref>''Fellers v. United States'', 124 S.Ct. 1019 (2004)</ref> Both Miranda and Massiah defective statements can be used for impeachment purposes.\n# '''Exceptions''': The primary exceptions to Miranda are (1) the routine booking questions exception (2) the jail house informant exception and (3) the public safety exception. In ''Moulton v. Maine'' the Supreme Court refused to recognize a public safety exception to the Massiah rule.<ref>474 U.S. 159 (1989)</ref> Massiah allows for the use of jail house informants provided the informants serve merely as \"passive listeners\".<ref>The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide another basis for challenging the admissibility of confessions. The test is whether the statement was \"voluntary\". A statement is not voluntary if it was the product of police misconduct. That is a due process claim requires that the defendant establish that there was police misconduct and that this misconduct induced the confession. The \"voluntariness\" test is implicated in any police interrogation\u2014neither Miranda \"custody\" or Massiah \"commencement of formal criminal proceedings\" is a necessary conditions (state action is required). Further, there are no issues of waiver or assertion. Finally the remedy is complete\u2014an involuntary statement cannot be used for any purpose.</ref>\n\n===The voluntariness standard===\nThe voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and regardless of whether the suspect has been formally charged. The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement. The statement cannot be used as either substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's testimony.<ref>Originally Miranda was regarded as a \"prophylactic\" rule\u2014the rule itself was not a constitutional right but a \" judicially\u2013created enforcement mechanism\" devised to protect the underlying constitutional rights. In Dickerson v. United States, the Court \"constitutionalized\" the Miranda rule\u2014although the decision did not perforce change the rule concerning the use of a Miranda-defective statement for impeachment purposes.</ref> The reason for the strictness is the common law's aversion to the use of coerced confessions because of their inherent unreliability. Further the rights to be free from coerced confession cannot be waived nor is it necessary that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right. In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court's decision in ''Colorado v. Connelly''.<ref>''Colorado v. Connelly'', 479 U.S. 157 (1986)</ref> Although federal courts' application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case, Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard. Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances.<ref>See ''Mincey v. Arizona'', 437 U.S. 385 (1978); ''Greenwald v. Wisconsin'', 390 U. S. 519, 390 U.S. 521 (1968) (\"Considering the totality of these circumstances, we do not think it credible that petitioner's statements were the product of his free and rational choice\"); Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 367 U.S. 440 (1961) (\"If [a defendant's will was overborne], the confession cannot be deemed 'the product of a rational intellect and a free will'\")</ref> \"Voluntary\" carried its everyday meaning: the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant's free will rather than police coercion.<ref>See e.g., ''Culombe v. Connecticut'', 367 U.S. 568, 367 U.S. 583 (1961) (\"[A]n extrajudicial confession, if it was to be offered in evidence against a man, must be the product of his own free choice\")</ref> After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct.<ref>Bloom & Brodin, ''Criminal Procedure'' (Aspen 1996) at 247.</ref> Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession.<ref>Bloom & Brodin, ''Criminal Procedure'' (Aspen 1996)</ref>\n\n===State constitutional challenges===\nEvery state constitution has articles and provision guaranteeing individual rights.<ref>Latzer, ''State Constitutions and Criminal Justice'' (Greenwood 1991)</ref> In most cases the subject matter is similar to the federal bill of rights.<ref>Id. at 2. This similarity is hardly surprising since the federal constitution and many state constitutions had common sources the state constitutions of some of the more important states such as Virginia.</ref> Most state courts interpretation of their constitution is consistent with the interpretation federal court's of analogous provisions of the federal constitution. With regard to Miranda issues, state courts have exhibited significant resistance to incorporating into their state jurisprudence some of the limitations on the Miranda rule that have been created by the federal courts.<ref>Id. at 89\u201391.</ref> As a consequence a defendant may be able to circumvent the federal limitation on the Miranda rule and successfully challenge the admissibility under state constitutional provisions. Practically every aspect of the Miranda rule has drawn state court criticism. However the primary point of contention involve the following limitations on the scope of the Miranda rule: (1) the Harris exception<ref>In ''Harris'' the United States Supreme Court allowed a Miranda-defective statement to be used to impeach the trial testimony of a defendant. Note the Harris rule does not permit the use of a statement that fails to meet the voluntariness standards of the due process clause to be used for any purpose. The basis for the distinction is that a Miranda-defective statement does not raise the questions of unreliability as does an involuntary statement.</ref> (2) the Burbine rule<ref>In ''Moran v. Burbine'', 475 U.S. 412 (1986) the Court held that officers are not required to tell a suspect in custody that third parties had retained an attorney for the suspect. The failure of the police to inform the suspect of this fact did not render the waiver involuntary. ''Burbine'' decision was not well-received by the state courts. Six states specifically rejected the Burbine rule.</ref> and (3) the Fare rule.<ref>id. at 91\u201398. The specific holding in Fare was that a juvenile's request to have his probation officer present during an interrogation was not an invocation of the juvenile's right to counsel. The Supreme Court stated that juveniles were essentially to be treated the same as adults for the purposes of Miranda. Many states adopted special rules concerning police interrogation of juveniles not true</ref>\n\n===State statutory challenges===\nIn addition to constitutionally based challenge, states permit a defendant to challenge the admissibility of a confession on the grounds that the confession was obtained in violation of a defendant's statutory rights. For example, North Carolina Criminal Procedure Act permits a defendant to move to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a \"substantial\" violation of the provision of the North Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n==Confusion regarding use==\nDue to the prevalence of American television programs and motion pictures in which the police characters frequently read suspects their rights, it has become an expected element of arrest procedure\u2014in the 2000 ''Dickerson'' decision, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] wrote that Miranda warnings had \"become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture\".<ref>''[[Dickerson v. United States]]'' {{ussc|530|428|2000}}.</ref>\n\nWhile arrests and interrogations can legally occur without the Miranda warning being given, this procedure would generally make the arrestee's pre-Miranda statements inadmissible at trial. (However, pursuant to the plurality opinion in ''[[United States v. Patane]]'', physical evidence obtained as a result of pre-Miranda statements may still be admitted. There was no majority opinion of the Court in that case.)\n\nIn some jurisdictions,{{where|date=July 2011}} a ''detention'' differs at law from an ''arrest'', and police are not required to give the Miranda warning until the person is arrested for a crime. In those situations, a person's statements made to police are generally admissible even though the person was not advised of their rights. Similarly, statements made while an arrest is in progress before the Miranda warning was given or completed are also generally admissible.\n\nBecause ''Miranda'' applies only to custodial interrogations, it does not protect detainees from standard booking questions such as name and address. Because it is a protective measure intended to safeguard the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, it does not prevent the police from taking blood without a warrant from persons suspected of [[Drunk driving (United States)|driving under the influence of alcohol]]. (Such evidence may be self-incriminatory, but are not considered statements of self-incrimination.)\n\nIf an inmate is in jail and invoked ''Miranda'' on one case, it is unclear whether this extends to any other cases that they may be charged with while in custody. For example: a subject is arrested, charged with cattle rustling, and is held in county jail awaiting trial. He invoked his Miranda rights on the cow case. While in custody, he is involved in a fight where a staff member loses his ability to walk. He speaks to the custodial staff regarding the fight without staff first invoking Miranda. It is unclear if this statement is admissible because of the original Miranda statement.\n\nMany police departments give special training to interrogators with regard to the Miranda warning; specifically, how to influence a suspect's decision to waive the right. For instance, the officer may be required to specifically ask if the rights are understood and if the suspect wishes to talk. The officer is allowed, before asking the suspect a question, to speak at length about evidence collected, witness statements, etc. The officer will ''then'' ask if the suspect wishes to talk, and the suspect is then more likely to talk in an attempt to refute the evidence presented. Another tactic commonly taught is never to ask a question; the officer may simply sit the suspect down in an interrogation room, sit across from him and do paperwork, and wait for the suspect to begin talking.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724033316/http://www.regent.edu/admin/media/schlaw/LawPreview/ Prof. James Duane and Officer George Bruch \u2013 Fifth Amendment Lecture at Regent University].</ref> These tactics are intended to mitigate the restrictions placed on law officers against compelling a suspect to give evidence, and have stood up in court as valid lawful tactics. Nevertheless, such tactics are condemned by legal rights groups as deceptive.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n===Exemption for interrogations conducted by undercover agents===\nIn ''Illinois v. Perkins'', 496 U.S. 292 (1990), the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that undercover officers do not have to give suspects a ''Miranda'' warning prior to asking questions that may elicit incriminating responses. In this case, an undercover agent posed as an inmate and carried on a 35-minute conversation with another inmate that he suspected of committing a murder that was being investigated. During this conversation, the suspect implicated himself in the murder that the undercover agent was investigating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/496/292 |title=Supreme.justia.com |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court came to this conclusion despite the government's admission that a custodial interrogation had been conducted by a government agent.\n\n===Report of warnings being given to detainees in Afghanistan===\nBeginning in 2009, some detainees captured in [[Afghanistan]] have been read their Miranda rights by the [[FBI]], according to Congressman [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Michael Rogers]] of Michigan, who claims to have witnessed this himself. According to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], \"There has been no policy change nor blanket instruction for FBI agents to Mirandize detainees overseas. While there have been specific cases in which FBI agents have Mirandized suspects overseas at both Bagram and in other situations, in order to preserve the quality of evidence obtained, there has been no overall policy change with respect to detainees.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/06/10/lawmaker-says-obama-ordered-fbi-read-rights-detainees/ |title=U.S. Lawmaker Says Obama Administration Ordered FBI to Read Rights to Detainees |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822082506/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/06/10/lawmaker-says-obama-ordered-fbi-read-rights-detainees/ |archivedate=August 22, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2009/06/miranda_rights_for_terrorists.asp|title=Miranda Rights for Terrorists|magazine=The Weekly Standard|date=June 10, 2009|accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>\n\n==Equivalent rights in other countries==\n{{main|Right to silence}}\nWhether arising from their constitutions, common law, or statute, many nations recognize a defendant's [[right to silence]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Anthony|title=The Right to Silence: Using American and European Law to Protect a Fundamental Right|journal=New Criminal Law Review|date=Fall 2013|volume=16|issue=4|pages=527\u2013567|url=https://eprints.usq.edu.au/24108/7/Gray_NCLR_v16n4_PV.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Miranda Warning Equivalents Abroad|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/miranda-warning-equivalents-abroad/index.php|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=27 July 2017|date=May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arrest]]\n* [[Civil rights]]\n* [[Criminal justice]]\n* [[Garrity Warning]]\n* [[Joe Jacquot]]\n* [[Kalkines Warning]]\n* [[Right to silence]]\n* [[Uniform Code of Military Justice#Pre-trial procedure|Uniform Code of Military Justice]]\n* [[United States constitutional criminal procedure]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Coldrey, J.

{"title_page": "Tables, ladders, and chairs match", "text_new": "{{redirect|Tables, Ladders and Chairs|the pay-per-view event named after this match|WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs}}\n{{short description|Professional wrestling match type}}\nA '''tables, ladders, and chairs match''', often abbreviated as '''TLC''', is a type of [[professional wrestling]] match that originated within the World Wrestling Federation (now known as the [[WWE]]).\n\nThe TLC match is a variation of a [[ladder match]], which is modified to co-emphasize two other weapons: tables and chairs. The goal is to acquire the item (usually championship belts) which starts the match suspended above the ring. A TLC match can be seen as a more complicated ladder match, where tables and chairs, along with ladders, can also be used as legal foreign objects.\n\nAnother TLC match that could also exist as a variation of a [[hardcore wrestling|hardcore match]], where tables, ladders, and chairs can also be used as legal foreign objects, but the only way to win this variation of the TLC match is by pinfall or submission.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe match originates around the tag teams of [[The Dudley Boyz]], [[The Hardy Boyz]], and [[Edge and Christian]]. The particular weapons of tables, ladders and chairs were seen as unique to each team's style. The Hardys were seen as high-flying daredevils with a penchant for using ladders, and a key element to the Dudley Boyz gimmick was their flagrant use of tables as weapons. Edge and Christian became notable for using steel chairs in tandem against opponents.\n\n== WWF/WWE ==\nWorld Wrestling Federation created and adapted the matches to make it known today as a TLC match. The idea of the TLC match in WWF had its origins in a tag team ladder match for the managerial services of [[Terri Runnels]] between [[Edge and Christian]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Matt Hardy]] and [[Jeff Hardy]]), at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy 1999]], with the audience giving all four wrestlers a [[standing ovation]] at the end of the match. The move catapulted both tag teams to the top of the tag team world. The following months had The Hardy Boyz face [[The Dudley Boyz]], ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[D-Von Dudley]]), in a tag-team [[Professional wrestling match types#Tables match|Tables match]], which had similar success.\n\nThe three teams would be known for their three respective foreign objects, as well as the hardcore wrestling styles associated therein: the Dudley Boyz often used tables, the Hardy Boyz, in singles matches, challenged main-event singles wrestlers (such as [[The Undertaker]]) in ladder matches, considered at that time to be the \"signature match\" of the team (as they were both high-flyers, they specialized with [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Spot|high spots]], and doing them off the top of ladders amplified their effectiveness), while Edge and Christian developed the \"con-chair-to\", which involved the two hitting an opponent's head simultaneously, on opposite sides, with chairs. Eventually, the three teams were brought together in a triangle ladder match at [[WrestleMania 2000]], in what was the forerunner of the TLC in terms of the spots involved (tables were involved in some of the major spots, even though it was technically a ladder match).\n[[File:Hardyz, Dudleyz, E&C crop.jpg|thumb|left|The participants in the first TLC match. From left to right: [[Jeff Hardy]], [[Matt Hardy]], [[Bubba Ray Dudley]], [[D-Von Dudley]], [[Jason Reso|Christian]], and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]]]\nThe first official TLC match was contested between these three teams using the weapons that they had made famous at [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam 2000]]. These matches frequently involved members of these three teams, and are largely remembered for the dangerous stunts, injuries and length. The second TLC match happened at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] the following year, which also sprung the infamous Swanton bomb off a 16-ft ladder by Jeff Hardy on Rhyno and Spike Dudley and Edge spearing Jeff Hardy from a 20-ft ladder. These matches involved the three aforementioned teams, with each having Edge and Christian winning. TLC III on the May 24, 2001 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' saw the tag team of [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Chris Benoit]] defend their tag team championship against the usual other three tag teams.\n\nIn the fourth TLC match on the October 7, 2002 episode of ''Raw'', four tag teams had drawn, as a result of \"[[WWE Raw|Raw roulette]]\" (where the match type of every match of the card was determined by spinning a wheel), a TLC match. The match saw defending champions [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] putting their World Tag Team titles up against the teams of Christian and Chris Jericho, Bubba Ray Dudley and [[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]], and Jeff Hardy and [[Rob Van Dam]]. Being the veterans that they were to the match itself, general manager [[Eric Bischoff]] allowed Hardy, Christian and Dudley to choose their own partners, as their former partners [[Matt Hardy]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]] were unavailable as [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] wrestlers.\n\nOn the January 16, 2006 episode of ''Raw'', WWE held its fifth TLC match, the first in over three years. Edge successfully defended his [[WWE Championship]] against [[Ric Flair]]. It was the first TLC match to be held in singles competition and the first to have the WWE Championship on the line. TLC VI at [[Unforgiven (2006)|Unforgiven 2006]] saw [[John Cena]] winning the WWE Championship from Edge. TLC VII was held at [[One Night Stand (2008)|One Night Stand 2008]] saw Edge winning the vacant [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], defeating [[The Undertaker]] and ([[kayfabe]]) banishing him from WWE. TLC VIII  at [[SummerSlam (2009)|SummerSlam 2009]] saw [[CM Punk]] winning the World Heavyweight Championship from TLC veteran Jeff Hardy. This marked the first time Jeff Hardy had participated in a singles TLC match.\n\nIn December 2009, WWE introduced [[WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs|TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs]] as a new [[pay-per-view]] event, which included a tables match, a ladder match, a match in which chairs were legal as weapons and, as the main event, a TLC match. TLC IX in the [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2009)|2009 event]] pitted [[Chris Jericho]] and The [[Big Show]] against [[D-Generation X]] ([[Triple H]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]) for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Unified WWE Tag Team Championship]]. This was the first TLC match to not include any member from the three original teams.\n\nA year later, at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2010)|TLC 2010]], the TLC match, for the first time, was a [[professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|fatal four-way]]. The match pitted [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Rey Mysterio]] and [[Alberto Del Rio]] against each other for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. In the end, Edge won the title. This was also Edge's last TLC match because of his retirement in early April the following year.\n\nThe next year at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2011)|TLC 2011]], CM Punk defended his WWE Championship in a first-ever [[professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat]] TLC match against Alberto Del Rio and The Miz.  Punk retained the championship, and this marked the second time that all three competitors had competed in a TLC match.\n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2012)|TLC 2012]], [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] ([[Dean Ambrose]], [[Seth Rollins]], and [[Roman Reigns]]) fought [[Ryback (wrestler)|Ryback]] and [[Team Hell No]] (Kane and [[Daniel Bryan]]).<ref name=\"TLC2012_TheShield_RybackHellNo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwetlc/2012/mr-mcmahon-issues-statement-regarding-injured-punk-wwe-tlc-26073769|title=Mr. McMahon issues statement regarding injured Punk, WWE TLC|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> This was the first TLC match to contain teams of three and was the first TLC match for everyone involved except Kane. It was the first TLC match decided by pinfall or submission and the first in which all the weapons would have to be retrieved from under the ring.\n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2013)|TLC 2013]], WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena in a TLC match for both the WWE and World Heavyweight titles. Orton won to become the first WWE World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nAt [[Extreme Rules (2014)]], a \"WeeLC match\" was contested between El Torito and Hornswoggle, the first TLC match to involve midget wrestlers and the second to be decided by pinfall or submission.\n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2014)|TLC 2014]] [[Bray Wyatt]] defeated Dean Ambrose in the 17th TLC Match. This was also the third TLC match in which victory would be achieved by pinfall or submission. \n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2015)|TLC 2015]], [[Sheamus]] retained the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Roman Reigns in the 18th TLC Match.\n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2016)|TLC 2016]], [[A.J. Styles|AJ Styles]] retained the WWE World Championship against Dean Ambrose in the 19th TLC Match.\n\n[[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2017)|TLC 2017]] marked the 20th TLC Match. Originally scheduled to feature the reunited Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns) against the team of The Miz, [[Braun Strowman]], Kane and [[Cesaro and Sheamus]], Reigns was removed from the match due to a legitimate illness. [[Kurt Angle]] replaced Reigns, making the match Angle's first in WWE since 2006. This was the first handicap TLC Match and the fourth decided by pinfall or submission.\n\nOn the December 10, 2018 episode of ''Raw'' Seth Rollins defended the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] in a TLC match against [[Baron Corbin]]. A few days later, [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2018)|TLC 2018]] marked the first women's TLC Match, as [[Becky Lynch]] lost the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] to [[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] in a match also involving [[Charlotte Flair]]. Also, Braun Strowman defeated Baron Corbin in a TLC Match, thereby earning a [[WWE Universal Championship]] match at the ''[[Royal Rumble (2019)|Royal Rumble]]'' and stripping Corbin of all authoritative power.\n\n=== Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Match\n!Stipulations\n!Event\n!Date\n!Location\n!Length\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|[[Edge and Christian]] (c) defeated [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Matt Hardy]] and [[Jeff Hardy]]) and [[The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[D-Von Dudley]])\n|{{small|[[Triple threat match|Triple threat]] [[Tag team match|tag team]] TLC match for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]]}}\n|[[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]]\n|August 27, 2000\n|[[Raleigh, North Carolina]]\n|14:51\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|[[Edge and Christian]] defeated [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Matt Hardy]] and [[Jeff Hardy]]) and [[The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[D-Von Dudley]]) (c)\n|{{small|[[Triple threat match|Triple threat]] [[Tag team match|tag team]] TLC match for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]]}}\n|[[WrestleMania X-Seven]]\n|April 1, 2001\n|[[Houston|Houston, Texas]]\n|15:53\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|[[Chris Jericho]] and [[Chris Benoit]] (c) defeated [[Edge and Christian]], [[The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[D-Von Dudley]]) and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Matt Hardy]] and [[Jeff Hardy]])\n|{{small|[[Fatal 4-way match|Fatal 4-way]] [[Tag team match|tag team]] TLC match for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]]}}\n|''[[WWF SmackDown]]''\n|May 24, 2001\n|[[Anaheim, California]]\n|21:00\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|[[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] (c) defeated [[The Dudley Boyz]] ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[Spike Dudley]]), [[Christian Cage|Christian]]  and [[Chris Jericho]], and [[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Rob Van Dam]]\n|{{small|[[Fatal 4-way match|Fatal 4-way]] [[Tag team match|tag team]] TLC match for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]]}}\n|''[[WWE Raw]] Roulette''\n|October 7, 2002\n|[[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]]\n|25:08\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|[[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] (c) defeated [[Ric Flair]]\n|{{small|[[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles]] TLC match for the [[WWE Championship]]}}\n|[[WWE Raw|''Raw'']]\n|January 16, 2006\n|[[Raleigh, North Carolina]]\n|16:40\n|-\n|align=center|6\n|[[John Cena]] defeated [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] (c)\n|{{small|[[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles]] TLC match for the [[WWE Championship]]}}\n|[[Unforgiven (2006)|Unforgiven]]\n|September 17, 2006\n|[[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]]\n|25:28\n|-\n|align=center|7\n|[[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[The Undertaker]]\n|{{small|[[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles]] TLC match for the [[Vacant (professional wrestling)|vacant]] [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]}};

Predating the TLC matches, two \"Tables and Ladders matches\" took place. These were traditional matches won by pinfall or submission, not by climbing the ladder for the belts. However, the term \"TLC\" itself was trademarked by WWE, thus other promotions give different names to these types of matches despite having an identical setup. In more hardcore-style promotions, the chairs were often replaced, or were used alongside, chains. One example of a variation of the TLC match is the Tables, Ladders, Chairs, and Canes match. This match is a TLC match with the addition of [[Shinai|Singapore Canes]]. The first and only TLC match was at [[Guilty as Charged (2001)|Guilty as Charged]] on January 7, 2001 at the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]] in [[New York City|New York, New York]], involving [[Steve Corino]], [[Justin Credible]], and [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]].\n\n==== Tables and Ladders/Tables, Ladders, Chairs and Canes matches ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Match\n!Stipulations\n!Event\n!Date\n!Location\n!Length\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|[[The Eliminators]] ([[Perry Saturn]] and [[John Kronus]]) (c) defeated [[Sabu and Rob Van Dam]]\n|{{small|[[Tag team match|Tag team]] Tables & Ladders match for the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]]}}\n|[[CyberSlam (1997)|CyberSlam]]\n|February 22, 1997\n|[[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n|20:40\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|[[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] defeated [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]]\n|{{small|Tables & Ladders match}}\n|[[November to Remember (1997)|November to Remember]]\n|November 30, 1997\n|[[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n|20:55\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|[[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] defeated [[Steve Corino]] (c) and [[Justin Credible]]\n|{{small|[[Three-way match|Three-way]] Tables, Ladders, Chairs, & Canes match for the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]]}}\n|[[Guilty as Charged (2001)|Guilty as Charged]]\n|January 7, 2001\n|[[New York City|New York, New York]]\n|13:20\n|}\n\n==== Participant list ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Wrestler\n!Victories\n!Appearances\n|-\n|Perry Saturn\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|John Kronus\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|Sabu\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|The Sandman\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|Rob Van Dam\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Steve Corino\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Justin Credible\n|0\n|1\n|}\n\n=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling/Impact Wrestling ===\nTNA Wrestling used a variation of the TLC match called Full Metal Mayhem as a bout between [[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] at [[Against All Odds (2005)|Against All Odds 2005]]. The added stipulation to the match was that \"anything metal is legal\", which also included Abyss's trademark chain and bag of tacks.\n\nAbyss defeated [[Jeff Hardy]] by climbing the ladder to retrieve a contract for a shot at the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] on a future episode of ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|TNA Impact!]]''. Abyss was never granted such title shot, and the story was [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] to state he lost his title shot to [[A.J. Styles]] at [[Lockdown (2005)|Lockdown]], even though the shot Styles won was used at [[Hardcore Justice|Hard Justice]] and not on Impact!, though Abyss would later get title shots at [[Slammiversary (2005)|Slammiversary]] and [[No Surrender (2005)|No Surrender]] that year.\n\nTNA used the \"Full Metal Mayhem\" match again at [[Sacrifice (2006)|Sacrifice 2006]] on May 14, 2006 when Abyss went one on one with [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian Cage]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. Cage defeated Abyss to retain the championship.\n\nIt made its third appearance at [[Victory Road (2008)|Victory Road]] in 2008, in a 6-man tag team match featuring [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian Cage]], [[A.J. Styles]] and [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]] against [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]], where Angle pinned Styles to win the match for his team.\n\nTNA held the fourth \"Full Metal Mayhem\" match at [[Bound for Glory (2009)|Bound for Glory 2009]], in which four tag teams ([[The British Invasion (professional wrestling)|The British Invasion]], [[Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]], [[Scott Steiner]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] and [[Beer Money, Inc.]]) competed for both the [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]] and the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]]. The British Invasion grabbed the TNA World Tag Team Championships whilst Team 3D got the IWGP Tag Team Championships.\n\nOn December 5, 2010, at [[Final Resolution (2010)|Final Resolution]], [[The Motor City Machine Guns]] ([[Alex Shelley]] and [[Chris Sabin]]) defeated [[The Young Bucks|Generation Me]] (Max and Jeremy Buck) to successfully retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship in the fifth \"Full Metal Mayhem\" match.\n\nOn October 16, 2011, at [[Bound for Glory (2011)|Bound for Glory]], [[Rob Van Dam]] defeated [[Jerry Lynn]] in the sixth \"Full Metal Mayhem\" match.\n\nThe seventh edition of the Full Metal Mayhem match occurred on the April 11, 2013 edition of ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]''. It is the first such match not aired on [[pay-per-view]] and also the first Full Metal Mayhem match to decide the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]]. Jeff Hardy was challenging for Bully Ray's championship in a rematch from [[Lockdown (2013)]]. Ray was victorious after sending Hardy through a table from atop the ladder and claiming the belt.\n\nThe November 7, 2013 edition of Full Metal Mayhem match was decided by \"The Wheel of Dixie\", a roulette that determined the match type for all participants in the qualifying tournament for TNA World Heavyweight Title.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61KVp5jl6RM How Will Dixie Carter Decide the Match Types in The Heavyweight Title Tournament? - Oct. 31, 2013</ref>  On November 7, 2013, Jeff Hardy pinned Chris Sabin to win the first round bout.\n\n==== Full Metal Mayhem matches ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Match\n!Stipulations\n!Event\n!Date\n!Location\n!Length\n|-\n|align=center| 1\n|[[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] defeated [[Jeff Hardy]]\n|{{small|Full Metal Mayhem match for a shot at the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] on a future episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]''.}}\n|[[Against All Odds (2005)|Against All Odds]]\n|February 13, 2005\n|[[Orlando, Florida]]\n|15:21\n|-\n|align=center| 2\n|[[Christian Cage]] (c) defeated [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]]\n|{{small|Full Metal Mayhem match for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].}}\n|[[Sacrifice (2006)|Sacrifice]]\n|May 14, 2006\n|[[Orlando, Florida]]\n|26:01\n|-\n|align=center| 3\n|[[Team 3D]] ([[Bubba Ray Dudley|Brother Ray]] & [[Brother Devon]]) and [[Kurt Angle]] defeated [[Christian Cage]], [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]] and [[A.J.

The goal is to acquire the item (usually championship belts) which starts the match suspended above the ring. A TLC match can be seen as a more complicated ladder match, where tables and chairs, along with ladders, can also be used as legal foreign objects.\n\nAnother TLC match that could also exist as a variation of a [[hardcore wrestling|hardcore match]], where tables, ladders, and chairs can also be used as legal foreign objects, but the only way to win this variation of the TLC match is by pinfall or submission.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe match originates around the tag teams of [[The Dudley Boyz]], [[The Hardy Boyz]], and [[Edge and Christian]]. The particular weapons of tables, ladders and chairs were seen as unique to each team's style. The Hardys were seen as high-flying daredevils with a penchant for using ladders, and a key element to the Dudley Boyz gimmick was their flagrant use of tables as weapons. Edge and Christian became notable for using steel chairs in tandem against opponents.\n\n== WWF/WWE ==\nWorld Wrestling Federation created and adapted the matches to make it known today as a TLC match. The idea of the TLC match in WWF had its origins in a tag team ladder match for the managerial services of [[Terri Runnels]] between [[Edge and Christian]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Matt Hardy]] and [[Jeff Hardy]]), at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy 1999]], with the audience giving all four wrestlers a [[standing ovation]] at the end of the match. The move catapulted both tag teams to the top of the tag team world. The following months had The Hardy Boyz face [[The Dudley Boyz]], ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[D-Von Dudley]]), in a tag-team [[Professional wrestling match types#Tables match|Tables match]], which had similar success.\n\nThe three teams would be known for their three respective foreign objects, as well as the hardcore wrestling styles associated therein: the Dudley Boyz often used tables, the Hardy Boyz, in singles matches, challenged main-event singles wrestlers (such as [[The Undertaker]]) in ladder matches, considered at that time to be the \"signature match\" of the team (as they were both high-flyers, they specialized with [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Spot|high spots]], and doing them off the top of ladders amplified their effectiveness), while Edge and Christian developed the \"con-chair-to\", which involved the two hitting an opponent's head simultaneously, on opposite sides, with chairs. Eventually, the three teams were brought together in a triangle ladder match at [[WrestleMania 2000]], in what was the forerunner of the TLC in terms of the spots involved (tables were involved in some of the major spots, even though it was technically a ladder match).\n[[File:Hardyz, Dudleyz, E&C crop.jpg|thumb|left|The participants in the first TLC match. From left to right: [[Jeff Hardy]], [[Matt Hardy]], [[Bubba Ray Dudley]], [[D-Von Dudley]], [[Jason Reso|Christian]], and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]]]\nThe first official TLC match was contested between these three teams using the weapons that they had made famous at [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam 2000]]. These matches frequently involved members of these three teams, and are largely remembered for the dangerous stunts, injuries and length. The second TLC match happened at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] the following year, which also sprung the infamous Swanton bomb off a 16-ft ladder by Jeff Hardy on Rhyno and Spike Dudley and Edge spearing Jeff Hardy from a 20-ft ladder. These matches involved the three aforementioned teams, with each having Edge and Christian winning. TLC III on the May 24, 2001 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' saw the tag team of [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Chris Benoit]] defend their tag team championship against the usual other three tag teams.\n\nIn the fourth TLC match on the October 7, 2002 episode of ''Raw'', four tag teams had drawn, as a result of \"[[WWE Raw|Raw roulette]]\" (where the match type of every match of the card was determined by spinning a wheel), a TLC match. The match saw defending champions [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] putting their World Tag Team titles up against the teams of Christian and Chris Jericho, Bubba Ray Dudley and [[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]], and Jeff Hardy and [[Rob Van Dam]]. Being the veterans that they were to the match itself, general manager [[Eric Bischoff]] allowed Hardy, Christian and Dudley to choose their own partners, as their former partners [[Matt Hardy]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]] were unavailable as [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] wrestlers.\n\nOn the January 16, 2006 episode of ''Raw'', WWE held its fifth TLC match, the first in over three years. Edge successfully defended his [[WWE Championship]] against [[Ric Flair]]. It was the first TLC match to be held in singles competition and the first to have the WWE Championship on the line. TLC VI at [[Unforgiven (2006)|Unforgiven 2006]] saw [[John Cena]] winning the WWE Championship from Edge. TLC VII was held at [[One Night Stand (2008)|One Night Stand 2008]] saw Edge winning the vacant [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], defeating [[The Undertaker]] and ([[kayfabe]]) banishing him from WWE. TLC VIII  at [[SummerSlam (2009)|SummerSlam 2009]] saw [[CM Punk]] winning the World Heavyweight Championship from TLC veteran Jeff Hardy. This marked the first time Jeff Hardy had participated in a singles TLC match.\n\nIn December 2009, WWE introduced [[WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs|TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs]] as a new [[pay-per-view]] event, which included a tables match, a ladder match, a match in which chairs were legal as weapons and, as the main event, a TLC match. TLC IX in the [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2009)|2009 event]] pitted [[Chris Jericho]] and The [[Big Show]] against [[D-Generation X]] ([[Triple H]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]) for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Unified WWE Tag Team Championship]]. This was the first TLC match to not include any member from the three original teams.\n\nA year later, at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2010)|TLC 2010]], the TLC match, for the first time, was a [[professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|fatal four-way]]. The match pitted [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Rey Mysterio]] and [[Alberto Del Rio]] against each other for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. In the end, Edge won the title. This was also Edge's last TLC match because of his retirement in early April the following year.\n\nThe next year at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2011)|TLC 2011]], CM Punk defended his WWE Championship in a first-ever [[professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat]] TLC match against Alberto Del Rio and The Miz.  Punk retained the championship, and thisnmarked the second time that all three competitors had competed in a TLC match.\n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2012)|TLC 2012]], [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] ([[Dean Ambrose]], [[Seth Rollins]], and [[Roman Reigns]]) fought [[Ryback (wrestler)|Ryback]] and [[Team Hell No]] (Kane and [[Daniel Bryan]]).<ref name=\"TLC2012_TheShield_RybackHellNo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwetlc/2012/mr-mcmahon-issues-statement-regarding-injured-punk-wwe-tlc-26073769|title=Mr. McMahon issues statement regarding injured Punk, WWE TLC|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> This was the first TLC match to contain teams of three and was the first TLC match for everyone involved except Kane. It was the first TLC match decided by pinfall or submission and the first in which all the weapons would have to be retrieved from under the ring.\n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2013)|TLC 2013]], WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena in a TLC match for both the WWE and World Heavyweight titles. Orton won to become the first WWE World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nAt [[Extreme Rules (2014)]], a \"WeeLC match\" was contested between El Torito and Hornswoggle, the first TLC match to involve midget wrestlers and the second to be decided by pinfall or submission.\n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2014)|TLC 2014]] [[Bray Wyatt]] defeated Dean Ambrose in the 17th TLC Match. This was also the third TLC match in which victory would be achieved by pinfall or submission. \n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2015)|TLC 2015]], [[Sheamus]] retained the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Roman Reigns in the 18th TLC Match.\n\nAt [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2016)|TLC 2016]], [[A.J. Styles|AJ Styles]] retained the WWE World Championship against Dean Ambrose in the 19th TLC Match.\n\n[[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2017)|TLC 2017]] marked the 20th TLC Match. Originally scheduled to feature the reunited Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns) against the team of The Miz, [[Braun Strowman]], Kane and [[Cesaro and Sheamus]], Reigns was removed from the match due to a legitimate illness. [[Kurt Angle]] replaced Reigns, making the match Angle's first in WWE since 2006. This was the first handicap TLC Match and the fourth decided by pinfall or submission.\n\nOn the December 10, 2018 episode of ''Raw'' Seth Rollins defended the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] in a TLC match against [[Baron Corbin]]. A few days later, [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2018)|TLC 2018]] marked the first women's TLC Match, as [[Becky Lynch]] lost the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] to [[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] in a match also involving [[Charlotte Flair]].

Predating the TLC matches, two \"Tables and Ladders matches\" took place. These were traditional matches won by pinfall or submission, not by climbing the ladder for the belts. However, the term \"TLC\" itself was trademarked by WWE, thus other promotions give different names to these types of matches despite having an identical setup. In more hardcore-style promotions, the chairs were often replaced, or were used alongside, chains. One example of a variation of the TLC match is the Tables, Ladders, Chairs, and Canes match. This match is a TLC match with the addition of [[Shinai|Singapore Canes]]. The first and only TLC match was at [[Guilty as Charged (2001)|Guilty as Charged]] on January 7, 2001 at the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]] in [[New York City|New York, New York]], involving [[Steve Corino]], [[Justin Credible]], and [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]].\n\n==== Tables and Ladders/Tables, Ladders, Chairs and Canes matches ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Match\n!Stipulations\n!Event\n!Date\n!Location\n!Length\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|[[The Eliminators]] ([[Perry Saturn]] and [[John Kronus]]) (c) defeated [[Sabu and Rob Van Dam]]\n|{{small|[[Tag team match|Tag team]] Tables & Ladders match for the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]]}}\n|[[CyberSlam (1997)|CyberSlam]]\n|February 22, 1997\n|[[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n|20:40\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|[[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] defeated [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]]\n|{{small|Tables & Ladders match}}\n|[[November to Remember (1997)|November to Remember]]\n|November 30, 1997\n|[[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n|20:55\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|[[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] defeated [[Steve Corino]] (c) and [[Justin Credible]]\n|{{small|[[Three-way match|Three-way]] Tables, Ladders, Chairs, & Canes match for the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]]}}\n|[[Guilty as Charged (2001)|Guilty as Charged]]\n|January 7, 2001\n|[[New York City|New York, New York]]\n|13:20\n|}\n\n==== Participant list ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Wrestler\n!Victories\n!Appearances\n|-\n|Perry Saturn\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|John Kronus\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|Sabu\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|The Sandman\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|Rob Van Dam\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Steve Corino\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Justin Credible\n|0\n|1\n|}\n\n=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling/Impact Wrestling ===\nTNA Wrestling used a variation of the TLC match called Full Metal Mayhem as a bout between [[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] at [[Against All Odds (2005)|Against All Odds 2005]]. The added stipulation to the match was that \"anything metal is legal\", which also included Abyss's trademark chain and bag of tacks.\n\nAbyss defeated [[Jeff Hardy]] by climbing the ladder to retrieve a contract for a shot at the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] on a future episode of ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|TNA Impact!]]''. Abyss was never granted such title shot, and the story was [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] to state he lost his title shot to [[A.J. Styles]] at [[Lockdown (2005)|Lockdown]], even though the shot Styles won was used at [[Hardcore Justice|Hard Justice]] and not on Impact!, though Abyss would later get title shots at [[Slammiversary (2005)|Slammiversary]] and [[No Surrender (2005)|No Surrender]] that year.\n\nTNA used the \"Full Metal Mayhem\" match again at [[Sacrifice (2006)|Sacrifice 2006]] on May 14, 2006 when Abyss went one on one with [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian Cage]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. Cage defeated Abyss to retain the championship.\n\nIt made its third appearance at [[Victory Road (2008)|Victory Road]] in 2008, in a 6-man tag team match featuring [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian Cage]], [[A.J. Styles]] and [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]] against [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]], where Angle pinned Styles to win the match for his team.\n\nTNA held the fourth \"Full Metal Mayhem\" match at [[Bound for Glory (2009)|Bound for Glory 2009]], in which four tag teams ([[The British Invasion (professional wrestling)|The British Invasion]], [[Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]], [[Scott Steiner]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] and [[Beer Money, Inc.]]) competed for both the [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]] and the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]]. The British Invasion grabbed the TNA World Tag Team Championships whilst Team 3D got the IWGP Tag Team Championships.\n\nOn December 5, 2010, at [[Final Resolution (2010)|Final Resolution]], [[The Motor City Machine Guns]] ([[Alex Shelley]] and [[Chris Sabin]]) defeated [[The Young Bucks|Generation Me]] (Max and Jeremy Buck) to successfully retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship in the fifth \"Full Metal Mayhem\" match.\n\nOn October 16, 2011, at [[Bound for Glory (2011)|Bound for Glory]], [[Rob Van Dam]] defeated [[Jerry Lynn]] in the sixth \"Full Metal Mayhem\" match.\n\nThe seventh edition of the Full Metal Mayhem match occurred on the April 11, 2013 edition of ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]''. It is the first such match not aired on [[pay-per-view]] and also the first Full Metal Mayhem match to decide the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]]. Jeff Hardy was challenging for Bully Ray's championship in a rematch from [[Lockdown (2013)]]. Ray was victorious after sending Hardy through a table from atop the ladder and claiming the belt.\n\nThe November 7, 2013 edition of Full Metal Mayhem match was decided by \"The Wheel of Dixie\", a roulette that determined the match type for all participants in the qualifying tournament for TNA World Heavyweight Title.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61KVp5jl6RM How Will Dixie Carter Decide the Match Types in The Heavyweight Title Tournament? - Oct. 31, 2013</ref>  On November 7, 2013, Jeff Hardy pinned Chris Sabin to win the first round bout.\n\n==== Full Metal Mayhem matches ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Match\n!Stipulations\n!Event\n!Date\n!Location\n!Length\n|-\n|align=center| 1\n|[[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] defeated [[Jeff Hardy]]\n|{{small|Full Metal Mayhem match for a shot at the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] on a future episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]''.}}\n|[[Against All Odds (2005)|Against All Odds]]\n|February 13, 2005\n|[[Orlando, Florida]]\n|15:21\n|-\n|align=center| 2\n|[[Christian Cage]] (c) defeated [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]]\n|{{small|Full Metal Mayhem match for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].}}\n|[[Sacrifice (2006)|Sacrifice]]\n|May 14, 2006\n|[[Orlando, Florida]]\n|26:01\n|-\n|align=center| 3\n|[[Team 3D]] ([[Bubba Ray Dudley|Brother Ray]] & [[Brother Devon]]) and [[Kurt Angle]] defeated [[Christian Cage]], [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]] and [[A.J.

Software publishers have implemented increasingly complex methods in an effort to stop unauthorized copying of software.\n\nOn the Apple II, unlike modern computers that use standardized device drivers to manage device communications, the operating system directly controlled the step motor that moves the floppy drive head, and also directly interpreted the raw data, called ''nibbles'', read from each track to identify the data sectors. This allowed complex disk-based software copy protection, by storing data on half tracks (0, 1, 2.5, 3.5, 5, 6...), quarter tracks (0, 1, 2.25, 3.75, 5, 6...), and any combination thereof. In addition, tracks did not need to be perfect rings, but could be sectioned so that sectors could be staggered across overlapping offset tracks, the most extreme version being known as spiral tracking. It was also discovered that many floppy drives did not have a fixed upper limit to head movement, and it was sometimes possible to write an additional 36th track above the normal 35 tracks. The standard Apple II copy programs could not read such protected floppy disks, since the standard DOS assumed that all disks had a uniform 35-track, 13- or 16-sector layout. Special nibble-copy programs such as Locksmith and Copy II Plus could sometimes duplicate these disks by using a reference library of known protection methods; when protected programs were cracked they would be completely stripped of the copy protection system, and transferred onto a standard format disk that any normal Apple II copy program could read.\n\nOne of the primary routes to hacking these early copy protections was to run a program that simulates the normal CPU operation. The CPU simulator provides a number of extra features to the hacker, such as the ability to single-step through each processor instruction and to examine the CPU registers and modified memory spaces as the simulation runs (any modern disassembler/debugger can do this). The Apple II provided a built-in opcode disassembler, allowing raw memory to be decoded into CPU opcodes, and this would be utilized to examine what the copy-protection was about to do next. Generally there was little to no defense available to the copy protection system, since all its secrets are made visible through the simulation. However, because the simulation itself must run on the original CPU, in addition to the software being hacked, the simulation would often run extremely slowly even at maximum speed.\n\nOn Atari 8-bit computers, the most common protection method was via \"bad sectors\". These were sectors on the disk that were intentionally unreadable by the disk drive. The software would look for these sectors when the program was loading and would stop loading if an error code was not returned when accessing these sectors. Special copy programs were available that would copy the disk and remember any bad sectors. The user could then use an application to spin the drive by constantly reading a single sector and display the drive RPM. With the disk drive top removed a small screwdriver could be used to slow the drive RPM below a certain point. Once the drive was slowed down the application could then go and write \"bad sectors\" where needed. When done the drive RPM was sped up back to normal and an uncracked copy was made. Of course cracking the software to expect good sectors made for readily copied disks without the need to meddle with the disk drive. As time went on more sophisticated methods were developed, but almost all involved some form of malformed disk data, such as a sector that might return different data on separate accesses due to bad data alignment. Products became available (from companies such as [[Happy Computers]]) which replaced the controller BIOS in Atari's \"smart\" drives. These upgraded drives allowed the user to make exact copies of the original program with copy protections in place on the new disk.\n\nOn the Commodore 64, several methods were used to protect software. For software distributed on [[ROM cartridge]]s, subroutines were included which attempted to write over the program code. If the software was on ROM, nothing would happen, but if the software had been moved to [[Random-access memory|RAM]], the software would be disabled. Because of the operation of Commodore floppy drives, one write protection scheme would cause the floppy drive head to bang against the end of its rail, which could cause the drive head to become misaligned. In some cases, cracked versions of software were desirable to avoid this result. A misaligned drive head was rare usually fixing itself by smashing against the rail stops. Another brutal protection scheme was grinding from track 1 to 40 and back a few times.\n\nMost of the early software crackers were computer hobbyists who often formed groups that competed against each other in the cracking and spreading of software. Breaking a new copy protection scheme as quickly as possible was often regarded as an opportunity to demonstrate one's technical superiority rather than a possibility of money-making. Some low skilled hobbyists would take already cracked software and edit various unencrypted strings of text in it to change messages a game would tell a game player, often something considered vulgar. Uploading the altered copies on file sharing networks provided a source of laughs for adult users. The cracker groups of the 1980s started to advertise themselves and their skills by attaching animated screens known as [[crack intro]]s in the software programs they cracked and released. Once the technical competition had expanded from the challenges of cracking to the challenges of creating visually stunning intros, the foundations for a new subculture known as [[demoscene]] were established. Demoscene started to separate itself from the illegal \"warez scene\" during the 1990s and is now regarded as a completely different subculture. Many software crackers have later grown into extremely capable software reverse engineers; the deep knowledge of assembly required in order to crack protections enables them to [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] [[device driver|drivers]] in order to port them from binary-only drivers for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] to drivers with source code for [[Linux]] and other [[Free software|free]] operating systems. Also because music and game intro was such an integral part of gaming the music format and graphics became very popular when hardware became affordable for the home user.\n\nWith the rise of the [[Internet]], software crackers developed secretive online organizations. In the latter half of the nineties, one of the most respected sources of information about \"software protection reversing\" was [[Fravia]]'s website.\n\nMost of the well-known or \"elite\" cracking groups make software cracks entirely for respect in the \"[[Warez (scene)|Scene]]\", not profit. From there, the cracks are eventually leaked onto public Internet sites by people/crackers who use well-protected/secure FTP release archives, which are made into full copies and sometimes sold illegally by other parties.\n\n[[Warez (scene)|The Scene]] today is formed of small groups of skilled people, who informally compete to have the best crackers, methods of cracking, and [[reverse engineering]].\n\n==+HCU==\nThe ''High Cracking University'' (+HCU), was founded by [[Old Red Cracker]] (+ORC), considered a genius of reverse engineering and a legendary figure in RCE, to advance research into [[Reverse Engineering|Reverse Code Engineering]] (RCE). He had also taught and authored many papers on the subject, and his texts are considered classics in the field and are mandatory reading for students of RCE.<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\"/>\n\nThe addition of the \"+\" sign in front of the nickname of a reverser signified membership in the +HCU. Amongst the students of +HCU were the top of the elite Windows reversers worldwide.<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\">{{cite book|author1=Cyrus Peikari|author2=[[Anton Chuvakin]]|title=Security Warrior|url=https://archive.org/details/securitywarrior0000peik|url-access=registration|date=12 January 2004|publisher=\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"|isbn=978-0-596-55239-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/securitywarrior0000peik/page/31 31]}}</ref> +HCU published a new reverse engineering problem annually and a small number of respondents with the best replies qualified for an undergraduate position at the university.<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\"/>\n\n+Fravia was a professor at +HCU. Fravia's website was known as \"+Fravia's Pages of Reverse Engineering\" and he used it to challenge programmers as well as the wider society to \"reverse engineer\" the \"brainwashing of a corrupt and rampant materialism\". In its heyday, his website received millions of visitors per year and its influence was \"widespread\".<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\"/>\n\nNowadays most of the graduates of +HCU have migrated to Linux and few have remained as Windows reversers. The information at the university has been rediscovered by a new generation of researchers and practitioners of RCE who have started new research projects in the field.<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\"/>\n\n==Methods==\nThe most common software crack is the modification of an application's binary to cause or prevent a specific key branch in the program's execution. This is accomplished by [[reverse engineering]] the compiled program code using a [[debugger]] such as [[SoftICE]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ankit|first1=Jain|last2=Jason|first2=Kuo|last3=Jordan|first3=Soet|last4=Brian|first4=Tse|title=Software Cracking (April 2007)|date=April 2007|url=https://courses.ece.ubc.ca/cpen442/previous_years/2007_1_spring/modules/term_project/reports/2007/software_cracking.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2018|publisher=The University of British Columbia  - Electrical and Computer Engineering}}</ref> [[x64dbg]], [[OllyDbg]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=W\u00f3jcik|first1=Bartosz|title=Reverse engineering tools review|url=https://www.pelock.com/articles/reverse-engineering-tools-review|website=pelock.com|publisher=PELock|accessdate=16 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913143457/https://www.pelock.com/articles/reverse-engineering-tools-review|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref> [[GDB]], or [[MacsBug]] until the software cracker reaches the [[subroutine]] that contains the primary method of protecting the software (or by [[disassembler|disassembling]] an executable file with a program such as [[Interactive Disassembler|IDA]]). The binary is then modified using the [[debugger]] or a [[hex editor]] or [[Machine code monitor|monitor]] in a manner that replaces a prior branching [[opcode]] with its complement or a [[NOP (code)|NOP]] [[opcode]] so the key branch will either always execute a specific [[subroutine]] or skip over it. Almost all common software cracks are a variation of this type. [[Proprietary software]] developers are constantly developing techniques such as [[code obfuscation]], [[encryption]], and [[self-modifying code]] to make this modification increasingly difficult. Even with these measures being taken, developers struggle to combat software cracking. This is because it is very common for a professional to publicly release a simple cracked EXE or Retrium Installer for public download, eliminating the need for inexperienced users to crack the software themselves.\n\nA specific example of this technique is a crack that removes the expiration period from a time-limited trial of an application. These cracks are usually programs that alter the program executable and sometimes the [[Library (computing)|.dll or .so]] linked to the application. Similar cracks are available for software that requires a hardware [[dongle]]. A company can also break the copy protection of programs that they have legally purchased but that are [[software license|licensed]] to particular hardware, so that there is no risk of downtime due to hardware failure (and, of course, no need to restrict oneself to running the software on bought hardware only).\n\nAnother method is the use of special software such as [[CloneCD]] to scan for the use of a commercial copy protection application. After discovering the software used to protect the application, another tool may be used to remove the copy protection from the software on the [[CD]] or [[DVD]]. This may enable another program such as [[Alcohol 120%]], [[CloneDVD]], [[Game Jackal]], or [[Daemon Tools]] to copy the protected software to a user's hard disk. Popular commercial copy protection applications which may be scanned for include [[SafeDisc]] and StarForce.<ref>[http://m0001.gamecopyworld.com/games/gcw_cd-backup.shtml Gamecopyworld Howto]</ref>\n\nIn other cases, it might be possible to [[decompile]] a program in order to get access to the original [[source code]] or code on a [[High level programming language|level higher]] than [[machine code]]. This is often possible with [[scripting language]]s and languages utilizing [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compilation. An example is cracking (or debugging) on the .NET platform where one might consider manipulating [[Common Intermediate Language|CIL]] to achieve one's needs. [[Java (programming language)|Java's]] [[bytecode]] also works in a similar fashion in which there is an intermediate language before the program is compiled to run on the platform dependent [[machine code]].\n\nAdvanced reverse engineering for protections such as [[SecuROM]], [[SafeDisc]], StarForce, or [[Denuvo]] requires a cracker, or many crackers to spend much time studying the protection, eventually finding every flaw within the protection code, and then coding their own tools to \"unwrap\" the protection automatically from executable (.EXE) and library (.DLL) files.\n\nThere are a number of sites on the Internet that let users download cracks produced by [[warez groups]] for popular games and applications (although at the danger of acquiring malicious software that is sometimes distributed via such sites).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/1997/04/ff-warez/|title=Warez Wars|last=McCandless|first=David|date=1997-04-01|work=Wired|access-date=2020-02-04|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> Although these cracks are used by legal buyers of software, they can also be used by people who have downloaded or otherwise obtained unauthorized copies (often through [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] networks).\n\n== Trial reset ==\nMany commercial programs that can be downloaded from the Internet have a trial period (often 30 days) and must be registered (i.e. be bought) after its expiration if the user wants to continue to use them. To reset the trial period, registry entries and/or hidden files that contain information about the trial period are modified and/or deleted. For this purpose, crackers develop \"''trial resetters''\" for a particular program or sometimes also for a group of programs by the same manufacturer.\n<br>\nA method to make trial resets less attractive is the limitation of the software during the trial period (e.g., some features are only available in the registered version; pictures/videos/hardcopies created with the program get a watermark; the program runs for only 10-20 minutes and then closes automatically). Some programs have an unlimited trial period, but are limited until their registration.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Reverse engineering]]\n*[[Warez]]\n*[[Warez groups]]\n*[[List of warez groups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Independent production}}\n\n[[Category:Hacker culture]]\n[[Category:Copyright infringement]]\n[[Category:Software cracking| ]]\n[[Category:Copyright infringement of software]]\n[[Category:Warez]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|Type of hacking}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = February 2019}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=September 2013}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2013}}\n}}\n\n'''Software cracking''' (known as \"breaking\" in the 1980s<ref name=\"kevelson198510\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_22_1985-10_Ion_International_US#page/n71/mode/2up |title=Isepic |work=Ahoy! |date=October 1985 |accessdate=27 June 2014 |first=Morton |last=Kevelson |pages=71\u201373 |quote=The origin of the term probably lies in the activity burglars in the still of the night.}}</ref>) is the modification of [[software]] to remove or disable features which are considered undesirable by the person cracking the software, especially [[copy protection]] features (including protection against the manipulation of software, serial number, hardware key, date checks and disc check) or software annoyances like [[Nagware|nag screens]] and [[adware]].\n\nA '''crack''' refers to the means of achieving, for example a stolen [[serial number]] or a tool that performs that act of cracking.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tulloch|first1=Mitch|title=Microsoft Encyclopedia of Security|date=2003|publisher=Microsoft Press|location=Redmond, Washington|isbn=0735618771|page=68|url=http://examples.oreilly.de/english_examples/9780735622180/cd_contents/Encyclopedia/EncySecur.pdf}}</ref> Some of these tools are called [[keygen]], [[Patch (computing)|patch]], or [[Loader (computing)|loader]].

The Apple II provided a built-in opcode disassembler, allowing raw memory to be decoded into CPU opcodes, and this would be utilized to examine what the copy-protection was about to do next. Generally there was little to no defense available to the copy protection system, since all its secrets are made visible through the simulation. However, because the simulation itself must run on the original CPU, in addition to the software being hacked, the simulation would often run extremely slowly even at maximum speed.\n\nOn Atari 8-bit computers, the most common protection method was via \"bad sectors\". These were sectors on the disk that were intentionally unreadable by the disk drive. The software would look for these sectors when the program was loading and would stop loading if an error code was not returned when accessing these sectors. Special copy programs were available that would copy the disk and remember any bad sectors. The user could then use an application to spin the drive by constantly reading a single sector and display the drive RPM. With the disk drive top removed a small screwdriver could be used to slow the drive RPM below a certain point. Once the drive was slowed down the application could then go and write \"bad sectors\" where needed. When done the drive RPM was sped up back to normal and an uncracked copy was made. Of course cracking the software to expect good sectors made for readily copied disks without the need to meddle with the disk drive. As time went on more sophisticated methods were developed, but almost all involved some form of malformed disk data, such as a sector that might return different data on separate accesses due to bad data alignment. Products became available (from companies such as [[Happy Computers]]) which replaced the controller BIOS in Atari's \"smart\" drives. These upgraded drives allowed the user to make exact copies of the original program with copy protections in place on the new disk.\n\nOn the Commodore 64, several methods were used to protect software. For software distributed on [[ROM cartridge]]s, subroutines were included which attempted to write over the program code. If the software was on ROM, nothing would happen, but if the software had been moved to [[Random-access memory|RAM]], the software would be disabled. Because of the operation of Commodore floppy drives, one write protection scheme would cause the floppy drive head to bang against the end of its rail, which could cause the drive head to become misaligned. In some cases, cracked versions of software were desirable to avoid this result. A misaligned drive head was rare usually fixing itself by smashing against the rail stops. Another brutal protection scheme was grinding from track 1 to 40 and back a few times.\n\nMost of the early software crackers were computer hobbyists who often formed groups that competed against each other in the cracking and spreading of software. Breaking a new copy protection scheme as quickly as possible was often regarded as an opportunity to demonstrate one's technical superiority rather than a possibility of money-making. Some low skilled hobbyists would take already cracked software and edit various unencrypted strings of text in it to change messages a game would tell a game player, often something considered vulgar. Uploading the altered copies on file sharing networks provided a source of laughs for adult users. The cracker groups of the 1980s started to advertise themselves and their skills by attaching animated screens known as [[crack intro]]s in the software programs they cracked and released. Once the technical competition had expanded from the challenges of cracking to the challenges of creating visually stunning intros, the foundations for a new subculture known as [[demoscene]] were established. Demoscene started to separate itself from the illegal \"warez scene\" during the 1990s and is now regarded as a completely different subculture. Many software crackers have later grown into extremely capable software reverse engineers; the deep knowledge of assembly required in order to crack protections enables them to [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] [[device driver|drivers]] in order to port them from binary-only drivers for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] to drivers with source code for [[Linux]] and other [[Free software|free]] operating systems. Also because music and game intro was such an integral part of gaming the music format and graphics became very popular when hardware became affordable for the home user.\n\nWith the rise of the [[Internet]], software crackers developed secretive online organizations. In the latter half of the nineties, one of the most respected sources of information about \"software protection reversing\" was [[Fravia]]'s website.\n\nMost of the well-known or \"elite\" cracking groups make software cracks entirely for respect in the \"[[Warez (scene)|Scene]]\", not profit. From there, the cracks are eventually leaked onto public Internet sites by people/crackers who use well-protected/secure FTP release archives, which are made into full copies and sometimes sold illegally by other parties.\n\n[[Warez (scene)|The Scene]] today is formed of small groups of skilled people, who informally compete to have the best crackers, methods of cracking, and [[reverse engineering]].\n\n==+HCU==\nThe ''High Cracking University'' (+HCU), was founded by [[Old Red Cracker]] (+ORC), considered a genius of reverse engineering and a legendary figure in RCE, to advance research into [[Reverse Engineering|Reverse Code Engineering]] (RCE). He had also taught and authored many papers on the subject, and his texts are considered classics in the field and are mandatory reading for students of RCE.<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\"/>\n\nThe addition of the \"+\" sign in front of the nickname of a reverser signified membership in the +HCU. Amongst the students of +HCU were the top of the elite Windows reversers worldwide.<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\">{{cite book|author1=Cyrus Peikari|author2=[[Anton Chuvakin]]|title=Security Warrior|url=https://archive.org/details/securitywarrior0000peik|url-access=registration|date=12 January 2004|publisher=\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"|isbn=978-0-596-55239-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/securitywarrior0000peik/page/31 31]}}</ref> +HCU published a new reverse engineering problem annually and a small number of respondents with the best replies qualified for an undergraduate position at the university.<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\"/>\n\n+Fravia was a professor at +HCU.

In its heyday, his website received millions of visitors per year and its influence was \"widespread\".<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\"/>\n\nNowadays most of the graduates of +HCU have migrated to Linux and few have remained as Windows reversers. The information at the university has been rediscovered by a new generation of researchers and practitioners of RCE who have started new research projects in the field.<ref name=\"PeikariChuvakin2004\"/>\n\n==Methods==\nThe most common software crack is the modification of an application's binary to cause or prevent a specific key branch in the program's execution. This is accomplished by [[reverse engineering]] the compiled program code using a [[debugger]] such as [[SoftICE]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ankit|first1=Jain|last2=Jason|first2=Kuo|last3=Jordan|first3=Soet|last4=Brian|first4=Tse|title=Software Cracking (April 2007)|date=April 2007|url=https://courses.ece.ubc.ca/cpen442/previous_years/2007_1_spring/modules/term_project/reports/2007/software_cracking.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2018|publisher=The University of British Columbia  - Electrical and Computer Engineering}}</ref> [[x64dbg]], [[OllyDbg]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=W\u00f3jcik|first1=Bartosz|title=Reverse engineering tools review|url=https://www.pelock.com/articles/reverse-engineering-tools-review|website=pelock.com|publisher=PELock|accessdate=16 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913143457/https://www.pelock.com/articles/reverse-engineering-tools-review|archivedate=13 September 2017}}</ref> [[GDB]], or [[MacsBug]] until the software cracker reaches the [[subroutine]] that contains the primary method of protecting the software (or by [[disassembler|disassembling]] an executable file with a program such as [[Interactive Disassembler|IDA]]). The binary is then modified using the [[debugger]] or a [[hex editor]] or [[Machine code monitor|monitor]] in a manner that replaces a prior branching [[opcode]] with its complement or a [[NOP (code)|NOP]] [[opcode]] so the key branch will either always execute a specific [[subroutine]] or skip over it. Almost all common software cracks are a variation of this type. [[Proprietary software]] developers are constantly developing techniques such as [[code obfuscation]], [[encryption]], and [[self-modifying code]] to make this modification increasingly difficult. Even with these measures being taken, developers struggle to combat software cracking. This is because it is very common for a professional to publicly release a simple cracked EXE or Retrium Installer for public download, eliminating the need for inexperienced users to crack the software themselves.\n\nA specific example of this technique is a crack that removes the expiration period from a time-limited trial of an application. These cracks are usually programs that alter the program executable and sometimes the [[Library (computing)|.dll or .so]] linked to the application. Similar cracks are available for software that requires a hardware [[dongle]]. A company can also break the copy protection of programs that they have legally purchased but that are [[software license|licensed]] to particular hardware, so that there is no risk of downtime due to hardware failure (and, of course, no need to restrict oneself to running the software on bought hardware only).\n\nAnother method is the use of special software such as [[CloneCD]] to scan for the use of a commercial copy protection application. After discovering the software used to protect the application, another tool may be used to remove the copy protection from the software on the [[CD]] or [[DVD]]. This may enable another program such as [[Alcohol 120%]], [[CloneDVD]], [[Game Jackal]], or [[Daemon Tools]] to copy the protected software to a user's hard disk. Popular commercial copy protection applications which may be scanned for include [[SafeDisc]] and StarForce.<ref>[http://m0001.gamecopyworld.com/games/gcw_cd-backup.shtml Gamecopyworld Howto]</ref>\n\nIn other cases, it might be possible to [[decompile]] a program in order to get access to the original [[source code]] or code on a [[High level programming language|level higher]] than [[machine code]]. This is often possible with [[scripting language]]s and languages utilizing [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compilation. An example is cracking (or debugging) on the .NET platform where one might consider manipulating [[Common Intermediate Language|CIL]] to achieve one's needs. [[Java (programming language)|Java's]] [[bytecode]] also works in a similar fashion in which there is an intermediate language before the program is compiled to run on the platform dependent [[machine code]].\n\nAdvanced reverse engineering for protections such as [[SecuROM]], [[SafeDisc]], StarForce, or [[Denuvo]] requires a cracker, or many crackers to spend much time studying the protection, eventually finding every flaw within the protection code, and then coding their own tools to \"unwrap\" the protection automatically from executable (.EXE) and library (.DLL) files.\n\nThere are a number of sites on the Internet that let users download cracks produced by [[warez groups]] for popular games and applications (although at the danger of acquiring malicious software that is sometimes distributed via such sites).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/1997/04/ff-warez/|title=Warez Wars|last=McCandless|first=David|date=1997-04-01|work=Wired|access-date=2020-02-04|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> Although these cracks are used by legal buyers of software, they can also be used by people who have downloaded or otherwise obtained unauthorized copies (often through [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] networks).\n\n== Trial reset ==\nMany commercial programs that can be downloaded from the Internet have a trial period (often 30 days) and must be registered (= be bought) after its expiration if the user wants to continue to use them. To reset the trial period, registry entries and/or hidden files that contain information about the trial period are modified and/or deleted. For this purpose, crackers develop \"''trial resetters''\" for a particular program or sometimes also for a group of programs by the same manufacturer.\n<br>\nA method to make trial resets less attractive is the limitation of the software during the trial period (e.g., some features are only available in the registered version; pictures/videos/hardcopies created with the program get a watermark; the program runs for only 10-20 minutes and then closes automatically). Some programs have an unlimited trial period, but are limited until their registration.\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Reverse engineering]]\n*[[Warez]]\n*[[Warez groups]]\n*[[List of warez groups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Independent production}}\n\n[[Category:Hacker culture]]\n[[Category:Copyright infringement]]\n[[Category:Software cracking| ]]\n[[Category:Copyright infringement of software]]\n[[Category:Warez]]\n", "name_user": "Commander C22", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTrial reset", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking"}

Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG01\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG02\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]].<ref name=\"RG19\">Roche, (2005)</ref> The Miguelite-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.<ref name=\"RG03\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG04\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Almirante_Charles_Napier_-_John_Simpson_(attributed),_after_1834,_Museu_Nacional_Soares_dos_Reis.png|thumb|right|upright=1|A portrait of Napier in 1834, at the conclusion of the war.]]\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]].<ref name=\"RG05\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG06\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG07\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG08\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.<ref name=\"RG09\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG10\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelite fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelite fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to [[Pedro I of Brazil|Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelite fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelite fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros.<ref name=\"RG11\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG12\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelite prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the [[Navy Directory|Royal Navy List]] at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite ''The Lord of the Isles'' [[Steamboat|steamer]] at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834.

Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|parliamentary]] seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834.

Vincent]] between a Liberal fleet under the command of British [[Officer (armed forces)|naval officer]] [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]] against a [[Miguelist|Miguelite]] fleet under the command of Portugese naval officer Manuel Marreiros, which was fought on 5 July 1833 during the [[Liberal Wars]] and resulted in a decisive victory for the Liberal fleet. Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG01\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG02\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]].<ref name=\"RG19\">Roche, (2005)</ref> The Miguelite-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.<ref name=\"RG03\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG04\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]].<ref name=\"RG05\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG06\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]].
