In 1896, at the age of 16, he joined the [[Gaelic League]] (''Conradh na Gaeilge''), and in 1903, at the age of 23, he became editor of its newspaper ''[[An Claidheamh Soluis]]'' (\"''The Sword of Light''\").<ref>[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol1/pearse.html Flanagan, Frank M., \"Patrick H.

In 1905, Pearse represented [[Neil McBride (poet)|Neil McBride]], a poet and songwriter from [[Creeslough|Feymore, Creeslough]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], who had been fined for having his name displayed in \"illegible\" writing (i.e. Irish) on his donkey cart. The appeal was heard before the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] in Dublin. It was Pearse's first and only court appearance as a barrister. The case was lost but it became a symbol of the struggle for Irish independence. In his 27 June 1905 ''[[An Claidheamh Soluis]]'' column, Pearse wrote of the decision, \"''...it was in effect decided that Irish is a foreign language on the same level with Yiddish.''\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://giveitsomesparkle.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/padraig-pearse-the-cart-and-an-old-song-book/|title=Padraig Pearse, the cart and an old song book|date=9 September 2011|website=Sparkle|access-date=10 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/98115729|title=Neil McBride|date=1 October 2012|website=findagrave.com|access-date=10 April 2016}}{{Primary source inline|date=July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGill|first=P.J.|year=1966|title=Pearse Defends Niall Mac Giolla Bhride in Court of King's Bench, Dublin|journal=Donegal Annual|volume=1966|pages=83\u201385 (from 27 June 1905 article written by Patrick Pearse).|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==St Enda's==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Pearse Brother's Museum - St. Enda's Park.jpg|thumb|[[St. Enda's School|St. Enda's]], now the Pearse Museum ]]\nAs a cultural nationalist educated by the [[Irish Christian Brothers]], like his younger brother Willie, Pearse believed that language was intrinsic to the identity of a nation. The Irish school system, he believed, raised Ireland's youth to be good [[England|Englishmen]] or obedient Irishmen, and an alternative was needed. Thus for him and other language revivalists saving the [[Irish language]] from extinction was a cultural priority of the utmost importance. The key to saving the language, he felt, would be a sympathetic education system. To show the way he started his own bilingual school for boys, [[St. Enda's School]] (Scoil \u00c9anna) in Cullenswood House in [[Ranelagh]], a suburb of [[County Dublin]], in 1908.<ref name=\"nli\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.nli.ie/1916/pdf/4.4.pdf|title = Patrick Pearse|work = The 1916 Rising:  Personalities and Perspectives|year = 2006|publisher = National Library of Ireland|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060519214523/http://www.nli.ie/1916/pdf/4.4.pdf|archivedate = 19 May 2006|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The pupils were taught in both Irish and English. Cullenswood House is now the home of a [[Gaelscoil]], Lios na n\u00d3g.  With the aid of [[Thomas MacDonagh]], Pearse's younger brother [[Willie Pearse]], their mother and both Margaret and Mary Brigid Pearse, along with other (often transient) academics, it soon proved a successful experiment. Pearse did all he planned, and even took students on field trips to the [[Gaeltacht]] in the West of Ireland.\n\nPearse's restless idealism led him in search of an even more idyllic home for his school. He found it in The Hermitage in [[Rathfarnham]], County Dublin, now home to the [[Pearse Museum]]. In 1910 Pearse wrote that the Hermitage was an \"ideal\" location due to the aesthetics of the grounds and that if he could secure it, \"the school would be on a level with\" the more established schools of the day such as \"[[Clongowes Wood College]] and [[Castleknock College]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=UA3fbLv1EQoC&pg=PA288&lpg=PA288&dq=patrick+pearse+clongowes&source=bl&ots=yL3W7ovjU-&sig=ACfU3U0gfT|title=The Pedagogy of Protest: The Educational Thought and Work of Patrick H.

He strove continually to keep ahead of his debts while doing his best to maintain the school. In February 1914, he went on a fund-raising trip to the United States, where he met [[John Devoy]] and [[Joseph McGarrity]], both of whom were impressed by his fervour and supported him in raising sufficient money to secure the continued existence of the school.\n\n==The Volunteers and Home Rule==\nIn April 1912 [[John Redmond]] leader of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], which held the balance of power in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] committed the government of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] to introducing an [[Irish Home Rule Bill]].  Pearse gave the Bill a qualified welcome. He was one of four speakers, including Redmond, [[Joseph Devlin]] MP, leader of the Northern Nationalists, and [[Eoin MacNeill]] a prominent Gaelic Leaguer, who addressed a large Home Rule Rally in Dublin at the end of March 1912.  Speaking in Irish, Pearse said he thought that \"a good measure can be gained if we have enough courage\", but he warned, \"Let the English understand that if we are again betrayed, there shall be red war throughout Ireland.\"<ref>Ruth Dudley Edwards, ''Patrick Pearse: The Triumph of Failure,'' (1977) p. 159</ref>\n\nIn November 1913 Pearse was invited to the inaugural meeting of the [[Irish Volunteers]]\u2014formed in reaction to the creation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]]\u2014whose aim was \"to secure and maintain the rights and liberties common to the whole people of Ireland\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foy|first=Michael|last2=Barton|first2=Brian|title=The Easter Rising|publisher=Sutton Publishing|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/easterrising0000foym/page/7 7\u20138]|isbn=0-7509-3433-6|url=https://archive.org/details/easterrising0000foym/page/7}}</ref> In an article entitled \"The Coming Revolution\" (November 1913) Pearse wrote: \n{{quote|As to what your work as an Irish Nationalist is to be, I cannot conjecture; I know what mine is to be, and would have you know yours and buckle yourselves to it. And it may be (nay, it is) that your and mine will lead us to a common meeting-place, and that on a certain day we shall stand together, with many more beside us, ready for a greater adventure than any of us has yet had, a trial and a triumph to be endured and achieved in common.<ref name=\"Se\u00e1n Cronin 1966, pg.15\">Se\u00e1n Cronin, Our Own Red Blood, Irish Freedom Press, New York, 1966, pg.15</ref>\n}}\n\nThe Home Rule Bill just failed to pass the [[House of Lords]], but the Lords' diminished power under the [[Parliament Act 1911]] meant that the Bill could only be delayed, not stopped. It was placed on the statute books with [[Royal Assent]] in September 1914, but its implementation was suspended for the duration of the First World War.\n\nJohn Redmond feared that his \"national authority\" might be circumvented by the Volunteers and decided to try to take control of the new movement. Despite opposition from the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Volunteer Executive agreed to share leadership with Redmond and a joint committee was set up. Pearse was opposed to this and was to write:<ref name=\"Se\u00e1n Cronin 1966, pg.15\"/>\n\n{{quote|The leaders in Ireland have nearly always left the people at the critical moment; they have sometimes sold them.

A majority followed Redmond into the [[National Volunteers]] in the belief that this would ensure Home Rule on their return. Pearse, exhilarated by the dramatic events of the European war, wrote in an article in December 1915:\n\n{{quote|It is patriotism that stirs the people.

When [[Eoin MacNeill]], the Chief of Staff of the Volunteers, learned what was being planned without the promised arms from Germany, he countermanded the orders via newspaper, causing the IRB to issue a last-minute order to go through with the plan the following day, greatly limiting the numbers who turned out for the rising.\n\nWhen the [[Easter Rising]] eventually began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, it was Pearse who read the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]] from outside the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]], the headquarters of the Rising. Pearse was the person most responsible for drafting the Proclamation, and he was chosen as President of the Republic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patrick Pearse|url=http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/patrick-pearse|website=Century Ireland|publisher=[[RT\u00c9]]/[[Boston College]]|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref> After six days of fighting, heavy civilian casualties and great destruction of property, Pearse issued the order to surrender.\n\nPearse and fourteen other leaders, including his brother Willie, were [[court-martial]]led and [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]].

In the middle decades of the 20th century Pearse was idolised by [[Irish nationalist]]s as the supreme idealist of their cause.

The key to saving the language, he felt, would be a sympathetic education system. To show the way he started his own bilingual school for boys, [[St. Enda's School]] (Scoil \u00c9anna) in Cullenswood House in [[Ranelagh]], a suburb of [[County Dublin]], in 1908.<ref name=\"nli\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.nli.ie/1916/pdf/4.4.pdf|title = Patrick Pearse|work = The 1916 Rising:  Personalities and Perspectives|year = 2006|publisher = National Library of Ireland|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060519214523/http://www.nli.ie/1916/pdf/4.4.pdf|archivedate = 19 May 2006|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The pupils were taught in both Irish and English. Cullenswood House is now the home of a [[Gaelscoil]], Lios na n\u00d3g.  With the aid of [[Thomas MacDonagh]], Pearse's younger brother [[Willie Pearse]], their mother and both Margaret and Mary Brigid Pearse, along with other (often transient) academics, it soon proved a successful experiment. Pearse did all he planned, and even took students on field trips to the [[Gaeltacht]] in the West of Ireland.\n\nPearse's restless idealism led him in search of an even more idyllic home for his school. He found it in The Hermitage in [[Rathfarnham]], County Dublin, now home to the [[Pearse Museum]]. In 1910 Pearse wrote that the Hermitage was an \"ideal\" location due to the aesthetics of the grounds and that if he could secure it, \"the school would be on a level with\" the more established schools of the day such as \"[[Clongowes Wood College]] and [[Castleknock College]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=UA3fbLv1EQoC&pg=PA288&lpg=PA288&dq=patrick+pearse+clongowes&source=bl&ots=yL3W7ovjU-&sig=ACfU3U0gfT|title=The Pedagogy of Protest: The Educational Thought and Work of Patrick H.

He strove continually to keep ahead of his debts while doing his best to maintain the school. In February 1914, he went on a fund-raising trip to the United States, where he met [[John Devoy]] and [[Joseph McGarrity]], both of whom were impressed by his fervour and supported him in raising sufficient money to secure the continued existence of the school.\n\n==The Volunteers and Home Rule==\nIn April 1912 [[John Redmond]] leader of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], which held the balance of power in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] committed the government of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] to introducing an [[Irish Home Rule Bill]].  Pearse gave the Bill a qualified welcome. He was one of four speakers, including Redmond, [[Joseph Devlin]] MP, leader of the Northern Nationalists, and [[Eoin MacNeill]] a prominent Gaelic Leaguer, who addressed a large Home Rule Rally in Dublin at the end of March 1912.  Speaking in Irish, Pearse said he thought that \"a good measure can be gained if we have enough courage\", but he warned, \"Let the English understand that if we are again betrayed, there shall be red war throughout Ireland.\"<ref>Ruth Dudley Edwards, ''Patrick Pearse: The Triumph of Failure,'' (1977) p. 159</ref>\n\nIn November 1913 Pearse was invited to the inaugural meeting of the [[Irish Volunteers]]\u2014formed in reaction to the creation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]]\u2014whose aim was \"to secure and maintain the rights and liberties common to the whole people of Ireland\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foy|first=Michael|last2=Barton|first2=Brian|title=The Easter Rising|publisher=Sutton Publishing|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/easterrising0000foym/page/7 7\u20138]|isbn=0-7509-3433-6|url=https://archive.org/details/easterrising0000foym/page/7}}</ref> In an article entitled \"The Coming Revolution\" (November 1913) Pearse wrote: \n{{quote|As to what your work as an Irish Nationalist is to be, I cannot conjecture; I know what mine is to be, and would have you know yours and buckle yourselves to it. And it may be (nay, it is) that your and mine will lead us to a common meeting-place, and that on a certain day we shall stand together, with many more beside us, ready for a greater adventure than any of us has yet had, a trial and a triumph to be endured and achieved in common.<ref name=\"Se\u00e1n Cronin 1966, pg.15\">Se\u00e1n Cronin, Our Own Red Blood, Irish Freedom Press, New York, 1966, pg.15</ref>\n}}\n\nThe Home Rule Bill just failed to pass the [[House of Lords]], but the Lords' diminished power under the [[Parliament Act 1911]] meant that the Bill could only be delayed, not stopped. It was placed on the statute books with [[Royal Assent]] in September 1914, but its implementation was suspended for the duration of the First World War.\n\nJohn Redmond feared that his \"national authority\" might be circumvented by the Volunteers and decided to try to take control of the new movement. Despite opposition from the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Volunteer Executive agreed to share leadership with Redmond and a joint committee was set up. Pearse was opposed to this and was to write:<ref name=\"Se\u00e1n Cronin 1966, pg.15\"/>\n\n{{quote|The leaders in Ireland have nearly always left the people at the critical moment; they have sometimes sold them.

A majority followed Redmond into the [[National Volunteers]] in the belief that this would ensure Home Rule on their return. Pearse, exhilarated by the dramatic events of the European war, wrote in an article in December 1915:\n\n{{quote|It is patriotism that stirs the people.

When [[Eoin MacNeill]], the Chief of Staff of the Volunteers, learned what was being planned without the promised arms from Germany, he countermanded the orders via newspaper, causing the IRB to issue a last-minute order to go through with the plan the following day, greatly limiting the numbers who turned out for the rising.\n\nWhen the [[Easter Rising]] eventually began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, it was Pearse who read the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]] from outside the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]], the headquarters of the Rising. Pearse was the person most responsible for drafting the Proclamation, and he was chosen as President of the Republic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patrick Pearse|url=http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/patrick-pearse|website=Century Ireland|publisher=[[RT\u00c9]]/[[Boston College]]|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref> After six days of fighting, heavy civilian casualties and great destruction of property, Pearse issued the order to surrender.\n\nPearse and fourteen other leaders, including his brother Willie, were [[court-martial]]led and [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]].

In the middle decades of the 20th century Pearse was idolised by [[Irish nationalist]]s as the supreme idealist of their cause. With the outbreak of conflict in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1969, Pearse's legacy was used by the [[Provisional IRA]].\n\nPearse's ideas have also been seen within the context of European cultural history as a part of a rejection of \"reason\" by European social thinkers.<ref>Sean Farrell Moran, \"Patrick Pearse and the European Revolt Against Reason,\" Journal of the History of Ideas, 1989, 4.</ref> Additionally, his place within Catholicism, where his orthodoxy was challenged in the early 1970s,<ref>Francis J.
