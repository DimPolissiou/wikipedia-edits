people|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[politician]] who was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Kilmarnock and Loudoun (UK Parliament constituency)|Kilmarnock and Loudoun]] from [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] to [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]]. He was a member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]] under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]], until the latter moved him from both [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence]] and [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scottish Secretary]] in 2008.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrowne was born in [[Kilwinning]], [[North Ayrshire]], lived in [[Stevenston]] for the early part of his life, and was educated at the Catholic St Michael's Academy in [[Kilwinning]] and later at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he received a [[Master of Laws|degree]] in [[Scots law|law]].\n\n==Legal career==\nHe started his legal career in 1974 as an apprentice [[solicitor]] with the firm James Campbell & Co. On qualifying in 1976 he became an assistant solicitor with Ross, Harper and Murphy, and was promoted to partner in 1980. He became a partner in McCluskey Browne in 1985 and a council member of the [[Law Society of Scotland]] 1988-1992. He was admitted as an [[advocate]] in 1993, practising at the Scottish bar until 1997. He worked mainly in child law.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nBrowne contested the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] seat of [[Argyll and Bute (UK Parliament constituency)|Argyll and Bute]] at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 General Election]], and finished in fourth place behind the sitting [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[Ray Michie, Baroness Michie of Gallanach|Ray Michie]]. He was elected to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in 1993. Browne was selected to contest the safe Labour seat of Kilmarnock and Loudoun following the retirement of the sitting MP [[William McKelvey]]. Browne won the seat at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 General Election]] with a majority of 7,256. He made his [[maiden speech]] on 20 June 1997.\n\nBrowne joined the [[Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee]] on his election, and became the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] (PPS) to the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] [[Donald Dewar]] in 1998. After Dewar left the Cabinet in 1999, to seek election as the [[First Minister of Scotland]], Browne remained in post as PPS to the new Secretary of State [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]]. In 2000 he became the PPS to the [[Minister of State]] at the [[Northern Ireland Office]].\n\nOn 27 November 2009, Browne announced his intention not seek election in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8383783.stm | title=Des Browne to quit House of Commons after next election | work=[[BBC News Online]] | date=27 November 2009 | accessdate=2 January 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130055004/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8383783.stm | archive-date=30 November 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nBrowne currently acts as convenor of the [[Top Level Group|Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation]], established in October 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/08/nuclear-disarmament-cross-party-group | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Nuclear-free world ultimate aim of new cross-party pressure group | first=Julian | last=Borger | date=8 September 2009 | access-date=14 December 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/08/nuclear-disarmament-cross-party-group | archive-date=30 June 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Government Minister==\n[[File:Browne and gates.jpg|thumb|left|Browne meeting [[Robert Gates]] in Edinburgh during December 2007]]\nAfter the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 General Election]] Browne entered [[Tony Blair]]'s government as the [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]] at the [[Northern Ireland Office]].

He joined the Cabinet following the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 General Election]] as the [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] and became a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Member of the Privy Council]].\n\nBrowne was appointed [[Secretary of State for Defence]] on 5 May 2006. An advocate of the [[UK Trident programme]], in 2007 he successfully persuaded Parliament to vote to replace Trident.

This meant that although Labour won the largely Telford-based version of the constituency in the previous general election of 1992, the new constituency which was much more rural was likely to have been won by the Conservatives in 1992 if it had existed then.\n\nIn Parliament, he founded and chaired the Rural Group of Labour MPs which played a major part in shaping the Government's Rural White Paper and was subsequently appointed [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Alun Michael]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/pdfs/ruralwp/rural.pdf |title=Our Countryside: The Future \u2013 A Fair Deal for Rural England |date=November 2000 |author=[[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|MAFF]]/[[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions|DETR]] |id=2000 Cm 4909 |publisher=[[The Stationery Office]] |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214060314/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/pdfs/ruralwp/rural.pdf |archivedate=14 February 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=18 April 2000|title=Labour MPs unveil rural manifesto|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 November 2013|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/718297.stm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Blair finds red and green hard to match|first=Michael|last=Gove|authorlink=Michael Gove|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=28 February 1998|page=6}}</ref> His involvement in the [[Hunting Act 2004|bill to ban hunting]] led to his constituency being targeted by the [[Countryside Party (UK)|Countryside Party]] at the 2005 election.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hunt lobby aims to oust MPs|last=Hinsliff|first=Gaby|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date=18 June 2000|page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Don't get mad, get even' is new tactic of the pro-hunters|first=Melissa|last=Kite|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|location=London|date=23 January 2005|page=15|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1481810/Dont-get-mad-get-even-is-new-tactic-of-the-pro-hunters.html|accessdate=8 November 2013}}</ref> He was also a target of the strategy led by [[Michael Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]] to concentrate resources on key marginal seats which saw \u00a350,000 donated to the Conservative campaign to unseat him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tory funding unfair, Labour MP claims|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|location=Cardiff|date=22 December 2009|page=11|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-214964053|accessdate=8 November 2013|id=Archived at [[Questia Online Library]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Labour bids to outlaw Ashcroft's funding of Tory candidates|last=Brown|first=Colin|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=4 August 2007|page=1|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1P2-7536790/labour-bids-to-outlaw-ashcroft-s-funding-of-tory-candidates|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131108134553/http://www.questia.com/library/1P2-7536790/labour-bids-to-outlaw-ashcroft-s-funding-of-tory-candidates|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 November 2013|accessdate=8 November 2013|id=Archived at [[Questia Online Library]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nKnown for his campaigning commitment and skill \u2013 and once described by the ''Mail on Sunday'' (25 July 1999) as, with Peter Stothard, editor of ''The Times'', and Peter Mandelson, one of \"three men with a formidable combination of power and influence\" \u2013 he secured a saving of \u00a3240&nbsp;million in the annual NHS drugs budget following a successful campaign to regulate pharmaceutical company practices (2001).

One is that the Cherokee, an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking people, are relative latecomers to Southern [[Appalachia]], who may have migrated in late prehistoric times from northern areas around the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the  ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples. Another theory is that the Cherokee had been in the Southeast for thousands of years.\n\nResearchers in the 19th century recorded conversations with elders who recounted an oral tradition of the Cherokee people migrating south from the [[Great Lakes]] region in ancient times.<ref name=\"Mooney 1900 393\"/> They may have moved south into [[Muscogee Creek]] territory and settled at the sites of [[mound]]s built by the [[Mississippian culture]] and earlier moundbuilders. In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly attributed several Mississippian culture sites in Georgia to the Cherokee, including [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Mounds]]. However, other evidence{{Clarify|date=February 2019}} shows that the Cherokee did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built the mounds.\n\nThe Connestee people, believed to be ancestors of the Cherokee, occupied western North Carolina circa 200 to 600 CE.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/08/21/answer-man-did-cherokee-live-biltmore-estate-lands-early-settlers/581792001/|title=Answer Man: Did the Cherokee live on Biltmore Estate lands?

People created new art forms such as [[shell gorget]]s, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.\n\nDuring the Mississippian culture-period (800 to 1500 CE), local women developed a new variety of maize (corn) called eastern [[flint corn]]. It closely resembled modern corn and produced larger crops. The successful cultivation of corn surpluses allowed the rise of larger, more complex chiefdoms consisting of several villages and concentrated populations during this period. Corn became celebrated among numerous peoples in religious ceremonies, especially the [[Green Corn Ceremony]].\n\n==Early cultures==\nMuch of what is known about pre-18th-century Native American cultures has come from records of Spanish expeditions. The earliest ones of the mid-16th-century encountered people of the [[Mississippian culture]], the ancestors to later tribes in the Southeast such as the [[Muscogee]] and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]]. Specifically in 1540-41, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through what was later characterized as Cherokee country by English colonists based on their historical encounter. De Soto's expedition visited villages in present-day western Georgia and eastern Tennessee, recording them as ruled by the [[Coosa chiefdom]]. It is now considered to be a chiefdom ancestral to the [[Muscogee Creek people]], who are from a different language and cultural group. The Spanish recorded a '''Chalaque''' nation as living around the [[Keowee River]] where North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia meet.<ref>Mooney</ref> As some of this work was not translated into English until the 20th century, alternative views had developed among English-speaking historians, related to the limited understanding by English colonists of historic Native American cultures in the Southeast. In addition, the dominance of English colonists in the Southeast led to a discounting of Spanish sources for some time in their construction of history of the area.\n\nThe American writer [[John Howard Payne]] wrote about pre-19th-century Cherokee culture and society. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional two-part societal structure. A \"white\" organization of elders represented the seven clans. As Payne recounted, this group, which was [[hereditary]] and priestly, was responsible for religious activities, such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the \"red\" organization, was responsible for warfare. The Cherokee considered warfare a polluting activity. After warfare, the warriors required purification by the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century.\n\nResearchers have debated the reasons for the change. Some historians believe the decline in priestly power originated with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the ''[[Ani-kutani]]''.<ref name = \"Irwina-1992\">Irwin 1992.</ref> [[Ethnography|Ethnographer]] [[James Mooney]], who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.<ref>Mooney, p. 392.</ref> By the time that Mooney was studying the people, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/>\n\nAnother major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the ''didanvwisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c5\u13eb\u13cd\u13a9}}), Cherokee [[medicine man|medicine men]], after [[Sequoyah]]'s creation of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s. Initially only the ''didanvwisgi'' learned to write and read such materials, which were considered extremely powerful in a spiritual sense.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/> Later, the syllabary and writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.\n\nUnlike most other Native Americans in the American Southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]], an indication of their migration from another area. Since the [[Great Lakes]] region was the territory of most Iroquoian-language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. This view is supported by the Cherokee [[oral history]] tradition. According to the scholars' theory, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], another Iroquoian-speaking people who inhabited the Southeast in historic times, and the Cherokee broke off from the major group during its northern <!-- Have not read theory of Iroquois migration to the north - not typical of patterns across the continent --> migration.\n\nOther historians hold that, judging from linguistic and cultural data, the Tuscarora people migrated South from other Iroquoian-speaking people in the Great Lakes region in ancient times. After extended harsh warfare in the Southeast, in the 1700s, the Tuscarora left the area and \"returned\" to the New York area, counting their tribal migration complete by 1722. The Iroquois Five Nations accepted the Tuscarora as the Sixth Nation of [[Haudenosaunee|their political confederacy]], known as the ''Haudenosaunee''.<ref>[http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_041100_tuscarora.htm David Landy, \"Tuscarora\"], ''Encyclopedia of North American Indians'', Cengage Learning Website, Houghton Mifflin Company, accessed January 12, 2010.</ref>\n\nLinguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting they had migrated long ago. Scholars posit a split between the groups in the distant past, perhaps 3500\u20133800 years ago.<ref name=\"mooney\">{{Cite book| last = Mooney | first = James | authorlink = James Mooney | title = Myths of the Cherokee | origyear = 1900 | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | isbn = 0-486-28907-9}}</ref> [[Glottochronology]] studies suggest the split occurred between about 1,500 and 1,800 BCE.<ref>Glottochronology from: Lounsbury, Floyd (1961), and Mithun, Marianne (1981), cited in [http://www.famsi.org/research/hopkins/SouthEastUSLanguages.pdf Nicholas A.

The Cherokee were victorious in the [[Battle of Taliwa]].  British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to defend against the French in the [[Seven Years' War]], which was fought across Europe and was called the [[French and Indian War]] on the North American front. These included [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]] near Chota.  In 1756 the Cherokee were allies of the British in the French and Indian War.

The American Indians used this territory as a hunting ground by right of conquest; it had hardly been inhabited for years.  The conflict in Kentucky sparked the beginning of what was known as [[Dunmore's War]] (1773\u20131774).\n\nIn 1776, allied with the Shawnee led by [[Cornstalk]], Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina in the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars#The Second Cherokee War|Second Cherokee War]]. [[Overhill Cherokee]] [[Nancy Ward]], [[Dragging Canoe]]'s cousin, warned settlers of impending attacks. Provincial militias retaliated, destroying more than 50 Cherokee towns. North Carolina militia in 1776 and 1780 invaded and destroyed the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill towns]]. In 1777, surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the new states.\n\n[[Dragging Canoe]] and his band settled along [[Chickamauga Creek]] near present-day [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where they established 11 new towns. [[Chickamauga Town]] was his headquarters and the colonists tended to call his entire band the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga]] to distinguish them from other Cherokee. From here he fought a [[Cherokee\u2013American wars|guerrilla war]] against settlers, which lasted from 1776 to 1794. These are known informally as the Cherokee\u2013American wars, but this is not an historians' term.  The first Treaty of [[Tellico Blockhouse]], signed November 7, 1794, finally brought peace between the Cherokee and Americans, who had achieved independence from the British Crown. In 1805, the Cherokee ceded their lands between the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck rivers]] (i.e. the [[Cumberland Plateau]]) to [[Tennessee]].\n\n====Scots (and other Europeans) among the Cherokee in the 18th century====\nThe traders and British government agents dealing with the southern tribes in general, and the Cherokee in particular, were nearly all of Scottish ancestry, with many documented as being from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. A few were Scots-Irish, English, French, and German (see [[Scottish Indian trade]]).  Many of these men married women from their host peoples and remained after the fighting had ended. Some had mixed-race children who would later become significant leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes of the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].<ref>Mooney, James.

Some attained the honorary status of minor chiefs and/or members of significant delegations.\n\nBy contrast, a large portion of the settlers encroaching on the Native American territories were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], Irish from [[Ulster]] who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the English plantation of northern Ireland. They also tended to support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scots-Irish who were Loyalists, such as [[Simon Girty]].\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Acculturation====\nThe Cherokee lands between the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] rivers were remote enough from white settlers to remain independent after the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]].  The [[deerskin trade]] was no longer feasible on their greatly reduced lands, and over the next several decades, the people of the fledgling [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] began to build a new society modeled on the white Southern United States.\n[[File:Major ridge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Major Ridge in 1834, from ''[[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]]''.]]\n\n[[George Washington]] sought to 'civilize' Southeastern American Indians, through programs overseen by the [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]].  He encouraged the Cherokee to abandon their communal land-tenure and settle on individual farmsteads, which was facilitated by the destruction of many American Indian towns during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The [[deerskin trade]] brought [[white-tailed deer]] to the brink of extinction, and as pigs and cattle were introduced, they became the principal sources of meat.  The government supplied the tribes with [[spinning wheel]]s and cotton-seed, and men were taught to fence and plow the land, in contrast to their traditional division in which crop cultivation was woman's labor.  Americans instructed the women in weaving.  Eventually Hawkins helped them set up smithys, gristmills and cotton plantations.\n\nThe Cherokee organized a national government under Principal Chiefs [[Little Turkey]] (1788\u20131801), [[Black Fox (Cherokee chief)|Black Fox]] (1801\u20131811), and [[Pathkiller]] (1811\u20131827), all former warriors of [[Dragging Canoe]].  The 'Cherokee triumvirate' of [[James Vann]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] and [[Charles R. Hicks]] advocated acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming.  In 1801 they invited [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries from [[North Carolina]] to teach Christianity and the 'arts of civilized life.'  The Moravians and later [[Congregationalist]] missionaries ran boarding schools, and a select few students were educated at the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] school in [[Connecticut]].\n\nIn 1806 a [[Federal Road (Cherokee lands)|Federal Road]] from [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] was built through Cherokee land. Chief [[James Vann]] opened a tavern, inn and ferry across the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and built a [[Chief Vann House Historic Site|cotton-plantation]] on a spur of the road from [[Athens, Georgia]] to [[Nashville]].  His son [[Joseph Vann|'Rich Joe' Vann]] developed the plantation to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}, cultivated by 150 slaves.

Cherokee warriors led by [[Major Ridge]] played a major role in General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. Major Ridge moved his family to [[Rome, Georgia]], where he built a [[Chieftains (Rome, Georgia)|substantial house]], developed a large plantation and ran a ferry on the [[Oostanaula River]].  Although he never learned English, he sent his son and nephews to New England to be educated in mission schools. His interpreter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], the descendant of several generations of Cherokee women and Scots fur-traders, built a plantation and operated a trading firm and a ferry at Ross' Landing ([[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]). During this period, divisions arose between the acculturated elite and the great majority of Cherokee, who clung to traditional ways of life.\n\nAround 1809 [[Sequoyah]] began developing a written form of the Cherokee language. He spoke no English, but his experiences as a silversmith dealing regularly with white settlers, and as a warrior at Horseshoe Bend, convinced him the Cherokee needed to develop writing. In 1821, he introduced [[Cherokee syllabary]], the first written syllabic form of an American Indian language outside of [[Mesoamerican scripts|Central America]].  Initially his innovation was opposed by both Cherokee traditionalists and white missionaries, who sought to encourage the use of English. When Sequoyah taught children to read and write with the syllabary, he reached the adults. By the 1820s, the Cherokee had a higher rate of literacy than the whites around them in Georgia.\n\n[[File:New Echota.jpg|thumb|left|Cherokee National Council building, [[New Echota]]]]\n\nIn 1819, the Cherokee began holding council meetings at New Town, at the headwaters of the [[Oostanaula River|Oostanaula]] (near present-day [[Calhoun, Georgia]]).

They had developed a police force, a judicial system, and a National Committee.\n\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two-tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son [[John Ridge]]. Convinced the tribe's survival required English-speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] as Principal Chief.

Georgia Governor [[George Troup]] and his cousin [[William McIntosh]], chief of the Lower Creek, signed the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)|Treaty of Indian Springs]] in 1825, ceding the last [[Muscogee (Creek)]] lands claimed by Georgia.

In 1829, gold was discovered at [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], on Cherokee land claimed by Georgia.  The [[Georgia Gold Rush]] was the first in U.S. history, and state officials demanded that the federal government expel the Cherokee.

Georgia sold Cherokee lands to its citizens in a [[Georgia Land Lottery|Land Lottery]], and the state militia occupied [[New Echota]].  The Cherokee National Council, led by John Ross, fled to [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]], a remote valley north of Georgia's land claim.

On June 22, 1839, a party of twenty-five Ross supporters assassinated Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot.  The party included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald, James and Joseph Spear. Boudinot's brother [[Stand Watie]] fought and survived that day, escaping to [[Arkansas]].\n\nIn 1827, [[Sequoyah]] had led a delegation of Old Settlers to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the exchange of Arkansas land for land in Indian Territory. After the Trail of Tears, he helped mediate divisions between the Old Settlers and the rival factions of the more recent arrivals. In 1839, as President of the Western Cherokee, Sequoyah signed an Act of Union with John Ross that reunited the two groups of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n=====Eastern Band=====\n[[File:C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief.jpg|thumb|left|upright|C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief, painted by [[George Catlin]], 1834]]\n\nThe Cherokee living along the [[Oconaluftee River]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] were the most conservative and isolated from European\u2013American settlements. They rejected the reforms of the Cherokee Nation.  When the Cherokee government ceded all territory east of the [[Little Tennessee River]] to [[North Carolina]] in 1819, they withdrew from the Nation.<ref>Theda Purdue, ''Native Carolinians: The Indians of North Carolina'', pg. 40</ref> [[William Holland Thomas]], a white store owner and state legislator from [[Jackson County, North Carolina]], helped over 600 Cherokee from [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Qualla Town]] obtain North Carolina citizenship, which exempted them from forced removal.

An additional 400 Cherokee stayed on reserves in Southeast Tennessee, North Georgia, and Northeast Alabama, as citizens of their respective states.  They were mostly mixed-race and Cherokee women married to white men. Together, these groups were the ancestors of the federally recognized [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], and some of the state-recognized tribes in surrounding states.\n\n====Civil War====\n[[File:Cherokee Confederates Reunion.gif|right|325px|thumb|Cherokee confederates reunion in [[New Orleans]], 1902.]]\n\n{{Further|Cherokee in the American Civil War|Native Americans in the Civil War}}\nThe [[American Civil War]] was devastating for both East and Western Cherokee.

(March 10, 2007)</ref> Cherokee in Indian Territory divided into Union and Confederate factions, with most supporting the Confederacy.\n\n[[Stand Watie]], the leader of the Ridge Party, raised a regiment for [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] service in 1861. [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], who had reluctantly agreed to ally with the Confederacy, was captured by Federal troops in 1862. He lived in self-imposed exile in [[Philadelphia]], supporting the Union. In Indian Territory, the national council of those who supported the Union voted to abolish slavery in the Cherokee Nation in 1863, but they were not the majority slaveholders and the vote had little effect on those supporting the Confederacy.\n\nWatie was elected Principal Chief of the pro-Confederacy majority. A master of hit-and-run cavalry tactics, Watie fought those Cherokee loyal to John Ross and Federal troops in [[Indian Territory]] and [[Arkansas]], capturing Union supply trains and [[steamboats]], and saving a Confederate army by covering their retreat after the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862. He became a Brigadier General of the [[Confederate States]]; the only other American Indian to hold the rank in the American Civil War was [[Ely S. Parker]] with the Union Army.  On June 25, 1865, two months after [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]], Stand Watie became the last Confederate General to stand down.\n\n====Reconstruction and late 19th century====\n[[File:Group of Cherokee, Yankton, and Sisseton 1909.jpg|thumb|left|William Penn (Cherokee), His Shield (Yanktonai), Levi Big Eagle (Yanktonai), Bear Ghost (Yanktonai) and Black Moustache (Sisseton).]]\nAfter the Civil War, the U.S. government required the Cherokee Nation to sign a new treaty, because of its alliance with the Confederacy. The U.S. required the 1866 Treaty to provide for the [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of all Cherokee slaves, and full citizenship to all Cherokee [[freedmen]] and all African Americans who chose to continue to reside within tribal lands, so that they \"shall have all the rights of native Cherokees.\"<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/VOL2/treaties/che0942.htm \"Treaty with the Cherokee, 1866.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630013134/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/VOL2/treaties/che0942.htm |date=June 30, 2010 }} ''Oklahoma Historical Society: Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties.

Many Cherokee Freedmen have been active politically within the tribe.\n\nThe US government also acquired [[easement]] rights to the western part of the territory, which became the [[Oklahoma Territory]], for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans would be better off if each family owned its own land. The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land into individual household allotments. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. The U.S. government counted the remainder of tribal land as \"surplus\" and sold it to non-Cherokee individuals.\n\nThe [[Curtis Act of 1898]] dismantled tribal governments, courts, schools, and other civic institutions. For Indian Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a combined state. In 1905, the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the [[Indian Territory]] proposed the creation of the [[State of Sequoyah]] as one to be exclusively Native American, but failed to gain support in Washington, D.C.. In 1907, the [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]] and [[Indian Territory|Indian Territories]] entered the union as the state of [[Oklahoma]].\n[[File:CherokeeOTSA.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of present-day Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdiction Area (dark blue)]]\n\nBy the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokee were laboring under the constraints of a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society. In the aftermath of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchise]] all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that divided society into \"white\" and \"colored\", mostly to control freedmen. Cherokee and other Native Americans were classified on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disenfranchisement as former slaves. They also often lost their historical documentation for identification as Indians, when the Southern states classified them as colored.  Blacks and Native Americans would not have their constitutional rights as U.S. citizens enforced until after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] secured passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, and the federal government began to monitor voter registration and elections, as well as other programs.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Cultural institutions===\nThe [[Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual]], Inc., of Cherokee, North Carolina is the oldest continuing Native American art co-operative.

Advancement to leadership positions was generally subject to approval by the women elders.  In addition, the society was [[matrifocal]]; customarily, a married couple lived with or near the woman's family, so she could be aided by her female relatives.  Her oldest brother was a more important mentor to her sons than was their father, who belonged to another clan. Traditionally, couples, particularly women, can divorce freely.<ref>Perdue (1999), pp. 44, 57\u20138</ref>\n\nIt was unusual for a Cherokee man to marry a European-American woman.  The children of such a union were disadvantaged, as they would not belong to the nation.  They would be born outside the clans and traditionally were not considered Cherokee citizens. This is because of the matrilineal aspect of Cherokee culture.<ref name=\"Perdue 1999, p. 176\"/> As the Cherokee began to adopt some elements of European-American culture in the early 19th century, they sent elite young men, such as [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] to American schools for education. After Ridge had married a European-American woman from Connecticut and Boudinot was engaged to another, the Cherokee Council in 1825 passed a law making children of such unions full citizens of the tribe, as if their mothers were Cherokee. This was a way to protect the families of men expected to be leaders of the tribe.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yarbough |first=Fay |title=Legislating Women's Sexuality: Cherokee Marriage Laws |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=38 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=385\u2013406 [p. 388] |doi=10.1353/jsh.2004.0144 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the U.S. government put new restrictions on marriage between a Cherokee and non-Cherokee, although it was still relatively common. A European-American man could legally marry a Cherokee woman by petitioning the federal court, after gaining approval of ten of her blood relatives.  Once married, the man had status as an \"Intermarried White,\" a member of the Cherokee tribe with restricted rights; for instance, he could not hold any tribal office. He remained a citizen of and under the laws of the United States. [[Common law marriage]]s were more popular. Such \"Intermarried Whites\" were listed in a separate category on the registers of the [[Dawes Rolls]], prepared for allotment of plots of land to individual households of members of the tribe, in the early twentieth-century federal policy for [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the Native Americans.\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Cherokee ethnobotany]]\n\n=== Gender roles ===\nMen and women have historically played important yet, at times different, roles in Cherokee society. Historically, these roles have tended to support the idea of a balanced [[gender binary]], with gender determining social and ceremonial roles. Historically, women have primarily been the heads of households, owning the home and the land, farmers of the family's land, and \"mothers\" of the [[clan]]s.

However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to [[Unicode]], the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet.\n\nBecause of the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Examples include ''ditiyohihi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d8\u13f2\u13af\u13af}}), which means \"he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose,\" meaning \"attorney.\" Another example is ''didaniyisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c2\u13f1\u13cd\u13a9}}) which means \"the final catcher\" or \"he catches them finally and conclusively,\" meaning \"policeman.\"\n\nMany words, however, have been borrowed from the English language, such as ''gasoline'', which in Cherokee is {{lang|chr|ga-so-li-ne}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a6\u13d0\u13b5\u13c1}}). Many other words were borrowed from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 20th century. One example relates to a town in Oklahoma named \"Nowata\". The word {{lang|chr|nowata}} is a [[Delaware languages|Delaware Indian]] word for \"welcome\" (more precisely the Delaware word is {{lang|del|nu-wi-ta}} which can mean \"welcome\" or \"friend\" in the Delaware Language). The white settlers of the area used the name \"nowata\" for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware Language, called the town ''Amadikanigvnagvna'' ({{lang|chr|\u13a0\u13b9\u13d7\u13a7\u13c2\u13ac\u13be\u13ac\u13be}})  which means \"the water is all gone from here\", i.e. \"no water\".\n\nOther examples of borrowed words are {{lang|chr|kawi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a7\u13eb}}) for ''coffee'' and {{lang|chr|watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13e9\u13e5}}) for ''watch'' (which led to {{lang|chr|utana watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a4\u13d4\u13be \u13e9\u13e5}}) or \"big watch\" for ''clock'').\n\nThe following table is an example of Cherokee text and its translation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"background:#fff;\"| \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9: \u13c2\u13a6\u13d3 \u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb \u13c2\u13a8\u13ab\u13d3\u13b8\u13be \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c2\u13e0\u13f1 \u13a4\u13be\u13d5\u13bf \u13da\u13f3\u13a7\u13db \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2. \u13a8\u13e5\u13c1\u13b3 \u13a4\u13be\u13d3\u13c5\u13d6\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c3\u13df\u13cd\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13cc\u13ca \u13a8\u13d2 \u13e7\u13c2\u13b8\u13eb\u13cd\u13d3\u13c1\u13d7 \u13a0\u13be\u13df\u13c5\u13e2 \u13a0\u13d3\u13c5\u13d9 \u13ac\u13d7.<ref name=\"Omniglot\">{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cherokee.htm |title=Cherokee syllabary |accessdate=May 14, 2009 |date=1998\u20132009 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\" | [[Cherokee language|Tsalagi]]: {{lang|chr|Nigada aniyvwi nigeguda'lvna ale unihloyi unadehna duyukdv gesv'i.

They established a governmental system modeled on that of the United States, with an elected principal chief, senate, and house of representatives. On April 10, 1810 the seven Cherokee clans met and began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government.

The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-quarter Keetoowah Cherokee blood quantum (equivalent to one grandparent), and the UKB does not allow members that have relinquished their membership to re-enroll in the UKB.<ref>[http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html Enrollment.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609034110/http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html |date=June 9, 2010 }} ''United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees.''

Before 1975, they were considered a part of the Cherokee Nation, as reflected in briefs filed before the Indian Claims Commission. At one time W.W. Keeler served not only as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, but at the same time held the position as Chairman of the Texas Cherokee and Associated Bands (TCAB) Executive Committee.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Cherokee constitution in 1976, TCAB descendants whose ancestors had remained a part of the physical Mount Tabor Community in [[Rusk County, Texas]] were excluded from citizenship. Their ancestors did not appear on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes, registered under the Dawes Commission. However, most if not all TCAB descendants did have an ancestor listed on either the Guion-Miller or [[Old settler (Cherokee)|Old settler]] rolls.\n\nWhile most Mount Tabor residents returned to the Cherokee Nation following the death of John Ross in 1866, today there is a sizable group that is well documented but outside that body. It is not actively seeking a status clarification. They do have treaty rights going back to the [[Treaty of Bird's Fort]]. From the end of the Civil War until 1975, they were associated with the Cherokee Nation. The TCAB formed as a political organization in 1871 led by [[William Penn Adair]] and Clement Neely Vann. Descendants of the Texas Cherokees and the Mount Tabor Community joined together to try to gain redress from treaty violations, stemming from the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. Today, most Mount Tabor descendants are in fact members of the Cherokee Nation. Only some 800 are stuck in limbo without status as Cherokees. Many of them still reside in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas.\n\nOther remnant populations continue to exist throughout the Southeast United States and individually in the states surrounding Oklahoma. Many of these people trace descent from persons enumerated on official rolls such as the Guion-Miller, Drennan, Mullay and Henderson Rolls, among others. Other descendants trace their heritage through the treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government which gave individual allotments to Cherokees.  State recognized Tribes require varying levels of genealogical proof that applicants are of Cherokee descent. Current enrollment guidelines of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have been approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Such facts were pointed out by Cherokee citizens of CN during the Constitutional Convention held to ratify a new governing document. The document that was eventually ratified by a small portion of the electorate. However, the tribe does not have the power to change its membership procedures and maintain federal recognition. Any changes to the tribe's enrollment procedures must be approved by the Department of Interior. Under 25 CFR 83 the Office of Federal Acknowledgment is required to first apply its own anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods to any request for change by the tribe. It then forwards its recommendations to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs for consideration.<ref>* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/aoc.htm Act of Congress Roll, 1854]\n* [http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/default.aspx (Pre-convention \u2013 1999) Oral and Written Testimonies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104091145/http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/Default.aspx |date=January 4, 2011 }}\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/census.htm Cherokee Census Rolls, a follow-up]\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/chapman.htm Chapman Roll Eastern Cherokees, 1851]\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 Treaty with the Cherokee, 1817] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103150436/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 |date=November 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Cherokee Freedmen===\n{{Main|Cherokee Freedmen Controversy}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CNSeal.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The seal of the Cherokee Nation.]] -->\n\nThe Cherokee freedmen, descendants of African American slaves owned by citizens of the Cherokee Nation during the [[Antebellum Period]], were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866.

One is that the Cherokee, an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking people, are relative latecomers to Southern [[Appalachia]], who may have migrated in late prehistoric times from northern areas around the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the  ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples. Another theory is that the Cherokee had been in the Southeast for thousands of years.\n\nResearchers in the 19th century recorded conversations with elders who recounted an oral tradition of the Cherokee people migrating south from the [[Great Lakes]] region in ancient times.<ref name=\"Mooney 1900 393\"/> They may have moved south into [[Muscogee Creek]] territory and settled at the sites of [[mound]]s built by the [[Mississippian culture]] and earlier moundbuilders. In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly attributed several Mississippian culture sites in Georgia to the Cherokee, including [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Mounds]]. However, other evidence{{Clarify|date=February 2019}} shows that the Cherokee did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built the mounds.\n\nThe Connestee people, believed to be ancestors of the Cherokee, occupied western North Carolina circa 200 to 600 CE.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/08/21/answer-man-did-cherokee-live-biltmore-estate-lands-early-settlers/581792001/|title=Answer Man: Did the Cherokee live on Biltmore Estate lands?

People created new art forms such as [[shell gorget]]s, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.\n\nDuring the Mississippian culture-period (800 to 1500 CE), local women developed a new variety of maize (corn) called eastern [[flint corn]]. It closely resembled modern corn and produced larger crops. The successful cultivation of corn surpluses allowed the rise of larger, more complex chiefdoms consisting of several villages and concentrated populations during this period. Corn became celebrated among numerous peoples in religious ceremonies, especially the [[Green Corn Ceremony]].\n\n==Early cultures==\nMuch of what is known about pre-18th-century Native American cultures has come from records of Spanish expeditions. The earliest ones of the mid-16th-century encountered people of the [[Mississippian culture]], the ancestors to later tribes in the Southeast such as the [[Muscogee]] and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]]. Specifically in 1540-41, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through what was later characterized as Cherokee country by English colonists based on their historical encounter. De Soto's expedition visited villages in present-day western Georgia and eastern Tennessee, recording them as ruled by the [[Coosa chiefdom]]. It is now considered to be a chiefdom ancestral to the [[Muscogee Creek people]], who are from a different language and cultural group. The Spanish recorded a '''Chalaque''' nation as living around the [[Keowee River]] where North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia meet.<ref>Mooney</ref> As some of this work was not translated into English until the 20th century, alternative views had developed among English-speaking historians, related to the limited understanding by English colonists of historic Native American cultures in the Southeast. In addition, the dominance of English colonists in the Southeast led to a discounting of Spanish sources for some time in their construction of history of the area.\n\nThe American writer [[John Howard Payne]] wrote about pre-19th-century Cherokee culture and society. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional two-part societal structure. A \"white\" organization of elders represented the seven clans. As Payne recounted, this group, which was [[hereditary]] and priestly, was responsible for religious activities, such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the \"red\" organization, was responsible for warfare. The Cherokee considered warfare a polluting activity. After warfare, the warriors required purification by the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century.\n\nResearchers have debated the reasons for the change. Some historians believe the decline in priestly power originated with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the ''[[Ani-kutani]]''.<ref name = \"Irwina-1992\">Irwin 1992.</ref> [[Ethnography|Ethnographer]] [[James Mooney]], who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.<ref>Mooney, p. 392.</ref> By the time that Mooney was studying the people, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/>\n\nAnother major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the ''didanvwisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c5\u13eb\u13cd\u13a9}}), Cherokee [[medicine man|medicine men]], after [[Sequoyah]]'s creation of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s. Initially only the ''didanvwisgi'' learned to write and read such materials, which were considered extremely powerful in a spiritual sense.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/> Later, the syllabary and writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.\n\nUnlike most other Native Americans in the American Southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]], an indication of their migration from another area. Since the [[Great Lakes]] region was the territory of most Iroquoian-language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. This view is supported by the Cherokee [[oral history]] tradition. According to the scholars' theory, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], another Iroquoian-speaking people who inhabited the Southeast in historic times, and the Cherokee broke off from the major group during its northern <!-- Have not read theory of Iroquois migration to the north - not typical of patterns across the continent --> migration.\n\nOther historians hold that, judging from linguistic and cultural data, the Tuscarora people migrated South from other Iroquoian-speaking people in the Great Lakes region in ancient times. After extended harsh warfare in the Southeast, in the 1700s, the Tuscarora left the area and \"returned\" to the New York area, counting their tribal migration complete by 1722. The Iroquois Five Nations accepted the Tuscarora as the Sixth Nation of [[Haudenosaunee|their political confederacy]], known as the ''Haudenosaunee''.<ref>[http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_041100_tuscarora.htm David Landy, \"Tuscarora\"], ''Encyclopedia of North American Indians'', Cengage Learning Website, Houghton Mifflin Company, accessed January 12, 2010.</ref>\n\nLinguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting they had migrated long ago.

This custom does not belong originally to the Cherokees, but taken by them from the Shawnese, or other northern nations.\n\nThey that can afford it wear a collar of wampum, which are beads cut out of clam-shells, a silver breast-plate, and bracelets on their arms and wrists of the same metal, a bit of cloth over their private parts, a shirt of the English make, a sort of cloth-boots, and [[moccasins|mockasons]] ([[sic]]), which are shoes of a make peculiar to the Americans, ornamented with porcupine-quills; a large mantle or match-coat thrown over all complete their dress at home ...<ref name=Timberlake>{{cite web|last=Timberlake|first=Henry|title=Memoirs of Henry Timberlake|publisher=London 1765, pp. 49-51}}</ref>}}\n\nFrom 1753 to 1755, battles broke out between the Cherokee and Muscogee over disputed hunting grounds in [[North Georgia]]. The Cherokee were victorious in the [[Battle of Taliwa]].  British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to defend against the French in the [[Seven Years' War]], which was fought across Europe and was called the [[French and Indian War]] on the North American front. These included [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]] near Chota.  In 1756 the Cherokee were allies of the British in the French and Indian War.  Serious misunderstandings arose quickly between the two allies, resulting in the 1760 [[Anglo-Cherokee War]].<ref name=\"Rozema, pp. 17\u201323\">Rozema, pp. 17\u201323.</ref>\n\nKing George III's [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, as his government tried to afford some protection from colonial encroachment to the Cherokee and other tribes.

Retrieved September 21, 2009.</ref> [[Daniel Boone]] and his party tried to settle in Kentucky, but the Shawnee, [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Mingo]], and some Cherokee attacked a scouting and forage party that included Boone's son.  The American Indians used this territory as a hunting ground by right of conquest; it had hardly been inhabited for years.  The conflict in Kentucky sparked the beginning of what was known as [[Dunmore's War]] (1773\u20131774).\n\nIn 1776, allied with the Shawnee led by [[Cornstalk]], Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina in the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars#The Second Cherokee War|Second Cherokee War]]. [[Overhill Cherokee]] [[Nancy Ward]], [[Dragging Canoe]]'s cousin, warned settlers of impending attacks. Provincial militias retaliated, destroying more than 50 Cherokee towns. North Carolina militia in 1776 and 1780 invaded and destroyed the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill towns]]. In 1777, surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the new states.\n\n[[Dragging Canoe]] and his band settled along [[Chickamauga Creek]] near present-day [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where they established 11 new towns. [[Chickamauga Town]] was his headquarters and the colonists tended to call his entire band the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga]] to distinguish them from other Cherokee. From here he fought a [[Cherokee\u2013American wars|guerrilla war]] against settlers, which lasted from 1776 to 1794. These are known informally as the Cherokee\u2013American wars, but this is not an historians' term.  The first Treaty of [[Tellico Blockhouse]], signed November 7, 1794, finally brought peace between the Cherokee and Americans, who had achieved independence from the British Crown. In 1805, the Cherokee ceded their lands between the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck rivers]] (i.e. the [[Cumberland Plateau]]) to [[Tennessee]].\n\n====Scots (and other Europeans) among the Cherokee in the 18th century====\nThe traders and British government agents dealing with the southern tribes in general, and the Cherokee in particular, were nearly all of Scottish ancestry, with many documented as being from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. A few were Scots-Irish, English, French, and German (see [[Scottish Indian trade]]).  Many of these men married women from their host peoples and remained after the fighting had ended. Some had mixed-race children who would later become significant leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes of the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].<ref>Mooney, James. ''History, Myths, and Scared Formulas of the Cherokee'', p. 83. (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1900).</ref>\n\nNotable traders, agents, and refugee Tories among the Cherokee included [[John Stuart (loyalist)|John Stuart]], Henry Stuart, Alexander Cameron, John McDonald, John Joseph Vann (father of [[James Vann]]), Daniel Ross (father of [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]]), John Walker Sr., John McLemore (father of Bob), William Buchanan, John Watts (father of [[John Watts (Cherokee chief)|John Watts Jr.]]), [[Chisholm Tavern (Knoxville)|John D.

Some attained the honorary status of minor chiefs and/or members of significant delegations.\n\nBy contrast, a large portion of the settlers encroaching on the Native American territories were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], Irish from [[Ulster]] who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the English plantation of northern Ireland. They also tended to support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scots-Irish who were Loyalists, such as [[Simon Girty]].\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Acculturation====\nThe Cherokee lands between the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] rivers were remote enough from white settlers to remain independent after the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]].  The [[deerskin trade]] was no longer feasible on their greatly reduced lands, and over the next several decades, the people of the fledgling [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] began to build a new society modeled on the white Southern United States.\n[[File:Major ridge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Major Ridge in 1834, from ''[[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]]''.]]\n\n[[George Washington]] sought to 'civilize' Southeastern American Indians, through programs overseen by the [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]].  He encouraged the Cherokee to abandon their communal land-tenure and settle on individual farmsteads, which was facilitated by the destruction of many American Indian towns during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The [[deerskin trade]] brought [[white-tailed deer]] to the brink of extinction, and as pigs and cattle were introduced, they became the principal sources of meat.  The government supplied the tribes with [[spinning wheel]]s and cotton-seed, and men were taught to fence and plow the land, in contrast to their traditional division in which crop cultivation was woman's labor.  Americans instructed the women in weaving.  Eventually Hawkins helped them set up smithys, gristmills and cotton plantations.\n\nThe Cherokee organized a national government under Principal Chiefs [[Little Turkey]] (1788\u20131801), [[Black Fox (Cherokee chief)|Black Fox]] (1801\u20131811), and [[Pathkiller]] (1811\u20131827), all former warriors of [[Dragging Canoe]].  The 'Cherokee triumvirate' of [[James Vann]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] and [[Charles R. Hicks]] advocated acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming.  In 1801 they invited [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries from [[North Carolina]] to teach Christianity and the 'arts of civilized life.'  The Moravians and later [[Congregationalist]] missionaries ran boarding schools, and a select few students were educated at the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] school in [[Connecticut]].\n\nIn 1806 a [[Federal Road (Cherokee lands)|Federal Road]] from [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] was built through Cherokee land. Chief [[James Vann]] opened a tavern, inn and ferry across the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and built a [[Chief Vann House Historic Site|cotton-plantation]] on a spur of the road from [[Athens, Georgia]] to [[Nashville]].  His son [[Joseph Vann|'Rich Joe' Vann]] developed the plantation to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}, cultivated by 150 slaves.  He exported cotton to England, and owned a [[steamboat]] on the [[Tennessee River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2726&hl=y |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Chief Vann House |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=September 23, 2005 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Cherokee allied with the U.S. against the nativist and pro-British [[Red Stick]] faction of the Upper Creek in the [[Creek War]] during the [[War of 1812]]. Cherokee warriors led by [[Major Ridge]] played a major role in General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. Major Ridge moved his family to [[Rome, Georgia]], where he built a [[Chieftains (Rome, Georgia)|substantial house]], developed a large plantation and ran a ferry on the [[Oostanaula River]].  Although he never learned English, he sent his son and nephews to New England to be educated in mission schools. His interpreter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], the descendant of several generations of Cherokee women and Scots fur-traders, built a plantation and operated a trading firm and a ferry at Ross' Landing ([[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]). During this period, divisions arose between the acculturated elite and the great majority of Cherokee, who clung to traditional ways of life.\n\nAround 1809 [[Sequoyah]] began developing a written form of the Cherokee language. He spoke no English, but his experiences as a silversmith dealing regularly with white settlers, and as a warrior at Horseshoe Bend, convinced him the Cherokee needed to develop writing. In 1821, he introduced [[Cherokee syllabary]], the first written syllabic form of an American Indian language outside of [[Mesoamerican scripts|Central America]].  Initially his innovation was opposed by both Cherokee traditionalists and white missionaries, who sought to encourage the use of English. When Sequoyah taught children to read and write with the syllabary, he reached the adults. By the 1820s, the Cherokee had a higher rate of literacy than the whites around them in Georgia.\n\n[[File:New Echota.jpg|thumb|left|Cherokee National Council building, [[New Echota]]]]\n\nIn 1819, the Cherokee began holding council meetings at New Town, at the headwaters of the [[Oostanaula River|Oostanaula]] (near present-day [[Calhoun, Georgia]]). In November 1825, New Town became the capital of the Cherokee Nation, and was renamed [[New Echota]], after the [[Overhill Cherokee]] principal town of [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/New_Echota_Historic_Site |title=New Echota Historic Site |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref> Sequoyah's syllabary was adopted. They had developed a police force, a judicial system, and a National Committee.\n\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two-tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son [[John Ridge]]. Convinced the tribe's survival required English-speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] as Principal Chief. A printing press was established at New Echota by the [[Vermont]] missionary [[Samuel Worcester]] and Major Ridge's nephew [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], who had taken the name of his [[Elias Boudinot|white benefactor]], a leader of the [[Continental Congress]] and [[New Jersey]] Congressman.

The [[Texas Cherokees]] were mostly neutral during the [[Texas War of Independence]].  In 1836, they signed a treaty with Texas President [[Sam Houston]], an adopted member of the Cherokee tribe.

These were the \n\"[[Old Settlers]]\", the first of the Cherokee to make their way to what would eventually become [[Indian Territory]] (modern day [[Oklahoma]]).  This effort was headed by Indian Agent [[Return J. Meigs Sr.|Return J. Meigs]], and was finalized with the signing of the [[Jackson and McMinn Treaty]], giving the Old Settlers undisputed title to the lands designated for their use.<ref name=\"Tenn\">[https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/treaties/ ''Treaties'']; Tennessee Encyclopedia, online; accessed October 2019</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Georgia focused on removing the Cherokee's neighbors, the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Lower Creek]].  Georgia Governor [[George Troup]] and his cousin [[William McIntosh]], chief of the Lower Creek, signed the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)|Treaty of Indian Springs]] in 1825, ceding the last [[Muscogee (Creek)]] lands claimed by Georgia.  The state's northwestern border reached the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]], the border of the Cherokee Nation.  In 1829, gold was discovered at [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], on Cherokee land claimed by Georgia.  The [[Georgia Gold Rush]] was the first in U.S. history, and state officials demanded that the federal government expel the Cherokee.  When [[Andrew Jackson]] was inaugurated as President in 1829, Georgia gained a strong ally in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  In 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the forcible relocation of American Indians east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] to a new Indian Territory.\n\nJackson claimed the removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing extinction as a people, which he considered the fate that \"...the [[Mohegan]], the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansett]], and the [[Lenape|Delaware]]\" had suffered.<ref>Wishart, p. 120</ref>  There is, however, ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting modern farming techniques.  A modern analysis shows that the area was in general in a state of economic surplus and could have accommodated both the Cherokee and new settlers.<ref>Wishart 1995.</ref>\n\nThe Cherokee brought their grievances to a US judicial review that set a precedent in [[Indian country]].  John Ross traveled to Washington, D.C., and won support from [[National Republican Party]] leaders [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. [[Samuel Worcester]] campaigned on behalf of the Cherokee in New England, where their cause was taken up by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (see [[Emerson's letter to Martin Van Buren|Emerson's 1838 letter to Martin Van Buren]]). In June 1830, a delegation led by Chief Ross defended Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]''.\n\nIn 1831 Georgia militia arrested [[Samuel Worcester]] for residing on Indian lands without a state permit, imprisoning him in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]].  In ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' (1832), the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] ruled that American Indian nations were \"distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights,\" and entitled to federal protection from the actions of state governments that infringed on their [[sovereignty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2720 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: \"Worcester v.

His landslide reelection in 1832 emboldened calls for Cherokee removal. Georgia sold Cherokee lands to its citizens in a [[Georgia Land Lottery|Land Lottery]], and the state militia occupied [[New Echota]].  The Cherokee National Council, led by John Ross, fled to [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]], a remote valley north of Georgia's land claim. Ross had the support of Cherokee traditionalists, who could not imagine removal from their ancestral lands.\n\n[[File:Cherokee beadwork sampler 1840 ohs.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Cherokee [[beadwork]] sampler, made at [[Dwight Presbyterian Mission|Dwight Mission]], Indian Territory, 19th century, collection of the [[Oklahoma History Center]] ]]\n\nA small group known as the \"Ridge Party\" or the \"Treaty Party\" saw relocation as inevitable and believed the Cherokee Nation needed to make the best deal to preserve their rights in Indian Territory. Led by [[Major Ridge]], [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], they represented the Cherokee elite, whose homes, plantations and businesses were confiscated, or under threat of being taken by white squatters with Georgia land-titles. With capital to acquire new lands, they were more inclined to accept relocation. On December 29, 1835, the \"Ridge Party\" signed the [[Treaty of New Echota]], stipulating terms and conditions for the removal of the Cherokee Nation.

On June 22, 1839, a party of twenty-five Ross supporters assassinated Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot.  The party included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald, James and Joseph Spear. Boudinot's brother [[Stand Watie]] fought and survived that day, escaping to [[Arkansas]].\n\nIn 1827, [[Sequoyah]] had led a delegation of Old Settlers to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the exchange of Arkansas land for land in Indian Territory. After the Trail of Tears, he helped mediate divisions between the Old Settlers and the rival factions of the more recent arrivals. In 1839, as President of the Western Cherokee, Sequoyah signed an Act of Union with John Ross that reunited the two groups of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n=====Eastern Band=====\n[[File:C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief.jpg|thumb|left|upright|C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief, painted by [[George Catlin]], 1834]]\n\nThe Cherokee living along the [[Oconaluftee River]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] were the most conservative and isolated from European\u2013American settlements.

A master of hit-and-run cavalry tactics, Watie fought those Cherokee loyal to John Ross and Federal troops in [[Indian Territory]] and [[Arkansas]], capturing Union supply trains and [[steamboats]], and saving a Confederate army by covering their retreat after the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862.

The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land into individual household allotments. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. The U.S. government counted the remainder of tribal land as \"surplus\" and sold it to non-Cherokee individuals.\n\nThe [[Curtis Act of 1898]] dismantled tribal governments, courts, schools, and other civic institutions. For Indian Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a combined state. In 1905, the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the [[Indian Territory]] proposed the creation of the [[State of Sequoyah]] as one to be exclusively Native American, but failed to gain support in Washington, D.C.. In 1907, the [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]] and [[Indian Territory|Indian Territories]] entered the union as the state of [[Oklahoma]].\n[[File:CherokeeOTSA.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of present-day Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdiction Area (dark blue)]]\n\nBy the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokee were laboring under the constraints of a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society. In the aftermath of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchise]] all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that divided society into \"white\" and \"colored\", mostly to control freedmen. Cherokee and other Native Americans were classified on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disenfranchisement as former slaves. They also often lost their historical documentation for identification as Indians, when the Southern states classified them as colored.  Blacks and Native Americans would not have their constitutional rights as U.S. citizens enforced until after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] secured passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, and the federal government began to monitor voter registration and elections, as well as other programs.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Cultural institutions===\nThe [[Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual]], Inc., of Cherokee, North Carolina is the oldest continuing Native American art co-operative.

Advancement to leadership positions was generally subject to approval by the women elders.  In addition, the society was [[matrifocal]]; customarily, a married couple lived with or near the woman's family, so she could be aided by her female relatives.  Her oldest brother was a more important mentor to her sons than was their father, who belonged to another clan. Traditionally, couples, particularly women, can divorce freely.<ref>Perdue (1999), pp. 44, 57\u20138</ref>\n\nIt was unusual for a Cherokee man to marry a European-American woman.  The children of such a union were disadvantaged, as they would not belong to the nation.  They would be born outside the clans and traditionally were not considered Cherokee citizens. This is because of the matrilineal aspect of Cherokee culture.<ref name=\"Perdue 1999, p. 176\"/> As the Cherokee began to adopt some elements of European-American culture in the early 19th century, they sent elite young men, such as [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] to American schools for education. After Ridge had married a European-American woman from Connecticut and Boudinot was engaged to another, the Cherokee Council in 1825 passed a law making children of such unions full citizens of the tribe, as if their mothers were Cherokee. This was a way to protect the families of men expected to be leaders of the tribe.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yarbough |first=Fay |title=Legislating Women's Sexuality: Cherokee Marriage Laws |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=38 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=385\u2013406 [p. 388] |doi=10.1353/jsh.2004.0144 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the U.S. government put new restrictions on marriage between a Cherokee and non-Cherokee, although it was still relatively common. A European-American man could legally marry a Cherokee woman by petitioning the federal court, after gaining approval of ten of her blood relatives.  Once married, the man had status as an \"Intermarried White,\" a member of the Cherokee tribe with restricted rights; for instance, he could not hold any tribal office. He remained a citizen of and under the laws of the United States. [[Common law marriage]]s were more popular. Such \"Intermarried Whites\" were listed in a separate category on the registers of the [[Dawes Rolls]], prepared for allotment of plots of land to individual households of members of the tribe, in the early twentieth-century federal policy for [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the Native Americans.\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Cherokee ethnobotany]]\n\n=== Gender roles ===\nMen and women have historically played important yet, at times different, roles in Cherokee society. Historically, these roles have tended to support the idea of a balanced [[gender binary]], with gender determining social and ceremonial roles. Historically, women have primarily been the heads of households, owning the home and the land, farmers of the family's land, and \"mothers\" of the [[clan]]s. As in many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures, Cherokee women are honored as life-givers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1954047274/|title=Sons of Selu: Masculinity and Gendered Power in Cherokee Society, 1775-1846 - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> As givers and nurturers of life via childbirth and the growing of plants, and community leaders as clan mothers, women are traditionally community leaders in Cherokee communities.

However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to [[Unicode]], the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet.\n\nBecause of the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Examples include ''ditiyohihi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d8\u13f2\u13af\u13af}}), which means \"he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose,\" meaning \"attorney.\" Another example is ''didaniyisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c2\u13f1\u13cd\u13a9}}) which means \"the final catcher\" or \"he catches them finally and conclusively,\" meaning \"policeman.\"\n\nMany words, however, have been borrowed from the English language, such as ''gasoline'', which in Cherokee is {{lang|chr|ga-so-li-ne}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a6\u13d0\u13b5\u13c1}}). Many other words were borrowed from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 20th century. One example relates to a town in Oklahoma named \"Nowata\". The word {{lang|chr|nowata}} is a [[Delaware languages|Delaware Indian]] word for \"welcome\" (more precisely the Delaware word is {{lang|del|nu-wi-ta}} which can mean \"welcome\" or \"friend\" in the Delaware Language). The white settlers of the area used the name \"nowata\" for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware Language, called the town ''Amadikanigvnagvna'' ({{lang|chr|\u13a0\u13b9\u13d7\u13a7\u13c2\u13ac\u13be\u13ac\u13be}})  which means \"the water is all gone from here\", i.e. \"no water\".\n\nOther examples of borrowed words are {{lang|chr|kawi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a7\u13eb}}) for ''coffee'' and {{lang|chr|watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13e9\u13e5}}) for ''watch'' (which led to {{lang|chr|utana watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a4\u13d4\u13be \u13e9\u13e5}}) or \"big watch\" for ''clock'').\n\nThe following table is an example of Cherokee text and its translation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"background:#fff;\"| \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9: \u13c2\u13a6\u13d3 \u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb \u13c2\u13a8\u13ab\u13d3\u13b8\u13be \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c2\u13e0\u13f1 \u13a4\u13be\u13d5\u13bf \u13da\u13f3\u13a7\u13db \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2. \u13a8\u13e5\u13c1\u13b3 \u13a4\u13be\u13d3\u13c5\u13d6\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c3\u13df\u13cd\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13cc\u13ca \u13a8\u13d2 \u13e7\u13c2\u13b8\u13eb\u13cd\u13d3\u13c1\u13d7 \u13a0\u13be\u13df\u13c5\u13e2 \u13a0\u13d3\u13c5\u13d9 \u13ac\u13d7.<ref name=\"Omniglot\">{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cherokee.htm |title=Cherokee syllabary |accessdate=May 14, 2009 |date=1998\u20132009 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\" | [[Cherokee language|Tsalagi]]: {{lang|chr|Nigada aniyvwi nigeguda'lvna ale unihloyi unadehna duyukdv gesv'i.

Before 1975, they were considered a part of the Cherokee Nation, as reflected in briefs filed before the Indian Claims Commission. At one time W.W. Keeler served not only as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, but at the same time held the position as Chairman of the Texas Cherokee and Associated Bands (TCAB) Executive Committee.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Cherokee constitution in 1976, TCAB descendants whose ancestors had remained a part of the physical Mount Tabor Community in [[Rusk County, Texas]] were excluded from citizenship. Their ancestors did not appear on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes, registered under the Dawes Commission. However, most if not all TCAB descendants did have an ancestor listed on either the Guion-Miller or [[Old settler (Cherokee)|Old settler]] rolls.\n\nWhile most Mount Tabor residents returned to the Cherokee Nation following the death of John Ross in 1866, today there is a sizable group that is well documented but outside that body. It is not actively seeking a status clarification. They do have treaty rights going back to the [[Treaty of Bird's Fort]]. From the end of the Civil War until 1975, they were associated with the Cherokee Nation. The TCAB formed as a political organization in 1871 led by [[William Penn Adair]] and Clement Neely Vann. Descendants of the Texas Cherokees and the Mount Tabor Community joined together to try to gain redress from treaty violations, stemming from the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. Today, most Mount Tabor descendants are in fact members of the Cherokee Nation. Only some 800 are stuck in limbo without status as Cherokees. Many of them still reside in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas.\n\nOther remnant populations continue to exist throughout the Southeast United States and individually in the states surrounding Oklahoma. Many of these people trace descent from persons enumerated on official rolls such as the Guion-Miller, Drennan, Mullay and Henderson Rolls, among others. Other descendants trace their heritage through the treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government which gave individual allotments to Cherokees.  State recognized Tribes require varying levels of genealogical proof that applicants are of Cherokee descent. Current enrollment guidelines of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have been approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Such facts were pointed out by Cherokee citizens of CN during the Constitutional Convention held to ratify a new governing document. The document that was eventually ratified by a small portion of the electorate. However, the tribe does not have the power to change its membership procedures and maintain federal recognition. Any changes to the tribe's enrollment procedures must be approved by the Department of Interior. Under 25 CFR 83 the Office of Federal Acknowledgment is required to first apply its own anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods to any request for change by the tribe. It then forwards its recommendations to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs for consideration.<ref>* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/aoc.htm Act of Congress Roll, 1854]\n* [http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/default.aspx (Pre-convention \u2013 1999) Oral and Written Testimonies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104091145/http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/Default.aspx |date=January 4, 2011 }}\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/census.htm Cherokee Census Rolls, a follow-up]\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/chapman.htm Chapman Roll Eastern Cherokees, 1851]\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 Treaty with the Cherokee, 1817] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103150436/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 |date=November 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Cherokee Freedmen===\n{{Main|Cherokee Freedmen Controversy}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CNSeal.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The seal of the Cherokee Nation.]] -->\n\nThe Cherokee freedmen, descendants of African American slaves owned by citizens of the Cherokee Nation during the [[Antebellum Period]], were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866. This was in the wake of the [[American Civil War]], when the US emancipated slaves and passed US constitutional amendments granting freedmen citizenship in the United States.\n\nIn 1988, the federal court in the Freedmen case of ''[[Nero v. Cherokee Nation]]'' held that Cherokees could decide citizenship requirements and exclude freedmen. On March 7, 2006, the Cherokee Nation Judicial Appeal Tribunal ruled that the Cherokee Freedmen were eligible for Cherokee citizenship.

He was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Shrewsbury and Atcham (UK Parliament constituency)|Shrewsbury and Atcham]] from 1997 until 2005. He was most prominently known for his anti-war views and [[crossing the floor]] twice (the first to do so since [[Winston Churchill]]<ref>[http://www.futermanrose.co.uk/marsden.html Futerman, Rose & Associates profile of Paul Marsden]</ref>), from [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in 2001 and returning to Labour in 2005. He instructed a solicitor in 2010 to begin action for phone hacking that allegedly took place back in 2003 by a newspaper. In 2012, Marsden was appointed to draft the parliamentary inquiry report into VIP security at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London. Currently Marsden is Head of Business Intelligence at the construction company [[MWH Global]].<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulwbmarsden LinkedIN profile]</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nMarsden was born in [[Frodsham]] in [[Cheshire]] to Thomas Darlington Marsden, a distribution manager and Labour councillor<ref>[http://cdnedge.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1613340.stm ''BBC'' From disaffection to defection]</ref> and Audrey Stott, a school teacher. He was educated at [[Helsby High School]]. Marsden completed a diploma in building studies at [[Mid Cheshire College|Mid-Cheshire College]] in 1986, but withdrew from completing a civil engineering degree after the first three years at [[University of Teesside|Teesside Polytechnic]] in 1990. Studying part-time, he passed a diploma in management at the [[Open University]] and a diploma in business excellence at [[Newcastle College]].\n\nBefore his political career, Marsden worked as a quality manager at [[Taylor Woodrow]] (1990\u20131994), a management consultant at [[NatWest Bank]] (1994\u20131996) and as a total quality facilitator at [[Mitel]] from 1996 until the general election in 1997.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2172996.stm ''BBC'' Profile of Paul Marsden 2005]</ref>\n\n== Labour Member of Parliament ==\nMarsden was elected as the first (and thus far only) Labour MP for [[Shrewsbury and Atcham (UK Parliament constituency)|Shrewsbury and Atcham]] at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] with a swing of 11.4%; a seat which he held at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 election]] with a further swing of 5.5%. At 29 years of age, he was one of the youngest MP's elected in 1997. He spoke in the Commons for the first time on 21 May 1997 and in an otherwise traditional maiden speech, joked prophetically about refusing to be intimidated by the Whips.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1997/may/21/adjournment-of-the-house ''Hansard'' Maiden speech by Paul Marsden 21/05/97]</ref> He was nominated to serve on the Agriculture Select Committee and remained for four years quietly serving on the committee.\n\nOn 14 April 1999, Marsden introduced the Cancer Care Bill<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1999/apr/14/cancer-care ''Hansard'' Cancer Care 14/04/99]</ref> with backing from cancer charities including [[Macmillan Cancer Support]], under the Ten Minute Rule that would create the first comprehensive directory of cancer services in the UK to aid patients in identifying the location and type of cancer care available.<ref>[http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/astonished-mp-pushes-for-cancer-register/29792.article ''Health Service Journal'' Astonished MP pushes for cancer register 29/04/99]</ref> The Bill prompted Ruth Fermor Allan to create such a directory called 'Cancer Care 2000',<ref>[http://www.whsmith.co.uk/CatalogAndSearch/SearchWithinCategory.aspx?as_Publisher=Cambridge+Healthcare+Publishing+Ltd&cat=\\Books Cancer Care 2000 by Ruth Fermor Allan]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> which was published by Cambridge Healthcare Publishing Ltd in November 2000.\n\nIn March 2001, Marsden with cross party support put forward a Doorstep Recycling Bill,<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2001/mar/13/recycling-doorstep-collection ''Hansard'' Recycling (Doorstep Collection) Bill 13/03/01]</ref> mandating the collection of recyclable materials from streets.

He was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Shrewsbury and Atcham (UK Parliament constituency)|Shrewsbury and Atcham]] from 1997 until 2005. He was most prominently known for his anti-war views and [[crossing the floor]] twice (the first to do so since [[Winston Churchill]]<ref>[http://www.futermanrose.co.uk/marsden.html Futerman, Rose & Associates profile of Paul Marsden]</ref>), from [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in 2001 and returning to Labour in 2005. He instructed a solicitor in 2010 to begin action for phone hacking that allegedly took place back in 2003 by a newspaper. In 2012, Marsden was appointed to draft the parliamentary inquiry report into VIP security at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London. Currently Marsden is Head of Business Intelligence at the construction company [[MWH Global]].<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulwbmarsden LinkedIN profile]</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nMarsden was born in [[Frodsham]] in [[Cheshire]] to Thomas Darlington Marsden, a distribution manager and Labour councillor<ref>[http://cdnedge.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1613340.stm ''BBC'' From disaffection to defection]</ref> and Audrey Stott, a school teacher. He was educated at [[Helsby High School]]. Marsden completed a diploma in building studies at [[Mid Cheshire College|Mid-Cheshire College]] in 1986, but withdrew from completing a civil engineering degree after the first three years at [[University of Teesside|Teesside Polytechnic]] in 1990. Studying part-time, he passed a diploma in management at the [[Open University]] and a diploma in business excellence at [[Newcastle College]].\n\nBefore his political career, Marsden worked as a quality manager at [[Taylor Woodrow]] (1990\u20131994), a management consultant at [[NatWest Bank]] (1994\u20131996) and as a total quality facilitator at [[Mitel]] from 1996 until the general election in 1997.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2172996.stm ''BBC'' Profile of Paul Marsden 2005]</ref>\n\n== Labour Member of Parliament ==\nMarsden was elected as the first (and thus far only) Labour MP for [[Shrewsbury and Atcham (UK Parliament constituency)|Shrewsbury and Atcham]] at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] with a swing of 11.4%; a seat which he held at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 election]] with a further swing of 5.5%. At 29 years of age, he was one of the youngest MP\u2019s elected in 1997. He spoke in the Commons for the first time on 21 May 1997 and in an otherwise traditional maiden speech, joked prophetically about refusing to be intimidated by the Whips.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1997/may/21/adjournment-of-the-house ''Hansard'' Maiden speech by Paul Marsden 21/05/97]</ref> He was nominated to serve on the Agriculture Select Committee and remained for four years quietly serving on the committee.\n\nOn 14 April 1999, Marsden introduced the Cancer Care Bill<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1999/apr/14/cancer-care ''Hansard'' Cancer Care 14/04/99]</ref> with backing from cancer charities including [[Macmillan Cancer Support]], under the Ten Minute Rule that would create the first comprehensive directory of cancer services in the UK to aid patients in identifying the location and type of cancer care available.<ref>[http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/astonished-mp-pushes-for-cancer-register/29792.article ''Health Service Journal'' Astonished MP pushes for cancer register 29/04/99]</ref> The Bill prompted Ruth Fermor Allan to create such a directory called 'Cancer Care 2000',<ref>[http://www.whsmith.co.uk/CatalogAndSearch/SearchWithinCategory.aspx?as_Publisher=Cambridge+Healthcare+Publishing+Ltd&cat=\\Books Cancer Care 2000 by Ruth Fermor Allan]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> which was published by Cambridge Healthcare Publishing Ltd in November 2000.\n\nIn March 2001, Marsden with cross party support put forward a Doorstep Recycling Bill,<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2001/mar/13/recycling-doorstep-collection ''Hansard'' Recycling (Doorstep Collection) Bill 13/03/01]</ref> mandating the collection of recyclable materials from streets.

Tripp disclosed to Starr that she was aware of the relationship between Lewinsky and President Clinton, that Lewinsky had executed a false [[affidavit]] denying the relationship that was submitted to the federal court in Arkansas in the ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'' lawsuit, and that Lewinsky had attempted to [[Subornation of perjury|suborn]] Tripp's [[perjury]] in the ''Clinton v. Jones'' suit to conceal the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship as well as Tripp's claim regarding Kathleen Willey from the federal court. As Tripp explained, she was being solicited to commit a crime to conceal evidence in the Jones civil rights case.<ref name=LarryKing>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/16/tripp.transcript/ Transcript: Linda Tripp on 'Larry King Live'], ''[[CNN]]'', February 16, 1999.

During their friendship, Lewinsky had shown the dress to Tripp and said she intended to have it [[Dry cleaning|dry-cleaned]]; Tripp convinced her not to.\n\nBased on Tripp's tapes, Starr obtained approval from [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] and the special court overseeing the Independent Counsel to expand Starr's investigation into the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship, looking for potential incidents of perjury, to investigate Lewinsky for perjury and suborning perjury as a witness in the lawsuit [[Paula Jones]] had brought against Clinton.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/text012998.htm |title=Text of Reno's Petition for Starr |date=January 29, 1998 |accessdate=May 1, 2008 | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nTripp also told Starr that she had evidence directly linking the White House to the [[Travelgate]], [[Filegate]], and [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy|Chinagate]] affairs, but Starr chose not to act on that, preferring to pursue the sex-related allegations.\n\nTripp maintains she acted out of \"patriotic duty.\" Tripp has claimed that she taped Lewinsky out of self-defense, as she feared retaliation from the Clinton administration, also claiming Lewinsky had assured President Clinton that she had told only Tripp about their affair (which was untrue), thus making her a target since she refused to go along with perjuring herself to protect Lewinsky and the President.\n\nEventually both Clinton and Lewinsky had to appear before a [[Washington, D.C.]], [[grand jury]] to answer questions, although Clinton appeared via [[closed circuit television]].

However, the Maryland state court ruled that Lewinsky, who \"admitted that she lied under oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a part of her life,\" was not credible and Lewinsky's proposed testimony against Tripp was \"bathed in impermissible taint.\" As a result, all charges against Tripp were dismissed on May 26, 2000, when the prosecution decided not to proceed with the trial of the case.<ref>Lewis, Neil A.

Following the Bacon\u2013Bernath leak to Mayer, the Department of Defense leaked to the news media other confidential information from Tripp's personnel and security files. The Department of Defense Inspector General investigated the leak of Tripp's security clearance form information and found that Bacon and Bernath violated the Privacy Act, and the DoD IG concluded that Bacon and Bernath should have known that the release of information from Tripp's security file was improper.<ref>Becker, Elizabeth.
