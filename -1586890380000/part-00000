His initial scientific fame arose in the 1850s from his study of [[diamagnetism]]. Later he made discoveries in the realms of [[infrared radiation]] and the physical properties of air, proving the connection between atmospheric CO{{sub|2}} and what is now known as the [[greenhouse effect]] in 1859.\n\nTyndall also published more than a dozen science books which brought state-of-the-art 19th century [[experimental physics]] to a wide audience. From 1853 to 1887 he was professor of physics at the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]] in London.\n\n== Early years and education ==\nTyndall was born in [[Leighlinbridge]], [[County Carlow]], Ireland. His father was a local police constable, descended from [[Gloucestershire]] emigrants who settled in southeast Ireland around 1670. Tyndall attended the local schools (Ballinabranna Primary School) in County Carlow until his late teens, and was probably an assistant teacher near the end of his time there. Subjects learned at school notably included [[technical drawing]] and mathematics with some applications of those subjects to [[land surveying]]. He was hired as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] by the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] in his late teens in 1839, and moved to work for the [[Ordnance Survey]] for Great Britain in 1842. In the decade of the 1840s, a railroad-building boom was in progress, and Tyndall's land surveying experience was valuable and in demand by the railway companies. Between 1844 and 1847, he was lucratively employed in railway construction planning.<ref>When working for the government's land surveying agency in Lancashire, Tyndall was one of a number of employees who signed a petition calling for higher wages plus some other changes in working conditions. In November 1843 all of the signatories to the petition were dismissed from their jobs. In August 1844 Tyndall was hired by a railway surveying company in Lancashire at almost four times higher pay than the government had been paying him. {{cite journal|title=John Tyndall: A study in vocational enterprise|doi=10.1080/03057875780000061|journal=The Vocational Aspect of Education|volume=9 |issue =18|year=1957|author=D.

Recalling this decision later, he wrote: \"the desire to grow intellectually did not forsake me; and, when railway work slackened, I accepted in 1847 a post as master in Queenwood College.\"<ref>Tyndall gave detailed recollections about his life in the 1840s in \"Address Delivered at the Birkbeck Institution on October 22, 1884\", which is published as a chapter in his ''[https://archive.org/details/newfragments00tynd New Fragments]'' essays (1892).</ref> Another recently arrived young teacher at Queenwood was [[Edward Frankland]], who had previously worked as a chemical laboratory assistant for the British Geological Survey. Frankland and Tyndall became good friends. On the strength of Frankland's prior knowledge, they decided to go to Germany to further their education in science. Among other things, Frankland knew that certain German universities were ahead of any in Britain in experimental chemistry and physics. (British universities were still focused on classics and mathematics and not laboratory science.) The pair moved to Germany in summer 1848 and enrolled at the [[University of Marburg]], attracted by the reputation of [[Robert Bunsen]] as a teacher. Tyndall studied under Bunsen for two years.<ref>Tyndall studied under Bunsen from 1848 to 1850. Thirty-five years later, he praised Bunsen for explaining chemistry and physics in \"the language of experiment\" and said \"I still look back on Bunsen as the nearest approach to my ideal of a university teacher.\" [https://archive.org/details/newfragments00tynd ''New Fragments''].</ref> Perhaps more influential for Tyndall at Marburg was Professor [[Hermann Knoblauch]], with whom Tyndall maintained communications by letter for many years afterwards. Tyndall's Marburg dissertation was a mathematical analysis of screw surfaces in 1850 (under Friedrich Ludwig Stegmann). Tyndall stayed in Germany for a further year doing research on magnetism with Knoblauch, including some months' visit at the Berlin laboratory of Knoblauch's main teacher, [[Heinrich Gustav Magnus]]. It is clear today that Bunsen and Magnus were among the very best experimental science instructors of the era. Thus, when Tyndall returned to live in England in summer 1851, he probably had as good an education in experimental science as anyone in England.\n\n==Early scientific work==\nTyndall's early original work in physics was his experiments on [[magnetism]] and [[diamagnetic]] [[Magnetic polarity|polarity]], on which he worked from 1850 to 1856. His two most influential reports were the first two, co-authored with Knoblauch. One of them was entitled \"The magneto-optic properties of crystals, and the relation of magnetism and diamagnetism to molecular arrangement\", dated May 1850. The two described an inspired experiment, with an inspired interpretation. These and other magnetic investigations very soon made Tyndall known among the leading scientists of the day.<ref>Tyndall's main 1850's research reports on diamagnetism were later republished as a collection, which is available at [https://archive.org/details/researchesondiam00tynduoft Archive.org]. In the preface to the collection Tyndall writes about the work's historical context. [[John Tyndall#Biographies of John Tyndall|William T. Jeans' biography of Tyndall]] (pp. 22\u201334) also goes into the historical context of Tyndall's diamagnetic investigations.</ref> He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1852. In his search for a suitable research appointment, he was able to ask the longtime editor of the leading German physics journal ([[Johann Christian Poggendorff|Poggendorff]]) and other prominent men to write testimonials on his behalf. In 1853, he attained the prestigious appointment of Professor of [[Natural Philosophy]] (Physics) at the Royal Institution in London, due in no small part to the esteem his work had garnered from [[Michael Faraday]], the leader of magnetic investigations at the [[Royal Institution]].<ref>Michael Faraday advocated for Tyndall's appointment at the Royal Institution. As part of that, in a letter to the managers of the Royal Institution on 23 May 1853, Faraday praised Tyndall's abilities as a lecturer: \"I have heard him on two or three occasions, when his manner of expounding nature by discourse and experiment was in my judgement excellent\". Source: Emily Hankin (2008), [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/study_msc/dissertations/stable/2008_hankin.pdf \"John Tyndall's Lecture Courses at the Royal Institution and their Reception\"].</ref> About a decade later Tyndall was appointed the successor to the positions held by Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution on Faraday's retirement.\n\n==Alpine mountaineering and glaciology==\nTyndall visited the [[Alps]] mountains in 1856 for scientific reasons and ended up becoming a pioneering mountain climber. He visited the Alps almost every summer from 1856 onward, was a member of the very first mountain-climbing team to reach the top of the [[Weisshorn]] (1861), and lead of one of the early teams to reach the top of the [[Matterhorn]] (1868). He is one the names associated with the \"[[Golden age of alpinism]]\" &mdash; the mid-Victorian years when the more difficult of the Alpine peaks were summited for the first time.<ref>According to the account in Tyndall's book ''The Glaciers of the Alps'' (1860), Tyndall in 1858 reached the summit of [[Monte Rosa]] solo carrying only a ham sandwich for sustenance. The first ascent of Monte Rosa had taken place only in 1855. He had already reached the summit of Monte Rosa in a guided group on 10 August 1858 but he made an unplanned second ascent solo on 17 August 1858 after breakfast: \"the waiter then provided me with a ham sandwich, and, with my [[wiktionary:scrip#Etymology 1|scrip]] thus frugally furnished, I thought the heights of Monte Rosa might be won....\" (continued at pages 151\u2013157 of ''[https://archive.org/details/glaciersalpsbeing00tyndrich Glaciers of the Alps]''). Besides Tyndall's own books, information about Tyndall as a mountaineer is available at [https://archive.org/details/historyofmountai006709mbp ''A History of Mountaineering in the Alps''] by Claire Eliane Engel and [https://archive.org/details/victorianmountai010590mbp ''The Victorian Mountaineers''] by Ronald Clark.</ref>\n\n[[File:Tyndall 1896 Figure 7-37-MJ2.jpg|thumb|300px|John Tyndall explored the glacial tributaries feeding [[Mer de Glace]] in 1857. General topology (left); dirt-bands in glacier (right).]]\nIn the Alps, Tyndall studied [[glacier]]s, and especially [[glacier motion]]. His explanation of glacial flow brought him into dispute with others, particularly [[James David Forbes]]. Much of the early scientific work on glacier motion had been done by Forbes, but Forbes at that time didn't know of the phenomenon of [[regelation]] which was discovered a little later by Michael Faraday. Regelation played a key role in Tyndall's explanation. Forbes didn't see regelation in the same way at all. Complicating their debate, a disagreement arose publicly over who deserved to get investigator credit for what. Articulate friends of Forbes, as well as Forbes himself, thought that Forbes should get the credit for most of the good science, whereas Tyndall thought the credit should be distributed more widely. Tyndall commented: \"The idea of semi-fluid motion belongs entirely to [[Louis Rendu]]; the proof of the quicker central flow belongs in part to Rendu, but almost wholly to [[Louis Agassiz]] and Forbes; the proof of the retardation of the bed belongs to Forbes alone; while the discovery of the locus of the point of maximum motion belongs, I suppose, to me.\"<ref>That quotation from Tyndall appears in the ''[[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' article about Tyndall. For Forbes' view of the issue see \"Appendix A\" (plus Chapter XV) of ''[https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofjam00shaiuoft Life and Letters of James David Forbes]''.</ref> When Forbes and Tyndall were in the grave, their disagreement was continued by their respective official biographers. Everyone tried to be reasonable, but agreement wasn't attained. More disappointingly, aspects of glacier motion remained not understood or not proved.\n\n[[Tyndall Glacier (Chile)|Tyndall Glacier]] located in [[Chile]] and [[Tyndall Glacier (Colorado)|Tyndall Glacier]] in Colorado were named after John Tyndall, as is [[Mount Tyndall]] in California<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brewer, William H. | title = Discovery of Mount Tyndall | journal = The Popular Science Monthly | year = 1873 | volume = 2 | pages = 739\u2013741 | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_2/April_1873/Discovery_of_Mount_Tyndall }}</ref> and [[Mount Tyndall (Tasmania)|Mount Tyndall]] in Tasmania.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Haast, Julius | title = Notes on the Mountains and Glaciers of the Canterbury Province, New Zealand | journal = [[Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London]] | year = 1864 | volume = 34 | pages = 87\u201396 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=JOoRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&dq=Mount+Tyndall | jstor = 1798467 | doi = 10.2307/1798467 }}</ref>\n\n==Main scientific work==\nWork on glaciers alerted Tyndall to the research of [[Horace B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure|de Saussure]] into the heating effect of sunlight, and the concept of [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]], developed by [[Claude Pouillet|Pouillet]] and [[William Hopkins]]; that heat from the sun penetrates the atmosphere more easily than \"obscure heat\" ([[infrared]])  \"terrestrial radiation\" from the warmed Earth, causing what we now call the [[greenhouse effect]].

He concluded that [[water vapour]] is the strongest absorber of radiant heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small. Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere warms the surface in what was later called a [[greenhouse effect]], but he was the first to prove it. The proof was that water vapour strongly absorbed infrared radiation.<ref name=\"Baum\">{{cite journal|last1=Baum, Sr.|first1=Rudy M.|title=Future Calculations: The first climate change believer|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2 |pages=38\u201339 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/future-calculations|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref><ref>Tyndall explained the \"greenhouse effect\" in a public lecture in January 1863 entitled \"On Radiation Through The Earth's Atmosphere\". He emphasized that our environment would be much colder at nighttime in the absence of the greenhouse effect. This short, readable lecture is reprinted in his 1872 book about radiant heat, [https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n441/mode/1up available here].</ref> Relatedly, Tyndall in 1860 was first to demonstrate and quantify that visually transparent gases are infrared emitters.<ref name=InfraredEmissionByGases />\n* He devised demonstrations that advanced the question of how radiant heat is absorbed and emitted at the molecular level. He appears to be the first person to have demonstrated experimentally that emission of heat in chemical reactions has its physical origination within the newly created molecules (1864).<ref name=MolecularPhysicsInDomainOfRadiantHeat /> He produced instructive demonstrations involving the incandescent conversion of infrared into visible light at the molecular level, which he called [[calorescence]] (1865), in which he used materials that are transparent to infrared and opaque to visible light or vice versa.<ref>See [[calorescence]].</ref> He usually referred to infrared as \"radiant heat\", and sometimes as \"ultra-red undulations\", as the word \"infrared\" did not start coming into use until the 1880s. His main reports of the 1860s were republished as a 450-page collection in 1872 under the title ''Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat''.\n* In the investigations on radiant heat in air it had been necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] had been removed.<ref>Reported in a 10-page biography of John Tyndall by Arthur Whitmore Smith, a professor of physics, writing in an American scientific monthly in 1920; [https://archive.org/stream/contributions05michuoft#page/n90/mode/1up available online].</ref> A very sensitive way to detect particulates is to bathe the air with intense light. The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the [[Tyndall Effect]] or Tyndall Scattering.<ref>The term [[Tyndall Scattering]] is subject to some definitional overlap with the terms [[Rayleigh Scattering]] and [[Mie Scattering]].</ref> In studying this scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in electric-powered lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators. He developed the [[nephelometer]] and similar instruments that show properties of [[aerosols]] and [[colloids]] through concentrated light beams against a dark background and are based on exploiting the Tyndall Effect. (When combined with microscopes, the result is the [[ultramicroscope]], which was developed later by others).\n* He was the first to observe and report the phenomenon of [[thermophoresis]] in aerosols. He spotted it surrounding hot objects while investigating the Tyndall Effect with focused lightbeams in a dark room. He devised a better way to demonstrate it, and then simply reported it (1870), without investigating the physics of it in depth.<ref>A brief account of the early history of thermophoresis studies is given in ''Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science'', 2nd edition, year 2006, pages 6274\u20136275. Thermophoresis was first described by Tyndall in a Royal Institution lecture titled [https://archive.org/stream/scientificaddre01tyndgoog#page/n23/mode/1up \"On Haze and Dust\"], year 1870, which is included in Tyndall's 1870 book ''Scientific Addresses''. He observed the thermophoresis in gas mixtures. Unrelatedly and unknown to him, thermophoresis was observed in liquid mixtures in 1856 by [[Carl Ludwig]].</ref>\n* In radiant-heat experiments that called for much laboratory expertise in the early 1860s, he showed for a variety of readily vaporisable liquids that, molecule for molecule, the vapour form and the liquid form have essentially the same power to absorb radiant heat.<ref>''[https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01tyndgoog Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat]'' pages 199\u2013214, dated 1863. Those experiments demanded \"scrupulous accuracy, and minute attention to details\", he later said [https://archive.org/stream/newfragments00tynd/#page/91/mode/1up (ref)]. In one of his other and simpler experiments, infrared plus visible light beaming from an 1860s-vintage electric lamp was brought to a focus point via a powerful concave mirror. On its way to the focus point, the beam was passed through a body of liquid water. At the focus point, beyond the water, the beam was able to set wood on fire but was not able to melt frozen water. On removal of the intervening body of liquid water, the frozen water rapidly melted. This indicates that frequencies emerging from water are specifically frequencies that water molecules do not absorb and water's [[State of matter|phase state]] does not have a discernible role.

It is practically impossible to surround a closed vessel by an absolutely uniform temperature; and where differences of temperature, however small, exist, air-currents will be established. By such gentle currents the floating particles are gradually brought into contact with all the surrounding surfaces. To these they adhere, and the suspended matter finally disappears from the air altogether.\"</ref> Now, in the optically pure air there were no signs of any \"germs\", i.e. no signs of floating micro-organisms. Tyndall sterilised some meat-broths by simply boiling them, and then compared what happened when he let these meat-broths sit in the optically pure air, and in ordinary air. The broths sitting in the optically pure air remained \"sweet\" (as he said) to smell and taste after many months of sitting, while the ones in ordinary air started to become putrid after a few days. This demonstration extended [[Louis Pasteur]]'s earlier demonstrations that the presence of micro-organisms is a precondition for biomass decomposition. However, the next year (1876) Tyndall failed to consistently reproduce the result. Some of his supposedly heat-sterilized broths rotted in the optically pure air. From this Tyndall was led to find viable [[bacterial spores]] (endospores) in supposedly heat-sterilized broths. He discovered the broths had been contaminated with dry bacterial spores from [[hay]] in the lab. All bacteria are killed by simple boiling, except that bacteria have a spore form that can survive boiling, he correctly contended, citing research by [[Ferdinand Cohn]]. Tyndall found a way to eradicate the bacterial spores that came to be known as \"[[Tyndallization]]\". Tyndallization historically was the earliest known effective way to destroy bacterial spores. At the time, it affirmed the \"[[germ theory]]\" against a number of critics whose experimental results had been defective from the same cause. During the mid-1870s Pasteur and Tyndall were in frequent communication.<ref>[http://www.microform.co.uk/guides/R97614.pdf Microform.co.uk] has a catalog (perhaps incomplete) of letters from Pasteur to Tyndall. Communications between the two were most frequent during the mid-1870s. The earliest letter from Pasteur to Tyndall is dated 10 August 1871. Pasteur's early research had been in fermentation vats and broths. As he aimed to extend his program to air, he got in touch with Tyndall as someone who was an expert at dealing technically with air. In June 1871 extracts from a lecture by Tyndall entitled \"Dust and Disease\" were published in the ''British Medical Journal''. The [https://archive.org/stream/essaysonfloating00tynduoft#page/1/mode/1up \"Dust and Disease\" lecture] was Tyndall's first publication in this area.

In laboratory demonstrations motivated by foghorn issues, Tyndall established that sound is partially ''reflected'' (i.e. partially bounced back like an echo) at the location where an air mass of one temperature meets another air mass of a different temperature; and more generally when a body of air contains two or more air masses of different densities or temperatures, the sound travels poorly because of reflections occurring at the interfaces between the air masses, and very poorly when many such interfaces are present. (He then argued, though inconclusively, that this is the usual main reason why the same distant sound, e.g. foghorn, can be heard stronger or fainter on different days or at different times of day.)<ref>[[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]], who published a much-praised tome about sound in 1877\u201378, has a review of Tyndall's original contributions to the science of sound in [https://archive.org/stream/proceedings14roya#page/216/mode/1up ''Proceedings of the Royal Institution'', Volume XIV], pages 221\u2013223, dated 16 March 1894.

In the Royal Society's catalog 147 entries appear under Tyndall's name between 1850 and 1883. Between 1850 and 1863 Tyndall published 74 papers in research journals, an average of nearly one every two months. A listing of these papers can be found in the Royal Society's 1872 publication ''[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofscien06roya#page/75/mode/1up Catalogue of Scientific Papers Volume VI]''.

He produced very little after he got sick in 1885. Apart from his research papers, between 1860 and 1881 Tyndall also published 13 science books (see [[John Tyndall#John Tyndall's books|List of John Tyndall's books]]).</ref>\n\nIn his lectures at the Royal Institution Tyndall put a great value on, and was talented at producing, lively, visible demonstrations of physics concepts.<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/study_msc/dissertations/stable/2008_hankin.pdf \"John Tyndall's Lecture Courses at the Royal Institution and their Reception\"] by Emily Hankin (year 2008), pages 28\u201331, says that Tyndall and his audiences liked experimental demonstrations that had an element of spectacle, and that Tyndall selected lecture topics with that consideration partly in mind. The biographers Eve and Creasey are quoted as saying: \"His lectures were written down, rehearsed, and profusely illustrated with experiment. He knew that a public lecture should have the same exacting care in production as a play in a theatre.\"</ref> In one lecture, Tyndall demonstrated the propagation of light down through a stream of falling water via [[total internal reflection]] of the light. It was referred to as the \"light fountain\". It is historically significant today because it demonstrates the scientific foundation for modern fibre optic technology. During second half of the 20th century Tyndall was usually credited with being the first to make this demonstration. However, [[Jean-Daniel Colladon]] published a report of it in ''[[Comptes Rendus]]'' in 1842, and there's some suggestive evidence that Tyndall's knowledge of it came ultimately from Colladon and no evidence that Tyndall claimed to have originated it himself.<ref>Daniel Colladon's 1842 \"light fountain\" article is entitled \"On the reflections of a ray of light inside a parabolic liquid stream\". The history of this during the 19th century is in the book [https://books.google.com/books?id=r7HqAvWGUUkC ''The Story of Fiber Optics''] by Jeff Hecht, year 1999, Chapter 2. In Tyndall's own 1870 book ''[https://archive.org/stream/notesofcourseofn00tyndrich#page/20/mode/2up Notes on Light]'' Tyndall has a section entitled \"Total Reflexion\" where he explains: \"When the light passes from air into water, the refracted ray is bent ''towards'' the perpendicular.... When the ray passes from water to air it is bent ''from'' the perpendicular.... If the angle which the ray in water encloses with the perpendicular to the surface be greater than 48 degrees, the ray will not quit the water at all: it will be ''totally reflected'' at the surface.... The angle which marks the limit where total reflexion begins is called the limiting angle of the medium. For water this angle is 48\u00b0 27', for flint glass it is 38\u00b0 41', while for diamond it is 23\u00b0 42'.\"</ref>\n\n===Molecular physics of radiant heat===\n[[File:Tyndall setup for looking at aerosols.jpg|thumb|335px|With this setup Tyndall observed new chemical reactions produced by high frequency light waves acting on certain vapours. The main scientific interest here from his point of view was the additional hard data it lent to the grand question of the mechanism by which molecules absorb [[radiant energy]].]]\nTyndall was an experimenter and laboratory apparatus builder, not an abstract model builder. But in his experiments on radiation and the heat-absorptive power of gases, he had an underlying agenda to understand the physics of molecules. Tyndall said in 1879: \"During nine years of labour on the subject of radiation [in the 1860s], heat and light were handled throughout by me, not as ends, but as instruments by the aid of which the mind might perchance lay hold upon the ultimate particles of matter.\"<ref>Quoted from Tyndall's [https://archive.org/stream/fragmscience02tyndrich#page/385/mode/1up Fragments of Science, Volume II].</ref> This agenda is explicit in the title he picked for his 1872 book ''Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat''. It is present less explicitly in the spirit of his widely read 1863 book ''Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion''. Besides heat he also saw magnetism and sound propagation as reducible to molecular behaviours. Invisible molecular behaviours were the ultimate basis of all physical activity. With this mindset, and his experiments, he outlined an account whereby differing types of molecules have differing absorptions of infrared radiation because their molecular structures give them differing oscillating resonances. He'd gotten into the oscillating resonances idea because he'd seen that any one type of molecule has differing absorptions at differing radiant frequencies, and he was entirely persuaded that the only difference between one frequency and another is the frequency.<ref>In early 1861 Tyndall was writing: \"All the gases and vapours hitherto mentioned [which are absorbers of radiant heat] are transparent to light; that is to say, the waves of the visible spectrum pass among them without sensible absorption. Hence it is plain that their absorptive power depends on the periodicity of the undulations which strike them.... By Kirchhoff it has been conclusively shown that every atom absorbs in a special degree those waves which are synchronous with its own periods of vibration.\" ''[https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n69/mode/1up Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat]''.</ref> He'd also seen that the absorption behaviour of molecules is quite different from that of the atoms composing the molecules. For example, the gas nitric oxide (NO) absorbed more than a thousand times more infrared radiation than either nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).<ref>''Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat'', [https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n102/mode/1up pages 80\u201381 (dated 1862)]. He says on [https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n355/mode/1up page 334 (dated 1869)] that the difference in absorption rates \"may be a millionfold\" : [abridged] \"Let nitrogen and hydrogen be mixed mechanically together in the proportion of 14:3. Radiant heat will pass through the mixture as through a vacuum; the amount of heat intercepted is so small as to be practically insensible. The moment the nitrogen and hydrogen build themselves together into the molecules of ammonia [NH<sub>3</sub>] the amount of radiant heat which they absorb is augmented more than a thousandfold. It may be a millionfold, for we do not yet know how small the absorption of the absolutely pure mixture really is. The act of chemical union is the sole cause of the enormous alteration in the amount of heat intercepted. The converse is also true: dissolve the chemical bond of the ammonia, and you instantly destroy the absorption.\"</ref> He'd also seen in several kinds of experiments that \u2013 no matter whether a gas is a weak absorber of broad-spectrum radiant heat \u2013 any gas will strongly absorb the radiant heat coming from a separate body of the same type of gas.<ref name=MolecularPhysicsInDomainOfRadiantHeat>In the late 1850s Balfour Stewart had showed that cold rock-salt was a very strong absorber of the radiations from hot rock-salt, even though rock-salt was a very weak absorber of the radiations from all other kinds of heat-sources tested. By the early 1860s this had been generalized in the scientific literature to the principle that any kind of chemical will very strongly absorb the radiations coming from a separate body of the same kind of chemical. In Tyndall's words this was a \"principle which lies at the basis of spectrum analysis, ... namely, that a body which is competent to emit any ray, whether of heat or light, is competent in the same degree to absorb that ray\" [https://archive.org/stream/fragmscience01tyndrich#page/83/mode/1up (1866)]. Tyndall made several original observations around 1863 by beginning with the assumption that this principle is correct. The following is a summary of one of them. It was well-known at the time that in a flame of burning carbon monoxide, the carbon monoxide chemically combines with the oxygen of the air to form carbon dioxide plus heat. Tyndall observed that if a body of cold or room-temperature carbon dioxide is placed near the flame \"the cold gas is intensely opaque to [i.e. it very strongly absorbs] the radiation from this particular flame, though it is highly transparent to [i.e. it very weakly absorbs] heat of every other kind.\" Thus the great bulk of the heat in the carbon monoxide flame fits the [[emission spectrum]] of carbon dioxide, implying the heat is a radiant emission from the newly formed carbon dioxide molecules. Tyndall got the same type of result with a flame of [[hydrogen fuel|burning hydrogen]], another flame known to be chemically simple in the sense that very little intermediate or transitory molecules are produced in it. This appears to be the first demonstration that the heat given out in chemical reactions has its physical origination within the new molecules. Tyndall's report of the demonstration is in ''[https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01tyndgoog Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat]'', sections 11\u201317 of Chapter VI, dated 1864. A related demonstration is in sections 3\u20138 of Chapter V, dated 1863. It is also discussed in Tyndall's ''[https://archive.org/stream/fragmscience01tyndrich#page/74/mode/1up Fragments of Science, Volume I]'' Chapter III, dated 1866. For a modern analysis of where the heat is coming from in the carbon monoxide flame see {{cite journal|jstor=2414583|title=The Carbon Monoxide Flame Bands|author=R. N. Dixon|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

This was in contrast to the easily seen fact in solids such as carbon and platinum where the spectral profile moves towards the quicker frequencies when the temperature is increased.</ref> That demonstrated a kinship between the molecular mechanisms of [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]. Such a kinship was also in evidence in experiments by [[Balfour Stewart]] and others, cited and extended by Tyndall, that showed with respect to broad-spectrum radiant heat that molecules that are weak absorbers are weak emitters and strong absorbers are strong emitters.<ref name=InfraredEmissionByGases>After his measurements of infrared absorption by gases in 1859, Tyndall measured infrared emission by gases in 1860, with respect to broad-spectrum infrared radiation. He did this for many different gases, and when the gases were ranked by their emissive powers the rank order was the same as it was for their absorptive powers. His February 1861 article \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=D1dKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1 On the Absorption and Radiation of Heat by Gases and Vapours, and on the Physical Connexion of Radiation, Absorption, and Conduction]\"  in ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', Volume 151, pages 1\u201336, year 1861, was later republished in the book ''[https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01tyndgoog Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat]'', Chapter I; and in the same book there is more in Chapter II section 11 (year 1862), and chapter IX section 6 (year 1865). These laboratory experiments by Tyndall on \"the reciprocity of absorption and radiation on the part of gases\" were informed by experiments done on solids by Balfour Stewart in 1858 and 1859. The two relevant articles by Balfour Stewart are online as republished in 1901 in ''[https://archive.org/details/lawsofradiationa00bracrich The Laws of Radiation and Absorption: Memoirs by Pr\u00e9vost, Stewart, Kirchhoff and Bunsen]''.</ref> (For example, [[rock-salt]] is an exceptionally poor absorber of heat via radiation, and a good absorber of heat via conduction. When a plate of rock-salt is heated via conduction and let stand on an insulator, it takes an exceptionally long time to cool down; i.e., it's a poor emitter of infrared.) The kinship between absorption and emission was also consistent with some generic or abstract features of [[resonator]]s.<ref>In 1853 [[Anders Jonas \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m|Anders \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m]] had argued, based on general principles of resonance, that an incandescent gas should emit luminous rays of the same frequencies as those it can absorb. After this was affirmed and made more general experimentally by Tyndall and others in the early 1860s, \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m got a lot of plaudits. When the original paper by \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m (published in German in 1854) was published in English in 1855, the translator from the German was John Tyndall. {{cite book|author=John Charles Drury Brand|title=Lines of light: the sources of dispersive spectroscopy, 1800\u20131930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spYSK-g8DrkC&pg=PA61|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-2-88449-162-4|pages=61\u2013}}</ref> The chemical decomposition of molecules by lightwaves ([[photochemical effect]]) convinced Tyndall that the resonator could not be the molecule as a whole unit; it had to be some substructure, because otherwise the photochemical effect would be impossible.<ref>''Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat'' [https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n448/mode/1up page 428, dated 1868]. When talking about chemical reactions produced by light he says \"if the absorption [of radiant energy] were the act of the molecule as a whole, the relative motions of its constituent atoms would remain unchanged, and there would be no mechanical cause for their separation [in a photochemical decomposition].\" Therefore in a photochemical decomposition, \"it is probably the synchronism of the vibrations of ''one portion'' of the molecule with the incident waves which enables the amplitude of those vibrations to augment [i.e. resonate] until the chain which binds the parts of the molecule together is snapped asunder.\"</ref> But he was without testable ideas as to the form of this substructure, and did not partake in speculation in print.

In regard to knowledge he must, of course, be master of his work.... [and secondly] a power of character must underlie and enforce the work of the intellect. There were men who could so rouse and energise their pupils \u2013 so call forth their strength and the pleasure of its exercise \u2013 as to make the hardest work agreeable. Without this power it is questionable whether the teacher could ever really enjoy his vocation; with it, I do not know a higher, nobler, and more blessed calling.\" ''[https://archive.org/stream/newfragments00tynd/#page/232/mode/1up New Fragments]''.</ref> His greatest audience was gained ultimately through his books, most of which were not written for experts or specialists. He published more than a dozen science books.<ref>Some of his science books were short, like 80 pages, and others were not. See the [[John Tyndall#John Tyndall's books|List of John Tyndall's books]].</ref> From the mid-1860s on, he was one of the world's most famous living physicists, due firstly to his skill and industry as a tutorialist.

It has been a true pleasure to me to have you at my side so long. In the sweat of our brows we have often reached the heights where our work lay, but you have been steadfast and industrious throughout, using in all possible cases your own muscles instead of relying upon mine. Here and there I have stretched an arm and helped you to a ledge, but the work of climbing has been almost exclusively your own. It is thus that I should like to teach you all things; showing you the way to profitable exertion, but leaving the exertion to you.... Our task seems plain enough, but you and I know how often we have had to wrangle resolutely with the facts to bring out their meaning. The work, however, is now done, and you are master of a fragment of that sure and certain knowledge which is founded on the faithful study of nature.... Here then we part. And should we not meet again, the memory of these days will still unite us. Give me your hand. Good bye.\"<ref>Quoted from Tyndall's ''[https://archive.org/stream/formsofwaterincl00tyndiala#page/190/mode/2up The Forms of Water in Clouds and Rivers, Ice and Glaciers]'', year 1872.</ref>\n\nAs another indicator, here is the opening paragraph of his 350-page tutorial entitled ''Sound'' (1867): \"In the following pages I have tried to render the science of acoustics interesting to all intelligent persons, including those who do not possess any special scientific culture. The subject is treated experimentally throughout, and I have endeavoured so to place each experiment before the reader that he should realise it as an actual operation.\" In the preface to the 3rd edition of this book, he reports that earlier editions were translated into Chinese at the expense of the Chinese government and translated into German under the supervision of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (a big name in the science of acoustics).<ref>John Tyndall, [https://archive.org/details/sound05tyndgoog ''Sound'', 3rd edition (1875)].</ref> His first published tutorial, which was about glaciers (1860), similarly states: \"The work is written with a desire to interest intelligent persons who may not possess any special scientific culture.\"\n\nHis most widely praised tutorial, and probably his biggest seller, was the 550-page ''\"Heat: a Mode of Motion\"'' (1863; updated editions until 1880). It was in print for at least 50 years,<ref>The UK publisher was Longmans. The US publisher was Appleton.

Its primary feature is, as James Clerk Maxwell said in 1871, \"the doctrines of the science [of heat] are forcibly impressed on the mind by well-chosen illustrative experiments.\"<ref>J. Clerk Maxwell (1871, 1872) [https://archive.org/stream/theoryheat06maxwgoog#page/n10/mode/2up ''Theory of Heat''], preface page vi (publisher: Longmans, Green & Co).</ref>\n\nTyndall's three longest tutorials, namely ''Heat'' (1863), ''Sound'' (1867), and ''Light'' (1873), represented state-of-the-art experimental physics at the time they were written. Much of their contents were recent major innovations in the understanding of their respective subjects, which Tyndall was the first writer to present to a wider audience. One caveat is called for about the meaning of \"state of the art\". The books were devoted to laboratory science and they avoided mathematics. In particular, they contain absolutely no infinitesimal calculus. Mathematical modelling using infinitesimal calculus, especially differential equations, was a component of the state-of-the-art understanding of heat, light and sound at the time.\n\n==Demarcation of science from religion==\n[[File:John Tyndall, 1872.jpg|thumb|upright|Tyndall caricatured as a preacher in the magazine ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1872]]\n\nThe majority of the progressive and innovative British physicists of Tyndall's generation were conservative and orthodox on matters of religion. That includes for example [[James Joule]], [[Balfour Stewart]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[George Gabriel Stokes]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] \u2013 all names investigating heat or light contemporaneously with Tyndall. These conservatives believed, and sought to strengthen the basis for believing, that religion and science were consistent and harmonious with each other. Tyndall, however, was a member of [[X Club|a club]] that vocally supported [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution and sought to strengthen the barrier, or separation, between religion and science. The most prominent member of this club was the anatomist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. Tyndall first met Huxley in 1851 and the two had a lifelong friendship. Chemist [[Edward Frankland]] and mathematician [[Thomas Archer Hirst]], both of whom Tyndall had known since before going to university in Germany, were members too. Others included the social philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]].\n\nThough not nearly so prominent as Huxley in controversy over philosophical problems, Tyndall played his part in communicating to the educated public what he thought were the virtues of having a clear separation between science (knowledge & rationality) and religion (faith & spirituality).<ref>A review of how Tyndall demarcated science from religion, marshalling quotes from Tyndall, is in {{Cite book | last = Gieryn | first = Thomas F. | contribution = John Tyndall's Double Boundary-Work | title = Cultural Boundaries of Science | pages = 37\u201364 | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | place = | year = 1999 | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GljD3CHbDx0C&pg=PA37 | accessdate = }}.</ref> As the elected president of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1874, he gave a long [[keynote speech]] at the Association's annual meeting held that year in Belfast. The speech gave a favourable account of the history of evolutionary theories, mentioning Darwin's name favourably more than 20 times, and concluded by asserting that religious sentiment should not be permitted to \"intrude on the region of ''knowledge'', over which it holds no command\". This was a hot topic. The newspapers carried the report of it on their front pages \u2013 in Britain, Ireland & North America, even the European Continent \u2013 and many critiques of it appeared soon after. The attention and scrutiny increased the friends of the evolutionists' philosophical position, and brought it closer to mainstream ascendancy.<ref>The text of Tyndall's 1874 ''Belfast Address'' is available at [http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/belfast.html Victorianweb.org]. This speech got more coverage in the Victorian-era newspapers than any other single public speech in the decades-long Victorian debate over the status of evolution theory. A lengthy review of the speech and the speech's reception by London newspapers was published by ''The New York Times'' on 5 September 1874. It is downloadable at [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D06E4DE1E39EF34BC4D53DFBF66838F669FDE ref]. The great majority of London newspapers either endorsed Tyndall's position or took a neutral but respectful attitude towards it. Among other commentators the speech did have critics but a majority of these looked askance at subtleties and minor aspects [http://www.gkbenterprises.org.uk/thesis/ch05.htm#fnote61anc (e.g.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907075712/http://www.gkbenterprises.org.uk/thesis/ch05.htm |date=7 September 2008 }}, [https://archive.org/details/ideasinnatureove00mcco (e.g.)]; only a minority defended a role for religious belief in formation of knowledge. As the London ''Times'' put it when the speech was making front-page news: \"It is probably part of the great change in the manners of this country that [the speech]... will now encounter little contradiction even in the most religious circles\" (reprinted by [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1874/09/07/79081649.pdf ''New York Times'', 7 Sep 1874]). Among the exceptions, the Irish Catholic bishops decried it as paganism. Because the speech got widespread attention and little contradiction, and came from the Establishment post of the presidency of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, later historians have seen the speech as the \"final victory\" of the evolutionists in Victorian Britain. E.g., {{cite book|title=Darwin's Metaphor: Nature's Place in Victorian Culture|author=Robert M.

A doctrine of such character is most hurtful both to individuals and to the State.... It follows that it is quite unlawful to demand, to defend, or to grant, unconditional [or promiscuous] freedom of thought, speech, writing, or religion.\"<ref>Those quotations are from the [[s:The Syllabus of Errors|''Syllabus of Errors'']] decree (year 1864, [[Pope Pius IX]]) and the [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_20061888_libertas_en.html ''Libertas''] decree (year 1888, [[Pope Leo XIII]]). The ''Libertas'' decree also says: [\u00b627, abridged] \"The divine teaching of the Church brings the sure guidance of shining light. Therefore, there is no reason why true science should feel aggrieved at having to bear the restraint of laws by which, in the judgment of the Church, human teaching has to be controlled.\"</ref> Those principles and Tyndall's principles were profound enemies. Luckily for Tyndall he didn't need to get into a contest with them in Britain, nor in most other parts of the world. Even in Italy, Huxley and Darwin were awarded honorary medals and most of the Italian governing class was hostile to the papacy.<ref>For Italy see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]].

Between 1886 and 1893 Tyndall was active in the debate in England about whether to give the Catholics of Ireland more freedom to go their own way. Like the great majority of Irish-born scientists of the 19th century he opposed the [[Irish Home Rule Movement]]. He had ardent views about it, which were published in newspapers and pamphlets.<ref>For a list of Tyndall's pamphlets against Irish Home Rule search both [https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?search-alias=stripbooks&field-author=tyndall&field-title=gladstone Amazon] and [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=%28author%3AJohn+AND+author%3ATyndall%29+AND+%28subject%3A%22Ireland+-+Politics+and+government+-+1837-1901.%22+OR+subject%3A%22Great+Britain+-+Politics+and+government+-+1837-1901.%22%29&type=all&limits=format%3ABook&submit=Find National Library of Australia]. One of the pamphlets, ''Mr. Gladstone's Sudden Reversal of Polarity'', documented how British Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] did a [[Flip-flop (politics)|flip-flop]] on the Home Rule question. The intent was to undermine Gladstone's intellectual credibility on the question. Gladstone publicly defended himself against the attack. The debate between them got a lot of attention in the newspapers. Tyndall was a conspicuous participant in the Irish Home Rule debate in the London newspapers between 1886 and 1893. When he died in 1893, ''The Times'' newspaper obituary noted that \"our readers will remember many eloquent letters written by him of late years, full of unsparing condemnation of Mr. Gladstone's recent [Ireland] policy.\" \u2013 [https://archive.org/stream/eminentpersonsbi06timeiala#page/84/mode/2up Ref].</ref> For example, in an opinion piece in ''[[The Times]]'' on 27 December 1890 he saw priests and Catholicism as \"the heart and soul of this movement\" and wrote that placing the non-Catholic minority under the dominion of \"the priestly horde\" would be \"an unspeakable crime\".<ref>More from Tyndall's letter is in the year 1891 compilation [https://archive.org/details/gladstoneireland00londiala/ ''Gladstone, Ireland, Rome: A word of warning to electors''] (publisher: Fowler Brothers), page 119.</ref> He tried unsuccessfully to get the UK's premier scientific society to denounce the Irish Home Rule proposal as contrary to the interests of science.<ref>The scientists of the British Isles were nearly unanimous in opposing Irish Home Rule, but, to Tyndall's disappointment, a majority of them also thought that the matter didn't have enough direct bearing on the vital interests of science to warrant an organized formal denunciation by them.

His bride, [[Louisa Charlotte Tyndall|Louisa Hamilton]], was the 30-year-old daughter of a member of parliament ([[Lord Claud Hamilton (1813\u20131884)|Lord Claud Hamilton, M.P.]]). The following year, 1877, they built a summer [[chalet]] at [[Belalp]] in the [[Swiss Alps]]. Before getting married Tyndall had been living for many years in an upstairs apartment at the Royal Institution and continued living there after marriage until 1885 when a move was made to a house near [[Haslemere]] 45 miles southwest of London. The marriage was a happy one and without children. He retired from the Royal Institution at age 66 having complaints of ill health.\n\nTyndall became financially well-off from sales of his popular books and fees from his lectures (but there is no evidence that he owned commercial patents). For many years he got non-trivial payments for being a part-time scientific advisor to a couple of quasi-governmental agencies and partly donated the payments to charity. His successful lecture tour of the United States in 1872 netted him a substantial amount of dollars, all of which he promptly donated to a trustee for fostering science in America.<ref>[[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 3/May 1873/Professor Tyndall's Deed of Trust|Professor Tyndall's Deed of Trust]] in ''Popular Science Monthly'', May 1873.

His initial scientific fame arose in the 1850s from his study of [[diamagnetism]]. Later he made discoveries in the realms of [[infrared radiation]] and the physical properties of air, proving the connection between atmospheric CO{{sub|2}} and what is now known as the [[greenhouse effect]] in 1859.\n\nTyndall also published more than a dozen science books which brought state-of-the-art 19th century [[experimental physics]] to a wide audience. From 1853 to 1887 he was professor of physics at the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]] in London.\n\n== Early years and education ==\nTyndall was born in [[Leighlinbridge]], [[County Carlow]], Ireland. His father was a local police constable, descended from [[Gloucestershire]] emigrants who settled in southeast Ireland around 1670. Tyndall attended the local schools (Ballinabranna Primary School) in County Carlow until his late teens, and was probably an assistant teacher near the end of his time there. Subjects learned at school notably included [[technical drawing]] and mathematics with some applications of those subjects to [[land surveying]]. He was hired as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] by the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] in his late teens in 1839, and moved to work for the [[Ordnance Survey]] for Great Britain in 1842. In the decade of the 1840s, a railroad-building boom was in progress, and Tyndall's land surveying experience was valuable and in demand by the railway companies. Between 1844 and 1847, he was lucratively employed in railway construction planning.<ref>When working for the government's land surveying agency in Lancashire, Tyndall was one of a number of employees who signed a petition calling for higher wages plus some other changes in working conditions. In November 1843 all of the signatories to the petition were dismissed from their jobs. In August 1844 Tyndall was hired by a railway surveying company in Lancashire at almost four times higher pay than the government had been paying him. {{cite journal|title=John Tyndall: A study in vocational enterprise|doi=10.1080/03057875780000061|journal=The Vocational Aspect of Education|volume=9 |issue =18|year=1957|author=D.

Recalling this decision later, he wrote: \"the desire to grow intellectually did not forsake me; and, when railway work slackened, I accepted in 1847 a post as master in Queenwood College.\"<ref>Tyndall gave detailed recollections about his life in the 1840s in \"Address Delivered at the Birkbeck Institution on October 22, 1884\", which is published as a chapter in his ''[https://archive.org/details/newfragments00tynd New Fragments]'' essays (1892).</ref> Another recently arrived young teacher at Queenwood was [[Edward Frankland]], who had previously worked as a chemical laboratory assistant for the British Geological Survey. Frankland and Tyndall became good friends. On the strength of Frankland's prior knowledge, they decided to go to Germany to further their education in science. Among other things, Frankland knew that certain German universities were ahead of any in Britain in experimental chemistry and physics. (British universities were still focused on classics and mathematics and not laboratory science.) The pair moved to Germany in summer 1848 and enrolled at the [[University of Marburg]], attracted by the reputation of [[Robert Bunsen]] as a teacher. Tyndall studied under Bunsen for two years.<ref>Tyndall studied under Bunsen from 1848 to 1850. Thirty-five years later, he praised Bunsen for explaining chemistry and physics in \"the language of experiment\" and said \"I still look back on Bunsen as the nearest approach to my ideal of a university teacher.\" [https://archive.org/details/newfragments00tynd ''New Fragments''].</ref> Perhaps more influential for Tyndall at Marburg was Professor [[Hermann Knoblauch]], with whom Tyndall maintained communications by letter for many years afterwards. Tyndall's Marburg dissertation was a mathematical analysis of screw surfaces in 1850 (under Friedrich Ludwig Stegmann). Tyndall stayed in Germany for a further year doing research on magnetism with Knoblauch, including some months' visit at the Berlin laboratory of Knoblauch's main teacher, [[Heinrich Gustav Magnus]]. It is clear today that Bunsen and Magnus were among the very best experimental science instructors of the era. Thus, when Tyndall returned to live in England in summer 1851, he probably had as good an education in experimental science as anyone in England.\n\n==Early scientific work==\nTyndall's early original work in physics was his experiments on [[magnetism]] and [[diamagnetic]] [[Magnetic polarity|polarity]], on which he worked from 1850 to 1856. His two most influential reports were the first two, co-authored with Knoblauch. One of them was entitled \"The magneto-optic properties of crystals, and the relation of magnetism and diamagnetism to molecular arrangement\", dated May 1850. The two described an inspired experiment, with an inspired interpretation. These and other magnetic investigations very soon made Tyndall known among the leading scientists of the day.<ref>Tyndall's main 1850's research reports on diamagnetism were later republished as a collection, which is available at [https://archive.org/details/researchesondiam00tynduoft Archive.org]. In the preface to the collection Tyndall writes about the work's historical context. [[John Tyndall#Biographies of John Tyndall|William T. Jeans' biography of Tyndall]] (pp. 22\u201334) also goes into the historical context of Tyndall's diamagnetic investigations.</ref> He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1852. In his search for a suitable research appointment, he was able to ask the longtime editor of the leading German physics journal ([[Johann Christian Poggendorff|Poggendorff]]) and other prominent men to write testimonials on his behalf. In 1853, he attained the prestigious appointment of Professor of [[Natural Philosophy]] (Physics) at the Royal Institution in London, due in no small part to the esteem his work had garnered from [[Michael Faraday]], the leader of magnetic investigations at the [[Royal Institution]].<ref>Michael Faraday advocated for Tyndall's appointment at the Royal Institution. As part of that, in a letter to the managers of the Royal Institution on 23 May 1853, Faraday praised Tyndall's abilities as a lecturer: \"I have heard him on two or three occasions, when his manner of expounding nature by discourse and experiment was in my judgement excellent\". Source: Emily Hankin (2008), [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/study_msc/dissertations/stable/2008_hankin.pdf \"John Tyndall's Lecture Courses at the Royal Institution and their Reception\"].</ref> About a decade later Tyndall was appointed the successor to the positions held by Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution on Faraday's retirement.\n\n==Alpine mountaineering and glaciology==\nTyndall visited the [[Alps]] mountains in 1856 for scientific reasons and ended up becoming a pioneering mountain climber. He visited the Alps almost every summer from 1856 onward, was a member of the very first mountain-climbing team to reach the top of the [[Weisshorn]] (1861), and lead of one of the early teams to reach the top of the [[Matterhorn]] (1868). He is one the names associated with the \"[[Golden age of alpinism]]\" &mdash; the mid-Victorian years when the more difficult of the Alpine peaks were summited for the first time.<ref>According to the account in Tyndall's book ''The Glaciers of the Alps'' (1860), Tyndall in 1858 reached the summit of [[Monte Rosa]] solo carrying only a ham sandwich for sustenance. The first ascent of Monte Rosa had taken place only in 1855. He had already reached the summit of Monte Rosa in a guided group on 10 August 1858 but he made an unplanned second ascent solo on 17 August 1858 after breakfast: \"the waiter then provided me with a ham sandwich, and, with my [[wiktionary:scrip#Etymology 1|scrip]] thus frugally furnished, I thought the heights of Monte Rosa might be won....\" (continued at pages 151\u2013157 of ''[https://archive.org/details/glaciersalpsbeing00tyndrich Glaciers of the Alps]''). Besides Tyndall's own books, information about Tyndall as a mountaineer is available at [https://archive.org/details/historyofmountai006709mbp ''A History of Mountaineering in the Alps''] by Claire Eliane Engel and [https://archive.org/details/victorianmountai010590mbp ''The Victorian Mountaineers''] by Ronald Clark.</ref>\n\n[[File:Tyndall 1896 Figure 7-37-MJ2.jpg|thumb|300px|John Tyndall explored the glacial tributaries feeding [[Mer de Glace]] in 1857. General topology (left); dirt-bands in glacier (right).]]\nIn the Alps, Tyndall studied [[glacier]]s, and especially [[glacier motion]]. His explanation of glacial flow brought him into dispute with others, particularly [[James David Forbes]]. Much of the early scientific work on glacier motion had been done by Forbes, but Forbes at that time didn't know of the phenomenon of [[regelation]] which was discovered a little later by Michael Faraday. Regelation played a key role in Tyndall's explanation. Forbes didn't see regelation in the same way at all. Complicating their debate, a disagreement arose publicly over who deserved to get investigator credit for what. Articulate friends of Forbes, as well as Forbes himself, thought that Forbes should get the credit for most of the good science, whereas Tyndall thought the credit should be distributed more widely. Tyndall commented: \"The idea of semi-fluid motion belongs entirely to [[Louis Rendu]]; the proof of the quicker central flow belongs in part to Rendu, but almost wholly to [[Louis Agassiz]] and Forbes; the proof of the retardation of the bed belongs to Forbes alone; while the discovery of the locus of the point of maximum motion belongs, I suppose, to me.\"<ref>That quotation from Tyndall appears in the ''[[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' article about Tyndall. For Forbes' view of the issue see \"Appendix A\" (plus Chapter XV) of ''[https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofjam00shaiuoft Life and Letters of James David Forbes]''.</ref> When Forbes and Tyndall were in the grave, their disagreement was continued by their respective official biographers. Everyone tried to be reasonable, but agreement wasn't attained. More disappointingly, aspects of glacier motion remained not understood or not proved.\n\n[[Tyndall Glacier (Chile)|Tyndall Glacier]] located in [[Chile]] and [[Tyndall Glacier (Colorado)|Tyndall Glacier]] in Colorado were named after John Tyndall, as is [[Mount Tyndall]] in California<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brewer, William H. | title = Discovery of Mount Tyndall | journal = The Popular Science Monthly | year = 1873 | volume = 2 | pages = 739\u2013741 | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_2/April_1873/Discovery_of_Mount_Tyndall }}</ref> and [[Mount Tyndall (Tasmania)|Mount Tyndall]] in Tasmania.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Haast, Julius | title = Notes on the Mountains and Glaciers of the Canterbury Province, New Zealand | journal = [[Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London]] | year = 1864 | volume = 34 | pages = 87\u201396 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=JOoRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&dq=Mount+Tyndall | jstor = 1798467 | doi = 10.2307/1798467 }}</ref>\n\n==Main scientific work==\nWork on glaciers alerted Tyndall to the research of [[Horace B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure|de Saussure]] into the heating effect of sunlight, and the concept of [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]], developed by [[Claude Pouillet|Pouillet]] and [[William Hopkins]]; that heat from the sun penetrates the atmosphere more easily than \"obscure heat\" ([[infrared]])  \"terrestrial radiation\" from the warmed Earth, causing what we now call the [[greenhouse effect]].

He concluded that [[water vapour]] is the strongest absorber of radiant heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small. Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere warms the surface in what was later called a [[greenhouse effect]], but he was the first to prove it. The proof was that water vapour strongly absorbed infrared radiation.<ref name=\"Baum\">{{cite journal|last1=Baum, Sr.|first1=Rudy M.|title=Future Calculations: The first climate change believer|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2 |pages=38\u201339 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/future-calculations|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref><ref>Tyndall explained the \"greenhouse effect\" in a public lecture in January 1863 entitled \"On Radiation Through The Earth's Atmosphere\". He emphasized that our environment would be much colder at nighttime in the absence of the greenhouse effect. This short, readable lecture is reprinted in his 1872 book about radiant heat, [https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n441/mode/1up available here].</ref> Relatedly, Tyndall in 1860 was first to demonstrate and quantify that visually transparent gases are infrared emitters.<ref name=InfraredEmissionByGases />\n* He devised demonstrations that advanced the question of how radiant heat is absorbed and emitted at the molecular level. He appears to be the first person to have demonstrated experimentally that emission of heat in chemical reactions has its physical origination within the newly created molecules (1864).<ref name=MolecularPhysicsInDomainOfRadiantHeat /> He produced instructive demonstrations involving the incandescent conversion of infrared into visible light at the molecular level, which he called [[calorescence]] (1865), in which he used materials that are transparent to infrared and opaque to visible light or vice versa.<ref>See [[calorescence]].</ref> He usually referred to infrared as \"radiant heat\", and sometimes as \"ultra-red undulations\", as the word \"infrared\" did not start coming into use until the 1880s. His main reports of the 1860s were republished as a 450-page collection in 1872 under the title ''Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat''.\n* In the investigations on radiant heat in air it had been necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] had been removed.<ref>Reported in a 10-page biography of John Tyndall by Arthur Whitmore Smith, a professor of physics, writing in an American scientific monthly in 1920; [https://archive.org/stream/contributions05michuoft#page/n90/mode/1up available online].</ref> A very sensitive way to detect particulates is to bathe the air with intense light. The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the [[Tyndall Effect]] or Tyndall Scattering.<ref>The term [[Tyndall Scattering]] is subject to some definitional overlap with the terms [[Rayleigh Scattering]] and [[Mie Scattering]].</ref> In studying this scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in electric-powered lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators. He developed the [[nephelometer]] and similar instruments that show properties of [[aerosols]] and [[colloids]] through concentrated light beams against a dark background and are based on exploiting the Tyndall Effect. (When combined with microscopes, the result is the [[ultramicroscope]], which was developed later by others).\n* He was the first to observe and report the phenomenon of [[thermophoresis]] in aerosols. He spotted it surrounding hot objects while investigating the Tyndall Effect with focused lightbeams in a dark room. He devised a better way to demonstrate it, and then simply reported it (1870), without investigating the physics of it in depth.<ref>A brief account of the early history of thermophoresis studies is given in ''Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science'', 2nd edition, year 2006, pages 6274\u20136275. Thermophoresis was first described by Tyndall in a Royal Institution lecture titled [https://archive.org/stream/scientificaddre01tyndgoog#page/n23/mode/1up \"On Haze and Dust\"], year 1870, which is included in Tyndall's 1870 book ''Scientific Addresses''.

In one of his other and simpler experiments, infrared plus visible light beaming from an 1860s-vintage electric lamp was brought to a focus point via a powerful concave mirror. On its way to the focus point, the beam was passed through a body of liquid water. At the focus point, beyond the water, the beam was able to set wood on fire but was not able to melt frozen water. On removal of the intervening body of liquid water, the frozen water rapidly melted.

He built a square wooden box with a couple of glass windows on it. Before closing the box, he coated the inside walls and floor of the box with [[glycerin]], which is a sticky syrup. He found that after a few days' wait the air inside the box was entirely particulate-free when examined with strong light beams through the glass windows. The various floating-matter particulates had all ended up getting stuck to the walls or settling on the sticky floor.<ref>Discussed in Tyndall's book ''[https://archive.org/details/essaysonfloating00tynduoft The Floating-matter of the Air]''. Tyndall writes (page 46): \"Gravity is not the only agent.... It is practically impossible to surround a closed vessel by an absolutely uniform temperature; and where differences of temperature, however small, exist, air-currents will be established. By such gentle currents the floating particles are gradually brought into contact with all the surrounding surfaces. To these they adhere, and the suspended matter finally disappears from the air altogether.\"</ref> Now, in the optically pure air there were no signs of any \"germs\", i.e. no signs of floating micro-organisms. Tyndall sterilised some meat-broths by simply boiling them, and then compared what happened when he let these meat-broths sit in the optically pure air, and in ordinary air. The broths sitting in the optically pure air remained \"sweet\" (as he said) to smell and taste after many months of sitting, while the ones in ordinary air started to become putrid after a few days. This demonstration extended [[Louis Pasteur]]'s earlier demonstrations that the presence of micro-organisms is a precondition for biomass decomposition. However, the next year (1876) Tyndall failed to consistently reproduce the result. Some of his supposedly heat-sterilized broths rotted in the optically pure air. From this Tyndall was led to find viable [[bacterial spores]] (endospores) in supposedly heat-sterilized broths. He discovered the broths had been contaminated with dry bacterial spores from [[hay]] in the lab. All bacteria are killed by simple boiling, except that bacteria have a spore form that can survive boiling, he correctly contended, citing research by [[Ferdinand Cohn]]. Tyndall found a way to eradicate the bacterial spores that came to be known as \"[[Tyndallization]]\". Tyndallization historically was the earliest known effective way to destroy bacterial spores. At the time, it affirmed the \"[[germ theory]]\" against a number of critics whose experimental results had been defective from the same cause. During the mid-1870s Pasteur and Tyndall were in frequent communication.<ref>[http://www.microform.co.uk/guides/R97614.pdf Microform.co.uk] has a catalog (perhaps incomplete) of letters from Pasteur to Tyndall. Communications between the two were most frequent during the mid-1870s. The earliest letter from Pasteur to Tyndall is dated 10 August 1871. Pasteur's early research had been in fermentation vats and broths. As he aimed to extend his program to air, he got in touch with Tyndall as someone who was an expert at dealing technically with air.

In laboratory demonstrations motivated by foghorn issues, Tyndall established that sound is partially ''reflected'' (i.e. partially bounced back like an echo) at the location where an air mass of one temperature meets another air mass of a different temperature; and more generally when a body of air contains two or more air masses of different densities or temperatures, the sound travels poorly because of reflections occurring at the interfaces between the air masses, and very poorly when many such interfaces are present. (He then argued, though inconclusively, that this is the usual main reason why the same distant sound, e.g. foghorn, can be heard stronger or fainter on different days or at different times of day.)<ref>[[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]], who published a much-praised tome about sound in 1877\u201378, has a review of Tyndall's original contributions to the science of sound in [https://archive.org/stream/proceedings14roya#page/216/mode/1up ''Proceedings of the Royal Institution'', Volume XIV], pages 221\u2013223, dated 16 March 1894.

In the Royal Society's catalog 147 entries appear under Tyndall's name between 1850 and 1883.

The biographers Eve and Creasey are quoted as saying: \"His lectures were written down, rehearsed, and profusely illustrated with experiment. He knew that a public lecture should have the same exacting care in production as a play in a theatre.\"</ref> In one lecture, Tyndall demonstrated the propagation of light down through a stream of falling water via [[total internal reflection]] of the light. It was referred to as the \"light fountain\". It is historically significant today because it demonstrates the scientific foundation for modern fibre optic technology. During second half of the 20th century Tyndall was usually credited with being the first to make this demonstration. However, [[Jean-Daniel Colladon]] published a report of it in ''[[Comptes Rendus]]'' in 1842, and there's some suggestive evidence that Tyndall's knowledge of it came ultimately from Colladon and no evidence that Tyndall claimed to have originated it himself.<ref>Daniel Colladon's 1842 \"light fountain\" article is entitled \"On the reflections of a ray of light inside a parabolic liquid stream\". The history of this during the 19th century is in the book [https://books.google.com/books?id=r7HqAvWGUUkC ''The Story of Fiber Optics''] by Jeff Hecht, year 1999, Chapter 2. In Tyndall's own 1870 book ''[https://archive.org/stream/notesofcourseofn00tyndrich#page/20/mode/2up Notes on Light]'' Tyndall has a section entitled \"Total Reflexion\" where he explains: \"When the light passes from air into water, the refracted ray is bent ''towards'' the perpendicular.... When the ray passes from water to air it is bent ''from'' the perpendicular.... If the angle which the ray in water encloses with the perpendicular to the surface be greater than 48 degrees, the ray will not quit the water at all: it will be ''totally reflected'' at the surface.... The angle which marks the limit where total reflexion begins is called the limiting angle of the medium. For water this angle is 48\u00b0 27', for flint glass it is 38\u00b0 41', while for diamond it is 23\u00b0 42'.\"</ref>\n\n===Molecular physics of radiant heat===\n[[File:Tyndall setup for looking at aerosols.jpg|thumb|335px|With this setup Tyndall observed new chemical reactions produced by high frequency light waves acting on certain vapours. The main scientific interest here from his point of view was the additional hard data it lent to the grand question of the mechanism by which molecules absorb [[radiant energy]].]]\nTyndall was an experimenter and laboratory apparatus builder, not an abstract model builder. But in his experiments on radiation and the heat-absorptive power of gases, he had an underlying agenda to understand the physics of molecules. Tyndall said in 1879: \"During nine years of labour on the subject of radiation [in the 1860s], heat and light were handled throughout by me, not as ends, but as instruments by the aid of which the mind might perchance lay hold upon the ultimate particles of matter.\"<ref>Quoted from Tyndall's [https://archive.org/stream/fragmscience02tyndrich#page/385/mode/1up Fragments of Science, Volume II].</ref> This agenda is explicit in the title he picked for his 1872 book ''Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat''. It is present less explicitly in the spirit of his widely read 1863 book ''Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion''. Besides heat he also saw magnetism and sound propagation as reducible to molecular behaviours. Invisible molecular behaviours were the ultimate basis of all physical activity. With this mindset, and his experiments, he outlined an account whereby differing types of molecules have differing absorptions of infrared radiation because their molecular structures give them differing oscillating resonances. He'd gotten into the oscillating resonances idea because he'd seen that any one type of molecule has differing absorptions at differing radiant frequencies, and he was entirely persuaded that the only difference between one frequency and another is the frequency.<ref>In early 1861 Tyndall was writing: \"All the gases and vapours hitherto mentioned [which are absorbers of radiant heat] are transparent to light; that is to say, the waves of the visible spectrum pass among them without sensible absorption. Hence it is plain that their absorptive power depends on the periodicity of the undulations which strike them.... By Kirchhoff it has been conclusively shown that every atom absorbs in a special degree those waves which are synchronous with its own periods of vibration.\" ''[https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n69/mode/1up Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat]''.</ref> He'd also seen that the absorption behaviour of molecules is quite different from that of the atoms composing the molecules. For example, the gas nitric oxide (NO) absorbed more than a thousand times more infrared radiation than either nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).<ref>''Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat'', [https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n102/mode/1up pages 80\u201381 (dated 1862)]. He says on [https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n355/mode/1up page 334 (dated 1869)] that the difference in absorption rates \"may be a millionfold\" : [abridged] \"Let nitrogen and hydrogen be mixed mechanically together in the proportion of 14:3. Radiant heat will pass through the mixture as through a vacuum; the amount of heat intercepted is so small as to be practically insensible. The moment the nitrogen and hydrogen build themselves together into the molecules of ammonia [NH<sub>3</sub>] the amount of radiant heat which they absorb is augmented more than a thousandfold. It may be a millionfold, for we do not yet know how small the absorption of the absolutely pure mixture really is. The act of chemical union is the sole cause of the enormous alteration in the amount of heat intercepted. The converse is also true: dissolve the chemical bond of the ammonia, and you instantly destroy the absorption.\"</ref> He'd also seen in several kinds of experiments that \u2013 no matter whether a gas is a weak absorber of broad-spectrum radiant heat \u2013 any gas will strongly absorb the radiant heat coming from a separate body of the same type of gas.<ref name=MolecularPhysicsInDomainOfRadiantHeat>In the late 1850s Balfour Stewart had showed that cold rock-salt was a very strong absorber of the radiations from hot rock-salt, even though rock-salt was a very weak absorber of the radiations from all other kinds of heat-sources tested. By the early 1860s this had been generalized in the scientific literature to the principle that any kind of chemical will very strongly absorb the radiations coming from a separate body of the same kind of chemical. In Tyndall's words this was a \"principle which lies at the basis of spectrum analysis, ... namely, that a body which is competent to emit any ray, whether of heat or light, is competent in the same degree to absorb that ray\" [https://archive.org/stream/fragmscience01tyndrich#page/83/mode/1up (1866)]. Tyndall made several original observations around 1863 by beginning with the assumption that this principle is correct. The following is a summary of one of them. It was well-known at the time that in a flame of burning carbon monoxide, the carbon monoxide chemically combines with the oxygen of the air to form carbon dioxide plus heat. Tyndall observed that if a body of cold or room-temperature carbon dioxide is placed near the flame \"the cold gas is intensely opaque to [i.e. it very strongly absorbs] the radiation from this particular flame, though it is highly transparent to [i.e. it very weakly absorbs] heat of every other kind.\" Thus the great bulk of the heat in the carbon monoxide flame fits the [[emission spectrum]] of carbon dioxide, implying the heat is a radiant emission from the newly formed carbon dioxide molecules. Tyndall got the same type of result with a flame of [[hydrogen fuel|burning hydrogen]], another flame known to be chemically simple in the sense that very little intermediate or transitory molecules are produced in it. This appears to be the first demonstration that the heat given out in chemical reactions has its physical origination within the new molecules. Tyndall's report of the demonstration is in ''[https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01tyndgoog Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat]'', sections 11\u201317 of Chapter VI, dated 1864. A related demonstration is in sections 3\u20138 of Chapter V, dated 1863. It is also discussed in Tyndall's ''[https://archive.org/stream/fragmscience01tyndrich#page/74/mode/1up Fragments of Science, Volume I]'' Chapter III, dated 1866. For a modern analysis of where the heat is coming from in the carbon monoxide flame see {{cite journal|jstor=2414583|title=The Carbon Monoxide Flame Bands|author=R. N. Dixon|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

This was in contrast to the easily seen fact in solids such as carbon and platinum where the spectral profile moves towards the quicker frequencies when the temperature is increased.</ref> That demonstrated a kinship between the molecular mechanisms of [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]. Such a kinship was also in evidence in experiments by [[Balfour Stewart]] and others, cited and extended by Tyndall, that showed with respect to broad-spectrum radiant heat that molecules that are weak absorbers are weak emitters and strong absorbers are strong emitters.<ref name=InfraredEmissionByGases>After his measurements of infrared absorption by gases in 1859, Tyndall measured infrared emission by gases in 1860, with respect to broad-spectrum infrared radiation. He did this for many different gases, and when the gases were ranked by their emissive powers the rank order was the same as it was for their absorptive powers. His February 1861 article \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=D1dKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1 On the Absorption and Radiation of Heat by Gases and Vapours, and on the Physical Connexion of Radiation, Absorption, and Conduction]\"  in ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', Volume 151, pages 1\u201336, year 1861, was later republished in the book ''[https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01tyndgoog Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat]'', Chapter I; and in the same book there is more in Chapter II section 11 (year 1862), and chapter IX section 6 (year 1865). These laboratory experiments by Tyndall on \"the reciprocity of absorption and radiation on the part of gases\" were informed by experiments done on solids by Balfour Stewart in 1858 and 1859. The two relevant articles by Balfour Stewart are online as republished in 1901 in ''[https://archive.org/details/lawsofradiationa00bracrich The Laws of Radiation and Absorption: Memoirs by Pr\u00e9vost, Stewart, Kirchhoff and Bunsen]''.</ref> (For example, [[rock-salt]] is an exceptionally poor absorber of heat via radiation, and a good absorber of heat via conduction. When a plate of rock-salt is heated via conduction and let stand on an insulator, it takes an exceptionally long time to cool down; i.e., it's a poor emitter of infrared.) The kinship between absorption and emission was also consistent with some generic or abstract features of [[resonator]]s.<ref>In 1853 [[Anders Jonas \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m|Anders \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m]] had argued, based on general principles of resonance, that an incandescent gas should emit luminous rays of the same frequencies as those it can absorb. After this was affirmed and made more general experimentally by Tyndall and others in the early 1860s, \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m got a lot of plaudits. When the original paper by \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m (published in German in 1854) was published in English in 1855, the translator from the German was John Tyndall. {{cite book|author=John Charles Drury Brand|title=Lines of light: the sources of dispersive spectroscopy, 1800\u20131930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spYSK-g8DrkC&pg=PA61|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-2-88449-162-4|pages=61\u2013}}</ref> The chemical decomposition of molecules by lightwaves ([[photochemical effect]]) convinced Tyndall that the resonator could not be the molecule as a whole unit; it had to be some substructure, because otherwise the photochemical effect would be impossible.<ref>''Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat'' [https://archive.org/stream/contributionsto01tyndgoog#page/n448/mode/1up page 428, dated 1868]. When talking about chemical reactions produced by light he says \"if the absorption [of radiant energy] were the act of the molecule as a whole, the relative motions of its constituent atoms would remain unchanged, and there would be no mechanical cause for their separation [in a photochemical decomposition].\" Therefore in a photochemical decomposition, \"it is probably the synchronism of the vibrations of ''one portion'' of the molecule with the incident waves which enables the amplitude of those vibrations to augment [i.e. resonate] until the chain which binds the parts of the molecule together is snapped asunder.\"</ref> But he was without testable ideas as to the form of this substructure, and did not partake in speculation in print.

''The New York Times'' noted that more than half the people attending the lectures were women (which was generally true of Tyndall's lectures in London as well) and noted that the series of evening lectures about the nature of light delivered in Washington DC was attended by eminent U.S. Senators, Cabinet Ministers, and one night the U.S. President himself, accompanied by his daughter.

When he lectures at the Royal Institution the theatre is crowded.\"<ref>Tyndall was a celebrity in the later 19th century and he was one of the people profiled in the 1878 book ''[https://archive.org/details/celebritiesathom02yate Celebrities at Home (2nd Series)]''.</ref> Tyndall said of the occupation of teacher \"I do not know a higher, nobler, and more blessed calling.\"<ref>Tyndall said in 1884: \"Two factors went to the formation of a teacher. In regard to knowledge he must, of course, be master of his work.... [and secondly] a power of character must underlie and enforce the work of the intellect. There were men who could so rouse and energise their pupils \u2013 so call forth their strength and the pleasure of its exercise \u2013 as to make the hardest work agreeable. Without this power it is questionable whether the teacher could ever really enjoy his vocation; with it, I do not know a higher, nobler, and more blessed calling.\" ''[https://archive.org/stream/newfragments00tynd/#page/232/mode/1up New Fragments]''.</ref> His greatest audience was gained ultimately through his books, most of which were not written for experts or specialists. He published more than a dozen science books.<ref>Some of his science books were short, like 80 pages, and others were not. See the [[John Tyndall#John Tyndall's books|List of John Tyndall's books]].</ref> From the mid-1860s on, he was one of the world's most famous living physicists, due firstly to his skill and industry as a tutorialist. Most of his books were translated into German<ref>A catalog of the German editions of Tyndall's books at [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AJohn+Tyndall&fq=ln%3Ager Worldcat.org].</ref> and French<ref>A catalog of the French editions of Tyndall's books at [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AJohn+Tyndall&fq=ln%3Afre Worldcat.org].</ref> with his main tutorials staying in print in those languages for decades.\n\nAs an indicator of his teaching attitude, here are his concluding remarks to the reader at the end of a 200-page tutorial book for a \"youthful audience\", ''The Forms of Water'' (1872): \"Here, my friend, our labours close. It has been a true pleasure to me to have you at my side so long. In the sweat of our brows we have often reached the heights where our work lay, but you have been steadfast and industrious throughout, using in all possible cases your own muscles instead of relying upon mine. Here and there I have stretched an arm and helped you to a ledge, but the work of climbing has been almost exclusively your own. It is thus that I should like to teach you all things; showing you the way to profitable exertion, but leaving the exertion to you.... Our task seems plain enough, but you and I know how often we have had to wrangle resolutely with the facts to bring out their meaning. The work, however, is now done, and you are master of a fragment of that sure and certain knowledge which is founded on the faithful study of nature.... Here then we part. And should we not meet again, the memory of these days will still unite us. Give me your hand. Good bye.\"<ref>Quoted from Tyndall's ''[https://archive.org/stream/formsofwaterincl00tyndiala#page/190/mode/2up The Forms of Water in Clouds and Rivers, Ice and Glaciers]'', year 1872.</ref>\n\nAs another indicator, here is the opening paragraph of his 350-page tutorial entitled ''Sound'' (1867): \"In the following pages I have tried to render the science of acoustics interesting to all intelligent persons, including those who do not possess any special scientific culture. The subject is treated experimentally throughout, and I have endeavoured so to place each experiment before the reader that he should realise it as an actual operation.\" In the preface to the 3rd edition of this book, he reports that earlier editions were translated into Chinese at the expense of the Chinese government and translated into German under the supervision of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (a big name in the science of acoustics).<ref>John Tyndall, [https://archive.org/details/sound05tyndgoog ''Sound'', 3rd edition (1875)].</ref> His first published tutorial, which was about glaciers (1860), similarly states: \"The work is written with a desire to interest intelligent persons who may not possess any special scientific culture.\"\n\nHis most widely praised tutorial, and probably his biggest seller, was the 550-page ''\"Heat: a Mode of Motion\"'' (1863; updated editions until 1880). It was in print for at least 50 years,<ref>The UK publisher was Longmans. The US publisher was Appleton. Longmans kept the book in print until sometime after 1908 and Appleton until sometime after 1915. See [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2536919/editions?editionsView=true Worldcat.org]. The German publisher, Braunschweig, introduced a renewed German edition in 1894; and the French publisher, Gauthier-Villars, in 1887. In Russian the first edition was in 1864 [http://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/24939/1/Why%20Does%20Levin%20Read%20Tyndall.pdf (ref)] and an updated edition came out in Russian in 1888 [http://www.worldcat.org/title/teplota-razsmatrivaemaia-kak-rod-dvizheniia-publichnyia-lektsii-perevod-s-7-go-angliiskago-izd/oclc/49259153 (ref)].</ref> and is in print today. Its primary feature is, as James Clerk Maxwell said in 1871, \"the doctrines of the science [of heat] are forcibly impressed on the mind by well-chosen illustrative experiments.\"<ref>J. Clerk Maxwell (1871, 1872) [https://archive.org/stream/theoryheat06maxwgoog#page/n10/mode/2up ''Theory of Heat''], preface page vi (publisher: Longmans, Green & Co).</ref>\n\nTyndall's three longest tutorials, namely ''Heat'' (1863), ''Sound'' (1867), and ''Light'' (1873), represented state-of-the-art experimental physics at the time they were written. Much of their contents were recent major innovations in the understanding of their respective subjects, which Tyndall was the first writer to present to a wider audience. One caveat is called for about the meaning of \"state of the art\". The books were devoted to laboratory science and they avoided mathematics. In particular, they contain absolutely no infinitesimal calculus. Mathematical modelling using infinitesimal calculus, especially differential equations, was a component of the state-of-the-art understanding of heat, light and sound at the time.\n\n==Demarcation of science from religion==\n[[File:John Tyndall, 1872.jpg|thumb|upright|Tyndall caricatured as a preacher in the magazine ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1872]]\n\nThe majority of the progressive and innovative British physicists of Tyndall's generation were conservative and orthodox on matters of religion. That includes for example [[James Joule]], [[Balfour Stewart]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[George Gabriel Stokes]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] \u2013 all names investigating heat or light contemporaneously with Tyndall. These conservatives believed, and sought to strengthen the basis for believing, that religion and science were consistent and harmonious with each other. Tyndall, however, was a member of [[X Club|a club]] that vocally supported [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution and sought to strengthen the barrier, or separation, between religion and science. The most prominent member of this club was the anatomist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. Tyndall first met Huxley in 1851 and the two had a lifelong friendship. Chemist [[Edward Frankland]] and mathematician [[Thomas Archer Hirst]], both of whom Tyndall had known since before going to university in Germany, were members too. Others included the social philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]].\n\nThough not nearly so prominent as Huxley in controversy over philosophical problems, Tyndall played his part in communicating to the educated public what he thought were the virtues of having a clear separation between science (knowledge & rationality) and religion (faith & spirituality).<ref>A review of how Tyndall demarcated science from religion, marshalling quotes from Tyndall, is in {{Cite book | last = Gieryn | first = Thomas F. | contribution = John Tyndall's Double Boundary-Work | title = Cultural Boundaries of Science | pages = 37\u201364 | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | place = | year = 1999 | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GljD3CHbDx0C&pg=PA37 | accessdate = }}.</ref> As the elected president of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1874, he gave a long [[keynote speech]] at the Association's annual meeting held that year in Belfast. The speech gave a favourable account of the history of evolutionary theories, mentioning Darwin's name favourably more than 20 times, and concluded by asserting that religious sentiment should not be permitted to \"intrude on the region of ''knowledge'', over which it holds no command\". This was a hot topic. The newspapers carried the report of it on their front pages \u2013 in Britain, Ireland & North America, even the European Continent \u2013 and many critiques of it appeared soon after. The attention and scrutiny increased the friends of the evolutionists' philosophical position, and brought it closer to mainstream ascendancy.<ref>The text of Tyndall's 1874 ''Belfast Address'' is available at [http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/belfast.html Victorianweb.org]. This speech got more coverage in the Victorian-era newspapers than any other single public speech in the decades-long Victorian debate over the status of evolution theory. A lengthy review of the speech and the speech's reception by London newspapers was published by ''The New York Times'' on 5 September 1874. It is downloadable at [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D06E4DE1E39EF34BC4D53DFBF66838F669FDE ref]. The great majority of London newspapers either endorsed Tyndall's position or took a neutral but respectful attitude towards it. Among other commentators the speech did have critics but a majority of these looked askance at subtleties and minor aspects [http://www.gkbenterprises.org.uk/thesis/ch05.htm#fnote61anc (e.g.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907075712/http://www.gkbenterprises.org.uk/thesis/ch05.htm |date=7 September 2008 }}, [https://archive.org/details/ideasinnatureove00mcco (e.g.)]; only a minority defended a role for religious belief in formation of knowledge. As the London ''Times'' put it when the speech was making front-page news: \"It is probably part of the great change in the manners of this country that [the speech]... will now encounter little contradiction even in the most religious circles\" (reprinted by [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1874/09/07/79081649.pdf ''New York Times'', 7 Sep 1874]). Among the exceptions, the Irish Catholic bishops decried it as paganism. Because the speech got widespread attention and little contradiction, and came from the Establishment post of the presidency of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, later historians have seen the speech as the \"final victory\" of the evolutionists in Victorian Britain. E.g., {{cite book|title=Darwin's Metaphor: Nature's Place in Victorian Culture|author=Robert M.

A doctrine of such character is most hurtful both to individuals and to the State.... It follows that it is quite unlawful to demand, to defend, or to grant, unconditional [or promiscuous] freedom of thought, speech, writing, or religion.\"<ref>Those quotations are from the [[s:The Syllabus of Errors|''Syllabus of Errors'']] decree (year 1864, [[Pope Pius IX]]) and the [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_20061888_libertas_en.html ''Libertas''] decree (year 1888, [[Pope Leo XIII]]). The ''Libertas'' decree also says: [\u00b627, abridged] \"The divine teaching of the Church brings the sure guidance of shining light. Therefore, there is no reason why true science should feel aggrieved at having to bear the restraint of laws by which, in the judgment of the Church, human teaching has to be controlled.\"</ref> Those principles and Tyndall's principles were profound enemies. Luckily for Tyndall he didn't need to get into a contest with them in Britain, nor in most other parts of the world. Even in Italy, Huxley and Darwin were awarded honorary medals and most of the Italian governing class was hostile to the papacy.<ref>For Italy see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]].

Between 1886 and 1893 Tyndall was active in the debate in England about whether to give the Catholics of Ireland more freedom to go their own way. Like the great majority of Irish-born scientists of the 19th century he opposed the [[Irish Home Rule Movement]]. He had ardent views about it, which were published in newspapers and pamphlets.<ref>For a list of Tyndall's pamphlets against Irish Home Rule search both [https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?search-alias=stripbooks&field-author=tyndall&field-title=gladstone Amazon] and [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=%28author%3AJohn+AND+author%3ATyndall%29+AND+%28subject%3A%22Ireland+-+Politics+and+government+-+1837-1901.%22+OR+subject%3A%22Great+Britain+-+Politics+and+government+-+1837-1901.%22%29&type=all&limits=format%3ABook&submit=Find National Library of Australia]. One of the pamphlets, ''Mr. Gladstone's Sudden Reversal of Polarity'', documented how British Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] did a [[Flip-flop (politics)|flip-flop]] on the Home Rule question. The intent was to undermine Gladstone's intellectual credibility on the question. Gladstone publicly defended himself against the attack. The debate between them got a lot of attention in the newspapers. Tyndall was a conspicuous participant in the Irish Home Rule debate in the London newspapers between 1886 and 1893. When he died in 1893, ''The Times'' newspaper obituary noted that \"our readers will remember many eloquent letters written by him of late years, full of unsparing condemnation of Mr. Gladstone's recent [Ireland] policy.\" \u2013 [https://archive.org/stream/eminentpersonsbi06timeiala#page/84/mode/2up Ref].</ref> For example, in an opinion piece in ''[[The Times]]'' on 27 December 1890 he saw priests and Catholicism as \"the heart and soul of this movement\" and wrote that placing the non-Catholic minority under the dominion of \"the priestly horde\" would be \"an unspeakable crime\".<ref>More from Tyndall's letter is in the year 1891 compilation [https://archive.org/details/gladstoneireland00londiala/ ''Gladstone, Ireland, Rome: A word of warning to electors''] (publisher: Fowler Brothers), page 119.</ref> He tried unsuccessfully to get the UK's premier scientific society to denounce the Irish Home Rule proposal as contrary to the interests of science.<ref>The scientists of the British Isles were nearly unanimous in opposing Irish Home Rule, but, to Tyndall's disappointment, a majority of them also thought that the matter didn't have enough direct bearing on the vital interests of science to warrant an organized formal denunciation by them.

His bride, [[Louisa Charlotte Tyndall|Louisa Hamilton]], was the 30-year-old daughter of a member of parliament ([[Lord Claud Hamilton (1813\u20131884)|Lord Claud Hamilton, M.P.]]). The following year, 1877, they built a summer [[chalet]] at [[Belalp]] in the [[Swiss Alps]]. Before getting married Tyndall had been living for many years in an upstairs apartment at the Royal Institution and continued living there after marriage until 1885 when a move was made to a house near [[Haslemere]] 45 miles southwest of London. The marriage was a happy one and without children. He retired from the Royal Institution at age 66 having complaints of ill health.\n\nTyndall became financially well-off from sales of his popular books and fees from his lectures (but there is no evidence that he owned commercial patents). For many years he got non-trivial payments for being a part-time scientific advisor to a couple of quasi-governmental agencies and partly donated the payments to charity. His successful lecture tour of the United States in 1872 netted him a substantial amount of dollars, all of which he promptly donated to a trustee for fostering science in America.<ref>[[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 3/May 1873/Professor Tyndall's Deed of Trust|Professor Tyndall's Deed of Trust]] in ''Popular Science Monthly'', May 1873.

Thank you. -->\nIn the Valley of Peace, a land in ancient China inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, Po Ping the [[giant panda]] is a [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] fanatic who idolizes the Furious Five \u2013 Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Viper, and Mantis \u2013 a quintet of awesome kung fu masters trained by Master Shifu, the [[red panda]]. However, Po is unable to pursue his dream of learning kung fu as he helps his adoptive father, Mr. Ping the goose, in his [[noodle]] restaurant.\n\nGrand Master Oogway, an old [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]], Shifu's mentor and friend, has a vision that Shifu's former student and adoptive son, the evil [[snow leopard]], Tai Lung, will escape from prison and return to the valley to exact his revenge for being denied the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to boundless power. Panicked, Shifu sends his messenger, Zeng the goose, with a request for the prison to tighten its security. He then holds a tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway can identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll. Po arrives too late to enter the arena; desperate to see the Dragon Warrior, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks and launches himself into the middle of the arena in front of Oogway as he points towards the Dragon Warrior. To the astonishment of everyone present, Oogway proclaims Po as the chosen warrior.\n\nUnwilling to accept Oogway's decision, and believing it to be an accident, Shifu tries to dispose of Po with a harsh training regime. The Furious Five berate Po as an enthusiast with no potential in martial arts. Po considers resigning, but after receiving encouragement from Oogway, he endures his training and gradually befriends the Five with his durability, resilience, culinary skill, and good humor. One night when Po talks about Shifu's treatment toward him, Tigress tells the story of how Shifu raised Tai Lung since finding him as a cub and trained him in kung-fu. After Tai Lung was denied the Dragon Scroll he went on a rampage across the valley and tried to take the scroll by force, with Shifu unable to fight his adoptive son. Though Oogway was able to stop him, Tai Lung's betrayal caused Shifu to become cold and distant.\n\nMeanwhile, Tai Lung escapes from prison, ironically picking his locks with Zeng's fallen feather. Shifu horrifyingly learns of Tai Lung's escape from Zeng and informs Oogway, who extracts a promise from Shifu to believe in Po, and then [[Ascension (mystical)|passes on to the heavens]] in a stream of peach blossoms. Still unable to grasp the basics of kung fu, Po despairingly admits that he has no chance of defeating Tai Lung. Overhearing this, the Five leave to stop Tai Lung themselves. However, Shifu discovers that Po is capable of impressive physical feats when motivated by food. Using food as [[positive reinforcement]], Shifu successfully trains Po by incorporating these feats into an innovative kung fu style.\n\nMeanwhile, the Five battle with Tai Lung, but are defeated by his nerve attacks. He spares Crane to transport the rest of the Five, still paralyzed from his nerve strikes, back to Shifu as a warning. After reviving them, Shifu decides that Po is ready to receive the Dragon Scroll, but the scroll reveals nothing but a blank, reflective surface. Believing the scroll to be useless, Shifu orders Po and the Five to evacuate the valley while he faces Tai Lung. A distraught Po finds Mr. Ping. In an attempt to console his son, Mr. Ping reveals that the secret ingredient to his famous \"special secret ingredient noodle soup\" is \"nothing\", explaining that things are special when believed to be. Po realizes that this is the message of the Dragon Scroll and goes back to confront Tai Lung.\n \t\nPo arrives to find Shifu badly injured and defeated. He then becomes a formidable challenge for Tai Lung, frustrating him with confusing fighting techniques on top of his excessive body fat that renders him with an incredible ability to absorb damage and immunity to Tai Lung's nerve strikes. Tai Lung momentarily beats Po and retrieves the scroll, but he is unable to understand it and continues attacking Po. Eventually, Po defeats Tai Lung in combat by using the mysterious Wuxi Finger Hold to vanquish him.{{efn|In ''[[Kung Fu Panda 3]]'', it is revealed that using the Wuxi Finger Hold transports the opponent to the Spirit Realm.}} Po is praised by the Valley of Peace and earns the respect of the Furious Five, who fully acknowledge him as a true kung fu master, while Shifu finally attains peace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see|List of Kung Fu Panda characters}}\n[[File:Kung Fu Panda The Five.jpg|upright=1.36|thumb|right|From left to right: Viper, Monkey, Mantis (on Monkey's head), Shifu, Tigress, and Crane.

The film is set in a version of ancient China populated by anthropomorphic [[Talking animals in fiction|talking animals]] and revolves around a bumbling panda named [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]], a [[kung fu]] enthusiast. When an evil kung fu warrior named Tai Lung is foretold to escape from prison, Po is unwittingly named the \"Dragon Warrior\", that was destined to defeat him.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=September 1, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7560194.stm|title=Kung Fu Panda sequel in pipeline|work=BBC|date=August 14, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe film was originally conceived by Michael Lachance, a DreamWorks Animation executive. It was originally intended to be a parody of martial arts films, but director Stevenson decided instead to make an action comedy [[wuxia]] film that incorporates the [[hero's journey]] [[narrative]] [[archetype]] for the lead character. The computer animation in the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. As with most DreamWorks Animation films, [[Hans Zimmer]] (this time collaborating with [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]]) scored ''Kung Fu Panda''. He visited China to absorb the culture and get to know the [[China National Symphony Orchestra]] as part of his preparation.\n \t\n''Kung Fu Panda'' premiered in the United States on June 6, 2008. The film received positive reviews upon release. ''Kung Fu Panda'' opened in 4,114 theaters, grossing $20.3&nbsp;million on its opening day and $60.2&nbsp;million on its opening weekend, resulting in the number one position at the box office. The film became DreamWorks' biggest opening for a non-sequel film, the highest grossing animated film of the year worldwide, and also had the fourth-largest opening weekend for a DreamWorks film at the American and Canadian box office, behind all three ''[[Shrek]]'' sequels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37302907/ns/today-entertainment/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526010221/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37302907/ns/today-entertainment/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 26, 2010|title='Shrek Forever After' roars to top of box office|publisher=MSNBC|date=May 23, 2010|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Kung Fu Panda 2]]'', was released on May 26, 2011, along with a television series ''[[Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness]]'' premiering on [[Nickelodeon]] later that same year as a part of [[Kung Fu Panda (franchise)|a franchise]]. A second sequel, ''[[Kung Fu Panda 3]]'',was released on January 29, 2016.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be around 400-700 words. Thank you. -->\nIn the Valley of Peace, a land in ancient China inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, Po Ping the [[giant panda]] is a [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] fanatic who idolizes the Furious Five \u2013 Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Viper, and Mantis \u2013 a quintet of awesome kung fu masters trained by Master Shifu, the [[red panda]]. However, Po is unable to pursue his dream of learning kung fu as he helps his adoptive father, Mr. Ping the goose, in his [[noodle]] restaurant.\n\nGrand Master Oogway, an old [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]], Shifu's mentor and friend, has a vision that Shifu's former student and adoptive son, the evil [[snow leopard]], Tai Lung, will escape from prison and return to the valley to exact his revenge for being denied the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to boundless power. Panicked, Shifu sends his messenger, Zeng the goose, with a request for the prison to tighten its security. He then holds a tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway can identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll. Po arrives too late to enter the arena; desperate to see the Dragon Warrior, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks and launches himself into the middle of the arena in front of Oogway as he points towards the Dragon Warrior. To the astonishment of everyone present, Oogway proclaims Po as the chosen warrior.\n\nUnwilling to accept Oogway's decision, and believing it to be an accident, Shifu tries to dispose of Po with a harsh training regime. The Furious Five berate Po as an enthusiast with no potential in martial arts. Po considers resigning, but after receiving encouragement from Oogway, he endures his training and gradually befriends the Five with his durability, resilience, culinary skill, and good humor. One night when Po talks about Shifu's treatment toward him, Tigress tells the story of how Shifu raised Tai Lung since finding him as a cub and trained him in kung-fu. After Tai Lung was denied the Dragon Scroll he went on a rampage across the valley and tried to take the scroll by force, with Shifu unable to fight his adoptive son. Though Oogway was able to stop him, Tai Lung's betrayal caused Shifu to become cold and distant.\n\nMeanwhile, Tai Lung escapes from prison, ironically picking his locks with Zeng's fallen feather. Shifu horrifyingly learns of Tai Lung's escape from Zeng and informs Oogway, who extracts a promise from Shifu to believe in Po, and then [[Ascension (mystical)|passes on to the heavens]] in a stream of peach blossoms. Still unable to grasp the basics of kung fu, Po despairingly admits that he has no chance of defeating Tai Lung. Overhearing this, the Five leave to stop Tai Lung themselves. However, Shifu discovers that Po is capable of impressive physical feats when motivated by food. Using food as [[positive reinforcement]], Shifu successfully trains Po by incorporating these feats into an innovative kung fu style.\n\nMeanwhile, the Five battle with Tai Lung, but are defeated by his nerve attacks. He spares Crane to transport the rest of the Five, still paralyzed from his nerve strikes, back to Shifu as a warning. After reviving them, Shifu decides that Po is ready to receive the Dragon Scroll, but the scroll reveals nothing but a blank, reflective surface. Believing the scroll to be useless, Shifu orders Po and the Five to evacuate the valley while he faces Tai Lung. A distraught Po finds Mr. Ping. In an attempt to console his son, Mr. Ping reveals that the secret ingredient to his famous \"special secret ingredient noodle soup\" is \"nothing\", explaining that things are special when believed to be. Po realizes that this is the message of the Dragon Scroll and goes back to confront Tai Lung.\n \t\nPo arrives to find Shifu badly injured and defeated. He then becomes a formidable challenge for Tai Lung, frustrating him with confusing fighting techniques on top of his excessive body fat that renders him with an incredible ability to absorb damage and immunity to Tai Lung's nerve strikes. Tai Lung momentarily beats Po and retrieves the scroll, but he is unable to understand it and continues attacking Po. Eventually, Po defeats Tai Lung in combat by using the mysterious Wuxi Finger Hold to vanquish him.{{efn|In ''[[Kung Fu Panda 3]]'', it is revealed that using the Wuxi Finger Hold transports the opponent to the Spirit Realm.}} Po is praised by the Valley of Peace and earns the respect of the Furious Five, who fully acknowledge him as a true kung fu master, while Shifu finally attains peace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see|List of Kung Fu Panda characters}}\n[[File:Kung Fu Panda The Five.jpg|upright=1.36|thumb|right|From left to right: Viper, Monkey, Mantis (on Monkey's head), Shifu, Tigress, and Crane.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song, which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours, such as singing, to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side-effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]). However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island, high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences, therefore, remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song, which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours, such as singing, to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side-effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

The term usually refers to written media, such as [[book]]s and [[magazine]]s, either as an [[E-book|ebook]] or as a physical copy using [[Print on demand|POD (print on demand)]] technology. It may also apply to [[album]]s, pamphlets, brochures, video content, and [[zine]]s.\n\nIn the traditional publishing model, in which the publisher bears all the costs and risks of publication, but retains most of the profit if the book is successful.  In self-publishing, the author bears all the costs and risks, but earns a higher share of the profit per sale.\n\nThe $1&nbsp;billion market of self-publishing has transformed in the past two decades with new technologies providing increasing alternatives to traditional publishing.{{r|twsFortune147}} Self-publishing is increasingly becoming the first choice for writers.{{r|twsNPR899}} Most self-published books sell very few copies,{{r|twsWP57575}}   Those which sell large numbers are newsworthy because they are so rare. The quality of self-published works varies considerably, because there are no barriers to publication and no quality control.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\n==History==\n===Early examples===\n[[File:George Cruikshank - Tristram Shandy, Plate VIII. The Smoking Batteries.jpg|thumb|right|The original ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' was self-published by British author Laurence Sterne. Photo: an illustration from the original work by artist [[George Cruikshank]].]]\nSelf-publishing is not a new phenomenon. While most novels were distributed by established publishers, there have been authors who chose to self-publish, or even start their own presses, such as [[John Locke]]{{r|twsCSM2342}}, [[Jane Austen]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Walt Whitman]].{{r|patterson}}  In 1759, British satirist [[Laurence Sterne]]'s self-published the first two volumes of ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''.{{r|patterson}}   In 1908, [[Ezra Pound]] sold ''[[A Lume Spento]]'' for six pence each.{{r|patterson}} [[Franklin Hiram King]]'s book ''Farmers of Forty Centuries'' was self-published in 1911, and was subsequently published commercially. In 1931 the author of ''[[The Joy of Cooking]]'' paid a local printing company to print 3000 copies; the Bobbs-Merrill Company acquired the rights, and since then the book has sold over 18&nbsp;million copies.{{r|huffpost_books}} In 1941, writer [[Virginia Woolf]] chose to self-publish her final novel ''[[Between the Acts]]'' on her [[Hogarth Press]], in effect starting her own press.{{r|patterson}}\n\n===Negative stigma===\n{{Quote|Five years ago, self-publishing was a scar. Now it's a tattoo.|Greg White, in ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', 2016{{r|twsBloomberg433}}}}\nUntil the advent of [[E-book|ebooks]] and [[Print on demand|POD technology]], most self-published books were published through a [[vanity press]],{{R|twsNPR4432}} so called because such authors were assumed to be egotistical writers, unable to accept their work was not good enough to be accepted by traditional publishers.{{R|twsNPR4432}}    [[James D. Macdonald]] claimed that vanity publishing violated ''Yog's Law'' which states that \"Money should flow toward the author.\"{{r|twsYogsLaw}} Vanity publishing usually required a one-time payment of $5,000 to $10,000 to do a print run of 1000 books; these books usually ended up in boxes in a garage.{{r|twsNYT9989}}   \n\n[[File:Digital Printing Press.JPG|thumb|right|This modern printing press takes digital files and prints books.]]\nPhotographer-turned-publisher Max Bondi said that \"investing in a project shows that you believe in it\".{{R|twsTime101}} Nevertheless, part of the reason for the negative stigma is that many self-published books are of dubious quality, because they are written by authors who are still learning their craft, and have never been edited or even proof-read. For example, in 1995, a retired TV repairman self-published his autobiography in which he described how he had been stepped on by a horse when he was a boy, how he had been almost murdered by his stepfather when he was a young man in Mexico, and how his ex-wife had clawed his face with her fingernails. The repairman spent $10,000 to have his 150-page masterpiece printed up, and, for promotion purposes, he sent copies to a local library, to the White House, and to everybody with the repairman's same last name. These efforts did not lead anywhere; today, the book is largely forgotten.{{r|twsNYT4221}}\n\nSelf-publishing is still seen as a \"mark of failure\" by many.{{r|twsNPR2322}}  The image of self-publishing has been improving and some feel the stigma is gone entirely,{{r|twsMiHer4949}} while others feel it still has a way to go to cultivate respectability.{{r|twsWashPost0909}} Book critic Ron Charles in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' complained that \"No, I don't want to read your self-published book\", citing concerns that self-published books lacked quality and were published by authors with little understanding of the audience or the market.{{r|twsWashPost0909}} However rare breakaway bestsellers such as ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' {{r|huffpost_books}} and  ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'' were first self-published, helping to lend respectability to self-publishing in general.{{r|Martian22}} Further, with new avenues of self-publishing, there are more opportunities for authors to break through directly to audiences.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n\n{{Quote|For decades, the literary world dismissed self-published authors as amateurs and hacks who lacked the talent to land a book deal. But that attitude gradually began to change with the rise of e-books and the arrival of Kindle from Amazon, which gave authors direct access to millions of readers.|Alexandra Alter in the ''[[New York Times]]'', 2016{{r|twsNYT80009}}}}\n\n===Technological changes===\n[[File:Traditional publishing route before self publishing.jpg|thumb|350px|In previous decades, publishing meant going through agents and publishers.]]\n[[File:Chart showing how self publishing allows authors to bypass publishers and sell directly to the public.jpg|thumb|350px|Today, self publishing permits authors to bypass publishers and bookstores and sell directly to the public.]]\nA huge impetus to self-publishing has been rapid advances in technology, particularly the exponential growth of the [[Internet]] and a general shift from [[Analogue electronics|analog]] to [[digital technology]].{{r|twsNYT9989}} The Internet has been described as a \"great equalizer\" in the publishing world, since it enables an author to put their books out there and \"stand naked before the world.\"{{r|twsMiHer4949}} Costs for printing and distributing a book have fallen dramatically.{{r|twsNYT9989}}{{r|twsSFWA101}} Advances in [[E-reader|e-book readers]] and [[tablet computer]]s have improved readability; such devices allow readers to \"carry\" numerous books in a small portable device.{{r|twsNYT9989}} These technologies make it possible to have a book printed or digitally delivered after an order has been placed, so there are no costs for storing inventory. Print-On-Demand (or POD) technology, which became available in the mid-1990s,{{r|twsSFWA101}} can produce a high quality product equal to those produced by traditional publishers; in the past, one could easily identify a self-published title by its lack of quality.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Print-on-demand was easy, since an author could simply upload a manuscript, choose an interior file format and a cover, and the book could be printed as needed, avoiding warehousing costs, and reducing the risk of being stuck with a huge unsold inventory.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Further, the Internet provides access to global distribution channels via online retailers, so a self-published book can be instantly available to book buyers worldwide. A Canada-based firm named [[Wattpad]] offers streaming video productions based on the stories of self-published authors as of 2017.{{r|twsPW787}}\n\n[[File:Espresso Book Machine at Village Books - Flickr - brewbooks.jpg|thumb|right|An Espresso Book Machine at a bookstore.]]\nInternet transmission of digital books was combined with print-on-demand publishing with the invention of the [[Espresso Book Machine]] which was first demonstrated at the [[New York Public Library]] in 2007. This machine prints, collates, covers, and binds a single book. It is in libraries and bookstores throughout the world, and it can make copies of out-of-print editions. Small bookstores sometimes use it to compete with large bookstore chains. It works by taking two Internet-delivered [[Portable Document Format|pdf]] files, one for the text and one for the cover, and then prints an entire paperback book in a matter of minutes, which then drops down a chute.{{r|twsAP}}\n\nAmazon's introduction of the ''Kindle'' and its self-publishing platform, ''Kindle Direct Publishing'' or KDP, in 2007 has been described as a tipping point in self-publishing, which \"opened the floodgates\".{{r|twsFortune147}} It was an \"exclusively electronic self-publishing platform\" which was e-book only, free for authors to upload their books, and gave authors control over how their books were priced as well as access to the same distribution channels as major publishers.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n\n===Self-publishing today===\nIn recent times the publishing industry as a whole is in a great deal of flux, in a sort of \"Wild Wild West\" state.{{r|twsNYT9989}} The online retailing giant, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], has had a huge impact on the book-selling industry, driving many brick-and-mortar bookstores out of business and making inroads into publishing as well. Amazon has enticed readers away from bookstores and into an online environment, and its KDP and CreateSpace distribution channels have spawned a huge growth in self-publishing. As a result, the numbers of self-published authors are ever-increasing.{{r|twsUSAToday143}}\n\nThere is an anti-establishment aspect to self-publishing, in that it has been seen historically as a way to defy authority or resist oppression.{{R|twsBruno101}} The self-publishing movement can also be viewed as a part of the [[Do-it-yourself]] culture which \"flourishes in environments of communitarian support.\"{{R|twsBruno101}} A writer who is rejected by the usual system can find solace in self-publishing.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Some struggling authors complained that the traditional publishing model was too \"insular\", keeping out different ideas about stories as well as ones with unusual characters or plotlines, or which dealt with minorities, and self-publishing was a way for these formerly outcast writers to connect with readers.{{r|twsNYT43432}} Libraries have also become involved with self-publishing; the ''[[Library Journal]]'' and Biblioboard worked together to create a self-publishing platform called Self-e in which authors submit books online which are made available to readers. These books are reviewed by ''Library Journal'', and the best ones are published nationwide; authors do not make money this way but it serves as a marketing tool.{{r|twsBauer}}\n\nThe dramatic changes have impacted the standard publishing industry as well, which is controlling a smaller share of the overall publishing market, forcing many traditional publishers to consolidate to reduce costs. The squeeze has been applied to such authors, some of whom have complained that traditional publishers have often asked for the author to contribute part of the start-up expenses personally, in effect deviating from the usual model of the publisher providing all upfront expenses.{{R|twsTime101}}\n\nSelf-publishing is still a \"difficult and demanding way to go\" but is increasingly becoming a respectable, if alternative, choice for a writing career.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Self-publishers who are savvy, motivated and hard-working, can build audiences and make money.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n\n===Controversies and problem areas===\n[[File:Chart showing the traditional publishing process with filters screening out books.jpg|thumb|350px|A few decades ago, in order for a book to reach the public, it had to pass successfully through various filters or screens, such as agents and publishers and bookstores, and be approved.]]\n[[File:Self publishing allows an author to bypass the 'filter' of established agents and publishers.jpg|thumb|350px|Today authors can bypass established agents and publishers (the filters) and bring their creations directly to book buyers.]]\nIn the traditional publishing model, editors and publishers act as a filter or screen, weeding out possibly radical or badly written or substandard content. In contrast, self-publishing enables authors to bypass this filter and sell their books directly to the public. The wide-open uncensored nature of self-publishing has caused problems and controversies with pornographic or abuse-themed content. Amazon has a policy against selling content relating to rape and incest and bestiality which states \"We don't accept pornographic or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts\", but it is sometimes difficult for book distributors to distinguish what type of content is acceptable and what is not.{{r|twsCSM2342}} Some retailers have had to remove problematic content.{{r|twsCSM2342}} A survey found that self-published [[erotica]] was more extreme among self-published books than mainstream books. Erotica is about 1% of the mainstream market but 29% of the self-published market, according to one informal survey in 2013.{{r|twsLATimes42225}}\n\nThere have been some controversial self-published books, such as that of a man who posted a photo of his dead wife, whom he had murdered.{{r|twsLAT8332}} Celebrity [[Kim Kardashian]] self-published a 445-page book which consisted entirely of [[selfie]]s, a book described in ''[[Slate magazine]]'' as having \"no literary ambitions at all \u2013 it barely has words.\"{{r|twsSlate898}}\n\nWhile editors at a traditional publisher would often insist on fact-checking, and doing [[due diligence]] regarding claims made by an author, there are no requirements in the self-publishing model for this to happen. Self-publishing has attracted political provocateurs such as [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] who was able to publish his tome ''Dangerous'' on Amazon despite being dumped by traditional publisher [[Simon & Schuster]] as well as [[Breitbart]] after a video surfaced of him condoning [[pedophilia]].{{r|twsSlatemag1}}\n\nAs a check on self-published content, and as part of its overall strategy of empowering consumers by giving more information, Amazon permits reviews of its products, including books that it sells. However, it is possible for self-published authors to ''game'' the Amazon review system to make their books appear better than they are, perhaps by encouraging large numbers of five-star reviews by paying anonymous reviewers to write fake laudatory comments.{{r|twsQuartz101}} According to one view, the system is at serious risk of fraud and deception.{{r|twsQuartz101}} Amazon has responded by emphasizing reviews in which the book purchase is verified, and it has fought back by, in some cases, suing people and service firms who sell fake reviews.{{r|twsQuartz101}}\n\nA problem for some successful self-published authors is [[plagiarism]]. It is relatively easy for a manuscript to be copied and changed in superficial ways, but changed sufficiently so that it is hard for plagiarism-detecting software to catch the similarities between the real book and the plagiarized copy; then the copy can be uploaded online under a new title and different author name, which can earn royalties for the plagiarist.{{r|twsAtlanticPlag}} For example, author Rachel Ann Nunes, who wrote ''A Bid for Love'' in 1998, found that her manuscript had been plagiarized, with a nearly identical book entitled ''The Auction Deal''. Nunes hired a lawyer to track down the plagiarists.{{r|twsAtlanticPlag}} In the previous publisher-dominated system, a publisher would have been liable for selling a plagiarized book, but in the world of self-publishing, there are no liabilities involved if Amazon removes the plagiarized titles. It is often difficult to catch and prosecute the plagiarists, who can masquerade using false identities.{{r|twsAtlanticPlag}}\n\n===Future trends===\n{| style=\"float:right; width:18em; font-weight:bold; border:solid 1px #999999; font-size:.9em; line-height:1.3em; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-style=\"color:#800000; font-size:1.3em;\" valign=\"top\"\n|Predictions\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Most fiction sales will come from e-books\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Indie authors and smaller presses will be dominant\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Amazon titles will be the bestsellers\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Kindle Unlimited readership will keep growing\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Increased competition as market is flooded\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Audiobooks will become more popular\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Facebook ads will be less persuasive\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  International sales will spur profits\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Increasingly authors will work together\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|     Source: Chloe Smith 2017{{r|twsWWM111}}\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|}\nThe publishing industry, including self-publishing, is changing so rapidly that it is hard to make accurate predictions about where it is headed. It is likely that self-publishing will continue to grow, and that authors will demand more and more data about their readers as well as how well their books are selling.{{r|twsPW787|twsWSJ438337}} Self-publishing is growing in marketing sophistication and ambition, according to one view.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n\nRegarding the e-book market, there are predictions that independent authors will be grabbing an increasing slice of this market. Traditional publishers are losing ground in the e-book market, according to several sources. E-books published by traditional publishers declined by 11% from 2015 to 2016.{{r|twsNYT80009}} The drop in e-book sales was really more of a phenomenon in which established publishers were raising the prices of their e-books, and saw a relative decline in sales compared to their print offerings.{{r|twsFortune484733}} In contrast, sales of self-published e-books have been increasing.{{r|twsFortune484733}} An increasing number of e-books are being read on tablets as opposed to dedicated E-book readers.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} One forecast was that digital sales would continue to increase over time, and paper-based publishing would become a \"niche market\" like with newspapers and magazines.{{r|twsFortune484733}}\n\nA report in 2017 suggested that Amazon was working on a system to transform foreign language fiction into English with its [[AmazonCrossing]] service.{{r|twsDFP121}} Amazon accounted for 10% of all translated foreign fiction books, according to one report.{{r|twsDFP121}}\n\n==Main routes to self-publishing==\nThere are an increasing variety of resources for authors choosing the self-publishing route.{{R|twsNPR4432}}\n\n===Basic pathways to publishing===\nPublishing guru [[Jane Friedman]] breaks out the publishing routes for authors into basic categories:\n\n* '''Traditional publishing'''. Authors don't pay any publishing-related expenses.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} Large well-established publishing firms include the so-called 'Big Five': [[Penguin Random House]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]], [[Simon & Schuster]], and [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], including their dozens of imprints. These large publishers prefer authors with mainstream appeal, particularly celebrity or \"brand-name\" authors, and they bear most of the risk associated with publishing. They typically offer an advance payment, and sometimes authors can get a slice of the book profits. Publishers own the rights and control most aspects of publication, especially the design of the cover and the choice of a title.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} They can get books into brick-and-mortar bookstores and get reviews in mainstream media. Mid-size traditional publishers are smaller than the Big Five but often offer the same arrangements. Small and independent presses are harder to categorize but vary from well-established boutique presses to \"mom-and-pop\" [[startup company|start-ups]] with little experience. They accept more first-time authors and often don't require authors to hire agents in order to approach them. Authors may not receive advances but may get larger shares of the profits. It is harder for smaller presses to get books into bookstores.{{r|twsJFriedman787}}\n* '''Hybrid publishers'''. There are intermediate arrangements between traditional and self-publishing in which both author and publisher bear some of the costs of development, sometimes called \"cooperative publishing\".{{r|twsRMag1}} In some of these models, a hybrid publisher may offer selected services to help an author get a book published, such as story editing, [[copy editing]], proofreading, and marketing and public relations such as promotion through [[social media]] and [[search engine optimization]] strategies.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Many such firms have their own online bookstores.{{r|twsNYT9989}} It is important for authors considering a hybrid approach to fully understand what services will be included, and at what cost, and to fully understand the terms of any contract. Some intermediary firms offer less-than-ideal contracts, which make it hard for an author to get out of the deal at a later time, and can take a disproportionate share of profits; one adviser suggests it's \"buyer beware\" when hiring such firms.{{r|twsNYT9989}} With this model, the author funds the publication of the book, sometimes spending thousands of dollars, to get the know-how and editing skills of the publisher.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} Quality of services and the terms of contracts vary widely. Some professionals who used to work in the traditional publishing industry work in hybrid firms. As a general rule, royalties are less than true self-publishing but more than traditional publishing. Books rarely get into bookstores. Authors should try to keep as many rights with as much flexibility as possible. Some firms are nothing more than funky assisted-publishing services which are overcharging.{{r|twsJFriedman787}}\n* '''Assisted self-publishing'''. These firms charge fees for various publishing-related services such as formatting and cover design and copyediting, and make their money from these services alone, but authors earn all of the royalties and retain control over editing and cover design and title. Firms that offer help with publicity and marketing are generally not a good deal, and firms that have pushy sales tactics such as AuthorSolutions should be avoided.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} There are books, such as ''The Fine Print of Self-Publishing'' by Mark Levine, which can guide would-be authors.{{r|twsNYT9989}} For authors who are serious about making money through self-publishing, it is vital to have quality artwork, particularly on the cover, as well as interior formatting, and professionals doing publicity work, so hiring competent freelancers is critical.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n* '''True self-publishing.''' The author controls the entire publishing process from start to finish, and can hire freelancers to help with wherever the author requires, such as cover designers, copy editors, and story editors. It is necessary for the author to think like an entrepreneur and take charge of all variables, and as much as possible, get the finished book to look like a quality product. All profits and rights stay with the author but it is nearly impossible to get the book into bookstores unless it becomes a breakout bestseller, which is highly unlikely. Authors can sell their e-books through online platforms, and can distribute them through e-book distributors or print-on-demand firms.{{r|twsJFriedman787}}\n\n===Process of self-publishing: from concept to manuscript===\n{| style=\"float:right; width:18em; font-weight:bold; border:solid 1px #999999; font-size:.9em; line-height:1.3em; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-style=\"color:#800000; font-size:1.3em;\" valign=\"top\"\n| Steps to publication\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Idea and concept\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Writing\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Rewriting\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Story editing\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  More rewriting\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Copyediting\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Layout and typesetting\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Cover design\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Purchase an ISBN\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Select platform(s)\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Choose price\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Choose distribution channel(s)\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Upload\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Marketing and promotion\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|}\nThe author as a self-publisher also takes on many of the creative tasks to complete the finished works, which include creative writing as well as selecting the writing software, editing, marketing, and cover design. While self-publishing means that the author is in ''control'' of the entire process of production, from writing and editing, to layout to distribution, and to choosing publishing platforms and selecting marketing variables such as the price, many of these tasks can be outsourced to professionals. Professionals can be located through search engines, freelancing websites such as Reedsy,{{r|Reedsy43}} word of mouth, identifying and contacting creative assistants who have worked on already-published books, and searching relevant forums. Authors can spend up to $5000 for a variety of services to assist with publishing.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\nThere is strong agreement that self-published authors fare better if they are able to employ a skilled editor, preferably one with a financial interest in the success of the book, and who can bring a savvy understanding of the market as well as a strong sense of story development.{{r|twsUSAToday4435}} Self-published author James Altucher describes working with an editor:\n\n{{Quote|Nils and I went back and forth on more than 15 different rewrites for my book. The difference between the original version and the final version is like the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.|Self-published author James Altucher in 2013{{r|twsTechCrunch4221}}}}\n\nA liability for self-published authors is that if they can find a skilled editor, he or she is still being ''paid'' by the author for upfront editing work, and may not care whether the book is successful or not. A big advantage for working with a traditional publishing arrangement is having an editor and publisher who have a financial interest in making the book a bestseller.\n\nA self-published author is responsible for the technical aspects of self-publishing, which include formatting for printing and digital conversion.{{r|PBS11181}} Formatting can be complex and time-consuming but patient people can learn how to do it by themselves, but often hire this task out to experienced freelancers.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\nUnless a book is to be sold directly from the author to the public, an International Standard Book Number or [[ISBN]] is required to uniquely identify the title. ISBN is a global standard used for all titles worldwide.{{r|ISBN494}} Most self-publishing companies either provide their own ISBN to a title or can provide direction about how to get one.{{r|ISBN494}} A separate ISBN number is needed for each edition of the book.{{r|PBS2322}} It may be in the best interest of the self-published author to retain ownership of the ISBN and copyright instead of using a number owned by a vanity press.\n\nThe direction of the marketing and promotion effort is the responsibility of the author. Self-published authors can negotiate to have [[audiobook]]s made.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n\n===Publishing platforms===\nThe dominant self-publishing platform is Amazon which controls the vast share of the market, but there are numerous competitors and platforms in which authors can upload and sell their books.\n\n====Kindle Direct Publishing====\n[[File:Amazon Kindle 3.JPG|thumb|right|An Amazon Kindle.]]\n[[Kindle Direct Publishing]] or KDP is Amazon's e-book publishing unit which was launched when the company began selling its [[Amazon Kindle]] book reading device in 2007.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Books can be published in numerous languages.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}} Amazon's KDP has hundreds of thousands of self-published titles.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Amazon's KDP program uses ASIN identifiers instead of ISBNs to identify e-books.{{r|twsPW4342}} Amazon does not release sales figures of its authors.{{r|twsNPR2322}} Many authors prefer Amazon for its global clout and reach.{{R|twsNPR4432}} One analysis suggested that Amazon earned $2.3&nbsp;billion from e-book revenues in 2016, and 25% of these were from self-published e-books; and Amazon released 4&nbsp;million e-book titles in 2016, and 40% of them were self-published.{{r|twsFortune147}} Another estimate was that Amazon controls 70% of the e-book market.{{r|twsJFriedman88}}\n\nAmazon's ''Kindle Unlimited'' service lets readers read any books in its catalog, provided that the users pay a monthly fee. Amazon tracks which books are selected and read by subscribers. An author who wants to have their book included in this program enters into Amazon's ''KDP Select'' program, and as part of the agreement, the author promises to make their book exclusive to Amazon. The author can opt out of the KDP program every ninety days. An estimate in 2017 was that of Amazon's Kindle Unlimited market, about 60% of the books read and borrowed were self-published.{{r|twsJFriedman88}} Amazon initially began the program by paying authors whenever their book was chosen, but then it switched to an arrangement in which it pays authors based on pages read. Each month, Amazon establishes a fund from which to pay authors, based on Amazon's accounting of which pages are read. Amazon has been criticized for short-changing authors by paying them out of this monthly fund.{{r|twsQuartz101}} As a result of the program, many Amazon authors found that their income decreased substantially when the company switched to the pages-read basis.{{r|twsQuartz101}} The collective fund for KDP authors in August 2017 was $19.4&nbsp;million which was the \"largest ever\" of the monthly funds, but overall authors received the lowest amount, which was $0.00419 per page for that month.{{r|twsQuartz101|twsGuardian494933}} Some authors tried to compensate for less income by slightly altering and republishing their work, to try to increase the total of pages read.{{r|twsQuartz101}} The change to the pages-read model was criticized as being a \"huge pay cut\" for authors.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} None of the big 5 publishers contributed books to Kindle Unlimited as of 2017.{{r|twsChicTrib101}}\n\n====IngramSpark====\n\nIngramSpark lets authors publish digital and paperback editions of their books. It distributes books to most online bookstores. Brick-and-mortar stores can also order books from IngramSpark at wholesales prices for sale in their own venues. It is run by [[Ingram Content Group]].\n\n====Apple====\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] sells books via its [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] which is a digital distribution platform for its [[mobile app]]s on its [[iOS]] operating system. Apps can be downloaded to its devices such as the [[iPhone]], the [[iPod Touch]] handheld computer, and the [[iPad]]. Apple pays authors 70% of its proceeds at its Apple iBookstore where it sells [[iBooks]].{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\n====Smashwords====\n[[Smashwords]] is a California-based company founded by Mark Coker which allows authors and independent publishers to upload their manuscripts electronically to the Smashwords service, which then converts them into multiple e-book formats which can be read on various devices. Authors control what price is set.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}}\n\n====Barnes & Noble====\n[[Barnes & Noble]] pays 65% of the list price of e-books purchased through its online store called Pubit.{{r|twsNYT9989|twsMiamiHerald324}}\n\n====Kobo====\n[[Kobo Inc.|Kobo]] is a Canadian company which sells e-books, audiobooks, e-readers and tablet computers which originated as a cloud e-reading service.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\n====Scribd====\n[[Scribd]] is an open publishing platform which features a digital library, an e-book and audiobook subscription service.{{r|twsNYT9989}} It began as an online sharing site for books, and evolved into a store; books published there entitle an author to 80% of the sales price.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\n====Lulu====\n[[Lulu (company)|Lulu]] is an online print-on-demand, self-publishing and distribution platform.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}}\n\n===Print-on-Demand===\n{{Main|Print-on-demand}}\nPrint-on-demand (or POD) publishing refers to the ability to print high-quality books as needed. This is usually the most economical option for self-publishers who expect sales to be sporadic over time. An alternative is to hire a printing press to do a print run in which a large number of books are printed at one time, such as a hundred or a thousand copies, which can result in a slightly lower per-book printing cost, but risks holding onto unsold inventory for an extended period of time. Print-on-demand means that a book is printed only after it is purchased, lessening the risk, which eliminates the need for expensive warehouse space.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Many companies allow single books to be printed at per-book costs which are not much higher than those paid by publishing companies for large print runs.{{r|NYT123454|twsSFWA101}} Ingram is the largest book distributor, and it can help self-published authors get access to 39,000 bookstores, according to one report.{{r|twsFortune147}} The physical quality of print-on-demand self-published books is generally the same as that from an established publisher, although quality can in some instances vary.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n\n===E-books===\n[[File:Amazon Books at U Village, Seattle (22955160585).jpg|thumb|right|The online retailer [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] is transforming the publishing industry.]]\n{{Main|E-book}}\nGenerally self-publishing works best with e-books because, unlike print-on-demand self-publishing, it solves the twin problems of price and distribution.{{r|twsSFWA101}} There are a variety of e-book formats and tools that can be used to create them. Because it is possible to create e-books with no up-front or per-book costs, this is a popular option for self-publishers.{{r|PBS00998}} \n{{r|PBS00998|twsNPR4432}} When a person buys an E-book, the buyer does not ''own'' the book, but owns a license only to read the book.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} Formatting standards for e-books continue to evolve; at present, there have been compatibility problems with some digital e-book readers. For example, a recent [[EPUB]] 3.1 e-book format is not compatible with earlier e-book readers such as the Kindle.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} E-book formats include EPUB, MOBI and PDF, among others. In 2017, there was a report in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that e-books sales are continuing to increase.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} Epublishing distributors allow an author to sell on multiple platforms, often providing conversion and formatting services, usually charge no fees upfront, and make money by taking a small percentage of each book sold.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n\n===Vanity press===\n{{Main|Vanity press}}\nUsers pay to have their books published. While a commercial publisher's market is the book-buying public at large, the vanity publisher's market is the author himself or herself. Some authors buy substantial copies of their own book which are then used as giveaways or promotional tools. The term ''vanity press'' is considered pejorative since it suggests that a person who hires such a service is unqualified or unable to have their book succeed in the market, and that the author is printing the book only out of [[vanity]]. In this business model, there can be elements of fraud, such that some vanity presses masquerade as legitimate publishers, and pretend to be selective and choosy in their book selections, and prey upon a would-be author's desire to be published. If a vanity press charges a higher amount to print a run of books than a regular [[Printer (publishing)|printer]], it can be an indication of deception and fraud.\n\n====Kindle Direct Publishing====\n[[CreateSpace]] was Amazon's print-on-demand book publishing service. Authors could sign up for an account, and the online software guided an author through the steps of publication, such as uploading a cover, selecting distribution channels and setting prices.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Books uploaded to CreateSpace became part of Amazon's online catalog and were made available to book buyers around the world. Amazon collected revenues from book sales on behalf of authors, and then deposited royalty monies directly into an author's account, usually after a few months or so after the sale.{{R|twsNPR4432}} CreateSpace offered additional services to help authors, such as cover design and copyediting ($120+) as well as converting the manuscript file to a Kindle-compatible e-book file ($70).{{r|twsNYT9989}} CreateSpace offered authors free book identifying numbers or ISBNs without extra charge, or authors could buy their own ISBN numbers. In August 2018 CreateSpace was absorbed into Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP).\n\n====Smashwords====\n[[Smashwords]] publishes and distributes e-books.{{r|twsNPR4432}} Smashwords authors keep 60% of the sale price, and Smashwords keeps 10%, and the retailer keeps 30%; if a sale is made directly through Smashwords, the author keeps 85% of the sales price.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Smashwords provides a list of freelance assistance services.{{r|twsNYT9989}} In 2017, it distributed 250,000 titles for 60,000 authors to most of the world's e-book stores in exchange for a cut of the author's profits.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Smashwords books can go on sale a few minutes after they're uploaded.{{r|twsChicTrib101}}\n\n{{Quote|I believe every writer is great and wonderful and has something to share with the world. Readers will decide if what they're sharing is worth reading.|Mark Coker of Smashwords, 2013 {{r|twsNPR899}}}}\n\n====Lulu====\n[[Lulu (company)|Lulu]] publishes print and e-books and offers publishing-related services such as website design, cover design, editing packages, and strategies for social media promotions.{{r|twsNPR4432}} It was founded in 2002.{{r|twsNPR4432}} Lulu charges nothing upfront, and each time a book is sold, it keeps 20% of the profit and pays 80% to the author.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Lulu offers additional services such as editing ($450) and cover design ($130) and other services such as design and formatting which can cost from $700 to $5000.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Lulu enables authors to print books not only in paperback form, but in hardcover and comic book forms as well.\n\n====Author Solutions====\nAuthor Solutions sells services such as editing, e-book production and marketing services. According to one report, it served 170,000 authors who wrote 200,000 titles as of 2017.{{r|twsUSAToday143|DigitalBookWorld}} [[Penguin Random House]], a mainstream publisher, once bought, then sold, Author Solutions.{{r|twsWSJ456}}\n\n====FastPencil====\nFastPencil sells editing services, as well as consulting services related to publishing and distribution, for a fee.{{r|twsUSAToday143}}\n\n====Reedsy====\nReedsy is a [[United Kingdom|British]] online author services firm which connects authors and freelance professionals.{{r|twsPW1x|twsTechCrunch4x|twsGuardian1x}} It has a network of vetted editors, cover designers, illustrators and book marketers and takes a 10% cut of each contract between author and freelancer.{{r|twsFortune147}} In addition, it offers online software tools to help authors convert files for publication in print and in [[e-book]] form, and offers training courses by email to help authors navigate the self-publishing process.{{r|twsFortune148}} The firm checks the credentials of publishing freelancers such as story editors, cover designers, marketers and others, by verifying their previous work experience for mainstream publishers as well as their overall track record in the publishing industry.{{r|twsTechCrunch2x}} Reedsy checks the credentials of writing contests as well to help writers avoid wasting time with fake contests and prizes.{{r|twsReedsy148}} In addition, it offers online software tools to help authors convert their manuscript files to files suitable for publishing [[e-book]]s, such as [[EPUB]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] formats,{{r|twsTechCrunch2x}} as well as learning programs to help authors navigate the self-publishing process.{{r|twsForbes2x}} In 2016, the Reedsy community included 20,000 authors and 500 freelancers, and had helped them publish 3,000 books.{{r|twsForbes1x}} Reedsy began in 2014 after being funded by [[Seedcamp]],{{r|twsTechCrunch1x}} founded by Emmanuel Nataf, Richard Fayet, Matthew Cobb and Vincent Durand.{{r|twsTechCrunch1x}} While the start-up firm is headquartered in [[London]],{{r|twsTechCrunch1x}} it is a \"completely officeless business\" such that its staff is physically distributed in different locations, and conducts business via [[cloud computing]].{{r|twsTelegraph1x}}\n\n====Matador====\nMatador is the self-publishing imprint of Troubador Publishing Ltd, a traditional publishing company based in [[Leicester, United Kingdom]].<ref name=twsGuardian0032>Louise Walters, 22 February 2016, The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/22/i-didnt-want-to-resort-to-self-publishing-but-its-an-exhilarating-change I didn't want to resort to self-publishing, but it's an exhilarating change], Retrieved 26 May 2018</ref> In the last 19 years Matador has published over 5000 titles in book and ebook formats, approximately 500 titles a year.

Since 2000, there has been an increase in the sales of digital titles, audiobooks, self-published paperbacks,{{r|twsBB484829}} including printed as well as e-books. The overall market for all books, including from traditional publishers, is growing as well.\n* '''Explosive growth of new titles.''' The growth in new titles has been strong, particularly in the past decade. In 2002, there were a quarter&nbsp;million new titles, but since 2009, the number of new titles has topped 1.3&nbsp;million each year.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} In 2010, according to a different analysis, there were 4.2&nbsp;million new titles published.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} Much of the growth in new titles has been because of self-publishing. In 2011, self-published books made up 43% of all print titles, helping to increase overall growth of print production, according to Bowker market research.{{r|twsCSM48482}} In the middle of the second decade, the growth of print titles seemed to ebb somewhat, perhaps eclipsed by the growth of e-book titles.

Of profits paid to authors by Smashwords, the best-selling 1% of titles earn half of all sales money.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Some authors earn modest profits from their work.

Self-publishing is an increasingly likely choice for authors who are \"midcareer, midlist, middle-aged, more or less middlebrow, and somewhat Internet savvy,\" writes journalist Neal Pollack, who extols the promise of being able to reach readers directly.{{r|twsNYT4221}} Elizabeth Prybylski, publisher of Insomnia, an indie press, describes the main difference between self-publishing and traditional publishing is \"who puts up the overhead of production.\"\n\n{{Quote|If the author doesn't have the money, time, or inclination to do all of those things for their book and to pay the costs of production, a publisher's experience and knowledge can make up for that gap.|Elizabeth Prybylski of Insomnia Press.}}\n\nAnalyses have been made suggesting that self-published authors' earnings have been comparing favorably to earnings from established publishers,{{r|twsNPR2322}} and this may be a factor causing established authors to switch to the self-publishing approach. While a self-published author can typically keep 70% of the sales price, a typical contract with a publisher will be payment of an advance sum such as $5000 to $10,000, plus receiving 25% of digital sales and 7% to 12% of the list price for bound books, which the author will receive after the publisher recoups the money paid for the advance to the author.{{r|twsNYT16161}}\n\nAuthors being published the traditional way have seen their income from publishing decline in recent years. A survey from the Authors Guild found that authors with contracts with established publishers were making 30% less money in 2015 than they had been making in 2009.{{r|twsNPR1123}}  Talented writers in traditional publishing, who have won prizes and awards, are earning less, with some living at or near the poverty line.{{r|twsNPR1123}} Some books sell only 5,000 to 20,000 copies, some less than that.{{r|twsNPR1123}} Factors identified as dampening the income levels of such authors include the online piracy of digital material, major publishing houses consolidating to focus more on profits, and the rise of Amazon and self-publishing.{{r|twsNPR1123}}\n\n[[File:David Jones Fashion Ambassador Miranda Kerr in store book signing in Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|Some writers have criticized mainstream publishers for emphasizing celebrity rather than quality writing.

An author finds out right away whether a book is a hit with readers; there is not a six-month or longer delay typical with an established publisher since the usual back-and-forth steps with a publisher are bypassed.

Big bookstores rarely take self-published books, and if they do, they want 50% of the sales price.{{r|twsMiHer4949}} Publishers have established distribution channels to make this easy.\n* '''Publishers offer editorial and marketing help.''' Plus they usually pay an advance to help the author with expenses at the early start of the publishing cycle, an advantage which self-published writers do not have.{{r|twsMiHer4949}}\n\n{{Quote|You risk looking like an amateur ... Good writers need even better editors. They need brilliant cover designers. They need imaginative marketers and well-connected publicists. All these things are provided by a traditional publisher, and what's more, it doesn't cost you a penny. They pay you!

One self-published author in Britain was working \"14-hour days\", spending months promoting her book ''Only the Innocent''; while she eventually made it to the UK Kindle bestseller chart, Rachel Abbott still has difficulty getting the publishing world to take her book seriously.{{r|twsGuardian4948}} Another writer, Ros Barber, thinks self-publishing is a \"terrible idea for serious novelists\" since the requirements of marketing and promoting a book will prevent one from writing, and he continues to recommend the traditional approach.{{r|twsGuardian8426}}\n\n{{Quote|You have to forget writing for a living ...

The term usually refers to written media, such as [[book]]s and [[magazine]]s, either as an [[E-book|ebook]] or as a physical copy using [[Print on demand|POD (print on demand)]] technology. It may also apply to [[album]]s, pamphlets, brochures, video content, and [[zine]]s.\n\nIn the traditional publishing model, in which the publisher bears all the costs and risks of publication, but retains most of the profit if the book is successful.  In self-publishing, the author bears all the costs and risks, but earns a higher share of the profit per sale.\n\nThe $1&nbsp;billion market of self-publishing has transformed in the past two decades with new technologies providing increasing alternatives to traditional publishing.{{r|twsFortune147}} Self-publishing is increasingly becoming the first choice for writers.{{r|twsNPR899}} Most self-published books sell very few copies,{{r|twsWP57575}}   Those which sell large numbers are newsworthy because they are so rare. The quality of self-published works varies considerably, because there are no barriers to publication and no quality control.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\n==History==\n===Early examples===\n[[File:George Cruikshank - Tristram Shandy, Plate VIII. The Smoking Batteries.jpg|thumb|right|The original ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' was self-published by British author Laurence Sterne. Photo: an illustration from the original work by artist [[George Cruikshank]].]]\nSelf-publishing is not a new phenomenon. While most novels were distributed by established publishers, there have been authors who chose to self-publish, or even start their own presses, such as [[John Locke]]{{r|twsCSM2342}}, [[Jane Austen]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Walt Whitman]].{{r|patterson}}  In 1759, British satirist [[Laurence Sterne]]'s self-published the first two volumes of ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''.{{r|patterson}}   In 1908, [[Ezra Pound]] sold ''[[A Lume Spento]]'' for six pence each.{{r|patterson}} [[Franklin Hiram King]]'s book ''Farmers of Forty Centuries'' was self-published in 1911, and was subsequently published commercially. In 1931 the author of ''[[The Joy of Cooking]]'' paid a local printing company to print 3000 copies; the Bobbs-Merrill Company acquired the rights, and since then the book has sold over 18&nbsp;million copies.{{r|huffpost_books}} In 1941, writer [[Virginia Woolf]] chose to self-publish her final novel ''[[Between the Acts]]'' on her [[Hogarth Press]], in effect starting her own press.{{r|patterson}}\n\n===Negative stigma===\n{{Quote|Five years ago, self-publishing was a scar. Now it's a tattoo.|Greg White, in ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', 2016{{r|twsBloomberg433}}}}\nUntil the advent of [[E-book|ebooks]] and [[Print on demand|POD technology]], most self-published books were published through a [[vanity press]],{{R|twsNPR4432}} so called because such authors were assumed to be egotistical writers, unable to accept their work was not good enough to be accepted by traditional publishers.{{R|twsNPR4432}}    [[James D. Macdonald]] claimed that vanity publishing violated ''Yog's Law'' which states that \"Money should flow toward the author.\"{{r|twsYogsLaw}} Vanity publishing usually required a one-time payment of $5,000 to $10,000 to do a print run of 1000 books; these books usually ended up in boxes in a garage.{{r|twsNYT9989}}   \n\n[[File:Digital Printing Press.JPG|thumb|right|This modern printing press takes digital files and prints books.]]\nPhotographer-turned-publisher Max Bondi said that \"investing in a project shows that you believe in it\".{{R|twsTime101}} Nevertheless, part of the reason for the negative stigma is that many self-published books are of dubious quality, because they are written by authors who are still learning their craft, and have never been edited or even proof-read. For example, in 1995, a retired TV repairman self-published his autobiography in which he described how he had been stepped on by a horse when he was a boy, how he had been almost murdered by his stepfather when he was a young man in Mexico, and how his ex-wife had clawed his face with her fingernails. The repairman spent $10,000 to have his 150-page masterpiece printed up, and, for promotion purposes, he sent copies to a local library, to the White House, and to everybody with the repairman's same last name. These efforts did not lead anywhere; today, the book is largely forgotten.{{r|twsNYT4221}}\n\nSelf-publishing is still seen as a \"mark of failure\" by many.{{r|twsNPR2322}}  The image of self-publishing has been improving and some feel the stigma is gone entirely,{{r|twsMiHer4949}} while others feel it still has a way to go to cultivate respectability.{{r|twsWashPost0909}} Book critic Ron Charles in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' complained that \"No, I don't want to read your self-published book\", citing concerns that self-published books lacked quality and were published by authors with little understanding of the audience or the market.{{r|twsWashPost0909}} However rare breakaway bestsellers such as ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' {{r|huffpost_books}} and  ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'' were first self-published, helping to lend respectability to self-publishing in general.{{r|Martian22}} Further, with new avenues of self-publishing, there are more opportunities for authors to break through directly to audiences.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n\n{{Quote|For decades, the literary world dismissed self-published authors as amateurs and hacks who lacked the talent to land a book deal. But that attitude gradually began to change with the rise of e-books and the arrival of Kindle from Amazon, which gave authors direct access to millions of readers.|Alexandra Alter in the ''[[New York Times]]'', 2016{{r|twsNYT80009}}}}\n\n===Technological changes===\n[[File:Traditional publishing route before self publishing.jpg|thumb|350px|In previous decades, publishing meant going through agents and publishers.]]\n[[File:Chart showing how self publishing allows authors to bypass publishers and sell directly to the public.jpg|thumb|350px|Today, self publishing permits authors to bypass publishers and bookstores and sell directly to the public.]]\nA huge impetus to self-publishing has been rapid advances in technology, particularly the exponential growth of the [[Internet]] and a general shift from [[Analogue electronics|analog]] to [[digital technology]].{{r|twsNYT9989}} The Internet has been described as a \"great equalizer\" in the publishing world, since it enables an author to put their books out there and \"stand naked before the world.\"{{r|twsMiHer4949}} Costs for printing and distributing a book have fallen dramatically.{{r|twsNYT9989}}{{r|twsSFWA101}} Advances in [[E-reader|e-book readers]] and [[tablet computer]]s have improved readability; such devices allow readers to \"carry\" numerous books in a small portable device.{{r|twsNYT9989}} These technologies make it possible to have a book printed or digitally delivered after an order has been placed, so there are no costs for storing inventory. Print-On-Demand (or POD) technology, which became available in the mid-1990s,{{r|twsSFWA101}} can produce a high quality product equal to those produced by traditional publishers; in the past, one could easily identify a self-published title by its lack of quality.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Print-on-demand was easy, since an author could simply upload a manuscript, choose an interior file format and a cover, and the book could be printed as needed, avoiding warehousing costs, and reducing the risk of being stuck with a huge unsold inventory.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Further, the Internet provides access to global distribution channels via online retailers, so a self-published book can be instantly available to book buyers worldwide. A Canada-based firm named [[Wattpad]] offers streaming video productions based on the stories of self-published authors as of 2017.{{r|twsPW787}}\n\n[[File:Espresso Book Machine at Village Books - Flickr - brewbooks.jpg|thumb|right|An Espresso Book Machine at a bookstore.]]\nInternet transmission of digital books was combined with print-on-demand publishing with the invention of the [[Espresso Book Machine]] which was first demonstrated at the [[New York Public Library]] in 2007. This machine prints, collates, covers, and binds a single book. It is in libraries and bookstores throughout the world, and it can make copies of out-of-print editions. Small bookstores sometimes use it to compete with large bookstore chains. It works by taking two Internet-delivered [[Portable Document Format|pdf]] files, one for the text and one for the cover, and then prints an entire paperback book in a matter of minutes, which then drops down a chute.{{r|twsAP}}\n\nAmazon's introduction of the ''Kindle'' and its self-publishing platform, ''Kindle Direct Publishing'' or KDP, in 2007 has been described as a tipping point in self-publishing, which \"opened the floodgates\".{{r|twsFortune147}} It was an \"exclusively electronic self-publishing platform\" which was e-book only, free for authors to upload their books, and gave authors control over how their books were priced as well as access to the same distribution channels as major publishers.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n\n===Self-publishing today===\nIn recent times the publishing industry as a whole is in a great deal of flux, in a sort of \"Wild Wild West\" state.{{r|twsNYT9989}} The online retailing giant, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], has had a huge impact on the book-selling industry, driving many brick-and-mortar bookstores out of business and making inroads into publishing as well. Amazon has enticed readers away from bookstores and into an online environment, and its KDP and CreateSpace distribution channels have spawned a huge growth in self-publishing. As a result, the numbers of self-published authors are ever-increasing.{{r|twsUSAToday143}}\n\nThere is an anti-establishment aspect to self-publishing, in that it has been seen historically as a way to defy authority or resist oppression.{{R|twsBruno101}} The self-publishing movement can also be viewed as a part of the [[Do-it-yourself]] culture which \"flourishes in environments of communitarian support.\"{{R|twsBruno101}} A writer who is rejected by the usual system can find solace in self-publishing.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Some struggling authors complained that the traditional publishing model was too \"insular\", keeping out different ideas about stories as well as ones with unusual characters or plotlines, or which dealt with minorities, and self-publishing was a way for these formerly outcast writers to connect with readers.{{r|twsNYT43432}} Libraries have also become involved with self-publishing; the ''[[Library Journal]]'' and Biblioboard worked together to create a self-publishing platform called Self-e in which authors submit books online which are made available to readers. These books are reviewed by ''Library Journal'', and the best ones are published nationwide; authors do not make money this way but it serves as a marketing tool.{{r|twsBauer}}\n\nThe dramatic changes have impacted the standard publishing industry as well, which is controlling a smaller share of the overall publishing market, forcing many traditional publishers to consolidate to reduce costs. The squeeze has been applied to such authors, some of whom have complained that traditional publishers have often asked for the author to contribute part of the start-up expenses personally, in effect deviating from the usual model of the publisher providing all upfront expenses.{{R|twsTime101}}\n\nSelf-publishing is still a \"difficult and demanding way to go\" but is increasingly becoming a respectable, if alternative, choice for a writing career.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Self-publishers who are savvy, motivated and hard-working, can build audiences and make money.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n\n===Controversies and problem areas===\n[[File:Chart showing the traditional publishing process with filters screening out books.jpg|thumb|350px|A few decades ago, in order for a book to reach the public, it had to pass successfully through various filters or screens, such as agents and publishers and bookstores, and be approved.]]\n[[File:Self publishing allows an author to bypass the 'filter' of established agents and publishers.jpg|thumb|350px|Today authors can bypass established agents and publishers (the filters) and bring their creations directly to book buyers.]]\nIn the traditional publishing model, editors and publishers act as a filter or screen, weeding out possibly radical or badly written or substandard content. In contrast, self-publishing enables authors to bypass this filter and sell their books directly to the public. The wide-open uncensored nature of self-publishing has caused problems and controversies with pornographic or abuse-themed content. Amazon has a policy against selling content relating to rape and incest and bestiality which states \"We don't accept pornographic or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts\", but it is sometimes difficult for book distributors to distinguish what type of content is acceptable and what is not.{{r|twsCSM2342}} Some retailers have had to remove problematic content.{{r|twsCSM2342}} A survey found that self-published [[erotica]] was more extreme among self-published books than mainstream books. Erotica is about 1% of the mainstream market but 29% of the self-published market, according to one informal survey in 2013.{{r|twsLATimes42225}}\n\nThere have been some controversial self-published books, such as that of a man who posted a photo of his dead wife, whom he had murdered.{{r|twsLAT8332}} Celebrity [[Kim Kardashian]] self-published a 445-page book which consisted entirely of [[selfie]]s, a book described in ''[[Slate magazine]]'' as having \"no literary ambitions at all \u2013 it barely has words.\"{{r|twsSlate898}}\n\nWhile editors at a traditional publisher would often insist on fact-checking, and doing [[due diligence]] regarding claims made by an author, there are no requirements in the self-publishing model for this to happen. Self-publishing has attracted political provocateurs such as [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] who was able to publish his tome ''Dangerous'' on Amazon despite being dumped by traditional publisher [[Simon & Schuster]] as well as [[Breitbart]] after a video surfaced of him condoning [[pedophilia]].{{r|twsSlatemag1}}\n\nAs a check on self-published content, and as part of its overall strategy of empowering consumers by giving more information, Amazon permits reviews of its products, including books that it sells. However, it is possible for self-published authors to ''game'' the Amazon review system to make their books appear better than they are, perhaps by encouraging large numbers of five-star reviews by paying anonymous reviewers to write fake laudatory comments.{{r|twsQuartz101}} According to one view, the system is at serious risk of fraud and deception.{{r|twsQuartz101}} Amazon has responded by emphasizing reviews in which the book purchase is verified, and it has fought back by, in some cases, suing people and service firms who sell fake reviews.{{r|twsQuartz101}}\n\nA problem for some successful self-published authors is [[plagiarism]]. It is relatively easy for a manuscript to be copied and changed in superficial ways, but changed sufficiently so that it is hard for plagiarism-detecting software to catch the similarities between the real book and the plagiarized copy; then the copy can be uploaded online under a new title and different author name, which can earn royalties for the plagiarist.{{r|twsAtlanticPlag}} For example, author Rachel Ann Nunes, who wrote ''A Bid for Love'' in 1998, found that her manuscript had been plagiarized, with a nearly identical book entitled ''The Auction Deal''. Nunes hired a lawyer to track down the plagiarists.{{r|twsAtlanticPlag}} In the previous publisher-dominated system, a publisher would have been liable for selling a plagiarized book, but in the world of self-publishing, there are no liabilities involved if Amazon removes the plagiarized titles. It is often difficult to catch and prosecute the plagiarists, who can masquerade using false identities.{{r|twsAtlanticPlag}}\n\n===Future trends===\n{| style=\"float:right; width:18em; font-weight:bold; border:solid 1px #999999; font-size:.9em; line-height:1.3em; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-style=\"color:#800000; font-size:1.3em;\" valign=\"top\"\n|Predictions\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Most fiction sales will come from e-books\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Indie authors and smaller presses will be dominant\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Amazon titles will be the bestsellers\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Kindle Unlimited readership will keep growing\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Increased competition as market is flooded\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Audiobooks will become more popular\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Facebook ads will be less persuasive\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  International sales will spur profits\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Increasingly authors will work together\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|     Source: Chloe Smith 2017{{r|twsWWM111}}\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|}\nThe publishing industry, including self-publishing, is changing so rapidly that it is hard to make accurate predictions about where it is headed. It is likely that self-publishing will continue to grow, and that authors will demand more and more data about their readers as well as how well their books are selling.{{r|twsPW787|twsWSJ438337}} Self-publishing is growing in marketing sophistication and ambition, according to one view.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n\nRegarding the e-book market, there are predictions that independent authors will be grabbing an increasing slice of this market. Traditional publishers are losing ground in the e-book market, according to several sources. E-books published by traditional publishers declined by 11% from 2015 to 2016.{{r|twsNYT80009}} The drop in e-book sales was really more of a phenomenon in which established publishers were raising the prices of their e-books, and saw a relative decline in sales compared to their print offerings.{{r|twsFortune484733}} In contrast, sales of self-published e-books have been increasing.{{r|twsFortune484733}} An increasing number of e-books are being read on tablets as opposed to dedicated E-book readers.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} One forecast was that digital sales would continue to increase over time, and paper-based publishing would become a \"niche market\" like with newspapers and magazines.{{r|twsFortune484733}}\n\nA report in 2017 suggested that Amazon was working on a system to transform foreign language fiction into English with its [[AmazonCrossing]] service.{{r|twsDFP121}} Amazon accounted for 10% of all translated foreign fiction books, according to one report.{{r|twsDFP121}}\n\n==Main routes to self-publishing==\nThere are an increasing variety of resources for authors choosing the self-publishing route.{{R|twsNPR4432}}\n\n===Basic pathways to publishing===\nPublishing guru [[Jane Friedman]] breaks out the publishing routes for authors into basic categories:\n\n* '''Traditional publishing'''. Authors don't pay any publishing-related expenses.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} Large well-established publishing firms include the so-called 'Big Five': [[Penguin Random House]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]], [[Simon & Schuster]], and [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], including their dozens of imprints. These large publishers prefer authors with mainstream appeal, particularly celebrity or \"brand-name\" authors, and they bear most of the risk associated with publishing. They typically offer an advance payment, and sometimes authors can get a slice of the book profits. Publishers own the rights and control most aspects of publication, especially the design of the cover and the choice of a title.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} They can get books into brick-and-mortar bookstores and get reviews in mainstream media. Mid-size traditional publishers are smaller than the Big Five but often offer the same arrangements. Small and independent presses are harder to categorize but vary from well-established boutique presses to \"mom-and-pop\" [[startup company|start-ups]] with little experience. They accept more first-time authors and often don't require authors to hire agents in order to approach them. Authors may not receive advances but may get larger shares of the profits. It is harder for smaller presses to get books into bookstores.{{r|twsJFriedman787}}\n* '''Hybrid publishers'''. There are intermediate arrangements between traditional and self-publishing in which both author and publisher bear some of the costs of development, sometimes called \"cooperative publishing\".{{r|twsRMag1}} In some of these models, a hybrid publisher may offer selected services to help an author get a book published, such as story editing, [[copy editing]], proofreading, and marketing and public relations such as promotion through [[social media]] and [[search engine optimization]] strategies.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Many such firms have their own online bookstores.{{r|twsNYT9989}} It is important for authors considering a hybrid approach to fully understand what services will be included, and at what cost, and to fully understand the terms of any contract. Some intermediary firms offer less-than-ideal contracts, which make it hard for an author to get out of the deal at a later time, and can take a disproportionate share of profits; one adviser suggests it's \"buyer beware\" when hiring such firms.{{r|twsNYT9989}} With this model, the author funds the publication of the book, sometimes spending thousands of dollars, to get the know-how and editing skills of the publisher.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} Quality of services and the terms of contracts vary widely. Some professionals who used to work in the traditional publishing industry work in hybrid firms. As a general rule, royalties are less than true self-publishing but more than traditional publishing. Books rarely get into bookstores. Authors should try to keep as many rights with as much flexibility as possible. Some firms are nothing more than funky assisted-publishing services which are overcharging.{{r|twsJFriedman787}}\n* '''Assisted self-publishing'''. These firms charge fees for various publishing-related services such as formatting and cover design and copyediting, and make their money from these services alone, but authors earn all of the royalties and retain control over editing and cover design and title. Firms that offer help with publicity and marketing are generally not a good deal, and firms that have pushy sales tactics such as AuthorSolutions should be avoided.{{r|twsJFriedman787}} There are books, such as ''The Fine Print of Self-Publishing'' by Mark Levine, which can guide would-be authors.{{r|twsNYT9989}} For authors who are serious about making money through self-publishing, it is vital to have quality artwork, particularly on the cover, as well as interior formatting, and professionals doing publicity work, so hiring competent freelancers is critical.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n* '''True self-publishing.''' The author controls the entire publishing process from start to finish, and can hire freelancers to help with wherever the author requires, such as cover designers, copy editors, and story editors. It is necessary for the author to think like an entrepreneur and take charge of all variables, and as much as possible, get the finished book to look like a quality product. All profits and rights stay with the author but it is nearly impossible to get the book into bookstores unless it becomes a breakout bestseller, which is highly unlikely. Authors can sell their e-books through online platforms, and can distribute them through e-book distributors or print-on-demand firms.{{r|twsJFriedman787}}\n\n===Process of self-publishing: from concept to manuscript===\n{| style=\"float:right; width:18em; font-weight:bold; border:solid 1px #999999; font-size:.9em; line-height:1.3em; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-style=\"color:#800000; font-size:1.3em;\" valign=\"top\"\n| Steps to publication\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Idea and concept\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Writing\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Rewriting\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Story editing\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  More rewriting\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Copyediting\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Layout and typesetting\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Cover design\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Purchase an ISBN\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Select platform(s)\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Choose price\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Choose distribution channel(s)\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Upload\n|-style=\"color:#2A6B35;\" valign=\"top\"\n|  Marketing and promotion\n|-style=\"color:#10365B;\" valign=\"top\"\n|}\nThe author as a self-publisher also takes on many of the creative tasks to complete the finished works, which include creative writing as well as selecting the writing software, editing, marketing, and cover design. While self-publishing means that the author is in ''control'' of the entire process of production, from writing and editing, to layout to distribution, and to choosing publishing platforms and selecting marketing variables such as the price, many of these tasks can be outsourced to professionals. Professionals can be located through search engines, freelancing websites such as Reedsy,{{r|Reedsy43}} word of mouth, identifying and contacting creative assistants who have worked on already-published books, and searching relevant forums. Authors can spend up to $5000 for a variety of services to assist with publishing.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\nThere is strong agreement that self-published authors fare better if they are able to employ a skilled editor, preferably one with a financial interest in the success of the book, and who can bring a savvy understanding of the market as well as a strong sense of story development.{{r|twsUSAToday4435}} Self-published author James Altucher describes working with an editor:\n\n{{Quote|Nils and I went back and forth on more than 15 different rewrites for my book. The difference between the original version and the final version is like the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.|Self-published author James Altucher in 2013{{r|twsTechCrunch4221}}}}\n\nA liability for self-published authors is that if they can find a skilled editor, he or she is still being ''paid'' by the author for upfront editing work, and may not care whether the book is successful or not. A big advantage for working with a traditional publishing arrangement is having an editor and publisher who have a financial interest in making the book a bestseller.\n\nA self-published author is responsible for the technical aspects of self-publishing, which include formatting for printing and digital conversion.{{r|PBS11181}} Formatting can be complex and time-consuming but patient people can learn how to do it by themselves, but often hire this task out to experienced freelancers.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\nUnless a book is to be sold directly from the author to the public, an International Standard Book Number or [[ISBN]] is required to uniquely identify the title. ISBN is a global standard used for all titles worldwide.{{r|ISBN494}} Most self-publishing companies either provide their own ISBN to a title or can provide direction about how to get one.{{r|ISBN494}} A separate ISBN number is needed for each edition of the book.{{r|PBS2322}} It may be in the best interest of the self-published author to retain ownership of the ISBN and copyright instead of using a number owned by a vanity press.\n\nThe direction of the marketing and promotion effort is the responsibility of the author. Self-published authors can negotiate to have [[audiobook]]s made.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n\n===Publishing platforms===\nThe dominant self-publishing platform is Amazon which controls the vast share of the market, but there are numerous competitors and platforms in which authors can upload and sell their books.\n\n====Kindle Direct Publishing====\n[[File:Amazon Kindle 3.JPG|thumb|right|An Amazon Kindle.]]\n[[Kindle Direct Publishing]] or KDP is Amazon's e-book publishing unit which was launched when the company began selling its [[Amazon Kindle]] book reading device in 2007.{{r|twsSFWA101}} Books can be published in numerous languages.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}} Amazon's KDP has hundreds of thousands of self-published titles.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Amazon's KDP program uses ASIN identifiers instead of ISBNs to identify e-books.{{r|twsPW4342}} Amazon does not release sales figures of its authors.{{r|twsNPR2322}} Many authors prefer Amazon for its global clout and reach.{{R|twsNPR4432}} One analysis suggested that Amazon earned $2.3&nbsp;billion from e-book revenues in 2016, and 25% of these were from self-published e-books; and Amazon released 4&nbsp;million e-book titles in 2016, and 40% of them were self-published.{{r|twsFortune147}} Another estimate was that Amazon controls 70% of the e-book market.{{r|twsJFriedman88}}\n\nAmazon's ''Kindle Unlimited'' service lets readers read any books in its catalog, provided that the users pay a monthly fee. Amazon tracks which books are selected and read by subscribers. An author who wants to have their book included in this program enters into Amazon's ''KDP Select'' program, and as part of the agreement, the author promises to make their book exclusive to Amazon. The author can opt out of the KDP program every ninety days. An estimate in 2017 was that of Amazon's Kindle Unlimited market, about 60% of the books read and borrowed were self-published.{{r|twsJFriedman88}} Amazon initially began the program by paying authors whenever their book was chosen, but then it switched to an arrangement in which it pays authors based on pages read. Each month, Amazon establishes a fund from which to pay authors, based on Amazon's accounting of which pages are read. Amazon has been criticized for short-changing authors by paying them out of this monthly fund.{{r|twsQuartz101}} As a result of the program, many Amazon authors found that their income decreased substantially when the company switched to the pages-read basis.{{r|twsQuartz101}} The collective fund for KDP authors in August 2017 was $19.4&nbsp;million which was the \"largest ever\" of the monthly funds, but overall authors received the lowest amount, which was $0.00419 per page for that month.{{r|twsQuartz101|twsGuardian494933}} Some authors tried to compensate for less income by slightly altering and republishing their work, to try to increase the total of pages read.{{r|twsQuartz101}} The change to the pages-read model was criticized as being a \"huge pay cut\" for authors.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} None of the big 5 publishers contributed books to Kindle Unlimited as of 2017.{{r|twsChicTrib101}}\n\n====IngramSpark====\n\nIngramSpark lets authors publish digital and paperback editions of their books. It distributes books to most online bookstores. Brick-and-mortar stores can also order books from IngramSpark at wholesales prices for sale in their own venues. It is run by [[Ingram Content Group]].\n\n====Apple====\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] sells books via its [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] which is a digital distribution platform for its [[mobile app]]s on its [[iOS]] operating system.

Apple pays authors 70% of its proceeds at its Apple iBookstore where it sells [[iBooks]].{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\n====Smashwords====\n[[Smashwords]] is a California-based company founded by Mark Coker which allows authors and independent publishers to upload their manuscripts electronically to the Smashwords service, which then converts them into multiple e-book formats which can be read on various devices. Authors control what price is set.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}}\n\n====Barnes & Noble====\n[[Barnes & Noble]] pays 65% of the list price of e-books purchased through its online store called Pubit.{{r|twsNYT9989|twsMiamiHerald324}}\n\n====Kobo====\n[[Kobo Inc.|Kobo]] is a Canadian company which sells e-books, audiobooks, e-readers and tablet computers which originated as a cloud e-reading service.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\n====Scribd====\n[[Scribd]] is an open publishing platform which features a digital library, an e-book and audiobook subscription service.{{r|twsNYT9989}} It began as an online sharing site for books, and evolved into a store; books published there entitle an author to 80% of the sales price.{{r|twsNYT9989}}\n\n====Lulu====\n[[Lulu (company)|Lulu]] is an online print-on-demand, self-publishing and distribution platform.{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}}\n\n===Print-on-Demand===\n{{Main|Print-on-demand}}\nPrint-on-demand (or POD) publishing refers to the ability to print high-quality books as needed. This is usually the most economical option for self-publishers who expect sales to be sporadic over time. An alternative is to hire a printing press to do a print run in which a large number of books are printed at one time, such as a hundred or a thousand copies, which can result in a slightly lower per-book printing cost, but risks holding onto unsold inventory for an extended period of time. Print-on-demand means that a book is printed only after it is purchased, lessening the risk, which eliminates the need for expensive warehouse space.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Many companies allow single books to be printed at per-book costs which are not much higher than those paid by publishing companies for large print runs.{{r|NYT123454|twsSFWA101}} Ingram is the largest book distributor, and it can help self-published authors get access to 39,000 bookstores, according to one report.{{r|twsFortune147}} The physical quality of print-on-demand self-published books is generally the same as that from an established publisher, although quality can in some instances vary.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n\n===E-books===\n[[File:Amazon Books at U Village, Seattle (22955160585).jpg|thumb|right|The online retailer [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] is transforming the publishing industry.]]\n{{Main|E-book}}\nGenerally self-publishing works best with e-books because, unlike print-on-demand self-publishing, it solves the twin problems of price and distribution.{{r|twsSFWA101}} There are a variety of e-book formats and tools that can be used to create them. Because it is possible to create e-books with no up-front or per-book costs, this is a popular option for self-publishers.{{r|PBS00998}} \n{{r|PBS00998|twsNPR4432}} When a person buys an E-book, the buyer does not ''own'' the book, but owns a license only to read the book.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} Formatting standards for e-books continue to evolve; at present, there have been compatibility problems with some digital e-book readers. For example, a recent [[EPUB]] 3.1 e-book format is not compatible with earlier e-book readers such as the Kindle.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} E-book formats include EPUB, MOBI and PDF, among others. In 2017, there was a report in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that e-books sales are continuing to increase.{{r|twsChicTrib00303}} Epublishing distributors allow an author to sell on multiple platforms, often providing conversion and formatting services, usually charge no fees upfront, and make money by taking a small percentage of each book sold.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n\n===Vanity press===\n{{Main|Vanity press}}\nUsers pay to have their books published. While a commercial publisher's market is the book-buying public at large, the vanity publisher's market is the author himself or herself. Some authors buy substantial copies of their own book which are then used as giveaways or promotional tools. The term ''vanity press'' is considered pejorative since it suggests that a person who hires such a service is unqualified or unable to have their book succeed in the market, and that the author is printing the book only out of [[vanity]]. In this business model, there can be elements of fraud, such that some vanity presses masquerade as legitimate publishers, and pretend to be selective and choosy in their book selections, and prey upon a would-be author's desire to be published. If a vanity press charges a higher amount to print a run of books than a regular [[Printer (publishing)|printer]], it can be an indication of deception and fraud.\n\n====Kindle Direct Publishing====\n[[CreateSpace]] was Amazon's print-on-demand book publishing service. Authors could sign up for an account, and the online software guided an author through the steps of publication, such as uploading a cover, selecting distribution channels and setting prices.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Books uploaded to CreateSpace became part of Amazon's online catalog and were made available to book buyers around the world. Amazon collected revenues from book sales on behalf of authors, and then deposited royalty monies directly into an author's account, usually after a few months or so after the sale.{{R|twsNPR4432}} CreateSpace offered additional services to help authors, such as cover design and copyediting ($120+) as well as converting the manuscript file to a Kindle-compatible e-book file ($70).{{r|twsNYT9989}} CreateSpace offered authors free book identifying numbers or ISBNs without extra charge, or authors could buy their own ISBN numbers. In August 2018 CreateSpace was absorbed into Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP).\n\n====Smashwords====\n[[Smashwords]] publishes and distributes e-books.{{r|twsNPR4432}} Smashwords authors keep 60% of the sale price, and Smashwords keeps 10%, and the retailer keeps 30%; if a sale is made directly through Smashwords, the author keeps 85% of the sales price.{{r|twsNYT9989}} Smashwords provides a list of freelance assistance services.{{r|twsNYT9989}} In 2017, it distributed 250,000 titles for 60,000 authors to most of the world's e-book stores in exchange for a cut of the author's profits.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Smashwords books can go on sale a few minutes after they're uploaded.{{r|twsChicTrib101}}\n\n{{Quote|I believe every writer is great and wonderful and has something to share with the world.

Since 2000, there has been an increase in the sales of digital titles, audiobooks, self-published paperbacks,{{r|twsBB484829}} including printed as well as e-books. The overall market for all books, including from traditional publishers, is growing as well.\n* '''Explosive growth of new titles.''' The growth in new titles has been strong, particularly in the past decade. In 2002, there were a quarter&nbsp;million new titles, but since 2009, the number of new titles has topped 1.3&nbsp;million each year.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} In 2010, according to a different analysis, there were 4.2&nbsp;million new titles published.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} Much of the growth in new titles has been because of self-publishing. In 2011, self-published books made up 43% of all print titles, helping to increase overall growth of print production, according to Bowker market research.{{r|twsCSM48482}} In the middle of the second decade, the growth of print titles seemed to ebb somewhat, perhaps eclipsed by the growth of e-book titles. For instance, from 2014 to 2015, print titles grew by 34%; from 2015 to 2016, print titles grew but more slowly by 11%.{{r|twsRI1010}} That is the growth of new ''titles''; book sales increased as well, growing by 3% in 2016.{{r|twsBloomberg47471}} In 2017, there were reports that sales of physical books were increasing in the United States.{{r|twsBB484829}}\n* '''Strong growth in self-publishing.''' There has been a \"dizzying rise in self-publishing,\" according to one view.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} Self-published book titles in production tripled from 2006 to 2012.{{r|twsCSM48482}} 2008 was a watershed year; for the first time in history, more books were self-published than those published traditionally.{{r|twsForbes11121}} In 2009, 76% of all books released were self-published, while publishing houses reduced the number of books they produced.{{r|Jim Milliot}} Back in 2008, there were 85,468 self-published titles;{{r|twsBaltSun543}} in 2011, 247,210; by 2012, 459,000; by 2013, 458,564;{{r|twsBaltSun543|twsPW787}} by 2017, 786,935 self-published ISBNs.{{r|twsRI1010|twsChicTrib101|twsUSAToday143}} During a period of six years, growth of self-published titles was a remarkable 218%.{{r|twsRI1010|twsChicTrib101}} These numbers don't count titles published by Amazon's KDP which identifies books by ASIN numbers instead of ISBN numbers. These are worldwide figures, but the numbers are strong for particular markets as well; for example, in the United Kingdom, readers bought 18&nbsp;million self-published books in 2013, a 79% increase from the year before.{{r|twsInsideHireEd}} The numbers are strong for particular platforms too; for instance, in 2012, of books sold by Amazon's Kindle KDP service, a quarter of those sales were self-published.{{r|twsInsideHireEd}}\n* '''A saturated market of mostly junky titles.''' The self-publishing ecosystem has become flooded with titles.{{r|twsNYT80009}} While self-publishing overall is booming, most new titles are poorly written or confused or otherwise lacking in appeal. There are a few dozen self-published books that are winning most of the sales, so for the others, even quality self-published books seeking to get attention, it is increasingly difficult to be noticed. Of profits paid to authors by Smashwords, the best-selling 1% of titles earn half of all sales money.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Some authors earn modest profits from their work. For example, writer Wayne Hicks of Arkansas published five titles, spending $700 on editing and marketing services, and spent a thousand hours creating and promoting his books; he's sold a thousand copies for a profit of $1,400.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Kate Lippa of Maine made $1,600 selling her books.{{r|twsUSAToday143}}\n\n{{Quote|The largest, by far, percentage of authors are making less than $500 a year self-publishing, because there's a glut.

One strategist suggested that an author should have a creative marketing campaign and try one tactic each day, while studying those tactics undertaken by successful self-publishers.{{r|twsNYT9989}} One author spends roughly $70,000 annually creating and promoting her books, and hires a dozen freelancers for various parts of her operation.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} Another self-published author gave 80 books to friends, who told their friends, to generate positive publicity.{{r|twsMiHer4949}} A strategy that helps many self-published authors is to write a series, making the first installment free, and charging for subsequent versions.{{r|twsSFWA101}}\n\nAuthors have tried numerous approaches to promoting and marketing their books, including...\n\n* '''Building a web presence'''{{r|PW11911}}\n* '''Building a mailing list'''{{r|PW11911}}\n* '''Promoting e-books through targeted giveaways'''{{r|PW11911}}\n* '''Offering a limited edition print book'''{{r|twsTime101}}\n* '''Promoting books through [[social media]]'''{{r|twsUSAToday143}}\n* '''Writing a blog'''{{r|twsUSAToday143|twsMiHer4949}}\n* '''Having an author website'''{{r|twsMiHer4949}}\n* '''Raising funds for advertising through [[crowdfunding]]'''{{r|twsChicTrib101}}\n* '''Having book signings'''{{r|twsMiHer4949}}\n* '''Going to craft fairs'''{{r|twsMiHer4949}}\n* '''Hiring a public relations firm'''{{r|twsMiHer4949}}\n* '''Generating positive word of mouth'''{{r|twsMiHer4949}}\n* '''Joining a self-publishing group'''{{r|twsUSAToday4435}}\n* '''Adding an audio book'''{{r|twsPW787}}\n* '''Becoming an indie publisher'''{{r|twsPW787}}\n* '''Entering contests open to self-published authors'''\n* '''Donating paperback copies to libraries'''{{r|twsPW787}}\n* '''Getting books into local bookstores'''{{r|twsPW787}}\n\nMost book contests are open only to books published by established publishers, but there are a few contests open to self-published writers. One is the Illinois Library Association, in conjunction with BiblioBoards and with Reaching Across Illinois Library System, which sponsored a prize for best self-published novel; the contest is open to Illinois-based self-published writers.{{r|twsChicTribBerk1|twsChicTrib89667}} The British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', in conjunction with selected publishers, has a ''Self published book of the month'' award, which began in 2014; entries are submitted digitally and must be in the English language, and the contest is open only to residents of the [[United Kingdom]].{{r|twsGuardian46980}}\n\n==Who is self-publishing?==\nSelf-publishers include a wide variety of persons. Some retirees are self-publishing the story of their life, to leave as a legacy to their offspring after they're gone.{{r|twsMercNews9393}} Sometimes adults help write and edit the book for their parent; for example, Arthur Chiang helped his mother describe her life as an immigrant, adding photos, and helping with the technical aspects of preparing the manuscript for publication.{{r|twsMercNews9393}} There have been instances in which parents, to give their teenaged children experience with writing and to involve them in fun projects, acted as \"publishers\" for their children, paying some of the costs to have their offspring self-published.{{r|twsNYT9897}} Eleven-year-old [[John Ruskin]] sold a book of poetry he self-published with his father.{{r|patterson}} Author Brooks Olsen chose Amazon after writing her self-published book, which was edited in part by her parents, with a cover design from her boyfriend, saying she liked having Amazon's clout behind her.{{R|twsNPR4432}} The motivations of self-published writers are many, and include building a career as a writer and satisfying an ambition, along with money, which isn't usually the top reason.{{r|twsUSAToday143}}\n\n==Self-publishing success stories==\n[[File:Shades of Grey - Geheimes Verlangen (E.

James]] was originally published online as ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' [[fan-fiction]] before the author decided to self-publish it as an [[e-book]] and print on demand.{{r|huffpost_books|twsNYT9989|twsMiHer4949}}\n* The science fiction novel ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'', by [[Andy Weir]], was originally released as chapters on his personal blog, and then self-published as an eBook in 2011.{{r|Martian22}} The rights were purchased by Crown Publishing which re-released it in 2014; the novel went on to become a bestseller and then a [[The Martian (film)|major motion picture]] starring [[Matt Damon]].{{r|BoxOfficeMojo99|Martian22|Martian|MartianBook1}}\n* Blogger [[Alan Sepinwall]]'s self-published book ''The Revolution Was Televised'' became an instant hit, winning a prominent review within two weeks of publication by critic Michiko Kakutani in the ''[[New York Times]]''.{{R|twsNPR4432}} Sepinwall hired an editor and spent roughly $2,500 on services to get his book ready for publication.{{R|twsNPR4432}}\n* Minnesota social worker [[Amanda Hocking]] uploaded several books in 2010 and sold a few dozen copies. She published several more manuscripts and within a few months was making enough money to quit her daytime job.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} She later won a deal with Macmillan publishers, and went to being a millionaire in a year.{{r|twsUSAToday143}} She sold her series to [[St. Martin's Press]] in 2011 for two&nbsp;million dollars.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n* Swedish author Carl-Johan Forssen Ehrlin wrote a book in 2010 which helped get children to go to sleep; his ''The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep'' title featured amateurish illustrations with \"clunky prose\" and a monotonous storyline, but parents bought it for the catchy subtitle of \"A new way of getting children to sleep\".{{r|twsNYT7676}} He released it on CreateSpace and it became a bestseller.{{r|twsNYT7676}}\n* Erotic romance author Meredith Wild sold 1.4&nbsp;million digital and print copies of her books, and founded her own publishing company called Waterhouse Press; she founded the firm in part because she felt that her novels were \"not being taken seriously\" as an indie author.{{r|twsNYT80009}} An advantage of having her own imprint is that it is easier to get books into chainstores and big-box retailers.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n\n[[File:Howey Wool art 03.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hugh Howey]]'s book ''Wool''.]]\n* The breakout hit ''[[Silo (series)|Wool]]'' by [[Hugh Howey]] was self-published originally and garnered more than a million dollars in royalty monies, and has generated over 5000 Amazon reviews.{{r|twsWSJ9439|WritersDigest44}}\n* [[James Altucher]]'s ''Choose Yourself'' (2013) sold 44,294 copies in its first month, debuted at No. 1 on Amazon's top non-fiction list, and was a ''Wall Street Journal'' bestseller.{{r|Altucher3333}}\n* [[Victoria Knowles]] achieved notoriety in July 2014 when her self-published book ''The PA'' reached the number one spot in the [[iTunes]] chart for paid books.{{r|The Sunday Times}}\n* [[Matthew Reilly]]'s self-published ''Contest'', the first of his action-thriller novels, in 1996.{{r|ABCnet444}}\n\n<small></small><small></small><small></small><small></small><small></small><small></small>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Self-publishing is an increasingly likely choice for authors who are \"midcareer, midlist, middle-aged, more or less middlebrow, and somewhat Internet savvy,\" writes journalist Neal Pollack, who extols the promise of being able to reach readers directly.{{r|twsNYT4221}} Elizabeth Prybylski, publisher of Insomnia, an indie press, describes the main difference between self-publishing and traditional publishing is \"who puts up the overhead of production.\"\n\n{{Quote|If the author doesn't have the money, time, or inclination to do all of those things for their book and to pay the costs of production, a publisher's experience and knowledge can make up for that gap.|Elizabeth Prybylski of Insomnia Press.}}\n\nAnalyses have been made suggesting that self-published authors' earnings have been comparing favorably to earnings from established publishers,{{r|twsNPR2322}} and this may be a factor causing established authors to switch to the self-publishing approach. While a self-published author can typically keep 70% of the sales price, a typical contract with a publisher will be payment of an advance sum such as $5000 to $10,000, plus receiving 25% of digital sales and 7% to 12% of the list price for bound books, which the author will receive after the publisher recoups the money paid for the advance to the author.{{r|twsNYT16161}}\n\nAuthors being published the traditional way have seen their income from publishing decline in recent years. A survey from the Authors Guild found that authors with contracts with established publishers were making 30% less money in 2015 than they had been making in 2009.{{r|twsNPR1123}}  Talented writers in traditional publishing, who have won prizes and awards, are earning less, with some living at or near the poverty line.{{r|twsNPR1123}} Some books sell only 5,000 to 20,000 copies, some less than that.{{r|twsNPR1123}} Factors identified as dampening the income levels of such authors include the online piracy of digital material, major publishing houses consolidating to focus more on profits, and the rise of Amazon and self-publishing.{{r|twsNPR1123}}\n\n[[File:David Jones Fashion Ambassador Miranda Kerr in store book signing in Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|Some writers have criticized mainstream publishers for emphasizing celebrity rather than quality writing. In photo: fashion model [[Miranda Kerr]] at a book signing.]]\nSome writers have been dissatisfied with the marketing efforts of a traditional publisher. One writer got fed up when the publisher made basic mistakes with a book launch, and so he \"decided to take his book back\" and self-published it. He hired the firm Reedsy to redesign his book ''The Pink Marine'', and went on to form his own imprint.{{r|twsBloomberg433}} Novelist Louise Walters felt that traditional publishers were \"debut-centric\" and obsessed with celebrities.{{r|twsGuardian4474}} [[David Mamet]], whose book ''The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture'' had been on the New York Times bestseller list, chose to release his novella by self-publishing.{{r|twsNYT16161}} He had been dissatisfied with the marketing efforts of his traditional publisher.{{r|twsNYT16161}} There was a report that suggested that traditional publishers have lessened their marketing efforts on behalf of authors.{{r|twsNYT16161}} Another example is romance novelist Courtney Milan who switched to self-publishing because she wanted to have \"more agency over the background of her characters\" and her stories.{{r|twsNYT43432}} Some photographers, who felt hemmed in by the traditional photo book publishing world, have started up their own imprints as a way to publish their own books.{{R|twsTime101}} Writer Sarah Grimm moved away from the traditional publishing approach to self-publishing because she wanted greater control over cover design, publication dates and the story content.{{r|twsUSAToday4435}}\n\n{{Quote|My first book went through so many different changes that when it released, I no longer felt like it was the story I originally set out to tell.|Author Sarah Grimm on why she chose self-publishing.{{r|twsUSAToday4435}}}}\n\nNovelist Louise Walters explained why she switched to the self-publishing mode, after her publisher rejected her second novel, describing self-publishing as an \"exhilarating change\":{{r|twsGuardian4474}}\n\n{{Quote|Footing the bill to bring out the book means the responsibility is on my shoulders, but at the same time it's incredibly freeing. I can market this book in any way I choose; I have real input into every decision regarding my work; I'll even earn a fairer share of the proceeds from each sale \u2026 It's only a book, after all, and self-publishing is a whole lot of fun.|Louise Walters in 2014{{r|twsGuardian4474}}}}\n\nStill, it is likely that when a self-published author creates a bestseller, that he or she will accept an offer from a major publisher. Some traditional publishers troll the lists of bestselling self-published titles to look for new books to sell.{{r|twsNPR899}} Smashwords president Mark Coker predicted that it will become more difficult for traditional publishers to entice the best self-published authors, simply because traditional publishers don't pay as much.{{r|twsNPR899}} Successful self-published authors have been courted by literary agents and publishers offering substantial sums of money.{{r|twsNYT80009}} It's getting harder for established publishers to woo away successful self-published authors since the royalty structure they offer may not match the profits to be made from publishing on their own.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n\n===Advantages of self-publishing===\nBenefits include:\n\n* '''Speed.''' An author finds out right away whether a book is a hit with readers; there is not a six-month or longer delay typical with an established publisher since the usual back-and-forth steps with a publisher are bypassed. It is possible to release a book within a few weeks after it is finished.{{r|twsUSAToday4435}} Further, it is possible to avoid the lengthy process of trying to find a literary agent to secure a publishing contract.{{r|twsBaltSun543}}\n* '''No start-up costs.''' Manuscripts uploaded to KDP or Smashwords typically do not incur any fees.\n* '''Freedom to begin the next book.''' An author can self-publish and then begin work on the next project, potentially being more prolific, although this presumes that the first book won't need any marketing effort.\n* '''A greater share of royalties.''' Self-published authors earn four to five times more per unit than if an author works with a traditional publisher,{{r|twsNPR899}} sometimes 70% of the sale price.\n* '''Pitch books straight to the readers.''' There is no intermediary censoring what might be shown to the public. The route to readers is more direct.\n\n{{Quote|Authors are no longer bound in their storytelling by what the traditional publishers think the market can bear ... Instead, because we can go straight to the reader now, we can write exactly the books that we want to write and exactly the books that our fans want to read. We don't have to worry about whether an agent can sell the book, or if an editor and publisher want to buy the book, or if a retailer wants to stock the book. Personally, I think this new open market can \u2013 and does \u2013 make for much more interesting storytelling.|Novelist [[Bella Andre]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2015{{r|twsWP57575}}}}\n\n* '''Creative freedom.'''{{r|twsBaltSun543}}\n\n{{Quote|With self-publishing you don't waste your time trying to get published, which can take years of query letters and agenting, and all this stuff. You go straight to the real gatekeepers, which are the readers. If they respond favorably and you have sales, you can leverage that into a writing career. If they don't, you write the next thing. Either way you're not spending your time trying to get published, you're spending your time writing the next work.|[[Hugh Howey]], author of ''Wool''{{r|twsMiamiHerald324}}}}\n\n===Disadvantages of self-publishing===\nThere are significant challenges to self-publishing as well.\n\n* '''Most self-published books sell few copies.''' Some estimates are that they sell fewer than 100 to 150 copies;{{r|twsNYT9989}} another estimate is that most sell fewer than 250 copies.{{r|twsSFWA101}} However, the vast majority of books promoted by traditional publishers fail as well.{{r|twsChicTrib101}} Still, the overwhelming odds are that any self-published book will be ignored and end up in the \"digital slush pile.\"{{r|twsNYT4221}}\n* '''Crowded landscape.''' There is much competition and it is difficult to get one's book to be noticed in a glutted market.{{r|twsPW787}} Big publishers have much better prospects for getting attention for a book.{{r|twsWSJ438337}}\n* '''Lack of prestige.''' A book from a traditional publisher still has a lot of cachet in that it has been vetted by editors, which gives it a \"stamp of approval.\"{{r|twsBaltSun543|twsMiHer4949}}\n* '''Hard to get into bookstores.''' Big bookstores rarely take self-published books, and if they do, they want 50% of the sales price.{{r|twsMiHer4949}} Publishers have established distribution channels to make this easy.\n* '''Publishers offer editorial and marketing help.''' Plus they usually pay an advance to help the author with expenses at the early start of the publishing cycle, an advantage which self-published writers do not have.{{r|twsMiHer4949}}\n\n{{Quote|You risk looking like an amateur ... Good writers need even better editors. They need brilliant cover designers. They need imaginative marketers and well-connected publicists. All these things are provided by a traditional publisher, and what's more, it doesn't cost you a penny. They pay you! If a self-published author wants to avoid looking like an amateur, they'd better be prepared to shell out some serious cash to get professional help in all the areas where they don't excel. And I mean serious.|Ros Barber in 2016.{{r|twsGuardian8426}}}}\n\n* '''Difficulty getting reviews in the mainstream press.''' It is difficult for self-published books to be reviewed in newspapers and magazines. The media favors books from traditional publishers before giving reviews.{{r|twsMiHer4949|twsGuardian8426}}\n*'''Hiring editors, proofreaders and cover designers can be difficult and expensive.'''\n* '''Authors must spend much time marketing their books.''' Authors must work hard to market their books, which is a task that many authors are not skilled at or willing to do.{{r|twsNYT80009}}\n* '''Having to spend time marketing the book.''' One self-published author in Britain was working \"14-hour days\", spending months promoting her book ''Only the Innocent''; while she eventually made it to the UK Kindle bestseller chart, Rachel Abbott still has difficulty getting the publishing world to take her book seriously.{{r|twsGuardian4948}} Another writer, Ros Barber, thinks self-publishing is a \"terrible idea for serious novelists\" since the requirements of marketing and promoting a book will prevent one from writing, and he continues to recommend the traditional approach.{{r|twsGuardian8426}}\n\n{{Quote|You have to forget writing for a living ... Self-publishing can make you behave like a fool ... The vast majority of indie authors have tweetstreams that are 90% adverts, perhaps a reflection of the fact that they must spend 90% of their time marketing ... Good writers become good because they undertake an apprenticeship.|Ros Barber on the benefits of the traditional approach, 2016.{{r|twsGuardian8426}}}}\n\n* '''Self-published books usually ineligible for prizes.''' Books are not eligible for major prizes such as the Hay festival, the Booker, the Baileys, the Costa and the Man Booker, and literary novels need these prizes to become a bestseller.{{r|twsGuardian8426}} However, there are signs that this is changing as more books become self-published.\n\n==See also==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Alternative media]]\n* [[D\u014djin]]\n* [[List of self-publishing companies]]\n* [[Independent music]]\n* [[Samizdat]]\n* [[Self Publish, Be Happy]]\n* [[:Category:Self-published books]]\n* [[Small press]]\n* [[Predatory open access publishing]]\n* [[Author mill]]\n* [[Vanity publishing]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"twsRMag1\">{{cite web | url=http://richmondmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/self-publishing/ | title=Self-Publishing | publisher=Richmond Magazine | date=25 September 2017 | accessdate=20 October 2017 | author=Harry Kollatz Jr. | quote=\"... publishing has never been less stable \u2026 \"cooperative\" publishing, in which the cost is shared between the author and publisher\u2026. software called Scrivener for book formatting...\"}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"twsReedsy148\">{{cite web | url=https://blog.reedsy.com/writing-contests/ | title=Search for writing contests in your genre | publisher=Reedsy | date=January 2018 | accessdate=16 January 2018 | quote=\"...

Hamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have information unavailable to the general public. Hamilton also argued that since no federal officeholder could be an elector, none of the electors would be beholden to any presidential candidate.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAnother consideration was the decision would be made without \"tumult and disorder\" as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various locales where the decision-makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one place where decision-makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the Electoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of Representatives was to choose the president from among the top five candidates,<ref>The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] changed this to the top three candidates</ref> ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the laws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned about somebody unqualified, but with a talent for \"low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity\" attaining high office.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Federalist No. 10]], James Madison argued against \"an interested and overbearing majority\" and the \"mischiefs of faction\" in an electoral system. He defined a faction as \"a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\" What was then called republican government (i.e., [[representative democracy]], as opposed to [[direct democracy]]) combined with the principles of [[federalism]] (with distribution of voter rights and separation of government powers) would countervail against factions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No.{{nbsp}}10 that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty factions would face in organizing due to such issues as [[sectionalism]].<ref>''The Federalist Papers: Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay'' The New American Library, 1961</ref>\n\nAlthough the United States Constitution refers to \"Electors\" and \"electors\", neither the phrase \"Electoral College\" nor any other name is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century the name \"Electoral College\" came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The phrase was first written into federal law in 1845 and today the term appears in {{USC|3|4}}, in the section heading and in the text as \"college of electors\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html|title=U.

That practice changed during the early 19th century, as states extended the right to vote to wider segments of the population. By [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], only [[South Carolina]] had not transitioned to popular election.

Under the original plan, each elector cast two votes for president; electors did not vote for vice president. Whoever received a majority of votes from the electors would become president, with the person receiving the second most votes becoming vice president.\n\nThe original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Stanley|title=Updating the Electoral College: The National Popular Vote Legislation|journal=Harvard Journal on Legislation|volume=44|issue=205, at 208|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|location=Cambridge, MA|year=2007}}</ref>\n# Choice of the president should reflect the \"sense of the people\" at a particular time, not the dictates of a faction in a \"pre-established body\" such as Congress or the State legislatures, and independent of the influence of \"foreign powers\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Hamilton, Alexander.

Hamilton so strongly believed this was to be done district by district, and when states began doing otherwise, he proposed a constitutional amendment to mandate the district system (Hamilton, [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289 Draft of a Constitutional Amendment]). Madison concurred, \"The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted.\" ([https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023 Madison to Hay, 1823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|date=May 25, 2017}})</ref>\n# Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting, deliberating with the most complete information available in a system that over time, tended to bring about a good administration of the laws passed by Congress.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n# Candidates would not pair together on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president.\n# The system as designed would rarely produce a winner, thus sending the presidential election to the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to the text of Article II, however, each state government was free to have its own plan for selecting its electors, and the Constitution does not explicitly require states to popularly elect their electors. Several methods for selecting electors are described [[United States Electoral College#Alternative methods of choosing electors|below]].\n\n==== Breakdown and revision ====\nThe emergence of [[Political party|political parties]] and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]] and [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]. In 1796, [[Federalist Party]] candidate [[John Adams]] won the presidential election. Finishing in second place was [[Democratic-Republican Party]] candidate [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Federalists' opponent, who became the vice president. This resulted in the president and vice president being of different political parties.\n\nIn 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for president and also nominated [[Aaron Burr]] for vice president. After the electors voted, Jefferson and Burr tied one another with 73 electoral votes each. Since ballots did not distinguish between votes for president and votes for vice president, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to become president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had to be decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] pursuant to the Constitution's contingency election provision.\n\nHaving already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party representatives in the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] House session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition by attempting to elect Burr over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House (the votes of nine states were needed for a conclusive election). Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot, but only after Federalist Party leader [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014who disfavored Burr's personal character more than Jefferson's policies\u2014had made known his preference for Jefferson.\n\nResponding to the problems from those elections, the Congress proposed on December 9, 1803, and three-fourths of the states ratified by June 15, 1804, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. Starting with the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 election]], the amendment requires electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president, replacing the system outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3.\n\n=== Evolution to the general ticket ===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution states:\n{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.}}\n\nAlexander Hamilton described the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers']] view of how electors would be chosen: {{quote|A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated [tasks].<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\">{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp|title=Federalist No 68|publisher=The Avalon Project}}</ref>}} They assumed this would take place district by district. That plan was carried out by many states until the 1880s. For example, in [[Massachusetts]] in 1820, the rule stated \"the people shall vote by ballot, on which shall be designated who is voted for as an Elector for the district.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0ouAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245|title=Resolves of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Passed at Their Session, which Commenced on Wednesday, the Thirty First of May, and Ended on the Seventeenth of June, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty.

Russell, 1820; [repr|date=January 1, 1820|publisher=Boston Book Company|via=Google Books}}</ref> In other words, the people did not place the name of a candidate for a president on the ballot, instead they voted for their local elector, whom they trusted later to cast a responsible vote for president.\n\nSome states reasoned that the favorite presidential candidate among the people in their state would have a much better chance if all of the electors selected by their state were sure to vote the same way\u2014a \"general ticket\" of electors pledged to a party candidate.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\">Devin McCarthy (Ph.D. Polysci, Duke), [http://www.fairvote.org/how-the-electoral-college-became-winner-take-all \"How the Electoral College Became Winner-Take-All\"]</ref> So the slate of electors chosen by the state were no longer free agents, independent thinkers, or deliberative representatives. They became \"voluntary party lackeys and intellectual non-entities.\"<ref>Chief Justice Robert Jackson, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/214 Ray v. Blair, dissent, 1952]</ref> Once one state took that strategy, the others felt compelled to follow suit in order to compete for the strongest influence on the election.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\"/>\n\nWhen [[James Madison]] and Hamilton, two of the most important architects of the Electoral College, saw this strategy being taken by some states, they protested strongly. Madison and Hamilton both made it clear this approach violated the spirit of the Constitution. According to Hamilton, the selection of the president should be \"made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president].\"<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\"/> According to Hamilton, the electors were to analyze the list of potential presidents and select the best one. He also used the term \"deliberate\". Hamilton considered a pre-pledged elector to violate the spirit of Article II of the Constitution insofar as such electors could make no \"analysis\" or \"deliberate\" concerning the candidates. Madison agreed entirely, saying that when the Constitution was written, all of its authors assumed individual electors would be elected in their districts and it was inconceivable a \"general ticket\" of electors dictated by a state would supplant the concept. Madison wrote to George Hay: {{quote|The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted; & was exchanged for the general ticket [many years later].<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\">{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|title=Founders Online: James Madison to George Hay, 23 August 1823|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Founding Fathers assumed that each elector would be elected by the citizens of a district and that elector was to be free to analyze and deliberate regarding who is best suited to be president.\n\nMadison and Hamilton were so upset by what they saw as a distortion of the original intent that they advocated a constitutional amendment to prevent anything other than the district plan: \"the election of Presidential Electors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward,\" Madison told George Hay in 1823.<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\"/> Hamilton went further. He actually drafted an amendment to the Constitution mandating the district plan for selecting electors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289|title=Founders Online: Draft of a Resolution for the Legislature of New York for the{{nbsp}}...|website=founders.archives.gov}}</ref> However, Hamilton's [[Burr-Hamilton duel|untimely death]] in 1804 prevented him from advancing his proposed reforms any further.\n\n=== Evolution of selection plans ===\nIn 1789, at-large popular vote, the winner-take-all method, began with Pennsylvania and Maryland; Virginia and Delaware used a district plan by popular vote, and in the five other states participating in the election (Connecticut, Georgia, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Carolina),<ref>{{cite web|title=1788 Election For the First Term, 1789\u20131793|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/votes/1789_1821.html#1788|website=U.

Beginning with the first census, Electoral College votes repeatedly eclipsed the electoral basis supporting slave-power in the choice of the U.S. president.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130103115308/http://history.house.gov/Institution/Apportionment/Apportionment/ Apportionment by State (PDF)], House of Representatives, History, Art & Archives, viewed January 27, 2019. Unlike the votes taken in the Electoral College, from 1803 to 1846, the U.S. Senate sustained parity between free-soil and slave-holding states. But subsequently, an unbroken chain of free-soil states, including Iowa, Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Oregon and Kansas, were admitted before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].</ref>\n\nAt the Constitution, the Electoral College was authorized a majority of 49 votes for northern states in the process of abolishing slavery, and 42 votes for slave-holding states (including Delaware). In the event, the first 1788 presidential election did not include Electoral College votes for unratified Rhode Island (3) and North Carolina (7), nor for New York (8) which reported too late; the Northern majority was 38 to 35.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript U.S. Constitution Transcript], held at the U.S. National Archives, viewed online on February 5, 2019.</ref> Then for the first two decades of census apportionment in the Electoral College, in 1790 and in 1800, the Three-fifths clause awarded free-soil Northern states narrow majorities of 8% and 11% as the Southern states in [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Convention]] had given up two-fifths of their slave population in their federal apportionment compromise.

Then Andrew Jackson won in 1828, but that second campaign would also have been lost if the count in the Electoral College were by citizen-only apportionment alone. Scholars conclude that in the 1828 race, Jackson benefited materially from the Three-fifths clause by providing his margin of victory. The impact of the Three-fifths clause in both Jefferson's first and Jackson's first presidential elections was significant because each of them launched sustained Congressional party majorities over several Congresses, as well as presidential party eras.<ref>Brian D.

If no candidate receives a majority in the election for president or vice president, the election is determined via a [[#Contingencies|contingency procedure]] established by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]].

The meeting is opened by the election certification official \u2013 often that state's [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]] or equivalent \u2014 who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches at this point in the proceedings.\n\nWhen the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two people to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. Ballot formats vary between the states: in [[New Jersey]] for example, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in [[North Carolina]], the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.\n\nEach state's electors must complete six Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must be signed by all of the electors and a Certificate of Ascertainment must be attached to each of the Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must include the names of those who received an electoral vote for either the office of president or of vice president. The electors certify the Certificates of Vote and copies of the Certificates are then sent in the following fashion:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|title=U.S. Electoral College \u2013 For State Officials|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053914/http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* One is sent by [[registered mail]] to the [[President of the Senate]] (who usually is the incumbent [[vice president of the United States]]);\n* Two are sent by registered mail to the [[Archivist of the United States]];\n* Two are sent to the state's Secretary of State; and\n* One is sent to the chief judge of the [[United States district court]] where those electors met.\n\nA staff member of the President of the Senate collects the Certificates of Vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress.

Blair]]'', {{ussc|343|214|1952}}. The Court ruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning candidate, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge. As stated in the ruling, electors are acting as a functionary of the state, not the federal government. Therefore, states have the right to govern the process of choosing electors. The constitutionality of state laws punishing electors for actually casting a faithless vote, rather than refusing to pledge, has never been decided by the Supreme Court. However, in his dissent in ''Ray v. Blair'', Justice [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]] wrote: \"no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text \u2014 that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.\"\n\n=== Joint session of Congress ===\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uiAex46pVw A joint session of Congress confirms the 2016 electoral college results], YouTube video.

The vice president and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] sit at the podium, with the vice president in the seat of the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the certificate of vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.\n\nMembers of Congress can object to any state's vote count, provided objection is presented in writing and is signed by at least one member of each house of Congress. An objection supported by at least one senator and one representative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of Congress; after both Houses deliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed. \n\nA state's certificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection, meaning the votes from the State in question are not counted. Individual votes can also be rejected, and are also not counted. \n\nIn [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]], all of the votes from Louisiana and Tennessee were rejected, and in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], all of the votes from Arkansas and Louisiana plus three of the eleven electoral votes  from Georgia were rejected. <ref>{{cite book|author=David A.

Bush of Texas and the vice president of the United States, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by only several representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object. Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections, and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. \n\nIf there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.\n\nAfter the certificates from all states are read and the respective votes are counted, the presiding officer simply announces the final result of the vote and, provided the required absolute majority of votes was achieved, declares the names of the persons elected president and vice president. This announcement concludes the joint session and formalizes the recognition of the president-elect and of the vice president-elect. The senators then depart from the House Chamber. The final tally is printed in the Senate and House journals.\n\n=== Contingencies ===\n{{further|Contingent election}}\n\n==== Contingent presidential election by House ====\nThe [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] requires the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to go into session immediately to vote for a president if no candidate for president receives a majority of the electoral votes (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes).\n\nIn this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes for president. Each state delegation votes ''en bloc'' \u2014 each delegation having a single vote; the District of Columbia does not get to vote. A candidate must receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., at present, a minimum of 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become the ''president-elect''. Additionally, delegations from at least two thirds of all the states must be present for voting to take place. The House continues balloting until it elects a president.\n\nThe House of Representatives has chosen the president only twice: in [[1800 United States presidential election|1801]] under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3; and in [[1824 United States presidential election|1825]] under the Twelfth Amendment.\n\n==== Contingent vice presidential election by Senate ====\nIf no candidate for vice president receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, then the [[United States Senate|Senate]] must go into session to elect a vice president. The Senate is limited to choosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less than the number of candidates available in the House vote. However, the text is written in such a way that ''all'' candidates with the most and second most electoral votes are eligible for the Senate election \u2013 this number could theoretically be larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e., ballots are individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations). However, two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.\n\nAdditionally, the Twelfth Amendment states a \"majority of the whole number\" of senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm#_1_8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231654/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm|archivedate=June 28, 2011|title=RL30804: The Electoral College: An Overview and Analysis of Reform Proposals, L.

Section{{nbsp}}3 also specifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the inauguration. Under the [[Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1947|Presidential Succession Act of 1947]], the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president.

The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]] in 1932. [[Alabama]] was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot.\n\nThe question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the legislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In ''[[McPherson v. Blacker]]'', {{ussc|146|1|1892}}, the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause{{nbsp}}2 which states that a state's electors are selected \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct\" and wrote these words \"operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power\". In ''Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board'', {{ussc|531|70|2000}}, a Florida Supreme Court decision was vacated (not reversed) based on ''McPherson''. On the other hand, three dissenting justices in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', {{ussc|531|98|2000}}, wrote: \"[N]othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it.\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZD.html ''Bush v.

As noted above, the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences: [[bicameral]] legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate. This is precisely what happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John L.|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|edition=2nd|publisher=Congressional Quarterly, Inc.|place=Washington, D.C.|year=1985|page=254|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to [[gerrymandering]].\n\n=== Proportional vote ===\nUnder such a system, electors would be selected in proportion to the votes cast for their candidate or party, rather than being selected by the statewide plurality vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fairvote.org/e_college/reform.htm#proportional|title=FairVote|publisher=FairVote|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref> \n\n=== Congressional district method ===\nThere are two versions of the congressional district method: one has been implemented in Maine and Nebraska; another has been proposed in Virginia.\nUnder the implemented congressional district method, the electoral votes go to the winner of a plurality of the popular vote winner within each of the states' [[congressional district]]s; the statewide popular vote winner receives two additional electoral votes. While this method may result in a more proportional allocation of electors, this is not necessarily the case. For example, in 1992, [[George H. W. Bush]] won all five of Nebraska's electoral votes with 47% of the vote; in a proportional system, he would have received three and [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] each would have received one. <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903145758/http://www1.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archivedate=September 3, 2006|title=Fiddling with the Rules|website=Franklin & Marshall College|date=March 9, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a different version of the congressional district method was proposed in Virginia.

For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by [[voter suppression]] methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchising]] specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement has no effect on the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend the electoral college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.\n\nLegal scholars [[Akhil Reed Amar|Akhil Amar]] and [[Vikram Amar]] have argued that the original Electoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled Southern states to disenfranchise their slave populations.<ref name=\"amar\">{{Cite journal|last=Amar|first=Akhil|last2=Amar|first2=Vikram|title=The Electoral College Votes Against Equality|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 2004|url=http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415144403/http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality|archivedate=2010-04-15}}</ref> It permitted Southern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while allowing these states to maintain political clout within the federation by using the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].

Advocates of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote elections.

Such an amendment, which would abolish the Electoral College, will ensure that the candidate chosen by the voters actually becomes President. Under the Electoral College, it is always possible that the winner of the popular vote will not be elected. This has already happened in three elections, 1824, 1876, and 1888. In the last election, the result could have been changed by a small shift of votes in Ohio and Hawaii, despite a popular vote difference of 1.7 million. I do not recommend a Constitutional amendment lightly. I think the amendment process must be reserved for an issue of overriding governmental significance. But the method by which we elect our President is such an issue. I will not be proposing a specific direct election amendment.

Supporters of the Electoral College argue that it is fundamental to American [[federalism]], that it requires candidates to appeal to voters outside large cities, increases the political influence of small states, preserves the two-party system, and makes the electoral outcome appear more legitimate than that of a nationwide popular vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43824.pdf|title=Electoral College Reform: Contemporary Issues for Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|work=CRS Report for Congress|date=October 6, 2017|last=Neale|first=Thomas H.|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOpponents of the Electoral College argue that it can result in different candidates winning the popular and electoral vote (which occurred in two of the five presidential elections from 2000 to 2016); that it causes candidates to focus their campaigning disproportionately in a few \"[[Swing state|swing states]]\"; and that its allocation of Electoral College votes gives citizens in less populated states (e.g., Wyoming) as much as four times the voting power as those in more populous states (e.g., California).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/11/17/502292749/critics-move-to-trash-the-electoral-college-but-its-not-likely-to-work|title=Critics Move To Scrap The Electoral College, But It's Not Likely To Work|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=November 17, 2016|last=Anderson|first=Meg|accessdate=January 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/us/politics/the-electoral-college-is-hated-by-many-so-why-does-it-endure.html|title=The Electoral College Is Hated by Many.

In [[Federalist No. 39]], Madison argued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of [[Federalism in the United States|state-based]] and [[Proportional representation|population-based]] government. [[United States Congress|Congress]] would have two houses: the state-based [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

The electors come directly from the people and them alone for that purpose only, and for that time only. This avoided a party-run legislature, or a permanent body that could be influenced by foreign interests before each election.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\">Hamilton. [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp The Federalist Papers: No. 68] The Avalon Project, Yale Law School. viewed November 10, 2016.</ref> Hamilton explained the election was to take place among all the states, so no corruption in any state could taint \"the great body of the people\" in their selection. The choice was to be made by a majority of the Electoral College, as majority rule is critical to the principles of republican government. Hamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have information unavailable to the general public. Hamilton also argued that since no federal officeholder could be an elector, none of the electors would be beholden to any presidential candidate.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAnother consideration was the decision would be made without \"tumult and disorder\" as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various locales where the decision-makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one place where decision-makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the Electoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of Representatives was to choose the president from among the top five candidates,<ref>The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] changed this to the top three candidates</ref> ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the laws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned about somebody unqualified, but with a talent for \"low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity\" attaining high office.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Federalist No. 10]], James Madison argued against \"an interested and overbearing majority\" and the \"mischiefs of faction\" in an electoral system. He defined a faction as \"a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\" What was then called republican government (i.e., [[representative democracy]], as opposed to [[direct democracy]]) combined with the principles of [[federalism]] (with distribution of voter rights and separation of government powers) would countervail against factions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No.{{nbsp}}10 that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty factions would face in organizing due to such issues as [[sectionalism]].<ref>''The Federalist Papers: Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay'' The New American Library, 1961</ref>\n\nAlthough the United States Constitution refers to \"Electors\" and \"electors\", neither the phrase \"Electoral College\" nor any other name is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century the name \"Electoral College\" came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The phrase was first written into federal law in 1845 and today the term appears in {{USC|3|4}}, in the section heading and in the text as \"college of electors\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html|title=U.

That practice changed during the early 19th century, as states extended the right to vote to wider segments of the population. By [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], only [[South Carolina]] had not transitioned to popular election. Since [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]], the electors in every state have been chosen based on a popular election held on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]].<ref name=CRS2017THN/> The popular election for electors means the president and vice president are in effect chosen through [[indirect election]] by the citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electoral College|website=history.com|url=https://www.history.com/topics/electoral-college|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> {{anchor|EvsP}}Since the mid-19th century when all electors have been popularly chosen, the Electoral College has elected the candidate who received the most popular votes nationwide, except in four elections: [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]], [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].

Under the original plan, each elector cast two votes for president; electors did not vote for vice president. Whoever received a majority of votes from the electors would become president, with the person receiving the second most votes becoming vice president.\n\nThe original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Stanley|title=Updating the Electoral College: The National Popular Vote Legislation|journal=Harvard Journal on Legislation|volume=44|issue=205, at 208|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|location=Cambridge, MA|year=2007}}</ref>\n# Choice of the president should reflect the \"sense of the people\" at a particular time, not the dictates of a faction in a \"pre-established body\" such as Congress or the State legislatures, and independent of the influence of \"foreign powers\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Hamilton, Alexander.

Hamilton so strongly believed this was to be done district by district, and when states began doing otherwise, he proposed a constitutional amendment to mandate the district system (Hamilton, [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289 Draft of a Constitutional Amendment]). Madison concurred, \"The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted.\" ([https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023 Madison to Hay, 1823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|date=May 25, 2017}})</ref>\n# Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting, deliberating with the most complete information available in a system that over time, tended to bring about a good administration of the laws passed by Congress.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n# Candidates would not pair together on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president.\n# The system as designed would rarely produce a winner, thus sending the presidential election to the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to the text of Article II, however, each state government was free to have its own plan for selecting its electors, and the Constitution does not explicitly require states to popularly elect their electors. Several methods for selecting electors are described [[United States Electoral College#Alternative methods of choosing electors|below]].\n\n==== Breakdown and revision ====\nThe emergence of [[Political party|political parties]] and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]] and [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]. In 1796, [[Federalist Party]] candidate [[John Adams]] won the presidential election. Finishing in second place was [[Democratic-Republican Party]] candidate [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Federalists' opponent, who became the vice president. This resulted in the president and vice president being of different political parties.\n\nIn 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for president and also nominated [[Aaron Burr]] for vice president. After the electors voted, Jefferson and Burr tied one another with 73 electoral votes each. Since ballots did not distinguish between votes for president and votes for vice president, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to become president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had to be decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] pursuant to the Constitution's contingency election provision.\n\nHaving already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party representatives in the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] House session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition by attempting to elect Burr over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House (the votes of nine states were needed for a conclusive election). Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot, but only after Federalist Party leader [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014who disfavored Burr's personal character more than Jefferson's policies\u2014had made known his preference for Jefferson.\n\nResponding to the problems from those elections, the Congress proposed on December 9, 1803, and three-fourths of the states ratified by June 15, 1804, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. Starting with the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 election]], the amendment requires electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president, replacing the system outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3.\n\n=== Evolution to the general ticket ===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution states:\n{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.}}\n\nAlexander Hamilton described the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers']] view of how electors would be chosen: {{quote|A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated [tasks].<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\">{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp|title=Federalist No 68|publisher=The Avalon Project}}</ref>}} They assumed this would take place district by district. That plan was carried out by many states until the 1880s. For example, in [[Massachusetts]] in 1820, the rule stated \"the people shall vote by ballot, on which shall be designated who is voted for as an Elector for the district.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0ouAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245|title=Resolves of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Passed at Their Session, which Commenced on Wednesday, the Thirty First of May, and Ended on the Seventeenth of June, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty.

Russell, 1820; [repr|date=January 1, 1820|publisher=Boston Book Company|via=Google Books}}</ref> In other words, the people did not place the name of a candidate for a president on the ballot, instead they voted for their local elector, whom they trusted later to cast a responsible vote for president.\n\nSome states reasoned that the favorite presidential candidate among the people in their state would have a much better chance if all of the electors selected by their state were sure to vote the same way\u2014a \"general ticket\" of electors pledged to a party candidate.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\">Devin McCarthy (Ph.D. Polysci, Duke), [http://www.fairvote.org/how-the-electoral-college-became-winner-take-all \"How the Electoral College Became Winner-Take-All\"]</ref> So the slate of electors chosen by the state were no longer free agents, independent thinkers, or deliberative representatives. They became \"voluntary party lackeys and intellectual non-entities.\"<ref>Chief Justice Robert Jackson, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/214 Ray v. Blair, dissent, 1952]</ref> Once one state took that strategy, the others felt compelled to follow suit in order to compete for the strongest influence on the election.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\"/>\n\nWhen [[James Madison]] and Hamilton, two of the most important architects of the Electoral College, saw this strategy being taken by some states, they protested strongly. Madison and Hamilton both made it clear this approach violated the spirit of the Constitution. According to Hamilton, the selection of the president should be \"made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president].\"<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\"/> According to Hamilton, the electors were to analyze the list of potential presidents and select the best one. He also used the term \"deliberate\". Hamilton considered a pre-pledged elector to violate the spirit of Article II of the Constitution insofar as such electors could make no \"analysis\" or \"deliberate\" concerning the candidates. Madison agreed entirely, saying that when the Constitution was written, all of its authors assumed individual electors would be elected in their districts and it was inconceivable a \"general ticket\" of electors dictated by a state would supplant the concept. Madison wrote to George Hay: {{quote|The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted; & was exchanged for the general ticket [many years later].<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\">{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|title=Founders Online: James Madison to George Hay, 23 August 1823|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Founding Fathers assumed that each elector would be elected by the citizens of a district and that elector was to be free to analyze and deliberate regarding who is best suited to be president.\n\nMadison and Hamilton were so upset by what they saw as a distortion of the original intent that they advocated a constitutional amendment to prevent anything other than the district plan: \"the election of Presidential Electors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward,\" Madison told George Hay in 1823.<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\"/> Hamilton went further. He actually drafted an amendment to the Constitution mandating the district plan for selecting electors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289|title=Founders Online: Draft of a Resolution for the Legislature of New York for the{{nbsp}}...|website=founders.archives.gov}}</ref> However, Hamilton's [[Burr-Hamilton duel|untimely death]] in 1804 prevented him from advancing his proposed reforms any further.\n\n=== Evolution of selection plans ===\nIn 1789, at-large popular vote, the winner-take-all method, began with Pennsylvania and Maryland; Virginia and Delaware used a district plan by popular vote, and in the five other states participating in the election (Connecticut, Georgia, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Carolina),<ref>{{cite web|title=1788 Election For the First Term, 1789\u20131793|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/votes/1789_1821.html#1788|website=U.

Beginning with the first census, Electoral College votes repeatedly eclipsed the electoral basis supporting slave-power in the choice of the U.S. president.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130103115308/http://history.house.gov/Institution/Apportionment/Apportionment/ Apportionment by State (PDF)], House of Representatives, History, Art & Archives, viewed January 27, 2019. Unlike the votes taken in the Electoral College, from 1803 to 1846, the U.S. Senate sustained parity between free-soil and slave-holding states. But subsequently, an unbroken chain of free-soil states, including Iowa, Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Oregon and Kansas, were admitted before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].</ref>\n\nAt the Constitution, the Electoral College was authorized a majority of 49 votes for northern states in the process of abolishing slavery, and 42 votes for slave-holding states (including Delaware). In the event, the first 1788 presidential election did not include Electoral College votes for unratified Rhode Island (3) and North Carolina (7), nor for New York (8) which reported too late; the Northern majority was 38 to 35.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript U.S. Constitution Transcript], held at the U.S. National Archives, viewed online on February 5, 2019.</ref> Then for the first two decades of census apportionment in the Electoral College, in 1790 and in 1800, the Three-fifths clause awarded free-soil Northern states narrow majorities of 8% and 11% as the Southern states in [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Convention]] had given up two-fifths of their slave population in their federal apportionment compromise.

Electors meet in their respective [[List of capitals in the United States#State capitals|state capitals]] (electors for the District of Columbia meet within the District) on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, at which time they cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for president and vice president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment12/|title=Twelfth Amendment|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment23/|title=Twenty-third Amendment|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/3/1/7|title=U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;7 : US Code \u2013 Section 7: Meeting and vote of electors|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough procedures in each state vary slightly, the electors generally follow a similar series of steps, and the Congress has constitutional authority to regulate the procedures the states follow. The meeting is opened by the election certification official \u2013 often that state's [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]] or equivalent \u2014 who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches at this point in the proceedings.\n\nWhen the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two people to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. Ballot formats vary between the states: in [[New Jersey]] for example, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in [[North Carolina]], the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.\n\nEach state's electors must complete six Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must be signed by all of the electors and a Certificate of Ascertainment must be attached to each of the Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must include the names of those who received an electoral vote for either the office of president or of vice president. The electors certify the Certificates of Vote and copies of the Certificates are then sent in the following fashion:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|title=U.S. Electoral College \u2013 For State Officials|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053914/http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* One is sent by [[registered mail]] to the [[President of the Senate]] (who usually is the incumbent [[vice president of the United States]]);\n* Two are sent by registered mail to the [[Archivist of the United States]];\n* Two are sent to the state's Secretary of State; and\n* One is sent to the chief judge of the [[United States district court]] where those electors met.\n\nA staff member of the President of the Senate collects the Certificates of Vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress.

Altogether, 23,529 electors have taken part in the Electoral College as of the 2016 election; only 165 electors have cast votes for someone other than their party's nominee. Of that group, 71 did so because the nominee had died{{snd}}63 Democratic Party electors in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], when presidential nominee [[Horace Greeley]] died; and eight Republican Party electors in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]], when vice presidential nominee [[James S.

As a result, Adams attained 71 electoral votes, Jefferson received 68, and Pinckney received 59, meaning Jefferson, rather than Pinckney, became vice president.<ref>Chernow, Ron. Alexander Hamilton. New York: Penguin, 2004. p. 514.</ref> \n* In the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 election]], Virginia's 23 electors, who were pledged to [[Richard Mentor Johnson]], voted instead for former U.S. Senator [[William Smith (South Carolina senator)|William Smith]], which left Johnson one vote short of the majority needed to be elected.

Blair]]'', {{ussc|343|214|1952}}. The Court ruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning candidate, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge. As stated in the ruling, electors are acting as a functionary of the state, not the federal government. Therefore, states have the right to govern the process of choosing electors. The constitutionality of state laws punishing electors for actually casting a faithless vote, rather than refusing to pledge, has never been decided by the Supreme Court. However, in his dissent in ''Ray v. Blair'', Justice [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]] wrote: \"no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text \u2014 that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.\"\n\n=== Joint session of Congress ===\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uiAex46pVw A joint session of Congress confirms the 2016 electoral college results], YouTube video.

The vice president and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] sit at the podium, with the vice president in the seat of the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the certificate of vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.\n\nMembers of Congress can object to any state's vote count, provided objection is presented in writing and is signed by at least one member of each house of Congress. An objection supported by at least one senator and one representative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of Congress; after both Houses deliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed. \n\nA state's certificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection, meaning the votes from the State in question are not counted. Individual votes can also be rejected, and are also not counted. \n\nIn [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]], all of the votes from Louisiana and Tennessee were rejected, and in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], all of the votes from Arkansas and Louisiana plus three of the eleven electoral votes  from Georgia were rejected. <ref>{{cite book|author=David A.

Bush of Texas and the vice president of the United States, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by only several representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object. Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections, and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. \n\nIf there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.\n\nAfter the certificates from all states are read and the respective votes are counted, the presiding officer simply announces the final result of the vote and, provided the required absolute majority of votes was achieved, declares the names of the persons elected president and vice president. This announcement concludes the joint session and formalizes the recognition of the president-elect and of the vice president-elect. The senators then depart from the House Chamber. The final tally is printed in the Senate and House journals.\n\n=== Contingencies ===\n{{further|Contingent election}}\n\n==== Contingent presidential election by House ====\nThe [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] requires the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to go into session immediately to vote for a president if no candidate for president receives a majority of the electoral votes (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes).\n\nIn this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes for president. Each state delegation votes ''en bloc'' \u2014 each delegation having a single vote; the District of Columbia does not get to vote. A candidate must receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., at present, a minimum of 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become the ''president-elect''. Additionally, delegations from at least two thirds of all the states must be present for voting to take place. The House continues balloting until it elects a president.\n\nThe House of Representatives has chosen the president only twice: in [[1800 United States presidential election|1801]] under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3; and in [[1824 United States presidential election|1825]] under the Twelfth Amendment.\n\n==== Contingent vice presidential election by Senate ====\nIf no candidate for vice president receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, then the [[United States Senate|Senate]] must go into session to elect a vice president. The Senate is limited to choosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less than the number of candidates available in the House vote. However, the text is written in such a way that ''all'' candidates with the most and second most electoral votes are eligible for the Senate election \u2013 this number could theoretically be larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e., ballots are individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations). However, two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.\n\nAdditionally, the Twelfth Amendment states a \"majority of the whole number\" of senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm#_1_8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231654/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm|archivedate=June 28, 2011|title=RL30804: The Electoral College: An Overview and Analysis of Reform Proposals, L.

Section{{nbsp}}3 also specifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the inauguration. Under the [[Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1947|Presidential Succession Act of 1947]], the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president.

The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]] in 1932. [[Alabama]] was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot.\n\nThe question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the legislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In ''[[McPherson v. Blacker]]'', {{ussc|146|1|1892}}, the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause{{nbsp}}2 which states that a state's electors are selected \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct\" and wrote these words \"operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power\". In ''Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board'', {{ussc|531|70|2000}}, a Florida Supreme Court decision was vacated (not reversed) based on ''McPherson''. On the other hand, three dissenting justices in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', {{ussc|531|98|2000}}, wrote: \"[N]othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it.\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZD.html ''Bush v.

As noted above, the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences: [[bicameral]] legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate. This is precisely what happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John L.|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|edition=2nd|publisher=Congressional Quarterly, Inc.|place=Washington, D.C.|year=1985|page=254|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to [[gerrymandering]].\n\n=== Proportional vote ===\nUnder such a system, electors would be selected in proportion to the votes cast for their candidate or party, rather than being selected by the statewide plurality vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fairvote.org/e_college/reform.htm#proportional|title=FairVote|publisher=FairVote|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref> \n\n=== Congressional district method ===\nThere are two versions of the congressional district method: one has been implemented in Maine and Nebraska; another has been proposed in Virginia.\nUnder the implemented congressional district method, the electoral votes go to the winner of a plurality of the popular vote winner within each of the states' [[congressional district]]s; the statewide popular vote winner receives two additional electoral votes. While this method may result in a more proportional allocation of electors, this is not necessarily the case. For example, in 1992, [[George H. W. Bush]] won all five of Nebraska's electoral votes with 47% of the vote; in a proportional system, he would have received three and [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] each would have received one. <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903145758/http://www1.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archivedate=September 3, 2006|title=Fiddling with the Rules|website=Franklin & Marshall College|date=March 9, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a different version of the congressional district method was proposed in Virginia. This version would distribute Virginia's electoral votes based on the popular vote winner within each of Virginia's congressional districts; the two statewide electoral votes would be awarded based on which candidate won the most congressional districts, rather than on who won Virginia's statewide popular vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-in-virginia-other-states-seeking-electoral-college-changes/2013/01/24/430096e6-6654-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|title=Republicans in Virginia, other states seeking electoral college changes|newspaper=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=January 24, 2013|first1=Nia-Malika|last1=Henderson|first2=Errin|last2=Haines|date=January 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe congressional district method can more easily be implemented than other alternatives to the winner-takes-all method, in view of major party resistance to relatively enabling third parties under the proportional method.

Conversely, the institutional structure of a national popular vote system would encourage candidates to pursue voter turnout wherever votes could be found, even in \"safe\" states they are already expected to win, and in \"safe\" states they have no hope of winning.\n\n==== Exclusive focus on large swing states ====\n{{main|Swing state}}\n[[File:2004CampaignAttention (edit).png|right|thumb|upright=1.35|<span>These maps show the amount of attention given to each state by the [[George W.

Populous states in which pre-election poll results show no clear favorite are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers, and debates, while \"four out of five\" voters in the national election are \"absolutely ignored\", according to one assessment.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-end-electoral-college/|title=It's Time to End the Electoral College: Here's how.|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Since most states use a [[Plurality voting system|winner-takes-all]] arrangement in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state's electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few key undecided states; in recent elections, these states have included [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], and [[Florida]] in 2004 and 2008, and included [[Colorado]] in 2012. In contrast, states with large populations such as [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], have in recent elections been considered \"safe\" for a particular party \u2014 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] for California and New York and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for Texas \u2014 and therefore campaigns spend less time and money there. Many small states are also considered to be \"safe\" for one of the two political parties and are also generally ignored by campaigners: of the 13 smallest states, six are reliably Democratic, six are reliably Republican, and only New Hampshire is considered as a swing state, according to critic [[George C.

The differences in turnout between swing states and non-swing states under the current electoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==== Obscuring disenfranchisement within states ====\nAccording to this criticism, the electoral college reduces elections to a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any voting problems ''within'' a particular state. For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by [[voter suppression]] methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchising]] specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement has no effect on the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend the electoral college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.\n\nLegal scholars [[Akhil Reed Amar|Akhil Amar]] and [[Vikram Amar]] have argued that the original Electoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled Southern states to disenfranchise their slave populations.<ref name=\"amar\">{{Cite journal|last=Amar|first=Akhil|last2=Amar|first2=Vikram|title=The Electoral College Votes Against Equality|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 2004|url=http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415144403/http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality|archivedate=2010-04-15}}</ref> It permitted Southern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while allowing these states to maintain political clout within the federation by using the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].

The system also allows each state the freedom, within constitutional bounds, to design its own laws on voting and enfranchisement without an undue incentive to maximize the number of votes cast.\n\nFor many years early in the nation's history, up until the [[Jacksonian Era]], many states appointed their electors by a vote of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of the president must still come down to the decisions of each state, or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive, centralized government.<ref name=\"FEC\">{{cite web|author=Kimberling, William C.|title=The Electoral College|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|url=http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf|date=May 1992|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]'', Professor [[Larry Sabato]] elaborated on this advantage of the Electoral College, arguing to \"mend it, don't end it,\" in part because of its usefulness in forcing candidates to pay attention to lightly populated states and reinforcing the role of the state in federalism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sabato|first=Larry|title=A More Perfect Constitution|publisher=Walker Publishing Company|year=2007|edition=First U.S.|isbn=978-0-8027-1621-7|url=https://archive.org/details/moreperfectconst00saba|accessdate=July 30, 2009|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

This encourages candidates to court a wide variety of such minorities and [[advocacy group]]s.<ref name=\"FEC\" />\n\n==== Encouragement of stability through the two-party system ====\n{{main|Two party system}}\n\nProponents of the Electoral College see its negative effect on [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] as beneficial. They argue that the two party system has provided stability because it encourages a delayed adjustment during times of rapid political and cultural change. They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their views to win broad, long-term support across the nation. Advocates of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote elections. Of 918 elections for governor between 1948 and 2009, for example, more than 90% were won by candidates securing more than 50% of the vote, and none have been won with less than 35% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.fairvote.org/majority-and-plurality-in-u-s-gubernatorial-elections Majority and Plurality in U.S. Gubernatorial Elections].

Advocates of the current system argue that human electors would be in a better position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public. According to this view, electors could act decisively during the critical time interval between when ballot choices become fixed in state ballots<ref>Note: this may be a few days or even weeks before an election; many states cannot change ballots at a late stage.</ref> until mid-December when the electors formally cast their ballots.<ref>Note: the day when the electors cast their votes is the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.</ref> In the [[1872 United States presidential election|election of 1872]], losing [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] candidate [[Horace Greeley]] died during this time interval, which resulted in disarray for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], who also supported Greeley, but the Greeley electors were able to split their votes for different alternate candidates.<ref>Note: three electoral votes were still cast for Greeley despite being dead.</ref><ref name=\"tws2H11\">{{cite news|author=Ethan Trex|title=Electoral College for dummies|publisher=CNN|quote=...{{nbsp}}In 1872, though, Democrat Horace Greeley died just over three weeks after Ulysses S.

With this system, the pair of candidates who had received the highest number of votes would win the presidency and vice presidency provided they won at least 40% of the national popular vote. If no pair received 40% of the popular vote, a runoff election would be held in which the choice of president and vice president would be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest number of votes in the first election.

The letter read in part:{{quote|My fourth recommendation is that the Congress adopt a Constitutional amendment to provide for direct popular election of the President. Such an amendment, which would abolish the Electoral College, will ensure that the candidate chosen by the voters actually becomes President. Under the Electoral College, it is always possible that the winner of the popular vote will not be elected. This has already happened in three elections, 1824, 1876, and 1888. In the last election, the result could have been changed by a small shift of votes in Ohio and Hawaii, despite a popular vote difference of 1.7 million. I do not recommend a Constitutional amendment lightly. I think the amendment process must be reserved for an issue of overriding governmental significance. But the method by which we elect our President is such an issue. I will not be proposing a specific direct election amendment.
