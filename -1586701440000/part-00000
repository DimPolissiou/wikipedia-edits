Air operations off [[Okinawa]] were followed by maneuvers with naval units from [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]]. A special weapons warfare exercise and a patrol along the southern seaboard of Japan followed. During this deployment, ''Ranger'' launched more than 7,000 sorties.\n\nAfter the war, division aircraft carriers were involved in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} flew the flag of Commander Carrier Division 2 in 1963. Rear Admiral Bernard M. Strean, as division commander, led ''Enterprise'', ''Long Beach'', and ''Bainbridge'' around the world in [[Operation Sea Orbit]] from July to October 1964. 'Sea Orbit' was a successful test of the first all-nuclear-powered task force. On 25 September 1965, [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[J. O. Cobb]] broke his flag as Commander, Carrier Division 2, aboard {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}. The division was re-designated as Commander Carrier Group 2 (ComCarGru 2) in 1973.\n\nIn 1986, while commanding Carrier Group Two, Rear Admiral Jerry C. Breast commanded the {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|2}} carrier battle group and Task Group 60.1 of the [[U.S. Sixth Fleet]] during a series of naval maneuvers code-named [[Action in the Gulf of Sidra (1986)|Attain Document]].  These naval maneuvers were intended to assert the [[freedom of navigation]] in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] as well as to challenge the [[Gulf of Sidra#Cold war period|territorial claims]] of [[Libya]] to that body of water.  Subsequently, the ''Coral Sea'' carrier battle group and the rest of [[Task Force 60]] carried out [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]], a series of punitive air-strikes against Libya in retaliations to the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events: Vol. II, 1946\u20132006 |authorlink=Norman Polmar|last= Polmar |first= Norman |year= 2008 |publisher= Potomac Books, Inc. |location= [[Dulles, Virginia]] |isbn= 978-157488-665-8 |pages= 369\u2013374 |url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=69770 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= El Dorado Canyon: Reagan's Undeclared War With Qaddafi |last= Stanik |first= Joseph T. |year= 2003 |publisher= [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location= [[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn= 978-155750-983-3 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/eldoradocanyonre00stan/page/120 120, 123\u2013140, 202\u2013205] |url= https://archive.org/details/eldoradocanyonre00stan/page/120 |url-access= registration }}</ref>\n\nOn 15 August 1990, the group staff embarked in {{USS|John F.

The battle group deployed for [[Operation Desert Storm]] only five days after notification, even though she had dispersed her air wing throughout the continental United States for training and just off-loaded stores and material in preparation for a routine yard period. Rear Admiral Riley Mixson, Commander, Carrier Group Two, acted as Commander, Battle Force Yankee of [[Naval Forces Central Command]] during the war. Battle Force Yankee included ''Saratoga'' and probably ''John F. Kennedy,'' and operated in the [[Red Sea]].\n\nIn the middle of 1992, the U.S. Navy instituted a concept which mandated greater task group integration of naval air and surface warfare assets into a more permanent carrier battle group structure. Instead of routinely changing the cruisers, destroyers, and frigates assigned to each carrier battle group, there was an attempt made to affiliate certain escorts more permanently with the carriers they escorted. Each of the Navy's 12 existing carrier battle groups was planned to consist of an aircraft carrier; an embarked carrier air wing; cruiser, destroyer, and frigate units; and two nuclear-powered attack submarines.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Naval Institute Guide to The Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, 15th ed. |authorlink=Norman Polmar|last= Polmar |first= Norman |year= 1993 |publisher= [[U.S. Naval Institute]] Press |location= Annapolis, Maryland |isbn= 1-55750-675-2 |pages= 32, 36 (Table 6-5), 376 |url= }}</ref> For details regarding this re-alignments as it pertained to Carrier Group Two, see the chart below.<ref name=PolmarUSFleet1993>{{cite book |title= The Naval Institute Guide to The Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, 15th ed. |authorlink=Norman Polmar|last= Polmar |first= Norman |year= 1993 |publisher= [[U.S. Naval Institute]] Press |location= [[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn= 1-55750-675-2 |pages= 36 (Table 6-5), 375, 377\u2013381, 383, 386 |url= }}</ref>\n\n;Carrier Group Two, late 1992<ref name=PolmarUSFleet1993/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=99%\n! colspan=\"1\" width=\"20%\" align=\"center\" | Cruisers/Submarines\n! colspan=\"1\" width=\"0%\" align=\"center\" | \n! colspan=\"2\" width=\"35%\" align=\"center\" | [[Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic|Destroyer Squadron 20]]\n! colspan=\"1\" width=\"0%\" align=\"center\" | \n! colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[Carrier Air Wing 3]] squadrons embarked aboard {{USS|John F.

Air operations off [[Okinawa]] were followed by maneuvers with naval units from [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]]. A special weapons warfare exercise and a patrol along the southern seaboard of Japan followed. During this deployment, ''Ranger'' launched more than 7,000 sorties.\n\nAfter the war, division aircraft carriers were involved in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} flew the flag of Commander Carrier Division 2 in 1963. Rear Admiral Bernard M. Strean, as division commander, led ''Enterprise'', ''Long Beach'', and ''Bainbridge'' around the world in [[Operation Sea Orbit]] from July to October 1964. 'Sea Orbit' was a successful test of the first all-nuclear-powered task force. On 25 September 1965, [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[J. O. Cobb]] broke his flag as Commander, Carrier Division 2, aboard {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}. The division was re-designated as Commander Carrier Group 2 (ComCarGru 2) in 1973.\n\nIn 1986, while commanding Carrier Group Two, Rear Admiral Jerry C. Breast commanded the {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|2}} carrier battle group and Task Group 60.1 of the [[U.S. Sixth Fleet]] during a series of naval maneuvers code-named [[Action in the Gulf of Sidra (1986)|Attain Document]].  These naval maneuvers were intended to assert the [[freedom of navigation]] in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] as well as to challenge the [[Gulf of Sidra#Cold war period|territorial claims]] of [[Libya]] to that body of water.  Subsequently, the ''Coral Sea'' carrier battle group and the rest of [[Task Force 60]] carried out [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]], a series of punitive air-strikes against Libya in retaliations to the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events: Vol. II, 1946\u20132006 |authorlink=Norman Polmar|last= Polmar |first= Norman |year= 2008 |publisher= Potomac Books, Inc. |location= [[Dulles, Virginia]] |isbn= 978-157488-665-8 |pages= 369\u2013374 |url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=69770 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= El Dorado Canyon: Reagan's Undeclared War With Qaddafi |last= Stanik |first= Joseph T. |year= 2003 |publisher= [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location= [[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn= 978-155750-983-3 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/eldoradocanyonre00stan/page/120 120, 123\u2013140, 202\u2013205] |url= https://archive.org/details/eldoradocanyonre00stan/page/120 |url-access= registration }}</ref>\n\nOn 15 August 1990, the group staff embarked in {{USS|John F.

The battle group deployed for [[Operation Desert Storm]] only five days after notification, even though she had dispersed her air wing throughout the continental United States for training and just off-loaded stores and material in preparation for a routine yard period. Rear Admiral Riley Mixson, Commander, Carrier Group Two, acted as Commander, Battle Force Yankee of [[Naval Forces Central Command]] during the war. Battle Force Yankee included ''Saratoga'' and probably ''John F. Kennedy,'' and operated in the [[Red Sea]].\n\nIn the middle of 1992, the U.S. Navy instituted a concept which mandated greater task group integration of naval air and surface warfare assets into a more permanent carrier battle group structure. Instead of routinely changing the cruisers, destroyers, and frigates assigned to each carrier battle group, there was an attempt made to affiliate certain escorts more permanently with the carriers they escorted. Each of the Navy's 12 existing carrier battle groups was planned to consist of an aircraft carrier; an embarked carrier air wing; cruiser, destroyer, and frigate units; and two nuclear-powered attack submarines.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Naval Institute Guide to The Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, 15th ed. |authorlink=Norman Polmar|last= Polmar |first= Norman |year= 1993 |publisher= [[U.S. Naval Institute]] Press |location= Annapolis, Maryland |isbn= 1-55750-675-2 |pages= 32, 36 (Table 6-5), 376 |url= }}</ref> For details regarding this re-alignments as it pertained to Carrier Group Two, see the chart below.<ref name=PolmarUSFleet1993>{{cite book |title= The Naval Institute Guide to The Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, 15th ed. |authorlink=Norman Polmar|last= Polmar |first= Norman |year= 1993 |publisher= [[U.S. Naval Institute]] Press |location= [[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn= 1-55750-675-2 |pages= 36 (Table 6-5), 375, 377\u2013381, 383, 386 |url= }}</ref>\n\n;Carrier Group Two, late 1992<ref name=PolmarUSFleet1993/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=99%\n! colspan=\"1\" width=\"20%\" align=\"center\" | Cruisers/Submarines\n! colspan=\"1\" width=\"0%\" align=\"center\" | \n! colspan=\"2\" width=\"35%\" align=\"center\" | [[Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic|Destroyer Squadron 20]]\n! colspan=\"1\" width=\"0%\" align=\"center\" | \n! colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[Carrier Air Wing 3]] squadrons embarked aboard {{USS|John F.

In general, the British heavily relied on American colonial militia units, while the French heavily relied on their First Nation allies. The Iroquois Nation were important allies of the British.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thomas Morgan |first1=William |year=1926 |title=The Five Nations and Queen Anne |journal=Mississippi Valley Historical Review |volume=13 |issue=2|pages=169\u2013189 |doi=10.2307/1891955 |jstor=1891955}}</ref> Much of the fighting involved ambushes and small-scale warfare in the villages along the border between New England and Quebec. The New England colonies had a much larger population than Quebec, so major invasions came from south to north. The First Nation allies, only loosely controlled by the French, repeatedly raided New England villages to kidnap women and children, and torture and kill the men.<ref>June Namias, ''White Captives: Gender and Ethnicity on the American Frontier'' (1993)</ref> Those who survived were brought up as Francophone Catholics. The tension along the border was exacerbated by religion, the French Catholics and English Protestants had a deep mutual distrust.<ref>Howard H. Peckham, ''The Colonial Wars'' (1965)</ref> There was a naval dimension as well, involving privateers attacking enemy merchant ships.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chard |first1=Donald F. |year=1975 |title=The Impact of French Privateering on New England, 1689\u20131713 |journal=American Neptune |volume=35 |issue=3|pages=153\u2013165}}</ref>\n\nEngland seized Quebec from 1629 to 1632, and Acadia in 1613 and again from 1654 to 1670; These territories were returned to France by the peace treaties. The major wars were (to use American names), [[King William's War]] (1689\u20131697); [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702\u20131713); [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1755\u20131763). In Canada, as in Europe, this era is known as the Seven Years' War.\n\nNew England soldiers and sailors were critical to the successful British campaign to capture the French fortress of Louisbourg in 1745,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shortt |first1=S.

Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940)</ref>\n\nNew England [[Yankee]]s settled large parts of [[Nova Scotia]] before 1775, and were neutral during the [[American Revolution]].<ref>John Brebner, ''The Neutral Yankees of Nova Scotia: A Marginal Colony During the Revolutionary Years'' (1937)</ref> At the end of the Revolution, about 75,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] moved out of the new United States to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the lands of Quebec, east and south of Montreal. From 1790 to 1812 many farmers moved from New York and New England into Ontario (mostly to Niagara, and the north shore of Lake Ontario). In the mid and late 19th century gold rushes attracted American prospectors, mostly to British Columbia after the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]], and later to the Yukon. In the early 20th century, the opening of land blocks in the Prairie Provinces attracted many farmers from the American Midwest. Many Mennonites immigrated from Pennsylvania and formed their own colonies. In the 1890s some Mormons went north to form communities in Alberta after [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] rejected plural marriage.<ref>Marcus Lee Hansen, ''The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples. Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940); David D. Harvey, ''Americans in Canada: Migration and Settlement since 1840'' (1991)</ref> The 1960s saw the arrival of about 50,000 draft-dodgers who opposed the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Renee Kasinsky, \"Refugees from Militarism: Draft Age Americans in Canada'' (1976)</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, about 900,000 French Canadians moved to the U.S., with 395,000 residents there in 1900. Two-thirds went to mill towns in New England, where they formed distinctive ethnic communities. By the late 20th century, they had abandoned the French language, but most kept the Catholic religion.<ref>Yves Roby, ''The Franco-Americans of New England'' (2004); Elliott Robert Barkan, \"French Canadians\" in Stephan Thernstrom, ed.

Brookes, \"Canadians, British\" in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) pp 191ff.</ref>\n\nCanada was a way-station through which immigrants from other lands stopped for a while, ultimately heading to the U.S. In 1851\u20131951, 7.1 million people arrived in Canada (mostly from Continental Europe), and 6.6 million left Canada, most of them to the U.S.<ref>Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) p 392.</ref>\n\n===American Revolutionary War===\n[[File:The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec December 31 1775.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec, December 31, 1775]]'', by [[John Trumbull]], depicting the failed American [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)]].]]\n\nAt the outset of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American revolutionaries]] hoped the [[French Canadians]] in Quebec and the Colonists in [[Nova Scotia]] would join their rebellion and they were pre-approved for joining the United States in the [[Articles of Confederation]]. When [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Canada was invaded]], thousands joined the American cause and formed regiments that fought during the war; however most remained neutral and some joined the British effort. Britain advised the French Canadians that the British Empire already enshrined their rights in the [[Quebec Act]], which the American colonies had viewed as one of the [[Intolerable Acts]]. The American invasion was a fiasco and Britain tightened its grip on its northern possessions; in 1777, a major British invasion into New York led to the surrender of the entire British army at Saratoga, and led France to enter the war as an ally of the U.S. The French Canadians largely ignored France's appeals for solidarity.<ref>Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians, 1760\u20131945'' (1955) p. 74.</ref> After the war Canada became a refuge for about 75,000 [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] who either wanted to leave the U.S., or were compelled by Patriot reprisals to do so.<ref>Thomas B. Allen, ''Tories: Fighting for the King in America's First Civil War'' (2010) p xviii</ref>\n\nAmong the original Loyalists there were 3,500 free African Americans. Most went to Nova Scotia and in 1792, 1200 migrated to [[Sierra Leone]]. About 2000 black slaves were brought in by Loyalist owners; they remained slaves in Canada until the Empire abolished slavery in 1833. Before 1860, about 30,000\u201340,000 black people entered Canada; many were already free and others were escaped slaves who came through the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>Patrick Bode, \"Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves,\" ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17\u201319; Paul Robert Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples'' (1999) p 142\u20133</ref>\n\n===War of 1812===\n{{main|War of 1812}}\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the war, called for British forces to vacate all their forts south of the [[Great Lakes]] border. Britain refused to do so, citing failure of the United States to provide financial restitution for Loyalists who had lost property in the war. The [[Jay Treaty]] in 1795 with Great Britain resolved that lingering issue and the British departed the forts. [[Thomas Jefferson]] saw the nearby British presence as a threat to the [[United States]], and so he opposed the [[Jay Treaty]], and it became one of the major political issues in the United States at the time.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''The First Rapprochement: England and the United States, 1795\u20131805'' (1955)</ref> Thousands of Americans immigrated to Upper Canada (Ontario) from 1785 to 1812 to obtain cheaper land and better tax rates prevalent in that province; despite expectations that they would be loyal to the U.S. if a war broke out, in the event they were largely non-political.<ref>{{cite book|first=George A.|last=Rawlyk|title=The Canada Fire: Radical Evangelicalism in British North America, 1775\u20131812|url=https://archive.org/details/canadafire0000unse|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/canadafire0000unse/page/122 122]|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9780773512214}}</ref>\n\nTensions mounted again after 1805, erupting into the [[War of 1812]], when the United States declared war on Britain. The Americans were angered by British harassment of U.S. ships on the high seas and [[Impressment|seizure of 6,000 sailors from American ships]], severe restrictions against neutral American trade with France, and British support for hostile Indian tribes in Ohio and territories the U.S. had gained in 1783. American \"honor\" was an implicit issue. While the Americans could not hope to defeat the [[Royal Navy]] and control the seas, they could call on an army much larger than the British garrison in Canada, and so a land invasion of Canada was proposed as the most advantageous means of attacking the British Empire. Americans on the western frontier also hoped an invasion would bring an end to British support of [[American Indians in the United States|Native American]] resistance to [[Westward expansion of the United States|American expansion]], typified by [[Tecumseh]]'s coalition of tribes.<ref>Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, & Indian Allies'' (2010).</ref> Americans may also have wanted to acquire Canada.{{sfn|Stagg|2012|pp=5\u20136}}<ref>George F.

There was some hope that settlers in western Canada\u2014most of them recent immigrants from the U.S.\u2014would welcome the chance to overthrow their British rulers. However, the American invasions were defeated primarily by British regulars with support from Native Americans and [[Upper Canada]] militia. Aided by the large Royal Navy, a series of British raids on the American coast were highly successful, culminating with an [[Burning of Washington|attack on Washington]] that resulted in the British burning of the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|the Capitol]], and other public buildings. However, the later battles of [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]], [[Battle of Plattsburg|Plattsburg]], and [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] all ended in defeat for the British. At the end of the war, Britain's American Indian allies had largely been defeated, and the Americans controlled a strip of Western Ontario centered on [[Amherstburg|Fort Malden]]. However, Britain held much of Maine, and, with the support of their remaining American Indian allies, huge areas of the Old Northwest, including [[Wisconsin]] and much of [[Michigan]] and [[Illinois]]. With the surrender of Napoleon in 1814, Britain ended naval policies that angered Americans; with the defeat of the Indian tribes the threat to American expansion was ended. The upshot was both the United States and Canada asserted their sovereignty, Canada remained under British rule, and London and Washington had nothing more to fight over. The war was ended by the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which took effect in February 1815.<ref>Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2007) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] perspective.</ref> A series of postwar agreements further stabilized peaceful relations along the Canadian-US border.

The myth that the Canadian militia had defeated the invasion almost single-handed, known logically as the \"militia myth\", became highly prevalent after the war, having been propounded by [[John Strachan]], [[Toronto|Anglican Bishop of York]]. Meanwhile, the United States celebrated victory in its \"Second War of Independence,\" and war heroes such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] headed to the White House.<ref>A.J.

A small interlocking elite, known as the [[Family Compact]] took full political control. Democracy, as practiced in the US, was ridiculed. The policies had the desired effect of deterring immigration from United States. [[Rebellions of 1837|Revolts in favor of democracy]] in Ontario and Quebec (\"Lower Canada\") in 1837 were suppressed; many of the leaders fled to the US.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dunning | first1 = Tom | year = 2009 | title = The Canadian Rebellions of 1837 and 1838 as a Borderland War: A Retrospective | url = | journal = Ontario History | volume = 101 | issue = 2| pages = 129\u2013141 | doi = 10.7202/1065615ar }}</ref> The American policy was to largely ignore the rebellions,<ref>Orrin Edward Tiffany, ''The Relations of the United States to the Canadian Rebellion of 1837\u20131838'' (1905).

Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] with Russia in 1867, he intended it as the first step in a comprehensive plan to gain control of the entire northwest Pacific Coast. Seward was a firm believer in [[Manifest Destiny]], primarily for its commercial advantages to the U.S. Seward expected [[British Columbia]] to seek annexation to the U.S. and thought Britain might accept this in exchange for the ''Alabama'' claims. Soon other elements endorsed annexation, Their plan was to annex [[British Columbia]], [[Red River Colony]] (Manitoba), and [[Nova Scotia]], in exchange for the dropping the damage claims. The idea reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1870, with American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and Pro-American Englishmen seemingly combining forces. The plan was dropped for multiple reasons. London continued to stall, American commercial and financial groups pressed Washington for a quick settlement of the dispute on a cash basis, growing Canadian nationalist sentiment in British Columbia called for staying inside the British Empire, Congress became preoccupied with Reconstruction, and most Americans showed little interest in territorial expansion. The \"[[Alabama Claims]]\" dispute went to international arbitration. In one of the first major cases of arbitration, the tribunal in 1872 supported the American claims and ordered Britain to pay $15.5 million. Britain paid and the episode ended in peaceful relations.<ref>Doris W.

Prior to Confederation, there was an [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in which the Americans claimed the 54th degree latitude. That issue was resolved by splitting the disputed territory; the northern half became British Columbia, and the southern half the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. Strained relations with America continued, however, due to a series of small-scale armed incursions named the [[Fenian raids]] by [[Irish American|Irish-American]] Civil War veterans across the border from 1866 to 1871 in an attempt to trade Canada for Irish independence.<ref>{{cite book|first=Yossi|last=Shain|title=Marketing the American Creed Abroad: Diasporas in the U.S. and Their Homelands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pqj8GFCg7MC&pg=PA53|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=53|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9780521642255}}</ref> The American government, angry at Canadian tolerance of Confederate raiders during the American Civil War, moved very slowly to disarm the [[Fenians]].

Much of the tension was relieved as the Fenians faded away and in 1872 by the settlement of the [[Alabama Claims]], when Britain paid the U.S. $15.5 million for war losses caused by warships built in Britain and sold to the Confederacy.\n\nDisputes over ocean boundaries on [[Georges Bank]] and over fishing, whaling, and sealing rights in the Pacific were settled by international arbitration, setting an important precedent.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Kurlansky|title=Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World|url=https://archive.org/details/cod00mark|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|page=[https://archive.org/details/cod00mark/page/117 117]|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9781440672873}}</ref>\n\n===Emigration to and from the United States of America===\n{{Further|French American}}\nAfter 1850, the pace of industrialization and urbanization was much faster in the United States, drawing a wide range of immigrants from the North. By 1870, 1/6 of all the people born in Canada had moved to the United States, with the highest concentrations in New England, which was the destination of Francophone emigrants from Quebec and Anglophone emigrants from the Maritimes. It was common for people to move back and forth across the border, such as seasonal lumberjacks, entrepreneurs looking for larger markets, and families looking for jobs in the textile mills that paid much higher wages than in Canada.<ref>John J. Bukowczyk et al. ''Permeable Border: The Great Lakes Region as Transnational Region, 1650\u20131990'' (University of Pittsburgh Press. 2005)</ref>\n\nThe southward migration slacked off after 1890, as Canadian industry began a growth spurt. By then, the American frontier was closing, and thousands of farmers looking for fresh land moved from the United States north into the Prairie Provinces. The net result of the flows were that in 1901 there were 128,000 American-born residents in Canada (3.5% of the Canadian population) and 1.18 million Canadian-born residents in the United States (1.6% of the U.S. population).<ref>J.

The issue was unimportant until a gold rush brought tens of thousands of men to Canada's Yukon, and they had to arrive through American ports. Canada needed its port and claimed that it had a legal right to a port near the present American town of [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], Alaska. It would provide an all-Canadian route to the rich goldfields. The dispute was settled by arbitration, and the British delegate voted with the Americans\u2014to the astonishment and disgust of Canadians who suddenly realized that Britain considered its relations with the United States paramount compared to those with Canada. The arbitration validated the status quo, but made Canada angry at London.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Munro | first1 = John A. | year = 1965 | title = English-Canadianism and the Demand for Canadian Autonomy: Ontario's Response to the Alaska Boundary Decision, 1903 | url = | journal = Ontario History | volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 189\u2013203 }}</ref><ref>David G.

Trudeau proposed a  \"[[Third Option]]\" policy of diversifying Canada's trade and downgrading the importance of the American market.  In a 1972 speech in Ottawa, Nixon declared the \"special relationship\" between Canada and the United States dead.<ref>Bruce Muirhead, \"From Special Relationship to Third Option: Canada, the U.S., and the Nixon Shock,\" ''American Review of Canadian Studies,'' Vol. 34, 2004 [https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5008438189 online edition]</ref>\n\nRelations deteriorated on many points in the Nixon years (1969\u201374), including trade disputes, defense agreements, energy, fishing, the environment, cultural imperialism, and foreign policy. They changed for the better when Trudeau and [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter (1977-1981)]] found a better rapport. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during \"the stagflation\" that hurt both nations.<ref>Lily Gardner Feldman, \"Canada and the United States in the 1970s: Rift and Reconciliation.\" ''The World Today'' 34.12 (1978): 484-492.

In the War of 1812, for example, the enthusiastic response by French militia to defend Lower Canada reflected, according to Heidler and Heidler (2004), \"the fear of Americanization.\"<ref>David Stephen Heidler and Jeanne T.

Granatstein, ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997)</ref>\n\nCanadian intellectuals who wrote about the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century identified America as the world center of modernity, and deplored it. Anti-American Canadians (who admired the British Empire) explained that Canada had narrowly escaped American conquest with its rejection of tradition, its worship of \"progress\" and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and societal harmony. There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as [[F. R. Scott]] and Jean-Charles Harvey (1891\u20131967).<ref>Damien-Claude B\u00e9langer, ''Prejudice and Pride: Canadian Intellectuals Confront the United States, 1891\u20131945'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp 16, 180</ref>\n\nLooking at television, Collins (1990) finds that it is in Anglophone Canada that fear of cultural Americanization is most powerful, for there the attractions of the U.S. are strongest.<ref>Richard Collins, ''Culture, Communication, and National Identity: The Case of Canadian Television'' (U. of Toronto Press, 1990) p. 25</ref> Meren (2009) argues that after 1945, the emergence of Quebec nationalism and the desire to preserve French-Canadian cultural heritage led to growing anxiety regarding American cultural imperialism and Americanization.<ref>David Meren, \"'Plus que jamais n\u00e9cessaires': Cultural Relations, Nationalism and the State in the Canada-Quebec-France Triangle, 1945\u20131960,\" ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association'', 2009, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 279\u2013305,</ref> In 2006 surveys showed that 60 percent of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois had a fear of Americanization, while other surveys showed they preferred their current situation to that of the Americans in the realms of health care, quality of life as seniors, environmental quality, poverty, educational system, racism and standard of living. While agreeing that job opportunities are greater in America, 89 percent disagreed with the notion that they would rather be in the United States, and they were more likely to feel closer to English Canadians than to Americans.<ref name=\"autogenerated114\">Paula Ruth Gilbert, ''Violence and the Female Imagination: Quebec's Women Writers'' (2006) p. 114</ref> However, there is evidence that the elites and Quebec are much less fearful of Americanization, and much more open to economic integration than the general public.<ref name=\"autogenerated114\" />\n\nThe history has been traced in detail by a leading Canadian historian J.L.

Many have stated that the Vietnam war had its own political life back then, and it could swing either way, rapidly and decisively.  And a new President steps in with promises of a great and lasting peace between all nations, mainly Vietnam.\n\nGenerally warm relations existed at this time between Canada and America, and it was good for trade.  Yet animosity reaches an all-time high since World War 2 in the Northern US.\nNotably one hand did not know what the other was doing.  Both countries continue to support war on Vietnam, and had entirely different views on how this would continue, if it should continue, and how it should be handled.  Ford is viewed as a pacifist by Canada, and a hero.  Richard Nixon tries to hold separate office even after the election, and his attempts to fight the state law see two camps briefly in power.  Gerald R. Ford, the owner of Ford Automotives, stated an end to the Vietnam war would happen during his election campaign.  But due to repeated attacks on airbases across eastern America, and group landing and guerilla warfare within North America by the Viet Cong... the war continued.\nIn Canada there was no official support for the war of Vietnam, and this adversely increased military / social / trade / alliance frictions.\n\nWar declared on Canada in early 1975 by USA, yet it does not go widely reported.  Rumours persist of Fascist American Nationalists (aka American Hardliners) involvement within American Military and Intelligence heads.  War declaration seems to be a result of American support for McCarthyism, and not Pres. Gerald R. Fords, official party line.  No support for Annexation was ever true, or popularized in press, or media.  A Hardliner fantasy.  Popular opinion in New York and North Eastern US shifting against Canada perhaps led to this decision.  No official draft bill passes the floor in Canada until 1983.  Little immediate response in US or Canada.  This begins a \"Cold War\" between the US and Canada (automatically this includes the Commonwealth).   A \"Cold War\" was at the time defined as a war that was not in the papers, and often included devastating nuclear battles.  This was a threat used mainly against Communist countries in that era.<ref>Queen Victoria of England's Office circa 1978.</ref>  Strangely this does not affect trade.  Intelligence units go to war, and this increases tensions across the board.  Many police officers are attacked in Canada and the Northern United States in the following years, and very little of this is in the papers.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nNATO operations, and a joint North America Shield continued.<ref>1977 CBC news</ref>  And eventually expanded.  What this meant was in question.  Joint initiatives were seen by Canada as a move in the right direction, as they had little interest in a war with America.  The pacifists in the Land Of The True And Free believed that a war could be averted if it was not fought.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Pierre Trudeau and Jimmy Carter (January 1977 \u2013 June 1979)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\nIn his fourth consecutive term, Pierre Trudeau, a lawyer, intellectual and activist, and his majority Liberal government had lost a lost of face in Western Canada.  Frequent corruption on both sides of the Canada-US border led to confusion, chaos, and indignation by both sides and some name-calling.  In an era when the USA had adopted food stamps in many of its states, among other widely successful state by state adopted programs which kept home owners fed, it had a few flaws.  Food stamps were attacked by critics in the United States, while in Canada many provinces and territories were backing similar programs hard, despite continual corruption, which created a loss of funding by individuals and criminals within the government.  Notably The Honorable Allen Blakeney, current Premiere of Saskatchewan from 1970\u20131980, was criticized openly from his removal of such a program by the British Royal Family, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and others, and this would have included Jimmy Carter, which resulted in the happy resolution of reinstatement of the Saskatchewan Social Welfare program by 1978.  A battle indicitive of the era, and how many Canadians were disillusioned with its leadership and their decisions.\n\nJimmy Carter, an American Navy submarine officer, was not as much of a media messiah, stunning and constantly and in your face as former Presidents Gerald Ford and Richard R. Nixon had been.  But he was popular with Canadians for his highly perceptive political stances, and his logical characteristics.  During his administration, Canada was publicly criticized by many Americans for not entering the American, Australian and French war with Vietnam.  At the same time hippies and the Peace, Love and Happiness anti-war movement were still in style in both countries.  And were a large part of the vote -- if they had heard any of that news they would march and get shot at by radical far right extremists.  In the face of all political debate, quietly thousands of Viet Cong occasionally descended on the West Coast including Vancouver, and the US headed back in.<ref>CBC News</ref><ref>Vancouver Mayor's Office</ref>  Instead of warfare the two heads of state used their time to move away from that.  And it became a period NASA initiatives reached a high point, and the Canadaarm Project was adopted. <ref>NASA https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/behindscenes/rms_anniversary.html</ref>  This device, in its second form is still used today on the National ISS.  The second Avro Arrow project was canceled, which was extremely popular in the media.  It was to be a continuation of the CF-100 line (the first Avro Arrow), and was to be an improvement in every way over well-known \"Voodoo\" CF-101 which remained an Air Force mainstay until at least 1987.  This cross-border co operation of epic proportion flew in the face of American hardliners, but also made them proud -- It produced the CF-18, Canada's first stealth fighter bomber by 1980. And also was optioned out as to American Military contractors which was refused by the US Navy at the time, but later spawned many variants.  And all that after continuous US open criticism and attacks on the ground floor.  The Central Intelligence Agency wanted America to remain first and this including attack its infrastructure, in the field of intelligence warfare.  The \"Cold War\" continued ever onward, the objectives remained ever-muddy.\n\nIf the name of the game was co-operation then the Avro Arrow Bs (B for supersonic bomber)<ref>Declassified Royal Canadian Armed Forces Records</ref> success was a big hit with the average American and Canadian.  After a brief co-operative period which combined Canadian, and American technology.  Trade barriers would not have been a barrier in this era of frequent attacks on Canadian citizens by American military, criminal gangs, and other forces from the military standpoint.  But the CF/18 and the Canadaarm along with trade law, and continued trade practice were pivotal in moving widely supported causes for peace forward in that era.  But the Governors, Premieres and Canadian and American heads of state worked on enhancing and stimulating trade by keeping borders fully open, and working out trade agreements.  While the U.S.S.R. threatened global war, it was the time to make friends not enemies.\n\nThere were many months when President Jimmy Carter, a preacher's son, and a harsh critic of Canadian policy, would never speak with P.M. Pierre Trudeau, who had worked closely with intelligence experts for years, and was completely pro-Canadian and pro Ontario.  Those close to them said that the break in their discussions was caused by the tenuous nature of the two countries, and the vitrified fervor that Jimmy Carter had for his country, and that kind of hardliner talk was not always welcomed by Canadian politicians.  By the end of President Carter's term Canadians over the age of 18 would have to show only their driver's license at the border to gain entry into Canada.  Very little was on file, as computers were not up to the task of stopping any criminals or terrorists yet.  Canada chose not to implement this method as it was seen to be faulty.  In a time of frequent border attacks and brutal attacks on border guards, surprisingly Canada did not implement any additional border security outside of Ontario.  While there was much talk in the media about \"The Red Menace\" of the U.S.S.R. and China's leaving Democracy behind...  Hundreds of roads remained unguarded.  The coast guard did not increase in size.  Canada and the USA lost thousands of officers due to these decision<ref>Canadian Intelligence Resources</ref>s, and the growing number of outlaws and war-hungry American dissidents exploded into increasingly frequent outbreaks of cross-border violence. Neither P.M. nor President could stem the tide.\n\n===Joe Clark and Jimmy Carter (June 1979 \u2013 March 1980)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\nClark and Carter are known to have very warm relations. And many private talks.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Joe Clarke gets a softer, warmer and fresh perspective, and Jimmy Carter has the chance start anew, and does not press forward with attacks on First Nations reserves in Canada, and agreements for Canada to allow the American Military, and Espionage forces into Canada.  They do not discuss racially based attacks in public.  And are said to have \"complete and utter disagreement\" about the path forward for the indigenous tribes of the region.<ref>Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News</ref> This is a great set up for what happens next.  Joe Clarke like most Canadians believes in peace with the Vietnam and North Korean alliance.\n\nPublicly war is declared on Canada by Mikhail Gorbachev President of the USSR by late 1980.  After 6 nuclear attacks are averted and constant attacks on the Yukon and Alaska persist and increase by the civilians of both states... neither side to agree that they were at peace.  Project Northern Shield, and The North American Defense Initiative, and allied Air Defense, and Radar and missile initiatives are allowed to co-exist during a state of warfare on both borders.  Because Canada blocks all access to Northern bases by gangs and those not under a Canadian command there are increasing attacks against Canadians who refuse to draft in Western Canada and a minimal draft of 80,000 troop objective to protect... only the city of Toronto and its borders.  Many do not make it to the front due to high levels of enemy infiltration on two borders.  The damage against Canada by the USA peaks at 90,000 war time murders a year.<ref>Canadian Intelligence Resources</ref> This unifies the two states publicly.  Trade surges ahead, the dollar moves from all time lows onward and upward, due to an over-linking of the trade markets with America, that confuses British traders, who eventually bow out, despite 20% a year inflation...  Many British owned businesses are bought out.  Woolco eventually folds in a few years.  Woolworths holds out, but downsizes, and eventually closes in the 1990s.  Major British owned chains in Canada fold.  A void is created, and American and Ontario businesses and factories rush to fill this market.\n\nIn the press the Voodoo project is aided by the American \"Genie Missile\" and air to air low megaton yield missile, tasked with defending the North from Russia.  Both air forces commit to protecting America from bombers, while Canada steps back and gives up territory in a bold move to protect \"the population belt\" of Canada (the 49th parallel).  But adds to its early warning systems by continuing their game of cards with the American public.  \"Duck and Cover\"<ref>\"Duck And Cover\" Canadian Government Federal Video, 1981</ref> and other informational videos and propaganda are used by Canada and America to bolster support for a war on Russia with a Peace-nick friendly Canada.  It is important to note Russia had been firm allies with Canada since their victory in World War 2, a stark contrast to American policy and social agendas.\n\nThe Viet Cong who opened up channels to Canada, and we have a semi-official truce, while we prepare for an ongoing Cold War on our Northern Borders.  P.M. Joe Carter is known to all on his way out as a gunslinger who batted above his belt level.  In his home town in Alberta, they still remember him as \"Dick\" Clarke, and it was the first breakthrough for the West in a very long time.  The next incumbent P.M. was also in for a gunfight if he wanted to hold his seat.\n\n===Pierre Trudeau and Jimmy Carter (March 1980 \u2013 January 1981)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Pierre Trudeau and Ronald Reagan (January 1981 \u2013 June 1984)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\n\n===John Turner and Ronald Reagan (June\u2013September 1984)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Brian Mulroney and Ronald Reagan (September 1984 \u2013 January 1989)===\n[[File:Mulroney and Reagan in Venice 1987.jpg|thumb|right|Ronald Reagan (left) and Brian Mulroney (right) at the Hotel Cipriani in Venice, Italy, June 11, 1987]]\nRelations between [[Brian Mulroney]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were famously close.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The president will see you now : my stories and lessons from Ronald Reagan's final years|last=Grande|first=Peggy|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9780316396455|edition= First|location=New York|pages=|chapter=8: Rawhide's Ranch|oclc=951764632}}</ref> This relationship resulted in negotiations for the [[Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement]], and the [[U.S.\u2013Canada Air Quality Agreement]] to reduce acid-rain-causing emissions, both major policy goals of Mulroney, that would be finalized under the presidency of [[George H.

Canada's assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait ([[international waters]]). Canadians were alarmed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker {{SS|Manhattan|1962|2}} through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker [[USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)|Polar Sea]] in 1985, which actually resulted in a [[1985 Polar Sea controversy|minor diplomatic incident]]. In 1970, the Canadian parliament enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a 100-mile zone. In response, the United States in 1970 stated, \"We cannot accept the assertion of a [[Canadians|Canadian]] claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada. ... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.\" A compromise of sorts was reached in 1988, by an agreement on \"Arctic Cooperation,\" which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers \"will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.\" However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position.

In general, the British heavily relied on American colonial militia units, while the French heavily relied on their First Nation allies. The Iroquois Nation were important allies of the British.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thomas Morgan |first1=William |year=1926 |title=The Five Nations and Queen Anne |journal=Mississippi Valley Historical Review |volume=13 |issue=2|pages=169\u2013189 |doi=10.2307/1891955 |jstor=1891955}}</ref> Much of the fighting involved ambushes and small-scale warfare in the villages along the border between New England and Quebec. The New England colonies had a much larger population than Quebec, so major invasions came from south to north. The First Nation allies, only loosely controlled by the French, repeatedly raided New England villages to kidnap women and children, and torture and kill the men.<ref>June Namias, ''White Captives: Gender and Ethnicity on the American Frontier'' (1993)</ref> Those who survived were brought up as Francophone Catholics. The tension along the border was exacerbated by religion, the French Catholics and English Protestants had a deep mutual distrust.<ref>Howard H. Peckham, ''The Colonial Wars'' (1965)</ref> There was a naval dimension as well, involving privateers attacking enemy merchant ships.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chard |first1=Donald F. |year=1975 |title=The Impact of French Privateering on New England, 1689\u20131713 |journal=American Neptune |volume=35 |issue=3|pages=153\u2013165}}</ref>\n\nEngland seized Quebec from 1629 to 1632, and Acadia in 1613 and again from 1654 to 1670; These territories were returned to France by the peace treaties. The major wars were (to use American names), [[King William's War]] (1689\u20131697); [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702\u20131713); [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1755\u20131763). In Canada, as in Europe, this era is known as the Seven Years' War.\n\nNew England soldiers and sailors were critical to the successful British campaign to capture the French fortress of Louisbourg in 1745,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shortt |first1=S.

Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940)</ref>\n\nNew England [[Yankee]]s settled large parts of [[Nova Scotia]] before 1775, and were neutral during the [[American Revolution]].<ref>John Brebner, ''The Neutral Yankees of Nova Scotia: A Marginal Colony During the Revolutionary Years'' (1937)</ref> At the end of the Revolution, about 75,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] moved out of the new United States to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the lands of Quebec, east and south of Montreal. From 1790 to 1812 many farmers moved from New York and New England into Ontario (mostly to Niagara, and the north shore of Lake Ontario). In the mid and late 19th century gold rushes attracted American prospectors, mostly to British Columbia after the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]], and later to the Yukon. In the early 20th century, the opening of land blocks in the Prairie Provinces attracted many farmers from the American Midwest. Many Mennonites immigrated from Pennsylvania and formed their own colonies. In the 1890s some Mormons went north to form communities in Alberta after [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] rejected plural marriage.<ref>Marcus Lee Hansen, ''The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples. Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940); David D.

Two-thirds went to mill towns in New England, where they formed distinctive ethnic communities. By the late 20th century, they had abandoned the French language, but most kept the Catholic religion.<ref>Yves Roby, ''The Franco-Americans of New England'' (2004); Elliott Robert Barkan, \"French Canadians\" in Stephan Thernstrom, ed.

Brookes, \"Canadians, British\" in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) pp 191ff.</ref>\n\nCanada was a way-station through which immigrants from other lands stopped for a while, ultimately heading to the U.S. In 1851\u20131951, 7.1 million people arrived in Canada (mostly from Continental Europe), and 6.6 million left Canada, most of them to the U.S.<ref>Stephan Thernstrom, ed.

When [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Canada was invaded]], thousands joined the American cause and formed regiments that fought during the war; however most remained neutral and some joined the British effort. Britain advised the French Canadians that the British Empire already enshrined their rights in the [[Quebec Act]], which the American colonies had viewed as one of the [[Intolerable Acts]]. The American invasion was a fiasco and Britain tightened its grip on its northern possessions; in 1777, a major British invasion into New York led to the surrender of the entire British army at Saratoga, and led France to enter the war as an ally of the U.S. The French Canadians largely ignored France's appeals for solidarity.<ref>Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians, 1760\u20131945'' (1955) p. 74.</ref> After the war Canada became a refuge for about 75,000 [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] who either wanted to leave the U.S., or were compelled by Patriot reprisals to do so.<ref>Thomas B. Allen, ''Tories: Fighting for the King in America's First Civil War'' (2010) p xviii</ref>\n\nAmong the original Loyalists there were 3,500 free African Americans. Most went to Nova Scotia and in 1792, 1200 migrated to [[Sierra Leone]]. About 2000 black slaves were brought in by Loyalist owners; they remained slaves in Canada until the Empire abolished slavery in 1833. Before 1860, about 30,000\u201340,000 black people entered Canada; many were already free and others were escaped slaves who came through the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>Patrick Bode, \"Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves,\" ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17\u201319; Paul Robert Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples'' (1999) p 142\u20133</ref>\n\n===War of 1812===\n{{main|War of 1812}}\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the war, called for British forces to vacate all their forts south of the [[Great Lakes]] border. Britain refused to do so, citing failure of the United States to provide financial restitution for Loyalists who had lost property in the war. The [[Jay Treaty]] in 1795 with Great Britain resolved that lingering issue and the British departed the forts. [[Thomas Jefferson]] saw the nearby British presence as a threat to the [[United States]], and so he opposed the [[Jay Treaty]], and it became one of the major political issues in the United States at the time.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''The First Rapprochement: England and the United States, 1795\u20131805'' (1955)</ref> Thousands of Americans immigrated to Upper Canada (Ontario) from 1785 to 1812 to obtain cheaper land and better tax rates prevalent in that province; despite expectations that they would be loyal to the U.S. if a war broke out, in the event they were largely non-political.<ref>{{cite book|first=George A.|last=Rawlyk|title=The Canada Fire: Radical Evangelicalism in British North America, 1775\u20131812|url=https://archive.org/details/canadafire0000unse|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/canadafire0000unse/page/122 122]|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9780773512214}}</ref>\n\nTensions mounted again after 1805, erupting into the [[War of 1812]], when the United States declared war on Britain. The Americans were angered by British harassment of U.S. ships on the high seas and [[Impressment|seizure of 6,000 sailors from American ships]], severe restrictions against neutral American trade with France, and British support for hostile Indian tribes in Ohio and territories the U.S. had gained in 1783. American \"honor\" was an implicit issue. While the Americans could not hope to defeat the [[Royal Navy]] and control the seas, they could call on an army much larger than the British garrison in Canada, and so a land invasion of Canada was proposed as the most advantageous means of attacking the British Empire. Americans on the western frontier also hoped an invasion would bring an end to British support of [[American Indians in the United States|Native American]] resistance to [[Westward expansion of the United States|American expansion]], typified by [[Tecumseh]]'s coalition of tribes.<ref>Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, & Indian Allies'' (2010).</ref> Americans may also have wanted to acquire Canada.{{sfn|Stagg|2012|pp=5\u20136}}<ref>George F.

There was some hope that settlers in western Canada\u2014most of them recent immigrants from the U.S.\u2014would welcome the chance to overthrow their British rulers. However, the American invasions were defeated primarily by British regulars with support from Native Americans and [[Upper Canada]] militia. Aided by the large Royal Navy, a series of British raids on the American coast were highly successful, culminating with an [[Burning of Washington|attack on Washington]] that resulted in the British burning of the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|the Capitol]], and other public buildings. However, the later battles of [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]], [[Battle of Plattsburg|Plattsburg]], and [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] all ended in defeat for the British. At the end of the war, Britain's American Indian allies had largely been defeated, and the Americans controlled a strip of Western Ontario centered on [[Amherstburg|Fort Malden]]. However, Britain held much of Maine, and, with the support of their remaining American Indian allies, huge areas of the Old Northwest, including [[Wisconsin]] and much of [[Michigan]] and [[Illinois]]. With the surrender of Napoleon in 1814, Britain ended naval policies that angered Americans; with the defeat of the Indian tribes the threat to American expansion was ended. The upshot was both the United States and Canada asserted their sovereignty, Canada remained under British rule, and London and Washington had nothing more to fight over. The war was ended by the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which took effect in February 1815.<ref>Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2007) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] perspective.</ref> A series of postwar agreements further stabilized peaceful relations along the Canadian-US border.

Morton, ''The Kingdom of Canada'' (1969) ch 12</ref>\n\nIn later years, Anglophone Canadians, especially in Ontario, viewed the War of 1812 as a heroic and successful resistance against invasion and as a victory that defined them as a people. The myth that the Canadian militia had defeated the invasion almost single-handed, known logically as the \"militia myth\", became highly prevalent after the war, having been propounded by [[John Strachan]], [[Toronto|Anglican Bishop of York]]. Meanwhile, the United States celebrated victory in its \"Second War of Independence,\" and war heroes such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] headed to the White House.<ref>A.J. Langguth, ''Union 1812: The Americans Who Fought the Second War of Independence'' (2006) ch 24</ref>\n\n===Conservative reaction===\nIn the aftermath of the War of 1812, pro-British conservatives led by Anglican Bishop [[John Strachan]] took control in Ontario (\"Upper Canada\"), and promoted the Anglican religion as opposed to the more republican Methodist and Baptist churches. A small interlocking elite, known as the [[Family Compact]] took full political control. Democracy, as practiced in the US, was ridiculed. The policies had the desired effect of deterring immigration from United States. [[Rebellions of 1837|Revolts in favor of democracy]] in Ontario and Quebec (\"Lower Canada\") in 1837 were suppressed; many of the leaders fled to the US.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dunning | first1 = Tom | year = 2009 | title = The Canadian Rebellions of 1837 and 1838 as a Borderland War: A Retrospective | url = | journal = Ontario History | volume = 101 | issue = 2| pages = 129\u2013141 | doi = 10.7202/1065615ar }}</ref> The American policy was to largely ignore the rebellions,<ref>Orrin Edward Tiffany, ''The Relations of the United States to the Canadian Rebellion of 1837\u20131838'' (1905).

Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] with Russia in 1867, he intended it as the first step in a comprehensive plan to gain control of the entire northwest Pacific Coast. Seward was a firm believer in [[Manifest Destiny]], primarily for its commercial advantages to the U.S. Seward expected [[British Columbia]] to seek annexation to the U.S. and thought Britain might accept this in exchange for the ''Alabama'' claims. Soon other elements endorsed annexation, Their plan was to annex [[British Columbia]], [[Red River Colony]] (Manitoba), and [[Nova Scotia]], in exchange for the dropping the damage claims. The idea reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1870, with American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and Pro-American Englishmen seemingly combining forces. The plan was dropped for multiple reasons. London continued to stall, American commercial and financial groups pressed Washington for a quick settlement of the dispute on a cash basis, growing Canadian nationalist sentiment in British Columbia called for staying inside the British Empire, Congress became preoccupied with Reconstruction, and most Americans showed little interest in territorial expansion. The \"[[Alabama Claims]]\" dispute went to international arbitration. In one of the first major cases of arbitration, the tribunal in 1872 supported the American claims and ordered Britain to pay $15.5 million. Britain paid and the episode ended in peaceful relations.<ref>Doris W.

Prior to Confederation, there was an [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in which the Americans claimed the 54th degree latitude. That issue was resolved by splitting the disputed territory; the northern half became British Columbia, and the southern half the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. Strained relations with America continued, however, due to a series of small-scale armed incursions named the [[Fenian raids]] by [[Irish American|Irish-American]] Civil War veterans across the border from 1866 to 1871 in an attempt to trade Canada for Irish independence.<ref>{{cite book|first=Yossi|last=Shain|title=Marketing the American Creed Abroad: Diasporas in the U.S. and Their Homelands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pqj8GFCg7MC&pg=PA53|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=53|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9780521642255}}</ref> The American government, angry at Canadian tolerance of Confederate raiders during the American Civil War, moved very slowly to disarm the [[Fenians]]. The British government, in charge of diplomatic relations, protested cautiously, as Anglo-American relations were tense. Much of the tension was relieved as the Fenians faded away and in 1872 by the settlement of the [[Alabama Claims]], when Britain paid the U.S. $15.5 million for war losses caused by warships built in Britain and sold to the Confederacy.\n\nDisputes over ocean boundaries on [[Georges Bank]] and over fishing, whaling, and sealing rights in the Pacific were settled by international arbitration, setting an important precedent.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Kurlansky|title=Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World|url=https://archive.org/details/cod00mark|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|page=[https://archive.org/details/cod00mark/page/117 117]|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9781440672873}}</ref>\n\n===Emigration to and from the United States of America===\n{{Further|French American}}\nAfter 1850, the pace of industrialization and urbanization was much faster in the United States, drawing a wide range of immigrants from the North. By 1870, 1/6 of all the people born in Canada had moved to the United States, with the highest concentrations in New England, which was the destination of Francophone emigrants from Quebec and Anglophone emigrants from the Maritimes. It was common for people to move back and forth across the border, such as seasonal lumberjacks, entrepreneurs looking for larger markets, and families looking for jobs in the textile mills that paid much higher wages than in Canada.<ref>John J. Bukowczyk et al. ''Permeable Border: The Great Lakes Region as Transnational Region, 1650\u20131990'' (University of Pittsburgh Press. 2005)</ref>\n\nThe southward migration slacked off after 1890, as Canadian industry began a growth spurt. By then, the American frontier was closing, and thousands of farmers looking for fresh land moved from the United States north into the Prairie Provinces. The net result of the flows were that in 1901 there were 128,000 American-born residents in Canada (3.5% of the Canadian population) and 1.18 million Canadian-born residents in the United States (1.6% of the U.S. population).<ref>J.

The issue was unimportant until a gold rush brought tens of thousands of men to Canada's Yukon, and they had to arrive through American ports. Canada needed its port and claimed that it had a legal right to a port near the present American town of [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], Alaska. It would provide an all-Canadian route to the rich goldfields. The dispute was settled by arbitration, and the British delegate voted with the Americans\u2014to the astonishment and disgust of Canadians who suddenly realized that Britain considered its relations with the United States paramount compared to those with Canada. The arbitration validated the status quo, but made Canada angry at London.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Munro | first1 = John A. | year = 1965 | title = English-Canadianism and the Demand for Canadian Autonomy: Ontario's Response to the Alaska Boundary Decision, 1903 | url = | journal = Ontario History | volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 189\u2013203 }}</ref><ref>David G.

In the War of 1812, for example, the enthusiastic response by French militia to defend Lower Canada reflected, according to Heidler and Heidler (2004), \"the fear of Americanization.\"<ref>David Stephen Heidler and Jeanne T.

Anti-American Canadians (who admired the British Empire) explained that Canada had narrowly escaped American conquest with its rejection of tradition, its worship of \"progress\" and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and societal harmony. There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as [[F. R. Scott]] and Jean-Charles Harvey (1891\u20131967).<ref>Damien-Claude B\u00e9langer, ''Prejudice and Pride: Canadian Intellectuals Confront the United States, 1891\u20131945'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp 16, 180</ref>\n\nLooking at television, Collins (1990) finds that it is in Anglophone Canada that fear of cultural Americanization is most powerful, for there the attractions of the U.S. are strongest.<ref>Richard Collins, ''Culture, Communication, and National Identity: The Case of Canadian Television'' (U. of Toronto Press, 1990) p. 25</ref> Meren (2009) argues that after 1945, the emergence of Quebec nationalism and the desire to preserve French-Canadian cultural heritage led to growing anxiety regarding American cultural imperialism and Americanization.<ref>David Meren, \"'Plus que jamais n\u00e9cessaires': Cultural Relations, Nationalism and the State in the Canada-Quebec-France Triangle, 1945\u20131960,\" ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association'', 2009, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 279\u2013305,</ref> In 2006 surveys showed that 60 percent of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois had a fear of Americanization, while other surveys showed they preferred their current situation to that of the Americans in the realms of health care, quality of life as seniors, environmental quality, poverty, educational system, racism and standard of living.

Many have stated that the Vietnam war had its own political life back then, and it could swing either way, rapidly and decisively.  And a new President steps in with promises of a great and lasting peace between all nations, mainly Vietnam.\n\nGenerally warm relations existed at this time between Canada and America, and it was good for trade.  Yet animosity reaches an all-time high since World War 2 in the Northern US.\nNotably one hand did not know what the other was doing.  Both countries continue to support war on Vietnam, and had entirely different views on how this would continue, if it should continue, and how it should be handled.  Ford is viewed as a pacifist by Canada, and a hero.  Richard Nixon tries to hold separate office even after the election, and his attempts to fight the state law see two camps briefly in power.  Gerald R. Ford, the owner of Ford Automotives, stated an end to the Vietnam war would happen during his election campaign.  But due to repeated attacks on airbases across eastern America, and group landing and guerilla warfare within North America by the Viet Cong... the war continued.\nIn Canada there was no official support for the war of Vietnam, and this adversely increased military / social / trade / alliance frictions.\n\nWar declared on Canada in early 1975 by USA, yet it does not go widely reported.  Rumours persist of Fascist American Nationalists (aka American Hardliners) involvement within American Military and Intelligence heads.  War declaration seems to be a result of American support for McCarthyism, and not Pres. Gerald R. Fords, official party line.  No support for Annexation was ever true, or popularized in press, or media.  A Hardliner fantasy.  Popular opinion in New York and North Eastern US shifting against Canada perhaps led to this decision.  No official draft bill passes the floor in Canada until 1983.  Little immediate response in US or Canada.  This begins a \"Cold War\" between the US and Canada (automatically this includes the Commonwealth).   A \"Cold War\" was at the time defined as a war that was not in the papers, and often included devastating nuclear battles.  This was a threat used mainly against Communist countries in that era.<ref>Queen Victoria of England's Office circa 1978.</ref>  Strangely this does not affect trade.  Intelligence units go to war, and this increases tensions across the board.  Many police officers are attacked in Canada and the Northern United States in the following years, and very little of this is in the papers.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nNATO operations, and a joint North America Shield continued.<ref>1977 CBC news</ref>  And eventually expanded.  What this meant was in question.  Joint initiatives were seen by Canada as a move in the right direction, as they had little interest in a war with America.  The pacifists in the Land Of The True And Free believed that a war could be averted if it was not fought.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Pierre Trudeau and Jimmy Carter (January 1977 \u2013 June 1979)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\nIn his fourth consecutive term, Pierre Trudeau, a lawyer, intellectual and activist, and his majority Liberal government had lost a lost of face in Western Canada.  Frequent corruption on both sides of the Canada-US border led to confusion, chaos, and indignation by both sides and some name-calling.  In an era when the USA had adopted food stamps in many of its states, among other widely successful state by state adopted programs which kept home owners fed, it had a few flaws.  Food stamps were attacked by critics in the United States, while in Canada many provinces and territories were backing similar programs hard, despite continual corruption, which created a loss of funding by individuals and criminals within the government.  Notably The Honorable Allen Blakeney, current Premiere of Saskatchewan from 1970\u20131980, was criticized openly from his removal of such a program by the British Royal Family, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and others, and this would have included Jimmy Carter, which resulted in the happy resolution of reinstatement of the Saskatchewan Social Welfare program by 1978.  A battle indicitive of the era, and how many Canadians were disillusioned with its leadership and their decisions.\n\nJimmy Carter, an American Navy submarine officer, was not as much of a media messiah, stunning and constantly and in your face as former Presidents Gerald Ford and Richard R. Nixon had been.  But he was popular with Canadians for his highly perceptive political stances, and his logical characteristics.  During his administration, Canada was publicly criticized by many Americans for not entering the American, Australian and French war with Vietnam.  At the same time hippies and the Peace, Love and Happiness anti-war movement were still in style in both countries.  And were a large part of the vote -- if they had heard any of that news they would march and get shot at by radical far right extremists.  In the face of all political debate, quietly thousands of Viet Cong occasionally descended on the West Coast including Vancouver, and the US headed back in.<ref>CBC News</ref><ref>Vancouver Mayor's Office</ref>  Instead of warfare the two heads of state used their time to move away from that.  And it became a period NASA initiatives reached a high point, and the Canadaarm Project was adopted. <ref>NASA https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/behindscenes/rms_anniversary.html</ref>  This device, in its second form is still used today on the National ISS.  The second Avro Arrow project was canceled, which was extremely popular in the media.  It was to be a continuation of the CF-100 line (the first Avro Arrow), and was to be an improvement in every way over well-known \"Voodoo\" CF-101 which remained an Air Force mainstay until at least 1987.  This cross-border co operation of epic proportion flew in the face of American hardliners, but also made them proud -- It produced the CF-18, Canada's first stealth fighter bomber by 1980. And also was optioned out as to American Military contractors which was refused by the US Navy at the time, but later spawned many variants.  And all that after continuous US open criticism and attacks on the ground floor.  The Central Intelligence Agency wanted America to remain first and this including attack its infrastructure, in the field of intelligence warfare.  The \"Cold War\" continued ever onward, the objectives remained ever-muddy.\n\nIf the name of the game was co-operation then the Avro Arrow Bs (B for supersonic bomber)<ref>Declassified Royal Canadian Armed Forces Records</ref> success was a big hit with the average American and Canadian.  After a brief co-operative period which combined Canadian, and American technology.  Trade barriers would not have been a barrier in this era of frequent attacks on Canadian citizens by American military, criminal gangs, and other forces from the military standpoint.  But the CF/18 and the Canadaarm along with trade law, and continued trade practice were pivotal in moving widely supported causes for peace forward in that era.  But the Governors, Premieres and Canadian and American heads of state worked on enhancing and stimulating trade by keeping borders fully open, and working out trade agreements.  While the U.S.S.R. threatened global war, it was the time to make friends not enemies.\n\nThere were many months when President Jimmy Carter, a preacher's son, and a harsh critic of Canadian policy, would never speak with P.M. Pierre Trudeau, who had worked closely with intelligence experts for years, and was completely pro-Canadian and pro Ontario.  Those close to them said that the break in their discussions was caused by the tenuous nature of the two countries, and the vitrified fervor that Jimmy Carter had for his country, and that kind of hardliner talk was not always welcomed by Canadian politicians.  By the end of President Carter's term Canadians over the age of 18 would have to show only their driver's license at the border to gain entry into Canada.  Very little was on file, as computers were not up to the task of stopping any criminals or terrorists yet.  Canada chose not to implement this method as it was seen to be faulty.  In a time of frequent border attacks and brutal attacks on border guards, surprisingly Canada did not implement any additional border security outside of Ontario.  While there was much talk in the media about \"The Red Menace\" of the U.S.S.R. and China's leaving Democracy behind...  Hundreds of roads remained unguarded.  The coast guard did not increase in size.  Canada and the USA lost thousands of officers due to these decision<ref>Canadian Intelligence Resources</ref>s, and the growing number of outlaws and war-hungry American dissidents exploded into increasingly frequent outbreaks of cross-border violence. Neither P.M. nor President could stem the tide.\n\n===Joe Clark and Jimmy Carter (June 1979 \u2013 March 1980)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\nClark and Carter are known to have very warm relations. And many private talks.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Joe Clarke gets a softer, warmer and fresh perspective, and Jimmy Carter has the chance start anew, and does not press forward with attacks on First Nations reserves in Canada, and agreements for Canada to allow the American Military, and Espionage forces into Canada.  They do not discuss racially based attacks in public.  And are said to have \"complete and utter disagreement\" about the path forward for the indigenous tribes of the region.<ref>Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News</ref> This is a great set up for what happens next.  Joe Clarke like most Canadians believes in peace with the Vietnam and North Korean alliance.\n\nPublicly war is declared on Canada by Mikhail Gorbachev President of the USSR by late 1980.  After 6 nuclear attacks are averted and constant attacks on the Yukon and Alaska persist and increase by the civilians of both states... neither side to agree that they were at peace.  Project Northern Shield, and The North American Defense Initiative, and allied Air Defense, and Radar and missile initiatives are allowed to co-exist during a state of warfare on both borders.  Because Canada blocks all access to Northern bases by gangs and those not under a Canadian command there are increasing attacks against Canadians who refuse to draft in Western Canada and a minimal draft of 80,000 troop objective to protect... only the city of Toronto and its borders.  Many do not make it to the front due to high levels of enemy infiltration on two borders.  The damage against Canada by the USA peaks at 90,000 war time murders a year.<ref>Canadian Intelligence Resources</ref> This unifies the two states publicly.  Trade surges ahead, the dollar moves from all time lows onward and upward, due to an over-linking of the trade markets with America, that confuses British traders, who eventually bow out, despite 20% a year inflation...  Many British owned businesses are bought out.  Woolco eventually folds in a few years.  Woolworths holds out, but downsizes, and eventually closes in the 1990s.  Major British owned chains in Canada fold.  A void is created, and American and Ontario businesses and factories rush to fill this market.\n\nIn the press the Voodoo project is aided by the American \"Genie Missile\" and air to air low megaton yield missile, tasked with defending the North from Russia.  Both air forces commit to protecting America from bombers, while Canada steps back and gives up territory in a bold move to protect \"the population belt\" of Canada (the 49th parallel).  But adds to its early warning systems by continuing their game of cards with the American public.  \"Duck and Cover\"<ref>\"Duck And Cover\" Canadian Government Federal Video, 1981</ref> and other informational videos and propaganda are used by Canada and America to bolster support for a war on Russia with a Peace-nick friendly Canada.  It is important to note Russia had been firm allies with Canada since their victory in World War 2, a stark contrast to American policy and social agendas.\n\nThe Viet Cong who opened up channels to Canada, and we have a semi-official truce, while we prepare for an ongoing Cold War on our Northern Borders.  P.M. Joe Carter is known to all on his way out as a gunslinger who batted above his belt level.  In his home town in Alberta, they still remember him as \"Dick\" Clarke, and it was the first breakthrough for the West in a very long time.  The next incumbent P.M. was also in for a gunfight if he wanted to hold his seat.\n\n===Pierre Trudeau and Jimmy Carter (March 1980 \u2013 January 1981)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Pierre Trudeau and Ronald Reagan (January 1981 \u2013 June 1984)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\n\n===John Turner and Ronald Reagan (June\u2013September 1984)===\n{{empty section|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Brian Mulroney and Ronald Reagan (September 1984 \u2013 January 1989)===\n[[File:Mulroney and Reagan in Venice 1987.jpg|thumb|right|Ronald Reagan (left) and Brian Mulroney (right) at the Hotel Cipriani in Venice, Italy, June 11, 1987]]\nRelations between [[Brian Mulroney]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were famously close.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The president will see you now : my stories and lessons from Ronald Reagan's final years|last=Grande|first=Peggy|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9780316396455|edition= First|location=New York|pages=|chapter=8: Rawhide's Ranch|oclc=951764632}}</ref> This relationship resulted in negotiations for the [[Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement]], and the [[U.S.\u2013Canada Air Quality Agreement]] to reduce acid-rain-causing emissions, both major policy goals of Mulroney, that would be finalized under the presidency of [[George H.

Canada's assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait ([[international waters]]). Canadians were alarmed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker {{SS|Manhattan|1962|2}} through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker [[USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)|Polar Sea]] in 1985, which actually resulted in a [[1985 Polar Sea controversy|minor diplomatic incident]]. In 1970, the Canadian parliament enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a 100-mile zone. In response, the United States in 1970 stated, \"We cannot accept the assertion of a [[Canadians|Canadian]] claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada. ... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.\" A compromise of sorts was reached in 1988, by an agreement on \"Arctic Cooperation,\" which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers \"will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.\" However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position. [[Paul Cellucci]], the American ambassador to Canada, in 2005 suggested to Washington that it should recognize the straits as belonging to Canada. His advice was rejected and Harper took opposite positions. The U.S. opposes Harper's proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.<ref>Matthew Carnaghan, Allison Goody, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/researchpublications/prb0561-e.htm \"Canadian Arctic Sovereignty\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304003939/http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0561-e.htm |date=March 4, 2012 }} (Library of Parliament: Political and Social Affairs Division, January 26, 2006); [https://web.archive.org/web/20061215051632/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/01/26/wilkins-harper060126.html 2006 news]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Politics/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222190522/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Politics/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/ |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |title=Cellucci: Canada should control Northwest Passage |publisher=CTV.ca |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, the U.S. State Department spokesperson [[Morgan Ortagus]] said the US \"view Canada\u2019s claim that the waters of the Northwest Passage are internal waters of Canada as inconsistent with international law.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=The US is picking a fight with Canada over a thawing Arctic shipping route |url=https://qz.com/1653831/the-us-is-picking-a-fight-with-canada-over-an-arctic-shipping-route/ |work=Quartz |date=27 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Common memberships===\n{{UKUSA}}\nCanada and the United States both hold membership in a number of multinational organizations such as:\n* [[Arctic Council]]\n* [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]]\n* [[Canadian Football League]]\n* [[CONCACAF]]\n* [[FIBA]]\n* [[FIFA]]\n* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]\n* [[G7]]\n* [[Group of Ten (economic)|G-10]]\n* [[G-20 major economies]]\n* [[International Chamber of Commerce]]\n* [[International Development Association]]\n* [[International Ice Hockey Federation]]\n* [[International Monetary Fund]]\n* [[International Olympic Committee]]\n* [[Interpol]]\n* [[Major League Baseball]]\n* [[Major League Soccer]]\n* [[National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing]]\n* [[National Basketball Association]]\n* [[National Football League]]\n* [[National Hockey League]]\n* [[National Lacrosse League]]\n* [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]\n* [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]]\n* [[North American Numbering Plan]]\n* [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]\n* [[Organization of American States]]\n* [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]\n* [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America]]\n* [[UKUSA Community]]\n* [[United Nations]]\n* [[UNESCO]]\n* [[World Bowling]]\n* [[World Health Organization]]\n* [[World Trade Organization]]\n* [[World Bank]]\n* [[World Rugby]]\n\n==Diplomatic missions==\n\n===Canadian missions in the United States===\n{{multiple image\n | width1   = 222\n | image1   = Embassy of Canada in Washington, D.C..JPG\n | caption1 = [[Canadian Embassy, Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Canada]] in Washington, D.C.\n | width2 = 187\n | image2   = USEmbassyOttawa.JPG\n | caption2 = [[Embassy of the United States, Ottawa|Embassy of the United States]] in Ottawa\n}}\nCanada's chief diplomatic mission to the United States is the Canadian Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]].
