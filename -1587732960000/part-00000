It comprised four regions: ''[[Polynesia]]'', ''[[Micronesia]]'', ''Malaysia'' (now called the [[Malay Archipelago]]), and ''[[Melanesia]]''.<ref name=\"onisl163\" /> Today, parts of three geological continents are included in the term \"Oceania\": Eurasia, Australia, and [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], as well the non-continental volcanic islands of the [[Philippines]], [[Wallacea]], and the open Pacific.\n\nOceania extends to New Guinea in the west, the [[Bonin Islands]] in the northwest, the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in the northeast, [[Easter Island|Rapa Nui]] and [[Isla Salas y G\u00f3mez|Sala y G\u00f3mez Island]] in the east, and [[Macquarie Island]] in the south. Not included are the Pacific islands of [[Taiwan]], the [[Ryukyu Islands]], the [[Japanese archipelago]], and the [[Maluku Islands]], all on the margins of Asia, and the [[Aleutian Islands]] of North America. In its periphery, Oceania sprawls [[28th parallel north|28 degrees north]] to the Bonin Islands in the [[northern hemisphere]], and [[55th parallel south|55 degrees south]] to Macquarie Island in the [[southern hemisphere]].<ref name=\"race1750\" />\n\nOceanian islands are of four basic types: continental islands, [[high island]]s, [[coral reef]]s and uplifted [[coral island|coral platforms]]. High islands are of volcanic origin, and many contain active volcanoes. Among these are [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], Hawaii, and Solomon Islands.<ref name=\"GillespieClague2009\" />\n\nOceania is one of eight terrestrial [[ecozone]]s, which constitute the major ecological regions of the planet. Related to these concepts are [[Near Oceania]], that part of western [[Island Melanesia]] which has been inhabited for tens of millennia, and [[Remote Oceania]] which is more recently settled. Although the majority of the Oceanian islands lie in the South Pacific, a few of them are not restricted to the Pacific Ocean \u2013 [[Kangaroo Island]] and [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]], for instance, are situated in the [[Southern Ocean]] and [[Indian Ocean]], respectively, and [[West Coast, Tasmania|Tasmania's west coast]] faces the Southern Ocean.<ref name=\"othero5\" />\nThe coral reefs of the South Pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the ocean's surface. One of the most dramatic is the [[Great Barrier Reef]] off northeastern Australia with chains of reef patches. A second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform, which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands. Examples include [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] (formerly Ocean Island) and [[Makatea]] in the Tuamotu group of [[French Polynesia]].<ref name=\"britta\" /><ref name=\"abcnet22613\" />\n\n[[File:\"Political Oceania\" CIA World Factbook.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of Oceania from the CIA World Factbook]]\n[[File:Oceania Political Map (EEZ based).png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Exclusive economic zone]]s of Pacific states and territories]]\n\n===Regions===\n[[Micronesia]], which lies north of the equator and west of the [[International Date Line]], includes the [[Mariana Islands]] in the northwest, the [[Caroline Islands]] in the center, the [[Marshall Islands]] to the west and the islands of [[Kiribati]] in the southeast.<ref name=\"AAE\" /><ref name=\"LalFortune2000p63\" />\n\n[[Melanesia]], to the southwest, includes [[New Guinea]], the world's second largest island after [[Greenland]] and by far the largest of the Pacific islands.

Much of the basement rock of New Zealand was once part of the super-continent of Gondwana, along with South America, Africa, [[Madagascar]], India, Antarctica and Australia.  The rocks that now form the continent of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] were nestled between Eastern Australia and [[Western Antarctica]].<ref name=\"tearaz\" />\n\nThe Australia-New Zealand continental fragment of Gondwana split from the rest of Gondwana in the [[late Cretaceous]] time (95\u201390 Ma).

The [[Tasman Sea]], and part of Zealandia then locked together with Australia to form the [[Australian Plate]] (40 Ma), and a new plate boundary was created between the Australian Plate and Pacific Plate.\n\nMost islands in the Pacific are [[high islands]] ([[volcanic]] islands), such as, [[Easter Island]], [[American Samoa]] and [[Fiji]], among others, having peaks up to 1300 m rising abruptly from the shore.<ref name=\"Factbook-Fiji\" /> The [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] were formed approximately 7 to 30 million years ago, as [[shield volcano]]es over the same volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] that formed the [[Emperor Seamounts]] to the north and the Main Hawaiian Islands to the south.<ref name=\"geochr\" /> Hawaii's tallest mountain [[Mauna Kea]] is {{convert|13796|ft|m|abbr=on}} above mean sea level.<ref name=\"usgsgov\" />\n\n===Flora===\n{{Main|Geography of Australia|Environment of New Zealand|Flora of Australia|Flora of New Zealand|Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands|Domesticated plants of Austronesia}}\n[[File:Countryside Kaikoura, New Zealand.JPG|thumb|New Zealand countryside]]\n[[File:Ulu\u1e5fu (Ayers Rock), Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock) in [[Central Australia]]]]\n\nThe most diverse country of Oceania when it comes to the environment is Australia, with tropical [[rainforest]]s in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and dry desert in the centre.<ref name=\"envigov2012\" /> [[Deserts of Australia|Desert]] or semi-arid land commonly known as the [[outback]] makes up by far the largest portion of land.<ref name=\"portrait\" /> The [[Eastern Australian temperate forests|coastal uplands]] and a [[Brigalow Belt|belt of Brigalow grasslands]] lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland.<ref name=\"drivers375\" /> The northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested [[Cape York Peninsula]].<ref name=\"uplands\" /><ref name=\"gdowns\" /><ref name=\"mulgas\" /><ref name=\"tempera\" /><ref name=\"savanna\" />\n\nProminent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to [[aridity]] and fire which include [[sclerophyll|scleromorphy]] and [[serotiny]].

The first migration [[Australo-Melanesian]]) took place approximately 40 to 80 thousand years ago, and these migrants, [[Papuan people|Papuans]], colonised much of Near Oceania. Approximately 3.5 thousand years ago, a second expansion of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] speakers arrived in Near Oceania, and the descendants of these people spread to the far corners of the Pacific, colonising [[Remote Oceania]].<ref name=\"doi10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.014\"/>\n\n[[Mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) studies quantify the magnitude of the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian expansion]] and demonstrate the homogenising effect of this expansion. With regards to Papuan influence, autochthonous [[haplogroup]]s support the hypothesis of a long history in Near Oceania, with some lineages suggesting a time depth of 60 thousand years. [[Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz]], a population located in Remote Oceania, is an anomaly with extreme frequencies of autochthonous haplogroups of Near Oceanian origin.<ref name=\"doi10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.014\"/>\n\nLarge areas of [[New Guinea]] are unexplored by scientists and [[anthropologist]]s due to extensive [[forestation]] and mountainous terrain. Known indigenous tribes in [[Papua New Guinea]] have very little contact with local authorities aside from the authorities knowing who they are. Many remain [[preliterate]] and, at the national or international level, the names of tribes and information about them is extremely hard to obtain.

Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States and South Korea. The smallest Pacific nations rely on trade with Australia, New Zealand and the United States for exporting goods and for accessing other products. Australia and New Zealand's trading arrangements are known as [[Closer Economic Relations]]. Australia and New Zealand, along with other countries, are members of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) and the [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS), which may become trade blocs in the future particularly EAS.\n\nThe main produce from the Pacific is [[copra]] or [[coconut]], but [[timber]], [[beef]], [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[sugar]] and [[ginger]] are also commonly grown across the [[tropics]] of the Pacific. [[Fishing]] provides a major [[industry]] for many of the smaller nations in the Pacific, although many [[fishing]] areas are exploited by other larger countries, namely Japan. [[Natural Resources]], such as [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]] and [[gold]], are mined in Australia and [[Solomon Islands]]. Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States, India, South Korea and the [[European Union]].\n\nEndowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, [[Fiji]] is one of the most developed of the Pacific island [[economics|economies]], though it remains a [[developing nation|developing country]] with a large [[subsistence agriculture]] sector.<ref name=\"ciafacfj\" /> Agriculture accounts for 18% of [[gross domestic product]], although it employed some 70% of the workforce as of 2001. [[Sugar]] exports and the growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign exchange. Sugar cane processing makes up one-third of industrial activity. [[Coconut]]s, [[ginger]], and [[copra]] are also significant.\n\nThe history of Hawaii's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries; [[sandalwood]],<ref name=\"hawahis\" /> [[whaling]],<ref name=\"whalinhawa\" /> sugarcane, [[pineapple]], the military, tourism and education.<ref name=\"capitagdf\" /> Hawaiian exports include food and clothing. These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, due to the shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey.<ref name=\"hawabee\" /> {{As of|2015}}, Honolulu was ranked high on world livability rankings, and was also ranked as the 2nd safest city in the U.S.<ref name=\"MercerSurvey2015\" /><ref name=\"KITVSafestCity\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Shangri-La Fijian Resort 15.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shangri-La's Fijian Resort]]]]\nTourists mostly come from Japan, the [[United Kingdom]] and the United States.

Tourism has been promoted, in part, by Vanuatu being the site of several reality-TV shows. The ninth season of the reality TV series ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]'' was filmed on Vanuatu, entitled ''[[Survivor: Vanuatu]]&nbsp;\u2013 Islands of Fire''.

Geological forces such as [[tectonic uplift]] of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australia's early history, when it was still a part of [[Gondwana]].

Much of the basement rock of New Zealand was once part of the super-continent of Gondwana, along with South America, Africa, [[Madagascar]], India, Antarctica and Australia.  The rocks that now form the continent of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] were nestled between Eastern Australia and [[Western Antarctica]].<ref name=\"tearaz\" />\n\nThe Australia-New Zealand continental fragment of Gondwana split from the rest of Gondwana in the [[late Cretaceous]] time (95\u201390 Ma). By 75 Ma, Zealandia was essentially separate from Australia and Antarctica, although only shallow seas might have separated Zealandia and Australia in the north. The [[Tasman Sea]], and part of Zealandia then locked together with Australia to form the [[Australian Plate]] (40 Ma), and a new plate boundary was created between the Australian Plate and Pacific Plate.\n\nMost islands in the Pacific are [[high islands]] ([[volcanic]] islands), such as, [[Easter Island]], [[American Samoa]] and [[Fiji]], among others, having peaks up to 1300 m rising abruptly from the shore.<ref name=\"Factbook-Fiji\" /> The [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] were formed approximately 7 to 30 million years ago, as [[shield volcano]]es over the same volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] that formed the [[Emperor Seamounts]] to the north and the Main Hawaiian Islands to the south.<ref name=\"geochr\" /> Hawaii's tallest mountain [[Mauna Kea]] is {{convert|13796|ft|m|abbr=on}} above mean sea level.<ref name=\"usgsgov\" />\n\n===Flora===\n{{Main|Geography of Australia|Environment of New Zealand|Flora of Australia|Flora of New Zealand|Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands|Domesticated plants of Austronesia}}\n[[File:Countryside Kaikoura, New Zealand.JPG|thumb|New Zealand countryside]]\n[[File:Ulu\u1e5fu (Ayers Rock), Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock) in [[Central Australia]]]]\n\nThe most diverse country of Oceania when it comes to the environment is Australia, with tropical [[rainforest]]s in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and dry desert in the centre.<ref name=\"envigov2012\" /> [[Deserts of Australia|Desert]] or semi-arid land commonly known as the [[outback]] makes up by far the largest portion of land.<ref name=\"portrait\" /> The [[Eastern Australian temperate forests|coastal uplands]] and a [[Brigalow Belt|belt of Brigalow grasslands]] lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland.<ref name=\"drivers375\" /> The northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested [[Cape York Peninsula]].<ref name=\"uplands\" /><ref name=\"gdowns\" /><ref name=\"mulgas\" /><ref name=\"tempera\" /><ref name=\"savanna\" />\n\nProminent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to [[aridity]] and fire which include [[sclerophyll|scleromorphy]] and [[serotiny]].

Approximately 3.5 thousand years ago, a second expansion of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] speakers arrived in Near Oceania, and the descendants of these people spread to the far corners of the Pacific, colonising [[Remote Oceania]].<ref name=\"doi10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.014\"/>\n\n[[Mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) studies quantify the magnitude of the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian expansion]] and demonstrate the homogenising effect of this expansion. With regards to Papuan influence, autochthonous [[haplogroup]]s support the hypothesis of a long history in Near Oceania, with some lineages suggesting a time depth of 60 thousand years.

Despite centuries of European influence, Samoa maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and [[Samoan language|language]]. Cultural customs such as the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven ''[['ie toga]]''.\n\nThe Samoan word for dance is ''[[siva Samoa|siva]]'', which consists of unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and which tell a story. Samoan male dances can be more snappy.<ref name=\"dancesiva\" /> The ''[[sasa (dance)|sasa]]'' is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid [[synchronization|synchronised]] movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ''([[pate (musical instrument)|pate]])'' or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the ''[[fa'ataupati]]'' or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. As with other Polynesian cultures ([[Hawaiian culture|Hawaiian]], [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] and [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]]) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos.<ref name=\"wwpride\" />\n\n===Arts===\n{{Main|Oceanian art|Samoan art|Hawaiian art|Maori art|Indigenous Australian art}}\n[[File:Bradshaw rock paintings.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Bradshaw rock paintings]] found in the north-west [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]]]]\nThe artistic creations of native Oceanians varies greatly throughout the cultures and regions.

Establishing a chronological timeframe for these pieces in most cases is difficult, but one has been dated to 1500 BC.<ref name=\"mettime444\" />\n\nBy 1500 BC the [[Lapita]] culture, descendants of the second wave, would begin to expand and spread into the more remote islands. At around the same time, art began to appear in New Guinea, including the earliest examples of sculpture in Oceania. Starting around 1100 AD, the people of Easter Island would begin construction of nearly 900 [[moai]] (large stone statues). At about 1200 AD, the people of Pohnpei, a Micronesian island, would embark on another megalithic construction, building [[Nan Madol]], a city of artificial islands and a system of canals.<ref name=\"mettime 453\" /> Hawaiian art includes [[wood carving]]s, feather work, petroglyphs, bark cloth (called [[kapa]] in Hawaiian and [[Tapa cloth|tapa]] elsewhere in the Pacific) and tattoos.

The hill rises above the city to a height of {{convert|250.5|m|abbr=on}}, provides excellent panoramic views of the city and beyond, is relatively easy to climb, and is popular for [[hillwalking]]. Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest and simplest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above [[Dunsapie Loch]]. At a spur of the hill, [[Salisbury Crags]] has historically been a [[rock climbing]] venue with routes of various degrees of difficulty, but due to hazards, rock climbing is now restricted to the South Quarry and a permit is required.\n\n== Name ==\nIt is sometimes said that its name is derived from legends pertaining to [[King Arthur]], such as the reference in ''[[Y Gododdin]]''. Some support for this may be provided by several other hilltop and mountaintop features in Britain which bear the same or similar names, such as the peak of Ben Arthur ([[The Cobbler]]) in the western highlands, sometimes known as Arthur's Seat,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhillwalking.com/articles/page.php?id=3381|title=Hill Names and the John Smith Question|date=April 2011|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref> and Arthur's Chair on the ridge called [[Stone Arthur]] in the Cumbrian lake district.

It was in these areas that [[James Hutton]] observed that the deposition of the [[sedimentary]] and formation of the [[igneous]] rocks must have occurred at different ages and in different ways than the thinking of that time said they did. It is possible to see a particular area known as Hutton's Section in the Salisbury Crags where the magma forced its way through the sedimentary rocks above it to form the [[dolerite]] sills that can be seen in the Section.\n\nThe hill bears a strong resemblance to the [[Cavehill]] in [[Belfast]] in terms of its geology and proximity to a major urban site.\n\n== Human history ==\n[[File:Panorama SalisburyCrags.jpg|thumb|Panorama of Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat]]\nA [[hill fort]] occupies the summit of Arthur's Seat and the subsidiary hill, Crow Hill.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/52561/details/edinburgh+holyrood+park+arthur+s+seat/ | title = Edinburgh, Holyrood Park, Arthur'sSeat | accessdate = 5 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHill fort defences are visible round the main massif of Arthur's Seat at [[Dunsapie Hill]] and above [[Samson's Ribs]], in the latter cases certainly of prehistoric date.

The purpose has remained a mystery ever since the discovery. A strong contemporary belief was that they were made for witchcraft, though more recently it has been suggested that they might be connected with the murders committed by [[Burke and Hare]] in 1828.<ref>S P Menefee, A D C Simpson, The West Port Murders and the Miniature Coffins From Arthur's Seat in The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, New Series vol.3, Edinburgh 1994, pp.63\u201381</ref> There were 16 known victims of the serial-killers plus the first person sold \"to the doctors\", namely a man who had died of natural causes. However, the murder victims were primarily female, while the eight surviving figures are male. Alternatively, the coffins may have represented the 16 bodies sold to the doctors, plus that of the final victim who remained unburied at the time of the duo's arrest, but was, as a destitute beggar, very likely dissected in any case. The surviving coffins are now displayed in Edinburgh's [[Royal Museum]].\n\nThe prominence of Arthur's Seat over Edinburgh has attracted various groups and has a particular significance to the history of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], because this is where the nation of Scotland was dedicated in 1840 \"for the preaching of the gospel\".<ref>{{citation |last= Evans |first= Richard L. |authorlink= Richard L.

Having fallen from his horse and about to be gored, he had a vision of a cross appearing between the animal's antlers, before it inexplicably turned away, leaving him unharmed. David, believing his life had been spared through divine intervention, founded [[Holyrood Abbey]] on the spot. The burgh arms of the [[Canongate]] display the head of the stag with the cross framed by its antlers.\n\nThe slopes of the hill facing Holyrood are where young girls in Edinburgh traditionally bathe their faces in the dew on [[May Day]] to make themselves more beautiful.  The poem \"Caller Water\" (fresh cool water), written by [[Robert Fergusson]] in 1773, contains the lines:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nOn May-day, in a fairy ring,\nWe've seen them round St Anthon's spring,\nFrae grass the caller dew draps wring\nTo weet their een,\nAnd water clear as crystal spring\nTo synd them clean<ref>[https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/caller-water Full text for ''Caller Watter'' on Poetry Nook].

Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest and simplest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above [[Dunsapie Loch]].

It is possible to see a particular area known as Hutton's Section in the Salisbury Crags where the magma forced its way through the sedimentary rocks above it to form the [[dolerite]] sills that can be seen in the Section.\n\nThe hill bears a strong resemblance to the [[Cavehill]] in [[Belfast]] in terms of its geology and proximity to a major urban site.\n\n== Human history ==\n[[File:Panorama SalisburyCrags.jpg|thumb|Panorama of Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat]]\nA [[hill fort]] occupies the summit of Arthur's Seat and the subsidiary hill, Crow Hill.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/52561/details/edinburgh+holyrood+park+arthur+s+seat/ | title = Edinburgh, Holyrood Park, Arthur'sSeat | accessdate = 5 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHill fort defences are visible round the main massif of Arthur's Seat at [[Dunsapie Hill]] and above [[Samson's Ribs]], in the latter cases certainly of prehistoric date.

The purpose has remained a mystery ever since the discovery. A strong contemporary belief was that they were made for witchcraft, though more recently it has been suggested that they might be connected with the murders committed by [[Burke and Hare]] in 1828.<ref>S P Menefee, A D C Simpson, The West Port Murders and the Miniature Coffins From Arthur's Seat in The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, New Series vol.3, Edinburgh 1994, pp.63\u201381</ref> There were 16 known victims of the serial-killers plus the first person sold \"to the doctors\", namely a man who had died of natural causes. However, the murder victims were primarily female, while the eight surviving figures are male. Alternatively, the coffins may have represented the 16 bodies sold to the doctors, plus that of the final victim who remained unburied at the time of the duo's arrest, but was, as a destitute beggar, very likely dissected in any case. The surviving coffins are now displayed in Edinburgh's [[Royal Museum]].\n\nThe prominence of Arthur's Seat over Edinburgh has attracted various groups and has a particular significance to the history of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], because this is where the nation of Scotland was dedicated in 1840 \"for the preaching of the gospel\".<ref>{{citation |last= Evans |first= Richard L. |authorlink= Richard L.

Having fallen from his horse and about to be gored, he had a vision of a cross appearing between the animal's antlers, before it inexplicably turned away, leaving him unharmed. David, believing his life had been spared through divine intervention, founded [[Holyrood Abbey]] on the spot. The burgh arms of the [[Canongate]] display the head of the stag with the cross framed by its antlers.\n\nThe slopes of the hill facing Holyrood are where young girls in Edinburgh traditionally bathe their faces in the dew on [[May Day]] to make themselves more beautiful.  The poem \"Caller Water\" (fresh cool water), written by [[Robert Fergusson]] in 1773, contains the lines:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nOn May-day, in a fairy ring,\nWe've seen them round St Anthon's spring,\nFrae grass the caller dew draps wring\nTo weet their een,\nAnd water clear as crystal spring\nTo synd them clean<ref>[https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/caller-water Full text for ''Caller Watter'' on Poetry Nook].

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves wanna be special forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by reject infantry officers [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh.

Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]].

Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the [[Military Medal]] (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], p.238.</ref><ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.318.</ref> Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] during the war.<ref>[[#refOdgers1974|Odgers 1974]], p.87.</ref><ref>[[#refHaran2004|Haran 2004]], p.26.</ref>\n\nWhen the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon. The final mission undertaken by ADGs in Vietnam was to provide security for the evacuation.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.597</ref> The \"last\" evacuation aircraft was severely overloaded and four ADGs were left on the tarmac at [[Tan Son Nhut]] airfield, each armed with a pistol and four rounds of ammunition; a C-130 was diverted from Thailand to evacuate them later in the day.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.601.</ref> Over 350 ADGs served in Vietnam,<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> six being killed in the conflict.<ref>[[#refADGAssoc|Airfield Defence Guard Association website]] Accessed on 8 July 2008</ref> In addition to the MM awarded to Powers, GRDEFOs and ADGs were awarded an [[MBE (Order of the British Empire)|MBE]], eight [[mention in dispatches|mentions in dispatches]] and four [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]s of the ten awarded to RAAF members.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], pp.242\u2013243.</ref>\n\n===1972\u20131999===\nAfter withdrawal from Vietnam the ADG mustering was reduced in numbers, with Rifle Flights posted to RAAF Bases Amberley, Fairbairn, Richmond and Williamtown and ADGs manning instructional posts at other establishments.<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.32.</ref>\nAlthough the RAAF contemplated disbanding the mustering in the mid-1980s, the years between the Vietnam War and the 1999 deployment to East Timor were spent consolidating tactics and techniques such as reconnaissance skills and Quick Reaction Force (QRF) operations. 2AFDS was reformed on 17 March 1983<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.1634</ref> with the headquarters located at RAAF Base Richmond and the Rifle Flights remaining dispersed; the unit was eventually consolidated at RAAF Base Amberley in January 1989. It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF).

Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR).

Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School]] (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank.

For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units. Within [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Combat Support Group]], [[No. 95 Wing RAAF|No. 95 Wing]] commands the three Security Forces Squadrons.<ref name=structure>{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/?RAAF-pgmUdI54oD/7ZI5LVP3JEZ6o3NEOB/BC |title=Structure of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n*[[No. 1 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Security Forces Squadron]] (1SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Amberley]]\n*[[No. 2 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Security Forces Squadron]] (2SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Williamtown]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref>\n* [[No. 3 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Security Forces Squadron]] (3 SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].<ref name=structure/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/air-force/airfield-defence-guard |title=Airfield Defence Guard |work=Defence Jobs |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nSecurity Forces Squadrons are deployable tactical units, broadly comparable in size and structure to an infantry independent rifle company, capable of providing force protection for RAAF elements or other formations. 2AFDS comprises four Rifle Flights and a Support Flight; each Rifle Flight consists of four 10-man Sections and a Headquarters element of one GRDEFO, a SGT and a signaller. Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1929\u20131939===\nFrom 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases.

It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF).

The additional manpower also allowed the squadron to assume responsibility for the Dili heliport in December.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.94.</ref>\n\n2AFDS was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation and the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader J.D. Leo, received the Distinguished Service Medal for performance during [[Operation Warden]].<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.133.</ref>\n\n===Solomon Islands===\nADGs and GRDEFOs deployed to Henderson Field, Honiara as part of the RAAF component of Joint Task Force 635 on [[Operation Anode]], the ADF contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)]]. Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR).

ADGs continue to be deployed to the [[Middle East Area of Operations]] (MEAO) in small numbers to provide specialist support to operations.\n\n===Other operations===\nIn addition to the major campaigns listed above, in recent years ADGs have been involved in a range of smaller scale operations. These have included [[Operation Gold]], the provision of ADF support to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; [[Operation Deluge]], the provision of security to the 2007 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum meetings in Sydney; and [[Operation Ramp]],<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsSep72006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 15 July 2008</ref> the evacuation of Australian and foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006 during the conflict between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]].\n\n2AFDS was presented with a squadron [[War flag|standard]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia]], Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], at RAAF Base Amberley on 19 May 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Stackpool |first=Andrew |url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&iid=48995&startpage=6&crd=0&searchKey=2AFDS |title=Rain fails to spoil colourful days |accessdate=13 January 2015 |newspaper=Air Force News |date=9 June 2011 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nMembers are enlisted as ADGs in the Permanent Air Force for an initial period of service of four years; those joining the Ground Defence Reserve Group are employed on full-time service for 11 months, followed by 4 years part-time service. Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School]] (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within [[Australia's Federation Guard]], as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at [[No. 1 Recruit Training Unit RAAF|No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU)]], [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Base Wagga Wagga]] and Officer Training School (OTS), [[RAAF Base East Sale]].\n\n==Duties and mission roles==\n[[File:Royal Australian Air Force security forces conduct a patrol through Tarin Kowt in March 2013.jpg|thumb|RAAF security force personnel patrolling through [[Tarin Kowt]] in Afghanistan during 2013]]\nADGs form the basis of the Air Force's ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

It is usually made during [[Diwali]] or [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]], [[Onam]], [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]] and other Hindu festivals in the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent.]] Designs are passed from one generation to the next, keeping both the [[art]] form and the [[tradition]] alive.\n\nThe purpose of rangoli is to feel strength, generoooosity, and it is thought to bring good luck. Design depictions may also vary as they reflect traditions, folklore, and practices that are unique to each area. It is traditionally done by girls or women. Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and gatherings.\n\nRangoli designs can be simple geometric shapes, deity impressions, or flower and petal shapes (appropriate for the given celebrations), but they can also be very elaborate designs crafted by numerous people. The base material is usually dry or wet powdered rice or dry flour, to which [[sindooram]] (vermilion), [[Turmeric|pasupu]] (turmeric) and other natural colours can be added. Chemical colors are a modern variation. Other materials include red brick powder and even flowers and petals, as in the case of flower rangolis.\n\n==Etymology==\nFrom Sanskrit word \"\u0930\u0919\u094d\u0917\" which means ''color''. ''Rangoli'' is derived from the Sanskrit word \u2018''rangavalli\u2019.''\n\nThe various names for this art form and similar practices include ''muggu'' (\u0c2e\u0c41\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c41) in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]], r''angoli/rangole'' (\u0cb0\u0c82\u0c97\u0ccb\u0cb2\u0cbf/\u0cb0\u0c82\u0c97\u0ccb\u0cb2\u0cc6) in [[Karnataka]], [[kolam]] (\u0b95\u0bcb\u0bb2\u0bae\u0bcd) in Tamil Nadu, ''mandana''/''mandas'' (\u092e\u093e\u0901\u0921\u0928\u093e) in [[Rajasthan]], c''howkpurana'' (\u091b\u094b\u0935\u0915\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093e) in [[Chhattisgarh]], ''[[alpana]]''/''alpona'' ([[:bn:\u0986\u09b2\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09be|\u0986\u09b2\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09be]]) in [[West Bengal]], ''muruja''/''marje'' (\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093e) or ''[[Jhoti chita|jhoti]]'' (\u091d\u094b\u091f\u0940) or ''[[Jhoti chita|chita]]'' (\u091a\u093f\u0924\u093e) in [[Odisha]], ''haripan''/''aripan'' (\u0906\u0930\u093f\u092a\u0928\u093e) in [[Bihar]], ''chowkpujan'' (\u091a\u094c\u0915\u092a\u0942\u091c\u0928) in [[Uttar Pradesh]], ''[[chowk poorana]]'' in Punjab, ''pookkalam'' (\u0d2a\u0d42\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d33\u0d02) in [[Kerala]],Rangoli/ ''sanskarbharti''/''bharti'' in [[Maharashtra]], ''saathiya''/''gahuli'' in [[Gujarat]], and ''aipan''/''eipan'' (\u0910\u092a\u0923) in [[Uttarakhand]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/nov/06sld4.htm|title=Kolams, chowkpurana, madana, aripana...|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Rediff|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Rangoli in different states==\nIn middle India mainly in Chhattisgarh Rangoli is called Chaook and is generally drawn at the entrance of a house or any other building. Dried rice flour or other forms of white dust powder is used for drawing Chaooks. Although there are numerous traditional Chaook patterns, many more can be created depending on the creativity of the person who draws it. It is considered auspicious as it signifies showering of good luck and prosperity on the house and in the family. It is not drawn like a picture. Patterns are created based on certain systems. Generally, women get up early in the morning and clean the area just outside the entrance of their houses with cow dung, sprinkle the area with water and draw the Chaook. In Maharashtra and Karnataka, rangolis are drawn on the doors of homes so that evil forces attempting to enter are repelled. During the festival of [[Onam]] in Kerala, flowers are laid down for each of the ten days of the celebration, the design growing larger and more complex every day. In Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and many parts of Maharashtra, the Rangoli or [[Kolam]] is drawn upon the ground or floor daily. The designs are geometric and symmetrical \u092e\u0942\u0932\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0903 shapes but the materials used are similar rangoli: rice flour or slurry is used. In Rajasthan the [[Mandana Paintings|Mandana]] are painted on walls. Mmandne, various festivals, major festivals and can be categorized based on seasons. Different shapes depending on the size of it also can be shared. Kumaon's \"writing beat 'or in a variety of plotting symbols Thapa, artistic designs, Bellbutoan is used. Alikhthap of society apart \u2013 separated by different groups \u2013 different icons and art media is used. In Odisha, the Murja is put at the aangan of every home in front of the Tulsi plant called \"Tulasi chahura\". The Rangoli patterns mostly are dedicated to Lord Krishna and Lord Jagannath. The Murja festival is observed during the auspicious month of Kartika ending on Kartika Purnima.\n\nThe Rangoli's most important element is being colourful. These are auspicious symbols that have a central role in the design. The design for generations are passed on as they are made \u2013 and is required to make these symbols. Traditionally, each new generation learns the art and thus a family keeps the tradition intact. Some major symbols used in Rangoli are the lotus flower, its leaves, mango, Tue vase, fish, different kind of birds like parrots, swans, peacocks, and human figures and foliage. Oftentimes Rangoli is made on special occasions like Diwali. Some special patterns for Diwali Rangoli are the Diya also called Deep, Ganesha, Lakshmi, flowers or birds of India.\n\nThe second key element is using the materials used to make the rangoli. The materials used are easily found everywhere. Therefore, this art is prevalent in all homes, rich or poor. Normally the major ingredients used to make rangoli are \u2013 Pise rice solution, the dried powder made from the leaves color, charcoal, burned soil was, wood sawdust, etc..\n\nThe third important element is the background. Rangoli use the background of a clear floor or wall or Llype is used. Rangoli can be made in a yard in the middle, corners, or as a bell is created around.\n\nDehri gateway is a tradition of making rangoli. God's seat, depending on lamp, place of worship and sacrifice on the altar is a tradition of decorating rangoli. With time, imagination and innovative ideas in Rangoli art is also incorporated. Hospitality and tourism has also had its effect and rangoli has been commercially developed in places such as hotels. Its traditional charm, artistry and importance still remain.\n\nRangoli is also created using coloured rice, dry flour, flower petals, turmeric (pasupu), Vermillion (Sindooram) and coloured sand. The patterns include the face of Hindu deities, geometric shapes peacock motifs, and round floral designs. Many of these motifs are traditional and are handed down by the previous generations. This makes rangoli a representation of India's rich heritage and the fact that it is a land of festivals and colour. People celebrate rangoli with davali patterns.\n\n==Creation of Rangoli==\nThere are two primary ways to make a Rangoli, dry and wet, referring to the materials used to create the outline and (if desired) fill that outline with colour. Using a white material like [[chalk]], sand, paint or flour, the artist marks a centre-point on the ground and cardinal points around it, usually in a square, hexagon or circle depending on region and personal preference. Ramifying that initially-simple pattern creates what is often an intricate and beautiful design. Motifs from nature (leaves, petals, feathers) and [[pattern|geometric patterns]] are common. Less common but by no means rare are representational forms (like a [[peacock]], icon or landscape). \"Readymade Rangoli\" patterns, often as [[stencil]]s or stickers, are becoming common, making it easier to create detailed or precise designs.\n\nOnce the outline is complete, the artist may choose to illuminate it with colour, again using either wet or dry ingredients like paints, coloured rice-water, gypsum powder, coloured sand or [[pigment|dry pigments]]. The artist might also choose unprocessed materials like seeds, grains, spices, leaves or flower petals to achieve lifelike hues. Modern materials like [[crayon]]s, dyes or dyed fabrics, [[acrylic paints]] and artificial colouring agents are also becoming common, allowing for brilliant and vibrant colour choices. A newer but less artificial method involves using cement coloured with marble powder. This rather precise method requires training, but beautiful portraits can be drawn in this medium.\n\nShape, design and material can be influenced by regional traditions. A square grid is common in North India as is a hexagonal grid in South India; [[Onam]] Rangolis are typically circular. In North India, the colour is most often based on gypsum (chirodi), in South India on rice flour and Onam Rangolis are typically flower based. The rapid and widespread migration and mixing of people within India can be seen by the way these styles are now freely adopted and mixed across the country. It is also becoming common to see experimentation like sawdust-based floating Rangolis, freeform designs, and exotic materials.\n\nIt is particularly notable that the Tamil version of the Rangoli, the [[Kolam]], prizes symmetry, complexity, precision, and intricacy rather than the flamboyance of Rangolis found in North India. Many people find it enjoyable to try and figure out how such intricate designs are drawn with a grid, and hence, it allows the mind to be exercised.\n\n==Faith and beliefs==\n[[File:Rangoli_of_pongal_festival_in_India.jpg|thumb|200px|A rangoli made in front of a house]]\nIn India, there is a prevalent myth that [[Andal|Andaal]] worshipped Lord [[Thirumaal]] and was married to him in the month of Margazhi. During this month, unmarried girls get up before dawn and draw a Rangoli to welcome the God Thirumal. Mentions of rangoli creation are also found in Hindu mythology. There are also references of Rangoli in legends such as Ramayana - at Sita's wedding pavilion where there is a discussion about Rangoli. Cultural development of Rangoli in the South originated in the era of the Chola Rulers.\nThere are modern and traditional rangoli designs. The designs are usually inspired by nature, but they can also be in the form of abstract art.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Rangoli in India.jpg|Rangoli is either left as uncoloured drawing or it is filled with various coloured powders\nFile:HiH - Events - World Childs Prize Vote- 08-03-18 - 33 (2485514943).jpg|Rangoli of Global Events\nFile:Rangoli.jpg|Rangoli in Singapore\nFile:Alpana 2.jpg|Alpana (painted Rangoli) in Rajshahi, Bangladesh\nFile:Aruppukottai Kolam.jpg|Rangoli of Peacock in [[Tamil Nadu]]\nFile:Rangoli.hrushikesh.3030.jpg|Nature Scene in Rangoli during a [[Vijayadashami]] festival, in Maharashtra\nFile:Birds of feather-Wikimedia-GNUnify2013 17.jpg|A Tux rangoli by students at [[GNUnify]]'13, Pune\nFile:rangoli filled.jpg|Rangoli is drawn in front of the house especially on festival days\nFile:Rangoli art.jpg|Rangoli in making\nFile:Rangoli being prepared by a Rangoli mould selling vendor, Bangalore.webm|Rangoli being prepared by a Rangoli mould vendor in Bangalore\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kolam]]\n*[[Chowk poorana]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Rangoli}}\n* Selin, Helaine (2008).

A square grid is common in North India as is a hexagonal grid in South India; [[Onam]] Rangolis are typically circular. In North India, the colour is most often based on gypsum (chirodi), in South India on rice flour and Onam Rangolis are typically flower based. The rapid and widespread migration and mixing of people within India can be seen by the way these styles are now freely adopted and mixed across the country. It is also becoming common to see experimentation like sawdust-based floating Rangolis, freeform designs, and exotic materials.\n\nIt is particularly notable that the Tamil version of the Rangoli, the [[Kolam]], prizes symmetry, complexity, precision, and intricacy rather than the flamboyance of Rangolis found in North India. Many people find it enjoyable to try and figure out how such intricate designs are drawn with a grid, and hence, it allows the mind to be exercised.\n\n==Faith and beliefs==\n[[File:Rangoli_of_pongal_festival_in_India.jpg|thumb|200px|A rangoli made in front of a house]]\nIn India, there is a prevalent myth that [[Andal|Andaal]] worshipped Lord [[Thirumaal]] and was married to him in the month of Margazhi. During this month, unmarried girls get up before dawn and draw a Rangoli to welcome the God Thirumal. Mentions of rangoli creation are also found in Hindu mythology. There are also references of Rangoli in legends such as Ramayana - at Sita's wedding pavilion where there is a discussion about Rangoli. Cultural development of Rangoli in the South originated in the era of the Chola Rulers.\nThere are modern and traditional rangoli designs. The designs are usually inspired by nature, but they can also be in the form of abstract art.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Rangoli in India.jpg|Rangoli is either left as uncoloured drawing or it is filled with various coloured powders\nFile:HiH - Events - World Childs Prize Vote- 08-03-18 - 33 (2485514943).jpg|Rangoli of Global Events\nFile:Rangoli.jpg|Rangoli in Singapore\nFile:Alpana 2.jpg|Alpana (painted Rangoli) in Rajshahi, Bangladesh\nFile:Aruppukottai Kolam.jpg|Rangoli of Peacock in [[Tamil Nadu]]\nFile:Rangoli.hrushikesh.3030.jpg|Nature Scene in Rangoli during a [[Vijayadashami]] festival, in Maharashtra\nFile:Birds of feather-Wikimedia-GNUnify2013 17.jpg|A Tux rangoli by students at [[GNUnify]]'13, Pune\nFile:rangoli filled.jpg|Rangoli is drawn in front of the house especially on festival days\nFile:Rangoli art.jpg|Rangoli in making\nFile:Rangoli being prepared by a Rangoli mould selling vendor, Bangalore.webm|Rangoli being prepared by a Rangoli mould vendor in Bangalore\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kolam]]\n*[[Chowk poorana]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Rangoli}}\n* Selin, Helaine (2008).
