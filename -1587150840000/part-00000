The Chaldean Catholic clergy numbered 248 priests; they were assisted by the monks of the Congregation of [[Rabban Hormizd (Saint)|St. Hormizd]], who numbered about one hundred. There were about 52 Assyrian Chaldean schools (not counting those conducted by Latin nuns and missionaries). At [[Mosul]] there was a patriarchal seminary, distinct from the Chaldean seminary directed by the Dominicans. The total number of Assyrian Chaldean Christians as by 2010 was 490,371,{{sfn|CNEWA 2016}} 78,000 of whom are in the [[Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Mosul|Diocese of Mosul]].\n\nThe current patriarch considers [[Baghdad]] as the principal city of his see. His title of \"[[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Patriarch of Babylon]]\" results from the identification of Baghdad with ancient [[Babylon]] (however Baghdad is 55 miles north of the ancient city of Babylon and corresponds to northern [[Babylonia]]). However, the Chaldean patriarch resides habitually at [[Mosul]] in the north, and reserves for himself the direct administration of this diocese and that of Baghdad.\n\nThere are five archbishops (resident respectively at [[Basra]], [[Diyarbak\u0131r]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Salmas]] and [[Urmia]]) and seven bishops. Eight patriarchal vicars govern the small Assyrian Chaldean communities dispersed throughout Turkey and Iran. The Chaldean clergy, especially the monks of [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]], have established some missionary stations in the mountain districts dominated by [[The Assyrian Church of the East]]. Three dioceses are in Iran, the others in Turkey.\n\nThe liturgical language of the Chaldean Catholic Church is [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and the liturgy of the Chaldean Church is written in the [[Syriac alphabet]]. The literary revival in the early 20th century was mostly due to the [[Lazarist]] [[Paul Bedjan|Pere Bedjan]], an ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Chaldean Catholic from northwestern Iran. He popularized the ancient chronicles, the lives of [[Assyria]]n saints and martyrs, and even works of the ancient Assyrian doctors among Assyrians of all denominations, including Chaldean Catholics, Syriac Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East and Assyrian Protestants.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03559a.htm\n|title = New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia }}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Gulf War]], Chaldean Catholics numbered approximately 400,000{{sfn|CNEWA 2016}} of Iraq's estimated 800,000-1,000,000 [[Assyrian people|Assyrian Christians]], with smaller numbers found among the Assyrian Christian communities of northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Georgia and Armenia.{{sfn|BBC 2008}} Perhaps the best known Iraqi Chaldean Catholic is the former Iraqi deputy prime minister, [[Tariq Aziz]] (real name Michael Youhanna).{{sfn|BBC 2008}}\n\nHundreds of thousands of [[Assyrian Christians]] of all denominations have left Iraq since the ousting of [[Saddam Hussein]] in 2003.

The Chaldean Catholic clergy numbered 248 priests; they were assisted by the monks of the Congregation of [[Rabban Hormizd (Saint)|St. Hormizd]], who numbered about one hundred. There were about 52 Assyrian Chaldean schools (not counting those conducted by Latin nuns and missionaries). At [[Mosul]] there was a patriarchal seminary, distinct from the Chaldean seminary directed by the Dominicans. The total number of Assyrian Chaldean Christians as by 2010 was 490,371,{{sfn|CNEWA 2016}} 78,000 of whom are in the [[Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Mosul|Diocese of Mosul]].\n\nThe current patriarch considers [[Baghdad]] as the principal city of his see. His title of \"[[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Patriarch of Babylon]]\" results from the identification of Baghdad with ancient [[Babylon]] (however Baghdad is 55 miles north of the ancient city of Babylon and corresponds to northern [[Babylonia]]). However, the Chaldean patriarch resides habitually at [[Mosul]] in the north, and reserves for himself the direct administration of this diocese and that of Baghdad.\n\nThere are five archbishops (resident respectively at [[Basra]], [[Diyarbak\u0131r]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Salmas]] and [[Urmia]]) and seven bishops. Eight patriarchal vicars govern the small Assyrian Chaldean communities dispersed throughout Turkey and Iran. The Chaldean clergy, especially the monks of [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]], have established some missionary stations in the mountain districts dominated by [[The Assyrian Church of the East]]. Three dioceses are in Iran, the others in Turkey.\n\nThe liturgical language of the Chaldean Catholic Church is [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and the liturgy of the Chaldean Church is written in the [[Syriac alphabet]]. The literary revival in the early 20th century was mostly due to the [[Lazarist]] [[Paul Bedjan|Pere Bedjan]], an ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Chaldean Catholic from northwestern Iran.

It is sung twice in the stage musical.\n\n==Overview==\nThe song is first sung in Act I by [[Enjolras]] and the other students at thhe ABC Cafe as they prepare themselves to launch a rebellion in the streets of Paris during the funeral procession of General [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque]]. The song is sung again in the finale as the final song of the musical. This second version, which immediately follows a number by [[Jean Valjean]] and others, is sung by the entire cast with revised lyrics, and becomes progressively louder with each stanza.\n\nThe song is a revolutionary call for people to overcome adversity. The \"barricades\" referred to in the song are erected by the rebel students in the streets of Paris in the musical's second act. They are to draw the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] into combat and ignite a civilian uprising to overthrow the government, but their rebellion eventually fails.\n\n===Use in various languages===\n*The original French version of the musical did not end with the full [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] singing this song; It only later became the musical's finale song when it was revamped for the English-language version.\n*At the special ''Les Miserables'' 10th Anniversary Concert in 1995, ''Do You Hear the People Sing?'' was sung by 17 different actors who had played Jean Valjean around the world. Each actor sang a line of the song in his own language.
