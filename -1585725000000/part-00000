Also known as '''Red Army''', the Soviet Ground Forces was not constitutionally disbanded until 25 December in 1993 in favor of the [[Russian Ground Forces|Ground Forces]] of the [[Russian Federation]].\n\nUntil 25 February 1946, it was known as the [[Red Army]], established by decree on 15 (28) January 1918 \"to protect the population, territorial integrity and civil liberties in the territory of the Soviet state.\" The [[Strategic Missile Forces]], [[Soviet Air Defense Forces|Air Defence Forces]] and [[Soviet Air Forces|Air Forces]] (ranking first, third and fourth within Soviet Armed Forces; Ground Forces holding second place) were part of the Soviet Army in addition to the Ground Forces. The former official name ''Red Army'' continued to be used as a nickname by both sides throughout the [[Cold War]].\n\n==After World War II==\nAt [[Aftermath of World War II|the end]] of [[World War II]] the Red Army had over 500 rifle [[Division (military)|divisions]] and about a tenth that number of tank formations.<ref name=\"Urban1985\">{{cite book|last=Urban|first=Mark L.|authorlink=Mark Urban|title=Soviet land power|publisher=Ian Allan|location=London|year=1985|isbn=978-0-7110-1442-8}}</ref> Their experience of war gave the Soviets such faith in tank forces that the infantry force was cut by two-thirds. The [[Tank corps (Soviet)|Tank Corps]] of the late war period were converted to tank divisions, and from 1957 the rifle divisions were converted to motor rifle divisions (MRDs). MRDs had three motorized rifle [[regiment]]s and a tank regiment, for a total of ten motor rifle [[battalion]]s and six tank battalions; tank divisions had the proportions reversed.\n\nThe Land Forces Chief Command was created for the first time in March 1946. Four years later it was disbanded, only to be formed again in 1955. In March 1964 the Chief Command was again disbanded but recreated in November 1967.<ref name=b1>''Armed Forces of the Russian Federation \u2013 Land Forces'', Agency Voeninform of the Defence Ministry of the RF (2007) p. 14</ref>\n\n[[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Georgy Zhukov]] became Chief of the Soviet Ground Forces in March 1946, but was quickly succeeded by [[Ivan Konev]] in July, who remained as such until 1950, when the position of Chief of the Soviet Ground Forces was abolished for five years, an organisational gap that \"probably was associated in some manner with the [[Korean War]]\".<ref name=\"ScottScott1979\">{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Harriet Fast|last2=Scott|first2=William Fontaine|title=The armed forces of the USSR|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|year=1979|isbn=978-0-89158-276-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/armedforcesofuss00scot/page/142 142]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/armedforcesofuss00scot/page/142}}</ref> From 1945 to 1948, the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] were reduced from about 11.3 million to about 2.8 million men,<ref>[[William Eldridge Odom|William E.

Elsewhere, they may have assisted the [[NKVD]] in suppressing anti-Soviet resistance in [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|Western Ukraine]] (1941\u201355) and the [[Forest Brothers|Baltic states]].<ref>Feskov et al 2013, p. 99</ref> Soviet troops, including the [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th Army]], remained at [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]] and [[Dalian]] on the northeast Chinese coast until 1955. Control was then handed over to the new Chinese communist government.\n\nSoviet Army forces on USSR territory were apportioned among military districts. There were 32 of them in 1945. Sixteen districts remained from the mid-1970s to the end of the USSR (see table at right). Yet, the greatest Soviet Army concentration was in the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]], which suppressed the anti-Soviet [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]. East European Groups of Forces were the [[Northern Group of Forces]] in Poland, and the [[Southern Group of Forces]] in [[Hungary]], which put down the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. In 1958, Soviet troops were withdrawn from [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Romania]]. The [[Central Group of Forces]] in Czechoslovakia was established after [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Warsaw Pact intervention against the Prague Spring]] of 1968. In 1969, at the east end of the Soviet Union, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] (1969), prompted establishment of a 16th military district, the Central Asian Military District, at [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]], Kazakhstan.<ref>Scott and Scott (1979) p. 176</ref> In 1979, the Soviet Union [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|entered Afghanistan]], to support its Communist government, provoking a 10-year [[Afghan mujahideen]] guerrilla resistance.\n\n==Cold War==\n[[File:Soviet big 7.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. assessment of the seven most important items of Soviet combat equipment in 1981]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = '''Soviet Military Districts 1990'''<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Soviet Army|last=Schofield |first=Carey |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Headline Book Publishing PLC |location=London |isbn=0-7472-0418-7 |pages=236\u2013237 |url= }}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n* [[Leningrad Military District]]\n* [[Belorussian Military District]]\n* [[Baltic Military District]]\n* [[Carpathian Military District]]\n* [[Kiev Military District]]\n* [[Odessa Military District]]\n* [[Moscow Military District]]\n* [[Volga-Urals Military District]]\n* [[North Caucasus Military District]]\n* [[Transcaucasian Military District]]\n* [[Turkestan Military District]]\n* [[Siberian Military District]]\n* [[Transbaikal Military District]]\n* [[Far Eastern Military District]]\n* The Central Asian Military District*\n *(dissolved in 1988 with the Volga and Urals Military Districts merged around 1991.)\n{{col-end}}\n | source =\n | width  = 30%\n | align  = right\n}}\nThroughout the [[Cold War]] (1947\u20131991), Western intelligence estimates calculated that the Soviet strength remained ca. 2.8 million to ca. 5.3 million men.<ref>Odom (1998) p. 39</ref> To maintain said strength range, Soviet law minimally required a three-year military service obligation from every able man of military age, until 1967, when the Ground Forces reduced it to a two-year draft obligation.<ref>Scott and Scott (1979) p. 305</ref>\n\nBy the middle of the 1980s, the Ground Forces contained [[List of Soviet Army divisions 1989\u201391|about 210 divisions]]. About three-quarters were motor rifle divisions and the remainder tank divisions.<ref>M J Orr, The Russian Ground Forces and Reform 1992\u20132002, January 2003, Conflict Studies Research Centre, UK Defence Academy, Sandhurst, p. 1</ref> There were also a large number of artillery divisions, separate artillery brigades, engineer formations, and other combat support formations. However, only relatively few formations were fully war ready. Three readiness categories, A, B, and V, after the first three letters of the Cyrillic alphabet, were in force. The Category A divisions were certified combat-ready and were fully equipped. B and V divisions were lower-readiness, 50\u201375% (requiring at least 72 hours of preparation) and 10\u201333% (requiring two months) respectively.<ref>M J Orr, 2003, p. 1 and David C Isby, Weapons and Tactics of the Soviet Army, Jane's Publishing Company, 1988, p. 30</ref> The internal military districts usually contained only one or two A divisions, with the remainder B and V series formations.\n\nSoviet planning for most of the [[Cold War]] period would have seen [[Army (Soviet Army)|Armies]] of four to five divisions operating in [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]] made up of around four armies (and roughly equivalent to Western [[Army Group]]s). In February 1979, the first of the new High Commands in the Strategic Directions were created at [[Ulan-Ude]].<ref>[[Viktor Suvorov]], [[Inside the Soviet Army]], Hamish Hamilton, 1982, gives this title, Odom (1998) also discusses this development. Specific details on the Strategic Directions can be seen at Michael Holm, [http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/gkv/gkv.htm High Commands].</ref> These new headquarters controlled multiple Fronts, and usually a Soviet Navy Fleet. In September 1984, three more were established to control multi-Front operations in Europe (the Western and South-Western Strategic Directions) and at [[Baku]] to handle southern operations.\n\nIn 1955, the Soviet Union signed the [[Warsaw Pact]] with its East European socialist allies, establishing military coordination between Soviet forces and their socialist counterparts. The Soviet Army created and directed the Eastern European armies in its image for the remainder of the Cold War, shaping them for a potential confrontation with the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)]]. After 1956, Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reduced the Ground Forces to build up the [[Strategic Rocket Forces]] \u2014 emphasizing the armed forces' [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] capabilities. He removed Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] from the [[Politburo]] in 1957, for opposing these reductions in the Ground Forces.<ref>see [[Viktor Suvorov]], ''[[Inside the Soviet Army]]''</ref> Nonetheless, Soviet forces possessed too few theater-level nuclear weapons to fulfil war-plan requirements until the mid-1980s.<ref>[[William Eldridge Odom|William E.

Soviet President Gorbachev resigned on 25 December 1991; the next day, the Supreme Soviet dissolved itself, officially dissolving the USSR on 26 December 1991. During the next 18 months, inter-republican political efforts to transform the Army of the Soviet Union into the CIS military failed; eventually, the forces stationed in the republics formally became the militaries of the respective republican governments.\n\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Soviet Army dissolved and the USSR's [[successor state]]s divided its assets among themselves. The divide mostly occurred along a regional basis, with Soviet soldiers from Russia becoming part of the new [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]], while Soviet soldiers originating from [[Kazakhstan]] became part of the new [[Military of Kazakhstan|Kazakh Army]]. As a result, the bulk of the Soviet Ground Forces, including most of the [[Scud]] and [[Scaleboard]] [[surface-to-surface missile]] forces, became incorporated in the [[Russian Ground Forces]].<ref>1992 estimates showed five SSM brigades with 96 missile vehicles in [[Belarus]] and 12 SSM brigades with 204 missile vehicles in [[Ukraine]], compared to 24 SSM brigades with over 900 missile vehicles under Russian Ground Forces' control, some in other former Soviet republics).

Military forces garrisoned in Eastern Europe (including the [[Baltic states]]) gradually returned home between 1992 and 1994. This [[List of Soviet Army divisions 1989\u201391|list of Soviet Army divisions]] sketches some of the fates of the individual parts of the Ground Forces.\n\nIn mid March 1992, Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] appointed himself as the new Russian minister of defence, marking a crucial step in the creation of the new [[Military of Russia|Russian armed forces]], comprising the bulk of what was still left of the military. The last vestiges of the old Soviet command structure were finally dissolved in June 1993, when the paper [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] Military Headquarters was reorganized as a staff for facilitating CIS military cooperation.<ref name=\"Matlock1995\">{{cite book|last=Matlock|first=Jack F.|authorlink=Jack F.

About three-quarters were motor rifle divisions and the remainder tank divisions.<ref>M J Orr, The Russian Ground Forces and Reform 1992\u20132002, January 2003, Conflict Studies Research Centre, UK Defence Academy, Sandhurst, p. 1</ref> There were also a large number of artillery divisions, separate artillery brigades, engineer formations, and other combat support formations. However, only relatively few formations were fully war ready. Three readiness categories, A, B, and V, after the first three letters of the Cyrillic alphabet, were in force. The Category A divisions were certified combat-ready and were fully equipped. B and V divisions were lower-readiness, 50\u201375% (requiring at least 72 hours of preparation) and 10\u201333% (requiring two months) respectively.<ref>M J Orr, 2003, p. 1 and David C Isby, Weapons and Tactics of the Soviet Army, Jane's Publishing Company, 1988, p. 30</ref> The internal military districts usually contained only one or two A divisions, with the remainder B and V series formations.\n\nSoviet planning for most of the [[Cold War]] period would have seen [[Army (Soviet Army)|Armies]] of four to five divisions operating in [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]] made up of around four armies (and roughly equivalent to Western [[Army Group]]s). In February 1979, the first of the new High Commands in the Strategic Directions were created at [[Ulan-Ude]].<ref>[[Viktor Suvorov]], [[Inside the Soviet Army]], Hamish Hamilton, 1982, gives this title, Odom (1998) also discusses this development. Specific details on the Strategic Directions can be seen at Michael Holm, [http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/gkv/gkv.htm High Commands].</ref> These new headquarters controlled multiple Fronts, and usually a Soviet Navy Fleet. In September 1984, three more were established to control multi-Front operations in Europe (the Western and South-Western Strategic Directions) and at [[Baku]] to handle southern operations.\n\nIn 1955, the Soviet Union signed the [[Warsaw Pact]] with its East European socialist allies, establishing military coordination between Soviet forces and their socialist counterparts. The Soviet Army created and directed the Eastern European armies in its image for the remainder of the Cold War, shaping them for a potential confrontation with the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)]]. After 1956, Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reduced the Ground Forces to build up the [[Strategic Rocket Forces]] \u2014 emphasizing the armed forces' [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] capabilities. He removed Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] from the [[Politburo]] in 1957, for opposing these reductions in the Ground Forces.<ref>see [[Viktor Suvorov]], ''[[Inside the Soviet Army]]''</ref> Nonetheless, Soviet forces possessed too few theater-level nuclear weapons to fulfil war-plan requirements until the mid-1980s.<ref>[[William Eldridge Odom|William E.

Soviet President Gorbachev resigned on 25 December 1991; the next day, the Supreme Soviet dissolved itself, officially dissolving the USSR on 26 December 1991. During the next 18 months, inter-republican political efforts to transform the Army of the Soviet Union into the CIS military failed; eventually, the forces stationed in the republics formally became the militaries of the respective republican governments.\n\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Soviet Army dissolved and the USSR's [[successor state]]s divided its assets among themselves. The divide mostly occurred along a regional basis, with Soviet soldiers from Russia becoming part of the new [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]], while Soviet soldiers originating from [[Kazakhstan]] became part of the new [[Military of Kazakhstan|Kazakh Army]]. As a result, the bulk of the Soviet Ground Forces, including most of the [[Scud]] and [[Scaleboard]] [[surface-to-surface missile]] forces, became incorporated in the [[Russian Ground Forces]].<ref>1992 estimates showed five SSM brigades with 96 missile vehicles in [[Belarus]] and 12 SSM brigades with 204 missile vehicles in [[Ukraine]], compared to 24 SSM brigades with over 900 missile vehicles under Russian Ground Forces' control, some in other former Soviet republics).

Military forces garrisoned in Eastern Europe (including the [[Baltic states]]) gradually returned home between 1992 and 1994. This [[List of Soviet Army divisions 1989\u201391|list of Soviet Army divisions]] sketches some of the fates of the individual parts of the Ground Forces.\n\nIn mid March 1992, Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] appointed himself as the new Russian minister of defence, marking a crucial step in the creation of the new [[Military of Russia|Russian armed forces]], comprising the bulk of what was still left of the military. The last vestiges of the old Soviet command structure were finally dissolved in June 1993, when the paper [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] Military Headquarters was reorganized as a staff for facilitating CIS military cooperation.<ref name=\"Matlock1995\">{{cite book|last=Matlock|first=Jack F.|authorlink=Jack F.
