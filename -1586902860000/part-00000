Jackson had been involved in a shoot-out at [[Round Rock, Texas]] between the Bass gang and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in July, 1878. Jackson was shot in one leg, but survived. The posse killed Bass, however Jackson escaped and rode through [[New Mexico]] until he reached Arizona where he assumed the name William F.

Downing worked as a cowhand at the nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, a ranch which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Though Downing became known for his quarrelsome nature, he was also known to be less quarrelsome when he was drinking whiskey.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The killing of  William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor==\n[[File:Pearce-Ranch House-1896.jpg|200px|thumb|Ranch house in Pearce]][[File:Burt Alvord Arizona.jpg|200px|thumb|Constable Burt Alvord]]\nDowning and his wife moved to the town of [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]]. Downing spent most of his time hanging around saloons and associating with the members of a gang run by Albert R. \u201cBurt\u201d Alvord, who was the town constable when he wasn't working as a ranch-hand. However, there was a particular person whom Downing did not like and that was William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nTraynor, who also went by the name of \"Bill Traynor\", was a native of [[Tennessee]] who at onetime had been an outlaw, mine guard and was a veteran [[Rough Rider]] campaigning in [[Cuba]] with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He was hired by cattle inspector Edwin Russell Hooker to look after his father, Henry Hooker, Sierra Bonita range interests. Traynor was engaged to be married to Mila Allaire, a young lady from a Willcox ranching family. He suspected Downing of stealing cattle and re-branding them. As such he made it known publicly that Downing was a rustler and that he was looking for him.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nOn the evening of May 19, 1899, Traynor and his friend Henry C. Taylor, an off-duty bartender, walked into Tom Fulghum's \"Elite Saloon\" on the corner of Maley and Haskell Streets. Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery==\n[[File:Willcox-Building-John H. Norton and Company Store -1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Soto Brothers Mercantile store which originally was the John H. Norton and Company Store]][[File:Cochise-Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot-1903.jpg|200px|thumb|The Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019]]\nConstable [[Burt Alvord]] was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Alvord hired Bill Downing and [[Billy Stiles]] as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThey conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise Junction]]. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They  held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up. Their first heist was successful and they seized between $2,000 and $3,000 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord organized a posse when news of the robbery reached Willcox. He sent the posses in all directions except the right one. Downing, Burts and Stiles stashed everything in Burt Alvord's chicken house in Willcox and then they \"joined the posse.\" As expected the posse did not find anything. The stolen goods were removed from the chicken house and stashed in Bill Downing's ranch near Pearce. The only member of the gang that took his share was Matt Burts who headed to the state of [[Oregon]].<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The failed Fairbank train robbery==\n[[File:Jeff_Milton_Arizona_Lawman.jpg|thumb|150px|Jeff Milton]][[File:Fairbank Railroad Depot Arizona Circa 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|The railroad depot in Fairbank, c. 1900.]][[File:T-Courthouse.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tombstone Courthouse]]\nOn February 15, 1900, the Alvord-Stiles Gang attempted a second major robbery, this time in [[Fairbank, Arizona]]. The members of the gang who participated in the holdup of the New Mexico & Arizona's northbound No. 1 on the Nogales-to-Benson line, were [[Jack Dunlop|Jesse \u201cThree-Fingered Jack\u201d Dunlap]], Tom \u201cBravo Juan\u201d Yoas, Robert Brown, and George and Lewis Owings. However, they were unaware that [[Jeff Milton]] a [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express]] messenger was aboard the train that day. Milton, an ex-Texas Ranger, had a long career in law enforcement.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe gang's attempt to rob the train failed because of Milton's intervention. He fired his gun and shot Jack Dunlap despite the fact that he himself was wounded with a bullet on his left arm between the shoulder and elbow which shattered the bone and left his arm useless. The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind. When a posse from Tombstone arrived and found Dunlap, he decided to cooperate and told them the names of those involved in the attempted but failed robbery. Dunlap died shortly after the encounter, but not before implicating Burt Alvord, Billy Stiles and Bill Downing as the planners of the robbery.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nBill Downing and some members of the gang were arrested and sent to the jail in Tombstone, since he had been implicated in the earlier Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot holdup. At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and went to the jailhouse. He shot [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy Marshal]] George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A. Smith announced before Judge [[George Russell Davis]] that even though the jurors believed that Downing was guilty of train robbery, they refused to return a guilty verdict.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com1\">{{Cite web | title=Burton Alvord - Lawmen Turned Outlaw| url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-burtonalvord.html| access-date=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEven though Downing was acquitted in the robbery case, he was found guilty of interfering with the United States mail, a federal charge and was sentenced to 10 years of prison-time to be served in the Yuma Territorial Prison.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Yuma Territorial Prison==\n[[File:Yuma-Yuma Territorial Prison-1875-8-2.jpg|200px|thumb|Yuma Territorial Prison cell with steel bunkers]]\nThe [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the [[sally port]] which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A. Ketcherside treated the old wound. The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nMrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a.

Downing''' (1860 \u2013 August 5, 1908) was a notorious outlaw during the [[Wild West]] era in [[Arizona]]. Downing had fled from the Texas Rangers posse that was after him when he came to Arizona. In Arizona, he was involved in the killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor     and in various train robberies including the robbery of the Train Depot in the town of [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise]].<ref name=\"BSG\">{{cite web|url=https://www.legendsofamerica.com/alvord-stiles-gang/|title=Alvord-Stiles Gang of Outlaws|website=Legends of America|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref> Downing was so unpopular that even members of his gang couldn't stand him.<ref name=\"AA\">{{cite web|url=http://arizonaoddities.com/2011/05/death-of-old-arizona-gunslinger-inspires-well-known-western-axiom/|title=Death of Old Arizona Gunslinger Inspires Well-Known Western Axiom|website=Arizona Oddities|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nDowning was born in [[Texas]]. He was in trouble with the law when he came to [[Arizona Territory]]. All the while a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] posse was in pursuit of Downing. Allegedly his real name was Frank Jackson, a teenager who was a member of the [[Sam Bass (outlaw)|Sam Bass]] gang. Jackson had been involved in a shoot-out at [[Round Rock, Texas]] between the Bass gang and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in July, 1878. Jackson was shot in one leg, but survived. The posse killed Bass, however Jackson escaped and rode through [[New Mexico]] until he reached Arizona where he assumed the name William F.

Downing worked as a cowhand at the nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, a ranch which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Though Downing became known for his quarrelsome nature, he was also known to be less quarrelsome when he was drinking whiskey.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The killing of  William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor==\n[[File:Pearce-Ranch House-1896.jpg|200px|thumb|Ranch house in Pearce]][[File:Burt Alvord Arizona.jpg|200px|thumb|Constable Burt Alvord]]\nDowning and his wife moved to the town of [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]]. Downing spent most of his time hanging around saloons and associating with the members of a gang run by Albert R. \u201cBurt\u201d Alvord, who was the town constable when he wasn't working as a ranch-hand. However, there was a particular person whom Downing did not like and that was William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nTraynor, who also went by the name of \"Bill Traynor\", was a native of [[Tennessee]] who at onetime had been an outlaw, mine guard and was a veteran [[Rough Rider]] campaigning in [[Cuba]] with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He was hired by cattle inspector Edwin Russell Hooker to look after his father, Henry Hooker, Sierra Bonita range interests. Traynor was engaged to be married to Mila Allaire, a young lady from a Willcox ranching family. He suspected Downing of stealing cattle and re-branding them. As such he made it known publicly that Downing was a rustler and that he was looking for him.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nOn the evening of May 19, 1899, Traynor and his friend Henry C. Taylor, an off-duty bartender, walked into Tom Fulghum's \"Elite Saloon\" on the corner of Maley and Haskell Streets. Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery==\n[[File:Willcox-Building-John H. Norton and Company Store -1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Soto Brothers Mercantile store which originally was the John H. Norton and Company Store]][[File:Cochise-Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot-1903.jpg|200px|thumb|The Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019]]\nConstable [[Burt Alvord]] was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Alvord hired Bill Downing and [[Billy Stiles]] as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThey conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise Junction]]. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They  held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up. Their first heist was successful and they seized between $2,000 and $3,000 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord organized a posse when news of the robbery reached Willcox. He sent the posses in all directions except the right one. Downing, Burts and Stiles stashed everything in Burt Alvord's chicken house in Willcox and then they \"joined the posse.\" As expected the posse did not find anything. The stolen goods were removed from the chicken house and stashed in Bill Downing's ranch near Pearce. The only member of the gang that took his share was Matt Burts who headed to the state of [[Oregon]].<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The failed Fairbank train robbery==\n[[File:Jeff_Milton_Arizona_Lawman.jpg|thumb|150px|Jeff Milton]][[File:Fairbank Railroad Depot Arizona Circa 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|The railroad depot in Fairbank, c. 1900.]][[File:T-Courthouse.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tombstone Courthouse]]\nOn February 15, 1900, the Alvord-Stiles Gang attempted a second major robbery, this time in [[Fairbank, Arizona]]. The members of the gang who participated in the holdup of the New Mexico & Arizona's northbound No. 1 on the Nogales-to-Benson line, were [[Jack Dunlop|Jesse \u201cThree-Fingered Jack\u201d Dunlap]], Tom \u201cBravo Juan\u201d Yoas, Robert Brown, and George and Lewis Owings. However, they were unaware that [[Jeff Milton]] a [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express]] messenger was aboard the train that day. Milton, an ex-Texas Ranger, had a long career in law enforcement.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe gang's attempt to rob the train failed because of Milton's intervention. He fired his gun and shot Jack Dunlap despite the fact that he himself was wounded with a bullet on his left arm between the shoulder and elbow which shattered the bone and left his arm useless. The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind. When a posse from Tombstone arrived and found Dunlap, he decided to cooperate and told them the names of those involved in the attempted but failed robbery. Dunlap died shortly after the encounter, but not before implicating Burt Alvord, Billy Stiles and Bill Downing as the planners of the robbery.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nBill Downing and some members of the gang were arrested and sent to the jail in Tombstone, since he had been implicated in the earlier Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot holdup. At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and went to the jailhouse. He shot [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy Marshal]] George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A. Smith announced before Judge [[George Russell Davis]] that even though the jurors believed that Downing was guilty of train robbery, they refused to return a guilty verdict.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com1\">{{Cite web | title=Burton Alvord - Lawmen Turned Outlaw| url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-burtonalvord.html| access-date=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEven though Downing was acquitted in the robbery case, he was found guilty of interfering with the United States mail, a federal charge and was sentenced to 10 years of prison-time to be served in the Yuma Territorial Prison.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Yuma Territorial Prison==\n[[File:Yuma-Yuma Territorial Prison-1875-8-2.jpg|200px|thumb|Yuma Territorial Prison cell with steel bunkers]]\nThe [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the [[sally port]] which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A. Ketcherside treated the old wound. The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nMrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\">{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/az/cochise/cemeteries/wilcoxhiscem.txt|website=files.usgwarchives.net|title=Old City Cemetery|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDowning served a total of seven years in prison and was finally released for good behavior.

The Tamil New Year follows the ''nirayanam'' [[vernal equinox]]<ref>Dershowitz, Nachum and Reingold, Edward M.: Calendrical Calculations. Third edition, Cambridge University Press (2008).</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}} and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. 14 April marks the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and is a public holiday in the state of Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Tropical vernal equinox fall around 22 March, and by adding 23 degrees of trepidation (oscillation) to it, we get the Hindu sidereal or ''Nirayana Mesha Sankranti'' (Sun's transition into ''nirayana'' Aries). Hence, the Tamil calendar begins on the same date in April which is observed by most traditional calendars of the rest of India \u2013 [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Odisha]], [[Manipur]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] etc.<ref>Underhill, Muriel M.: The Hindu Religious Year. Association Press, Kolkata, India (1921).</ref> This also coincides with the traditional new year in [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Thailand]]. \n\nThe calendar follows a 60-year cycle which is also very ancient and is observed by most traditional calendars of India and China. According to popular belief it is related to 5 revolutions of Jupiter around the Sun, and also to 60-year orbit of ''Nakshatras'' (stars) as mentioned in [[Surya Siddhanta]].\n\nIn the Gregorian Year {{CURRENTYEAR}} the '''Tamil year''' starts on 14 April {{CURRENTYEAR}}, [[Kaliyuga]] {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+3102}}.

Nakkirar, [[Sangam period]] author of the ''[[Ne\u1e6dunalv\u0101\u1e6dai]]'', wrote in the third century CE that the Sun travels each year from Mesha/Chitterai in mid-April through 11 successive signs of the zodiac.<ref>JV Chelliah: Pattupattu: Ten Tamil Idylls.

Its earliest reference is to be found in [[Surya Siddhanta]], which [[Varahamihira]]r (550 CE) believed to be the most accurate of the then current theories of astronomy. However, in the Surya Siddhantic list, the first year was ''Vijaya'' and not ''Prabhava'' as currently used. There are some parallels in this [[sexagenary cycle]] with the [[Chinese calendar]].<ref>Samuel Wells Williams, The Middle Kingdom, V 2, Columbia University Press, New York, 2005 pp. 69\u201370</ref><ref>Paul Kekai Manansala, Quests of the Dragon and Bird Clan, 2006, p. 236</ref><ref>Terrien de Lacouperie, Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization: From 2,300 BC to 20 AD, Asher and Co, London 1894 p. 78</ref> The Surya Siddhanta and other Indian classical texts on astronomy had some influence on the Chinese calendar<ref>George Gheverghese Joseph, Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, Princeton University Press, 2011, p. 304-305</ref> although it merits attention that the sexagenary cycle in China is itself very old.\n\nAfter the completion of sixty years, the calendar starts a new with the first year. This corresponds to the Hindu \"century.\" The ''Vakya'' or ''Tirukannitha Panchangam'' (the traditional Tamil almanac) outlines this sequence. It is related to the position of the planets in the sky with respect to earth. It means that the two major planets Sani/Saturn (which takes 30 years to complete one cycle round the sun) and the Viyazhan/Jupiter (which takes 12 years to complete one cycle round the Sun) comes to the same position after 60 years.\n\nThe following list presents the current 60-year cycle of the Tamil calendar:<ref>Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, Vedic calendar: Kadavul Hindu Panchangam,

[[Hindu]]s. Some months are considered very auspicious while a few are considered inauspicious as well. Tamil months start and end based on the Sun's shift from one Rasi to the other but the names of the months are based on the star on the start of Pournami in that month. The name of the month is some times the name of the star itself. (e.g. Chithrai is always the star on the Pournami of the Chithirai month).\n\nSome of the celebrations for each month are listed below. Dates in parentheses are not exact and usually vary by a day or two. Underneath (or beside) the months of the Hindu calendar are their Gregorian counterparts.<ref>Kielhorn, Franz: Festal Days of the Hindu Lunar Calendar.

Acta Orientalia (1922\u20131927).</ref> For computing the age of the earth and various geological and other epochs, as well as the age of mankind, they still employ a Tamil calendar derived from ancient astronomical data, known as the ''Tirukkanida Panchanga''<ref>H.P. Blavatsky, 'The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy' Book 2: pp. 49\u201351, Theosophical University Press, 1888</ref>\n*The 10th Tamil month, called ''Thai'', falls in mid-January each year. It is celebrated with much enthusiasm within the Tamil Community all over the world. Thai is marked by gifts of new clothing for family members and prayers to God for prosperity in the coming year. ''Thai'' and the fifth month ''Aavani'' are considered very auspicious for marriage and most marriages occur during these months.\n*The fourth month ''Aadi'' is a busy month for most people including priests as there will be major temple festivities throughout the month, so most weddings do not often fall in this month. ''Aadi'' is the month of preparation for the next crop cycle by farmers. Therefore, farming communities avoid major events like weddings in this month. Those members of the Tamil community who don't actively contribute/participate in farming take advantage by having important functions like wedding in this month. For example, the business community prefers this month for weddings. ''Aadi'' is usually the worst month for business, although when businesses recently initiated Aadi discounts, this situation has changed significantly. Each Friday of this month is set aside for prayer and worship.\n*''Aadi'' is portrayed as an inauspicious month for union of newlyweds because conceiving in this month might often result in child delivery around April\u2013May, the hottest months in Tamil Nadu (''Agni natchathiram'' \u2013 ['pinezhu'] the last 7 days of ''Chithirai'' and ['munezhu'] the first 7 days of ''Vaigasi''). 'Aadi' is also the windiest month in Tamil Nadu, and hence the phrase 'Aadi kaatru ammiyai nagatrum' (literally, 'the strong winds in the month of Aadi can even move a stone grinder')\n*''Purattaasi'' is when most of the non-vegetarian Tamil people forgo meat for a month. Each Saturday of this month is set apart to venerate the planet Saturn.\n*''Deepavali'', is celebrated on the new moon day, in the seventh month ''Aipasi''. The month of ''Aipasi'' is usually characterised by the North-East Monsoon in Tamil Nadu, which has given birth to a phrase, ''Aipasi adai mazhai'' meaning the \"Non-stop downpour\".\n*''Maargazhi'' falls in winter in Tamil Nadu, and is an auspicious month. The month is considered sacred. During the holy month of Maargazhi, houses are decorated with colorful and elaborate kolams. These are drawn on the threshold to welcome guests and divine beings to bless their houses with prosperity and happiness. The [[Shaivite]] fast of ''Thiru-vembaavai'' and the Vaishnava fast of ''Thiru-paavai'' are also observed in this month.\n*The total number of days in a Tamil Calendar is an average 365 days. The ''Vakiya Panchangam'' is employed for both sacred and civil calculations. The ''Trikanitha Panchangam'' is employed for [[Hindu astrology|astrological]] calculations.\n\n==Festivals==\nThe Tamil Calendar is important in the life of Tamil-speaking people and most Festivals of [[Tamil Nadu]] are based on it. Some Festivals include \n* [[Tamil New Year]] (also called ''[[Puthandu]]'') in mid-April, \n* [[Thai Pongal]], \n* [[Deepavali]], \n* Panguni Uthiram, \n* Thirukaarthigai, \n* Aadiperukku, \n* [[Navaratri]]\nOne day was even dedicated to a celebration of the Tamil alphabet and was called \"ezhuthu naal'.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chandravakyas]]\n* [[Malayalam calendar]]\n* [[Pambu Panchangam]]\n* [[Puthandu]]\n* [[Samvatsara]]\n* [[Sexagenary cycle]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://tamilcalendarz.com/ Full Tamil Calendar with Panchangam Information]\n* [http://tamil.indiancalendars.org/ Tamil Calendar with Panchangam Information]\n* [http://www.probharat.com/indian-calendars/tamil-calendar.php] @ Tamil Calendar for all past and future years (\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbf)\n* [http://tamil.panchangam.org/ Tamil Calendar with Daily Panchangam]\n* [https://dheivegam.com/tamil-calendar/ Tamil Calendar for each year]\n\n{{Calendars}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu calendar]]\n[[Category:Tamil culture]]\n[[Category:Time in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2010}}\nThe '''Tamil calendar''' is a [[Sidereal time|sidereal]] [[Hindu calendar|calendar]] used by the [[Tamil people]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>S.K.

The Tamil New Year follows the ''nirayanam'' [[vernal equinox]]<ref>Dershowitz, Nachum and Reingold, Edward M.: Calendrical Calculations. Third edition, Cambridge University Press (2008).</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}} and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. 14 April marks the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and is a public holiday in the state of Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Tropical vernal equinox fall around 22 March, and by adding 23 degrees of trepidation (oscillation) to it, we get the Hindu sidereal or ''Nirayana Mesha Sankranti'' (Sun's transition into ''nirayana'' Aries). Hence, the Tamil calendar begins on the same date in April which is observed by most traditional calendars of the rest of India \u2013 [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Odisha]], [[Manipur]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] etc.<ref>Underhill, Muriel M.: The Hindu Religious Year. Association Press, Kolkata, India (1921).</ref> This also coincides with the traditional new year in [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Thailand]]. \n\nThe calendar follows a 60-year cycle which is also very ancient and is observed by most traditional calendars of India and China. According to popular belief it is related to 5 revolutions of Jupiter around the Sun, and also to 60-year orbit of ''Nakshatras'' (stars) as mentioned in [[Surya Siddhanta]].\n\nIn the Gregorian Year {{CURRENTYEAR}} the '''Tamil year''' starts on 14 April {{CURRENTYEAR}}, [[Kaliyuga]] {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+3102}}. [[Vikrama era|Vikrama]] and [[Shalivahana era|Shalivahana]] Saka eras are also used.\n \nThere are '''several references''' in early [[Tamil literature]] to the new year.

Its earliest reference is to be found in [[Surya Siddhanta]], which [[Varahamihira]]r (550 CE) believed to be the most accurate of the then current theories of astronomy. However, in the Surya Siddhantic list, the first year was ''Vijaya'' and not ''Prabhava'' as currently used. There are some parallels in this [[sexagenary cycle]] with the [[Chinese calendar]].<ref>Samuel Wells Williams, The Middle Kingdom, V 2, Columbia University Press, New York, 2005 pp. 69\u201370</ref><ref>Paul Kekai Manansala, Quests of the Dragon and Bird Clan, 2006, p. 236</ref><ref>Terrien de Lacouperie, Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization: From 2,300 BC to 20 AD, Asher and Co, London 1894 p. 78</ref> The Surya Siddhanta and other Indian classical texts on astronomy had some influence on the Chinese calendar<ref>George Gheverghese Joseph, Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, Princeton University Press, 2011, p. 304-305</ref> although it merits attention that the sexagenary cycle in China is itself very old.\n\nAfter the completion of sixty years, the calendar starts a new with the first year. This corresponds to the Hindu \"century.\" The ''Vakya'' or ''Tirukannitha Panchangam'' (the traditional Tamil almanac) outlines this sequence. It is related to the position of the planets in the sky with respect to earth. It means that the two major planets Sani/Saturn (which takes 30 years to complete one cycle round the sun) and the Viyazhan/Jupiter (which takes 12 years to complete one cycle round the Sun) comes to the same position after 60 years.\n\nThe following list presents the current 60-year cycle of the Tamil calendar:<ref>Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, Vedic calendar: Kadavul Hindu Panchangam,

[[Hindu]]s. Some months are considered very auspicious while a few are considered inauspicious as well. Tamil months start and end based on the Sun's shift from one Rasi to the other but the names of the months are based on the star on the start of Pournami in that month. The name of the month is some times the name of the star itself. (e.g. Chithrai is always the star on the Pournami of the Chithirai month).\n\nSome of the celebrations for each month are listed below. Dates in parentheses are not exact and usually vary by a day or two. Underneath (or beside) the months of the Hindu calendar are their Gregorian counterparts.<ref>Kielhorn, Franz: Festal Days of the Hindu Lunar Calendar.

Acta Orientalia (1922\u20131927).</ref> For computing the age of the earth and various geological and other epochs, as well as the age of mankind, they still employ a Tamil calendar derived from ancient astronomical data, known as the ''Tirukkanida Panchanga''<ref>H.P. Blavatsky, 'The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy' Book 2: pp. 49\u201351, Theosophical University Press, 1888</ref>\n*The 10th Tamil month, called ''Thai'', falls in mid-January each year. It is celebrated with much enthusiasm within the Tamil Community all over the world. Thai is marked by gifts of new clothing for family members and prayers to God for prosperity in the coming year. ''Thai'' and the fifth month ''Aavani'' are considered very auspicious for marriage and most marriages occur during these months.\n*The fourth month ''Aadi'' is a busy month for most people including priests as there will be major temple festivities throughout the month, so most weddings do not often fall in this month. ''Aadi'' is the month of preparation for the next crop cycle by farmers. Therefore, farming communities avoid major events like weddings in this month. Those members of the Tamil community who don't actively contribute/participate in farming take advantage by having important functions like wedding in this month. For example, the business community prefers this month for weddings. ''Aadi'' is usually the worst month for business, although when businesses recently initiated Aadi discounts, this situation has changed significantly. Each Friday of this month is set aside for prayer and worship.\n*''Aadi'' is portrayed as an inauspicious month for union of newlyweds because conceiving in this month might often result in child delivery around April\u2013May, the hottest months in Tamil Nadu (''Agni natchathiram'' \u2013 ['pinezhu'] the last 7 days of ''Chithirai'' and ['munezhu'] the first 7 days of ''Vaigasi''). 'Aadi' is also the windiest month in Tamil Nadu, and hence the phrase 'Aadi kaatru ammiyai nagatrum' (literally, 'the strong winds in the month of Aadi can even move a stone grinder')\n*''Purattaasi'' is when most of the non-vegetarian Tamil people forgo meat for a month. Each Saturday of this month is set apart to venerate the planet Saturn.\n*''Deepavali'', is celebrated on the new moon day, in the seventh month ''Aipasi''. The month of ''Aipasi'' is usually characterised by the North-East Monsoon in Tamil Nadu, which has given birth to a phrase, ''Aipasi adai mazhai'' meaning the \"Non-stop downpour\".\n*''Maargazhi'' falls in winter in Tamil Nadu, and is an auspicious month. The month is considered sacred. During the holy month of Maargazhi, houses are decorated with colorful and elaborate kolams. These are drawn on the threshold to welcome guests and divine beings to bless their houses with prosperity and happiness. The [[Shaivite]] fast of ''Thiru-vembaavai'' and the Vaishnava fast of ''Thiru-paavai'' are also observed in this month.\n*The total number of days in a Tamil Calendar is an average 365 days. The ''Vakiya Panchangam'' is employed for both sacred and civil calculations. The ''Trikanitha Panchangam'' is employed for [[Hindu astrology|astrological]] calculations.\n\n==Festivals==\nThe Tamil Calendar is important in the life of Tamil-speaking people and most Festivals of [[Tamil Nadu]] are based on it. Some Festivals include \n* [[Tamil New Year]] (also called ''[[Puthandu]]'') in mid-April, \n* [[Thai Pongal]], \n* [[Deepavali]], \n* Panguni Uthiram, \n* Thirukaarthigai, \n* Aadiperukku, \n* [[Navaratri]]\nOne day was even dedicated to a celebration of the Tamil alphabet and was called \"ezhuthu naal'.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chandravakyas]]\n* [[Malayalam calendar]]\n* [[Pambu Panchangam]]\n* [[Puthandu]]\n* [[Samvatsara]]\n* [[Sexagenary cycle]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://tamilcalendarz.com/ Full Tamil Calendar with Panchangam Information]\n* [http://tamil.indiancalendars.org/ Tamil Calendar with Panchangam Information]\n* [http://www.probharat.com/indian-calendars/tamil-calendar.php] @ Tamil Calendar for all past and future years (\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbf)\n* [http://tamil.panchangam.org/ Tamil Calendar with Daily Panchangam]\n* [https://dheivegam.com/tamil-calendar/ Tamil Calendar for each year]\n\n{{Calendars}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu calendar]]\n[[Category:Tamil culture]]\n[[Category:Time in India]]\n", "name_user": "Niaroq78", "label": "safe", "comment": "It is not a sanskrit calendar nor an Hindu calendar, It is a non religious calendar used long before Hindu religion came to India.

Between 2002 and 2007, many such tiles displayed a different font and styling than the older tiles and tended to leave out words that were found on the originals: \"raise\" is often substituted for \"resurrect,\" and prepositions are frequently omitted. Beginning in 2007, tiles were discovered in Philadelphia that are quite similar to the original tiles, leading some to believe that everything has been the work of the same person throughout the life of the tile phenomenon. The font and message are the same as the old ones, and the subtext is a return to some of the older ideas as well.

Eventually, the tar paper wears away, exposing the message.\n\nA Toynbee-tile enthusiast website reported a tile found in Pittsburgh that included deployment instructions, which the reader transcribed as \"linoleum, asphalt glue (?) in several layers, then placing tar paper over it so that car wheels won't mess it up, and apparently the heat of the sun on the tar paper will bake it into the street.\" This tile was located near the [[Pittsburgh Hilton]] and has since been paved over.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=L.A.|title=Mysteries underfoot: Pedestrians have long wondered over Toynbee tiles|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06151/694320-42.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=17 August 2010|date=2006-07-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction, conservation, and public acknowledgment ===\nTiles that are located in the middle of busy streets and highway on- and off-ramps tend to wear away quickly and also can become victims of resurfacing; smaller tiles and those located close to pedestrian crosswalks tend to be in better condition.\n\nHundreds of tiles have been destroyed during the course of regular road maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weirdus.com/states/pennsylvania/roadside_oddities/toynbee_tiles/index.php|title=Weird Pennsylvania|work=weirdus.com}}</ref> The city of [[Chicago]] has declared the tiles \"vandalism\" and removes any tiles that it finds, considering them to be \"no different than graffiti.\"<ref name=upi />\n\nA large tile complex, the tile maker's apparent rant against his enemies, was destroyed when Chestnut Street in Philadelphia was repaved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rexht.com/sites/default/files/January2014.pdf|title=The Mysterious Toynbee Tiles|publisher=The Rex Files|accessdate=July 19, 2015|date=January 2014}}</ref> One tile located at the corners of Talcahuano and Santa F\u00e9 streets in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] since at least 1996 is damaged and unreadable.\n\nThere is no public or private agency dedicated to conserving Toynbee tiles.

Comparing the tile to those in other cities, a local police detective felt that \"clearly it was created by the same hand\" and concluded that despite referring to a \"movement\", the creator was acting alone.<ref name=\"worgul\">{{cite web | url=http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascitystar/living/special_packages/starmagazine/6693767.htm | title=A Space Oddity?

Between 2002 and 2007, many such tiles displayed a different font and styling than the older tiles and tended to leave out words that were found on the originals: \"raise\" is often substituted for \"resurrect,\" and prepositions are frequently omitted. Beginning in 2007, tiles were discovered in Philadelphia that are quite similar to the original tiles, leading some to believe that everything has been the work of the same person throughout the life of the tile phenomenon. The font and message are the same as the old ones, and the subtext is a return to some of the older ideas as well. These tiles were glued with a thicker layer of asphalt glue or sealant than older ones.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n== Usage ==\n=== Deployment ===\nToynbee-tile enthusiast [[Justin Duerr]] claims to have once found and examined a newly installed tile. This new tile was wrapped in [[tar paper]] and placed on a busy street early in the morning. From this find and other evidence, Duerr believes that the pressure exerted by automobiles driving over the tile for weeks on end pushes the tile into the road surface. Eventually, the tar paper wears away, exposing the message.\n\nA Toynbee-tile enthusiast website reported a tile found in Pittsburgh that included deployment instructions, which the reader transcribed as \"linoleum, asphalt glue (?) in several layers, then placing tar paper over it so that car wheels won't mess it up, and apparently the heat of the sun on the tar paper will bake it into the street.\" This tile was located near the [[Pittsburgh Hilton]] and has since been paved over.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=L.A.|title=Mysteries underfoot: Pedestrians have long wondered over Toynbee tiles|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06151/694320-42.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=17 August 2010|date=2006-07-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction, conservation, and public acknowledgment ===\nTiles that are located in the middle of busy streets and highway on- and off-ramps tend to wear away quickly and also can become victims of resurfacing; smaller tiles and those located close to pedestrian crosswalks tend to be in better condition.\n\nHundreds of tiles have been destroyed during the course of regular road maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weirdus.com/states/pennsylvania/roadside_oddities/toynbee_tiles/index.php|title=Weird Pennsylvania|work=weirdus.com}}</ref> The city of [[Chicago]] has declared the tiles \"vandalism\" and removes any tiles that it finds, considering them to be \"no different than graffiti.\"<ref name=upi />\n\nA large tile complex, the tile maker's apparent rant against his enemies, was destroyed when Chestnut Street in Philadelphia was repaved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rexht.com/sites/default/files/January2014.pdf|title=The Mysterious Toynbee Tiles|publisher=The Rex Files|accessdate=July 19, 2015|date=January 2014}}</ref> One tile located at the corners of Talcahuano and Santa F\u00e9 streets in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] since at least 1996 is damaged and unreadable.\n\nThere is no public or private agency dedicated to conserving Toynbee tiles.

In a flashback, it is shown that Badri's elder brother, Aloknath \"Alok\" Bansal ([[Yash Sinha]]) was in love with a girl and was going to leave the family for her because their father disapproved, but decided against it after their father Ambarnath \"Ambar\" Bansal's ([[Rituraj Singh (actor)|Rituraj Singh]]) first heart attack. Now Alok is married to Urmila Shukla ([[Swetha Basu Prasad]]) through an arranged marriage and she is not allowed to work despite being very intelligent and better professionally trained than Alok himself. Alok is also depressed at having to leave his love and be forced into a marriage, so he spends a lot of his time drinking. Badri fears the same fate for himself and so when he sees the beautiful and educated Vaidehi Trivedi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) at a wedding supposedly being looked after by her father Mayank ([[Swanand Kirkire]]), he falls for her immense beauty and charm. He eventually becomes obsessed with her and makes it his mission to marry her with Ambar's approval.\n\nVaidehi is an intelligent young woman, much more educated than Badri. She has completed her graduation and is secretly training to become a flight attendant while Badri has only passed the tenth grade. She's initially uninterested in getting married and is offended by his marriage proposal. But when Badri helps Vaidehi's elder sister, Kritika (Sukhmani Lamba) find a husband in Bhushan Mishra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and even resolves a dowry crisis with Bhushan's father Jitendra Mishra ([[Rajendra Sethi]]), Vaidehi agrees to marry him. On their wedding day, however, Vaidehi does not show up. Badri is heartbroken and Ambar is furious. Ambar commands Badri to find Vaidehi and bring her back so they can punish her. Despite being afraid of Ambar's words, Badri goes to [[Mumbai]] to find Vaidehi, where he discovers that she's already moved to [[Singapore]] for a flight attendant training program.\n\nBadri shows up on Vaidehi's doorstep in Singapore, and kidnaps her, pulling her into his car. On the way, he pulls over and lets her out of the car trunk and they have an emotional yet heated argument. Badri is furious at her for leaving him at the altar and she apologizes, trying to assure him that the reason she left was not because of him. Badri grabs her by the throat while venting out all his frustration and anger on her, when a police car pulls up and is about to arrest Badri for violently approaching Vaidehi, and while she defends him, they both are doubted and Badri is taken to the police station anyway and Vaidehi comes along for testifying. At the police station,Vaidehi covers up for Badri. Over the next few days, Badri follows Vaidehi. Alok calls and tells him that Ambar has started looking for other brides. This terrifies Badri and he attempts entry into Vaidehi's workplace. She stops him and tells him she'll marry him only if he can convince Ambar to let her work and live in Singapore. Badri gets drunk that night and causes a scene outside Vaidehi's residential building and he is arrested by the police again, where this time Vaidehi has to pay $1500 to bail him out.\n\nBadri moves into Vaidehi's apartment where she cares for him by cooking for him before leaving for work every day, which humbles him. They spend time together with friends and tour Singapore together. Over time Badri begins to respect Vaidehi's independence and is impressed by her job and intelligence. He also remembers Urmila and feels sorry that she doesn't get to work, telling Vaidehi that she would be proud of her. Badri and Vaidehi begin to spend more time together which causes them to grow closer. When Ambar calls, Badri lies and tells him that he hasn't found Vaidehi yet, and so Ambar tells Badri to return home. When Badri receives his passport back, Vaidehi invites him to party with her and his newly made friends. Later that night, Badri reveals that whoever Vaidehi marries is a lucky guy, yet she states that he talks too much while drunk. The next day Badri leaves for Jhansi and Vaidehi starts to miss him, depressed by his absence.\n\nBack in [[Jhansi]], Urmila is pregnant and Ambar holds a mega-pooja to ensure a boy is born. Badri feels sorry for her and misses Vaidehi at the same time, finally understanding why she ran away. Before the pooja, he gets heavily drunk and berates Ambar for being disrespectful. He blames Ambar for being the reason that he can't have Vaidehi when suddenly he sees Vaidehi from the corner of his eye. She tells him that she loves him and wants to marry him. Together they stand up to Ambar and tell him that they will get married and Vaidehi will work as she pleases regardless of whether he agrees or not.\n\nIn the epilogue, it is shown that Badri and Vaidehi maintain a long distance relationship while she finishes her training program in Singapore before moving back to India and starting her own flight attendant training center. Urmila gives birth to twins, one boy and girl, and it is shown that so far Ambar has been treating both of them equally. She also starts working in the family's car showroom with Alok and even gets her own cabin. Badri and Vaidehi promise not to collect any dowry for any of their children. The film ends when Badri and Vaidehi driving off on his motorbike, happily reunited.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Badrinath Bansal \n*[[Alia Bhatt]] as Vaidehi Trivedi ; Badri's Ex - Fiance \n*[[Rituraj Singh (actor)|Rituraj Singh]] as Ambarnath \"Ambar\" Bansal, Badri's father\n*[[Yash Sinha]] as Aloknath \"Alok\" Bansal, Badri's brother\n*[[Shweta Basu Prasad]] as Urmila Shukla Bansal, Alok's wife\n*[[Swanand Kirkire]] as Mayank Trivedi, Vaidehi's father\n*Kanupriya Pandit as Manasvi Trivedi, Vaidehi's mother\n*[[Sahil Vaid]] as Somdev Mishra, Badri's best friend\n*Sukhmani Lamba as Kritika Trivedi\n*[[Aparshakti Khurana]] as Bhushan Mishra, Kritika's Husband\n*Rajendra Sethi as Jitendra Mishra, Bhushan's father\n*[[Aakanksha Singh]] as Kiran Kakkar, Vaidehi's friend in Singapore \n*[[Gaurav Pandey]] as Gurmeet Singh Lamba, Vaidehi's friend in Singapore and Kiran's boyfriend\n*[[Gauahar Khan]] as Laxmi Shankar, a cop in Singapore\n*Atul Narang as Sagar\n\n== Production ==\n''Badrinath Ki Dulhania'' marks the second installment of a franchise that began with the romantic comedy ''[[Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania]]'' (2014), which was also directed by [[Shashank Khaitan]], produced by [[Karan Johar]] for [[Dharma Productions]] and starred [[Varun Dhawan]] and [[Alia Bhatt]] in the lead roles.

In a flashback, it is shown that Badri's elder brother, Aloknath \"Alok\" Bansal ([[Yash Sinha]]) was in love with a girl and was going to leave the family for her because their father disapproved, but decided against it after their father Ambarnath \"Ambar\" Bansal's ([[Rituraj Singh (actor)|Rituraj Singh]]) first heart attack. Now Alok is married to Urmila Shukla ([[Swetha Basu Prasad]]) through an arranged marriage and she is not allowed to work despite being very intelligent and better professionally trained than Alok himself. Alok is also depressed at having to leave his love and be forced into a marriage, so he spends a lot of his time drinking. Badri fears the same fate for himself and so when he sees the beautiful and educated Vaidehi Trivedi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) at a wedding supposedly being looked after by her father Mayank ([[Swanand Kirkire]]), he falls for her immense beauty and charm. He eventually becomes obsessed with her and makes it his mission to marry her with Ambar's approval.\n\nVaidehi is an intelligent young woman, much more educated than Badri. She has completed her graduation and is secretly training to become a flight attendant while Badri has only passed the tenth grade. She's initially uninterested in getting married and is offended by his marriage proposal. But when Badri helps Vaidehi's elder sister, Kritika (Sukhmani Lamba) find a husband in Bhushan Mishra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and even resolves a dowry crisis with Bhushan's father Jitendra Mishra ([[Rajendra Sethi]]), Vaidehi agrees to marry him. On their wedding day, however, Vaidehi does not show up. Badri is heartbroken and Ambar is furious. Ambar commands Badri to find Vaidehi and bring her back so they can punish her. Despite being afraid of Ambar's words, Badri goes to [[Mumbai]] to find Vaidehi, where he discovers that she's already moved to [[Singapore]] for a flight attendant training program.\n\nBadri shows up on Vaidehi's doorstep in Singapore, and kidnaps her, pulling her into his car. On the way, he pulls over and lets her out of the car trunk and they have an emotional yet heated argument. Badri is furious at her for leaving him at the altar and she apologizes, trying to assure him that the reason she left was not because of him. Badri grabs her by the throat while venting out all his frustration and anger on her, when a police car pulls up and is about to arrest Badri for violently approaching Vaidehi, and while she defends him, they both are doubted and Badri is taken to the police station anyway and Vaidehi comes along for testifying. At the police station,Vaidehi covers up for Badri. Over the next few days, Badri follows Vaidehi. Alok calls and tells him that Ambar has started looking for other brides. This terrifies Badri and he attempts entry into Vaidehi's workplace. She stops him and tells him she'll marry him only if he can convince Ambar to let her work and live in Singapore. Badri gets drunk that night and causes a scene outside Vaidehi's residential building and he is arrested by the police again, where this time Vaidehi has to pay $1500 to bail him out.\n\nBadri moves into Vaidehi's apartment where she cares for him by cooking for him before leaving for work every day, which humbles him. They spend time together with friends and tour Singapore together. Over time Badri begins to respect Vaidehi's independence and is impressed by her job and intelligence. He also remembers Urmila and feels sorry that she doesn't get to work, telling Vaidehi that she would be proud of her. Badri and Vaidehi begin to spend more time together which causes them to grow closer. When Ambar calls, Badri lies and tells him that he hasn't found Vaidehi yet, and so Ambar tells Badri to return home. When Badri receives his passport back, Vaidehi invites him to party with her and his newly made friends. Later that night, Badri reveals that whoever Vaidehi marries is a lucky guy, yet she states that he talks too much while drunk. The next day Badri leaves for Jhansi and Vaidehi starts to miss him, depressed by his absence.\n\nBack in [[Jhansi]], Urmila is pregnant and Ambar holds a mega-pooja to ensure a boy is born. Badri feels sorry for her and misses Vaidehi at the same time, finally understanding why she ran away. Before the pooja, he gets heavily drunk and berates Ambar for being disrespectful. He blames Ambar for being the reason that he can't have Vaidehi when suddenly he sees Vaidehi from the corner of his eye. She tells him that she loves him and wants to marry him. Together they stand up to Ambar and tell him that they will get married and Vaidehi will work as she pleases regardless of whether he agrees or not.\n\nIn the epilogue, it is shown that Badri and Vaidehi maintain a long distance relationship while she finishes her training program in Singapore before moving back to India and starting her own flight attendant training center. Urmila gives birth to twins, one boy and girl, and it is shown that so far Ambar has been treating both of them equally. She also starts working in the family's car showroom with Alok and even gets her own cabin. Badri and Vaidehi promise not to collect any dowry for any of their children. The film ends when Badri and Vaidehi driving off on his motorbike, happily reunited.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Badrinath Bansal \n*[[Alia Bhatt ]] as Vaidehi Trivedi ; Badri's Ex - Fiance \n*[[Rituraj Singh (actor)|Rituraj Singh]] as Ambarnath \"Ambar\" Bansal, Badri's father\n*[[Yash Sinha]] as Aloknath \"Alok\" Bansal, Badri's brother\n*[[Shweta Basu Prasad]] as Urmila Shukla Bansal, Alok's wife\n*[[Swanand Kirkire]] as Mayank Trivedi, Vaidehi's father\n*Kanupriya Pandit as Manasvi Trivedi, Vaidehi's mother\n*[[Sahil Vaid]] as Somdev Mishra, Badri's best friend\n*Sukhmani Lamba as Kritika Trivedi\n*[[Aparshakti Khurana]] as Bhushan Mishra, Kritika's Husband\n*Rajendra Sethi as Jitendra Mishra, Bhushan's father\n*[[Aakanksha Singh]] as Kiran Kakkar, Vaidehi's friend in Singapore \n*[[Gaurav Pandey]] as Gurmeet Singh Lamba, Vaidehi's friend in Singapore and Kiran's boyfriend\n*[[Gauahar Khan]] as Laxmi Shankar, a cop in Singapore\n*Atul Narang as Sagar\n\n== Production ==\n''Badrinath Ki Dulhania'' marks the second installment of a franchise that began with the romantic comedy ''[[Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania]]'' (2014), which was also directed by [[Shashank Khaitan]], produced by [[Karan Johar]] for [[Dharma Productions]] and starred [[Varun Dhawan]] and [[Alia Bhatt]] in the lead roles.

In order to count the degrees of freedom of this system, include the fixed body in the count of bodies, so that mobility is independent of the choice of the body that forms the fixed frame.  Then the degree-of-freedom of the unconstrained system of ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is \n:<math> M=6n=6(N-1), \\!</math>\nbecause the fixed body has zero degrees of freedom relative to itself.\n\nJoints that connect bodies in this system remove degrees of freedom and reduce mobility.   Specifically, hinges and sliders each impose five constraints and therefore remove five degrees of freedom.  It is convenient to define the number of constraints ''c'' that a joint imposes in terms of the joint's freedom ''f'', where ''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''f''.  In the case of a hinge or slider, which are one degree of freedom joints, have ''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and therefore ''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.\n\nThe result is that the mobility of a system formed from ''n'' moving links and ''j'' joints each with freedom  ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;j, is given by\n\n:<math> M = 6n - \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ (6 - f_i) =  6(N-1 - j) + \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i </math>\n\nRecall that ''N'' includes the fixed link.\n\nThere are two important special cases: (i) a simple open chain, and (ii) a simple closed chain.   \nA single open chain consists of ''n'' moving links connected end to end by ''n'' joints, with one end connected to a ground link.  Thus, in this case ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 and the mobility of the chain is\n:<math> M = \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i </math>\nFor a simple closed chain, ''n'' moving links are connected end-to-end by ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 joints such that the two ends are connected to the ground link forming a loop.  In this case, we have ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''j'' and the mobility of the chain is\n:<math> M = \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i - 6 </math>\n\nAn example of a simple open chain is a serial robot manipulator.  These robotic systems are constructed from a series of links connected by six one degree-of-freedom revolute or prismatic joints, so the system has six degrees of freedom.\n\nAn example of a simple closed chain is the RSSR spatial four-bar linkage.  The sum of the freedom of these joints is eight, so the mobility of the linkage is two, where one of the degrees of freedom is the rotation of the coupler around the line joining the two S joints.\n\n=== Planar and spherical movement ===\nIt is common practice to design the [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage system]] so that the movement of all of the bodies are constrained to lie on parallel planes, to form what is known as a ''planar linkage''.   It is also possible to construct the linkage system so that all of the bodies move on concentric spheres, forming a ''spherical linkage''.  In both cases, the degrees of freedom of the links in each system is now three rather than six, and the constraints imposed by joints are now ''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''f''.\n\nIn this case, the mobility formula is given by\n:<math>M = 3(N- 1 - j)+ \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i, </math>\nand the special cases become\n* planar or spherical simple open chain,\n:<math> M = \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i, </math>\n* planar or spherical simple closed chain,\n:<math> M = \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i - 3. </math>\nAn example of a planar simple closed chain is the planar [[four-bar linkage]], which is a four-bar loop with four one degree-of-freedom joints and therefore has mobility&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\n===Systems of bodies===\n[[Image:Robot arm model 1.png|thumb|300px|An [[articulated robot]] with six DOF in a kinematic chain.]]\n\nA system with several bodies would have a combined DOF that is the sum of the DOFs of the bodies, less the internal constraints they may have on relative motion.   A [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] or [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage]] containing a number of connected rigid bodies may have more than the degrees of freedom for a single rigid body.  Here the term ''degrees of freedom'' is used to describe the number of parameters needed to specify the spatial pose of a linkage.\n\nA specific type of linkage is the open [[kinematic chain]], where a set of rigid links are connected at [[joint]]s; a joint may provide one DOF (hinge/sliding), or two (cylindrical).  Such chains occur commonly in [[robotics]], [[biomechanics]], and for [[satellites]] and other space structures.  A human arm is considered to have seven DOFs. A shoulder gives pitch, yaw, and roll, an elbow allows for pitch, and a wrist allows for pitch, yaw and roll. Only 3 of those movements would be necessary to move the hand to any point in space, but people would lack the ability to grasp things from different angles or directions. A robot (or object) that has mechanisms to control all 6 physical DOF is said to be [[Holonomic (robotics)|holonomic]]. An object with fewer controllable DOFs than total DOFs is said to be non-holonomic, and an object with more controllable DOFs than total DOFs (such as the human arm) is said to be redundant. Although keep in mind that it is not redundant in the human arm because the two DOFs; wrist and shoulder, that represent the same movement; roll, supply each other since they can't do a full 360.\nThe degree of freedom are like different movements that can be made.\n\nIn mobile robotics, a car-like robot can reach any position and orientation in 2-D space, so it needs 3 DOFs to describe its pose, but at any point, you can move it only by a forward motion and a steering angle.  So it has two control DOFs and three representational DOFs; i.e. it is non-holonomic. A fixed-wing aircraft, with 3\u20134 control DOFs (forward motion, roll, pitch, and to a limited extent, yaw) in a 3-D space, is also non-holonomic, as it cannot move directly up/down or left/right.\n\nA summary of formulas and methods for computing the degrees-of-freedom in mechanical systems has been given by Pennestri, Cavacece, and Vita.<ref>{{cite conference|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239538229_On_the_Computation_of_Degrees-of-Freedom_A_Didactic_Perspective|title=On the Computation of Degrees-of-Freedom: A Didactic Perspective|first1=E.|last1=Pennestr\u0131\u0300|first2=M.|last2=Cavacece|first3=L.|last3=Vita|date=2005|doi=10.1115/DETC2005-84109|conference=2005 ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference|location=California, USA}}</ref>\n\n==Electrical engineering==\nIn [[electrical engineering]] ''degrees of freedom'' is often used to describe the number of directions in which a [[phased array]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] can form either [[beamforming|beams or nulls]].

A fixed-wing aircraft, with 3\u20134 control DOFs (forward motion, roll, pitch, and to a limited extent, yaw) in a 3-D space, is also non-holonomic, as it cannot move directly up/down or left/right.\n\nA summary of formulas and methods for computing the degrees-of-freedom in mechanical systems has been given by Pennestri, Cavacece, and Vita.<ref>{{cite conference|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239538229_On_the_Computation_of_Degrees-of-Freedom_A_Didactic_Perspective|title=On the Computation of Degrees-of-Freedom: A Didactic Perspective|first1=E.|last1=Pennestr\u0131\u0300|first2=M.|last2=Cavacece|first3=L.|last3=Vita|date=2005|doi=10.1115/DETC2005-84109|conference=2005 ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference|location=California, USA}}</ref>\n\n==Electrical engineering==\nIn [[electrical engineering]] ''degrees of freedom'' is often used to describe the number of directions in which a [[phased array]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] can form either [[beamforming|beams or nulls]].  It is equal to one less than the number of elements contained in the array, as one element is used as a reference against which either constructive or destructive interference may be applied using each of the remaining antenna elements.

While in town, she meets Martini, a [[con artist]] [[penguin]] from whom she buys a [[counterfeit]] [[Rolex]] watch. When she returns home she finds her owner, Tim, sad that there \"won't be any Christmas\". Olive discovers that Blitzen, one of [[Santa Claus's reindeer|Santa's reindeer]], is injured and unable to fly. Santa expresses in a radio interview that Christmas isn't cancelled if his sleigh can be pulled by \"all of the other reindeer\". Olive's pet flea, Fido, mishears this as \"Olive the other reindeer\", and Olive becomes convinced that it is she Santa is referring to, prompting her to travel to the North Pole to help pull the sleigh.\n\nOn the way to the bus station, Olive runs into a disgruntled [[mail carrier|Postman]] who is frustrated by having to deliver mail during the Christmas period, and expresses that he is glad Christmas might be cancelled. He learns Olive is trying to save Santa's flight, and is determined to stop Olive from saving Christmas. Olive goes to the bus station to buy a ticket to Arctic Junction. Martini shows up and Olive buys him a bus ticket, but before they can leave the station, Olive is captured by the Postman, who abducts her, claiming she is wanted for [[mail fraud]]. After she pleads for Martini's help, Martini trips the Postman, allowing Martini and Olive to catch the bus.\n\nOn the bus, Olive and Martini talk to an [[Inuit]] couple and bus driver Richard. They believe Olive misheard Santa, but wish her luck. The Postman pulls up next to the bus in his mail truck, but Martini makes a [[paper airplane]] and throws it at the Postman, knocking him off the road. When they arrive at Arctic Junction, they must wait for the next bus, so they go to a restaurant. The Postman, disguised as their waitress, lures Olive outside by stating that Santa is waiting for her. The Postman throws Olive into his truck, and while he is driving away, Olive finds a package addressed to her from \"[[Deus Ex Machina]]\" containing a [[File (tool)|metal file]] that Olive uses to escape.\n\nOlive returns to the Junction, and Martini and Richard, having discovered the Postman's actions, ask her how she got away. Olive and Martini, having missed the bus, go inside a nearby bar and are initially harassed by the bar's patrons, including bar owner [[Silent Night|Round John Virgin]]. Olive stands up to them, giving a speech about the meaning of Christmas. The patrons apologize for their behavior and Round John Virgin offers Martini and Olive a ride to the North Pole. At the North Pole, Olive is denied entry, but Martini distracts the guard, allowing Olive to get inside and look for Santa. Aside from Blitzen's injury, Santa is unsure about going out for Christmas, due to having received mean-spirited letters addressed from children. Olive convinces Santa that the letters are from the Postman, and persuades Santa not to give up on Christmas; Santa thanks Olive, and she joins the other reindeer in order to fly the sleigh.\n\nBefore they leave, the Postman switches the bag of toys with a bag of [[Advertising mail|junk mail]] and kidnaps Martini. Later, Santa discovers what happened, and Olive follows the Postman's scent to track him down. Olive struggles with the Postman, and Martini scares the Postman with a [[jack-in-the-box]], and he hits his head and is knocked unconscious. They retrieve the presents, rescue Martini, and then deliver the presents to the world. Santa gets lost in fog, and Olive guides the sleigh back to the North Pole by following the scent of cookies baked by Mrs. Claus. Comet gives Olive a ride home and she makes amends with Tim, who is happy to see her. The Postman is bound with packing tape and fitted with cardboard \"wings\" and put in the penguin exhibit in the [[zoo]] in Martini's place, while Martini is now in charge of the mail.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Olive\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as the Postman\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Martini\n* [[Ed Asner|Edward Asner]] as [[Santa Claus]]\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Fido, Olive's pet flea\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as Richard Stans\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as Tim\n* [[Michael Stipe]] as Schnitzel, Blitzen's flightless cousin\n* [[Tress MacNeille]] as Mrs. Claus and the news reporter\n* [[Matt Groening]] as Arturo, the elf that Schnitzel threw Olive into\n* [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]] as an Inuit person\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Zookeeper\n* [[David Herman]], [[Mitch Rouse]] and [[Kath Soucie]] as various characters\n}}\n\n==Music==\nMusic by [[Christopher Tyng]], lyrics by [[Steve Young (writer)|Steve Young]]\n\n*\"The Days Still Remaining 'Til Christmas\" performed by Drew Barrymore\n*\"Christmas (Bah, Bug and Hum!)\" performed by Dan Castellaneta\n*\"We're Not So Bad\" performed by [[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M.]]\n*\"Merry Christmas After All\" performed by [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]] with [[Drew Barrymore]]\n*\"The Days Still Remaining 'Til Christmas (reprise)\" performed by Drew Barrymore\n\n==Shortened Scenes==\nOriginally seen on FOX, some scenes in the special were shortened for time when it was released on DVD and aired on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.

Otto Seibold]]. In the song, ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', the lyric \"All of the other reindeer\" can be misheard in [[dialects]] with the [[cot\u2013caught merger]] as the [[mondegreen]] \"Olive, the other reindeer\".\n\n[[Drew Barrymore]] voices the title character, and she is credited as an executive producer on the special.\n\nThe special was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program#2000s|Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/content/olive-other-reindeer |title=Olive, The Other Reindeer &#124; Television Academy |website=Emmys.com |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=June 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story follows an [[anthropomorphic]] [[Jack Russell Terrier]] named Olive. While in town, she meets Martini, a [[con artist]] [[penguin]] from whom she buys a [[counterfeit]] [[Rolex]] watch. When she returns home she finds her owner, Tim, sad that there \"won't be any Christmas\". Olive discovers that Blitzen, one of [[Santa Claus's reindeer|Santa's reindeer]], is injured and unable to fly. Santa expresses in a radio interview that Christmas isn't cancelled if his sleigh can be pulled by \"all of the other reindeer\". Olive's pet flea, Fido, mishears this as \"Olive the other reindeer\", and Olive becomes convinced that it is she Santa is referring to, prompting her to travel to the North Pole to help pull the sleigh.\n\nOn the way to the bus station, Olive runs into a disgruntled [[mail carrier|Postman]] who is frustrated by having to deliver mail during the Christmas period, and expresses that he is glad Christmas might be cancelled. He learns Olive is trying to save Santa's flight, and is determined to stop Olive from saving Christmas. Olive goes to the bus station to buy a ticket to Arctic Junction. Martini shows up and Olive buys him a bus ticket, but before they can leave the station, Olive is captured by the Postman, who abducts her, claiming she is wanted for [[mail fraud]]. After she pleads for Martini's help, Martini trips the Postman, allowing Martini and Olive to catch the bus.\n\nOn the bus, Olive and Martini talk to an [[Inuit]] couple and bus driver Richard. They believe Olive misheard Santa, but wish her luck. The Postman pulls up next to the bus in his mail truck, but Martini makes a [[paper airplane]] and throws it at the Postman, knocking him off the road. When they arrive at Arctic Junction, they must wait for the next bus, so they go to a restaurant. The Postman, disguised as their waitress, lures Olive outside by stating that Santa is waiting for her. The Postman throws Olive into his truck, and while he is driving away, Olive finds a package addressed to her from \"[[Deus Ex Machina]]\" containing a [[File (tool)|metal file]] that Olive uses to escape.\n\nOlive returns to the Junction, and Martini and Richard, having discovered the Postman's actions, ask her how she got away. Olive and Martini, having missed the bus, go inside a nearby bar and are initially harassed by the bar's patrons, including bar owner [[Silent Night|Round John Virgin]]. Olive stands up to them, giving a speech about the meaning of Christmas. The patrons apologize for their behavior and Round John Virgin offers Martini and Olive a ride to the North Pole. At the North Pole, Olive is denied entry, but Martini distracts the guard, allowing Olive to get inside and look for Santa. Aside from Blitzen's injury, Santa is unsure about going out for Christmas, due to having received mean-spirited letters addressed from children. Olive convinces Santa that the letters are from the Postman, and persuades Santa not to give up on Christmas; Santa thanks Olive, and she joins the other reindeer in order to fly the sleigh.\n\nBefore they leave, the Postman switches the bag of toys with a bag of [[Advertising mail|junk mail]] and kidnaps Martini. Later, Santa discovers what happened, and Olive follows the Postman's scent to track him down. Olive struggles with the Postman, and Martini scares the Postman with a [[jack-in-the-box]], and he hits his head and is knocked unconscious. They retrieve the presents, rescue Martini, and then deliver the presents to the world. Santa gets lost in fog, and Olive guides the sleigh back to the North Pole by following the scent of cookies baked by Mrs. Claus. Comet gives Olive a ride home and she makes amends with Tim, who is happy to see her. The Postman is bound with packing tape and fitted with cardboard \"wings\" and put in the penguin exhibit in the [[zoo]] in Martini's place, while Martini is now in charge of the mail.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Olive\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as the Postman\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Martini\n* [[Ed Asner|Edward Asner]] as [[Santa Claus]]\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Fido, Olive's pet flea\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as Richard Stans\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as Tim\n* [[Michael Stipe]] as Schnitzel, Blitzen's flightless cousin\n* [[Tress MacNeille]] as Mrs. Claus and the news reporter\n* [[Matt Groening]] as Arturo, the elf that Schnitzel threw Olive into\n* [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]] as an Inuit person\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Zookeeper\n* [[David Herman]], [[Mitch Rouse]] and [[Kath Soucie]] as various characters\n}}\n\n==Music==\nMusic by [[Christopher Tyng]], lyrics by [[Steve Young (writer)|Steve Young]]\n\n*\"The Days Still Remaining 'Til Christmas\" performed by Drew Barrymore\n*\"Christmas (Bah, Bug and Hum!)\" performed by Dan Castellaneta\n*\"We're Not So Bad\" performed by [[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M.]]\n*\"Merry Christmas After All\" performed by [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]] with [[Drew Barrymore]]\n*\"The Days Still Remaining 'Til Christmas (reprise)\" performed by Drew Barrymore\n\n==Shortened Scenes==\nOriginally seen on FOX, some scenes in the special were shortened for time when it was released on DVD and aired on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.
