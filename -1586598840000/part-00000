Built in 1890 by [[Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads|Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, she was the first state-owned icebreaker of Finland and one of the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world.<ref name=\"history\">Jones, S. A history of icebreaking ships. Ocean Sovereignty, Vol. 3, No. 1, 2008. Page 55.</ref> ''Murtaja'' remained in service for 68 years until she was decommissioned and broken up in 1958 after having been replaced by the [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] ''[[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|Karhu]]''.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe history of winter navigation in Finland dates back to the 17th century when mail was carried year-round between [[Turku]], Finland and [[Grisslehamn]], Sweden, over the [[Sea of \u00c5land]]. During the winter season, the postmen used ice boats, strengthened sleigh-boats that were pushed over the ice until it gave in under the weight of the boat. Once in water, the men began rocking the boat back and forth until it slowly began to break the ice and proceed towards open water. The mail route was often called the most dangerous in Europe.<ref name=\"laurell14\">Laurell 1992, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s there were plans to start year-round traffic from the [[Hanko]], the southernmost tip of the continental Finland, but even people in the [[Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority]] were doubtful about the project \u2013 the director's aide was quoted saying that this close to the [[60th parallel north]] winter traffic to Hanko would forever be a distant dream. Despite the opposition, a harbour and railway connection were built in 1872\u201373. Several domestic and foreign shipping companies attempted year-round traffic with varying commercial success, but the port of Hanko remained closed for several months nearly every year.<ref name=\"laurell17-19\">Laurell 1992, p. 17-19.</ref>\n\nIn 1889, the Finnish factory owners encouraged the [[Denmark|Danish]] shipping company [[Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab]] to send their icebreaker, ''[[Bryderen]]'', to the northern [[Baltic Sea]] and try to open a path to the icebound port of Hanko. ''Bryderen'', the most powerful icebreaker in Europe at that time, had {{convert|1000|ihp|kW|abbr=on|adj=on}} steam engine and could easily break ice up to {{convert|45|cm|in|0}} thick. As word got around, people in the [[Senate of Finland]] became interested in the experiment as its result would affect the general opinions regarding icebreakers and winter navigation.<ref name=\"laurell23-24\">Laurell 1992, p. 23-24.</ref>\n\nOn 16 April 1889, two steamships were spotted approaching the lighthouse of [[Russar\u00f6]] from the south and news about unidentified vessels coming through the ice field began spreading immediately. The ships were the icebreaker ''Bryderen'' and a 912-ton cargo steamer ''Vesuv'',<ref name=\"ramsay142\">Ramsay 1949, p. 142.</ref> owned by the Danish shipping company, that was following on the channel broken by the icebreaker. During the following night, the icebreaker lost all four propeller blades, but once the replacement blades had been installed, the convoy arrived at the port of Hanko on 20 April 1889 at 13:00. Large headlines in the major Finnish newspapers reported how the ice blockade had finally been broken \u2014 a foreign icebreaker had come through the ice and was now moored at a Finnish port.<ref name=\"laurell24-26\">Laurell 1992, p. 24-26.</ref> The successful arrival of ''Bryderen'' was seen as the definite answer to the question whether or not an icebreaker would be needed in Finland.<ref name=\"ramsay144\">Ramsay 1949, p. 144.</ref>\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nShortly after the visit of ''Bryderen'', the Senate sent a call for bids for several Finnish and foreign shipyards for the construction of a steam-powered icebreaker capable of breaking a {{convert|32|ft|m|1|adj=on}} channel. Bids for a single-screw \"European-type\" icebreaker similar to the German icebreaker ''[[Eisbrecher I]]'' were received from German shipbuilder [[AG Vulcan Stettin]], Danish [[Burmeister & Wain]] and Swedish shipyards [[Kockums|Kockums AB]] and Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB. An expert committee appointed by the Senate recommended the second Swedish design, which was the second cheapest at 445,000 [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]], and the contract was signed with Bergsundet on 25 May 1889.<ref name=\"laurell29-33\" />\n\nThe construction of the icebreaker began on 18 August 1889 and she was launched on 23 December. On the same day she was given the name ''Murtaja'' after her German, Swedish and Danish counterparts \u2013 each country had named their first icebreaker simply ''Icebreaker'' in their own language.<ref name=\"laurell29-33\" /><ref name=\"ramsay147-148\">Ramsay 1949, p. 147-148.</ref>\n\n[[File:Icebreaker Murtaja on Trials.jpg|thumb|left|''Murtaja'' on sea trials in late March 1890.]]\n\nThe [[sea trials]] on 23\u201326 March 1890 were witnessed by a group of experts, among them the Finnish-Swedish [[arctic explorer]] [[Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld]], the first person to complete a voyage through the [[Northern Sea Route]]. During these trials ''Murtaja'' passed all but one of the tests for performance and general [[seaworthiness]]. Her draught at full load exceeded the contract specification by {{convert|1|ft|6|in|m}}, meaning that either her specialized hull form could not be fully utilized in icebreaking or the coal capacity would have to be reduced, affecting her range and endurance.<ref name=\"ramsay150\">Ramsay 1949, p. 150.</ref> However, the shipyard promised to do everything it could to reduce the draught of the vessel to an acceptable level and ''Murtaja'', the largest and most powerful European icebreaker at that time, was delivered to the owner on 30 March 1890. She left the shipyard on the following day and headed to Helsinki, where she was welcomed by a large cheering crowd on 2 April 1890.<ref name=\"laurell36\" /><ref name=\"ramsay152-153\">Ramsay 1949, p. 152-153.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Murtaja in Land och Stad.JPG|thumb|right|Drawing of ''Murtaja'' published in the Finnish newspaper [[Land och Stad]] on 16 April 1890, two weeks after she arrived to Finland.]]\n[[File:MECHELIN(1894) p033 The Ice-Breaker MURTAJA.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of ''Murtaja'' published in 1894.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was given the task of assisting ships to the port of Hanko. In the temporary directive, given on 5 February 1890, she was to maintain an open channel between the harbour and open water, and assist inbound and outbound ships by towing if necessary. The directive also gave some of the first guidelines for icebreakers regarding for example the qualifications required from the crew.<ref name=\"laurell34\">Laurell 1992, p. 34.</ref> When ''Murtaja'' arrived in Helsinki in early April, most of the ice had already melted and the new icebreaker was not taken into service. She returned to Finnboda for repairs under warranty in May and remained in the shipyard until mid-August.<ref name=\"laurell39-41\">Laurell 1992, p. 39-41.</ref>\n\nThe winter of 1890\u20131891 was mild, so ''Murtaja'' could not demonstrate her icebreaking capabilities to their full extent. However, she lost a large number of cast iron propeller blades and while the replacement blades could be installed at sea by trimming the vessel so that the propeller shaft was near the water surface, the heavy task took several days. For this reason the [[Helsinki Polytechnics]] later developed more durable steel blades that were also used in the subsequent icebreakers.<ref name=\"laurell42-43\">Laurell 1992, p. 42-43.</ref>\n\nDuring the first normal winters the icebreaking capability of ''Murtaja'' could be determined. She could break level ice up to {{convert|47|cm|in|0}} thick in continuous motion as long as there was no snow, in which case even {{convert|25|cm|in|0|adj=on}} ice required backing and ramming. In this method the ship was reversed two to four ship lengths before ordering full ahead, after which the ship could break new channel up to six ship lengths, almost {{convert|150|m|ft|0}}. However, in more difficult ice conditions each ramming would move the ship forwards only {{convert|10|m|ft|0|}}. In snow-covered ice and drift ice ''Murtaja'' could not operate efficiently due to her inefficient hull form.

The Finnish icebreakers were placed under the command of the [[Baltic Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and given the task of assisting naval ships and troop transportations in the Gulf of Finland. ''Murtaja'' was stationed with ''Sampo'' in the southern parts of the Archipelago Sea and between Turku and [[Mariehamn]]. Icebreaker assistance to merchant ships was largely neglected and the icebreakers often carried supplies for the Russian troops.<ref name=\"laurell91-93\">Laurell 1992, p. 91-93.</ref>\n\nOn 6 December 1917 the [[Parliament of Finland]] accepted the declaration of independence given by the Senate and on 29 December the icebreakers ''Murtaja'' and ''Sampo'' raised the [[flag of Finland|state flag of the independent Finland]] for the first time. However, already in early January 1918 the ship was seized by the Russian revolutionary fleet and ordered to assist the Russian troops stationed in Finland. From the beginning the Finnish officials attempted to negotiate the return of the icebreaker, but it wasn't until 5 April 1918 before ''Murtaja'' was handed back to Finland.<ref name=\"laurell99-102\">Laurell 1991, p. 99-102.</ref>\n\n''Murtaja'' survived the war without major damage and continued in service through the [[interwar period]].

The Finnish icebreakers had been equipped with gun mounts already in the 1920s and were armed with light artillery. ''Murtaja'' spent the early stages of the war in [[Viipuri]] and assisted supply ships to the port of [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Koivisto]].<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, p. 259-260.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] began on 25 June 1941, the Finnish icebreakers were re-armed and their anti-aircraft armament was improved. On 20 July, while guarding a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Motti|motti]] in the [[Battle of Hanko (1941)|Hanko Front]], the camouflaged ''Murtaja'' was attacked by a group of Soviet [[fighter-bomber]]s. None of the planes scored a direct hit, but the nearby explosions caused severe damage to the engine and fittings. On the following day ''Murtaja'' was towed to [[Crichton-Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Turku]] for repairs.<ref name=\"laurell282-284\">Laurell 1992, p. 282-284.</ref> Later the front moved east and the icebreaker fleet was disbanded in December 1941, after which some of the armament was removed and the icebreakers resumed their normal peacetime duties.<ref name=\"laurell286\">Laurell 1992, p. 286.</ref> For the remainder of the war ''Murtaja'' assisted ships without major incidents.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Decommissioning ===\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Murtaja 1850s.jpg|thumb|''Murtaja'' photographed shortly before retiring in the late 1950s.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was often criticized for her poor performance in difficult ice conditions and she was deemed old and obsolete already in 1906.<ref name=\"ramsay175-176\" /> Selling her was set as a prerequisite for ordering a new icebreaker, but while several foreign ports were interested in purchasing ''Murtaja'', in September 1906 the Senate decided to order the third state-owned icebreaker, [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']], without selling the old one.<ref name=\"laurell72\">Laurell 1992, p. 72.</ref> As more modern icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, ''Murtaja'' was again deemed obsolete and worn-out, and she was criticized for her high operating costs. She was said to be in need of complete overhaul and rebuilding in 1926, but the Finnish Board of Navigation did not agree to this until almost ten years later, although it noted that decommissioning her would probably be a better solution.<ref name=\"ramsay175-176\">Ramsay 1949, p. 175-176.</ref>\n\nDespite the criticism, ''Murtaja'' remained in service through the First and Second World Wars until the late 1950s, although during her last years in service her assistance in the [[Archipelago Sea]] was described being \"more of a moral nature\".<ref name=\"laurell330\">Laurell 1992, p. 330.</ref> The renewal of the Finnish icebreaker fleet began in 1952 after the [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union]] had been paid, and the first post-war icebreaker, [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], was commissioned in 1953. When the harsh winters of the 1950s showed that modern icebreakers were needed, a series of smaller diesel-electric icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago. The first steam-powered icebreaker to be decommissioned was the old ''Murtaja'', which was decommissioned on 3 May 1958 after almost 70 years of service. She was replaced by the new diesel-electric [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|''Karhu'']] and broken up shortly afterwards. The second ''Karhu'' class icebreaker was named [[Finnish icebreaker Murtaja (1959)|''Murtaja'']] in 1959 to honor the first state-owned icebreaker of Finland.<ref name=\"laurell332\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen231\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 231.</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n[[File:Icebreaker Murtaja docked.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''Murtaja'' showing her spoon-shaped bow during docking.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was {{convert|47.55|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|42.50|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[waterline length|at the waterline]].

Built in 1890 by [[Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads|Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, she was the first state-owned icebreaker of Finland and one of the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world.<ref name=\"history\">Jones, S. A history of icebreaking ships. Ocean Sovereignty, Vol. 3, No. 1, 2008. Page 55.</ref> ''Murtaja'' remained in service for 68 years until she was decommissioned and broken up in 1958 after having been replaced by the [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] ''[[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|Karhu]]''.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe history of winter navigation in Finland dates back to the 17th century when mail was carried year-round between [[Turku]], Finland and [[Grisslehamn]], Sweden, over the [[Sea of \u00c5land]]. During the winter season, the postmen used ice boats, strengthened sleigh-boats that were pushed over the ice until it gave in under the weight of the boat. Once in water, the men began rocking the boat back and forth until it slowly began to break the ice and proceed towards open water. The mail route was often called the most dangerous in Europe.<ref name=\"laurell14\">Laurell 1992, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s there were plans to start year-round traffic from the [[Hanko]], the southernmost tip of the continental Finland, but even people in the [[Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority]] were doubtful about the project \u2013 the director's aide was quoted saying that this close to the [[60th parallel north]] winter traffic to Hanko would forever be a distant dream. Despite the opposition, a harbour and railway connection were built in 1872\u201373. Several domestic and foreign shipping companies attempted year-round traffic with varying commercial success, but the port of Hanko remained closed for several months nearly every year.<ref name=\"laurell17-19\">Laurell 1992, p. 17-19.</ref>\n\nIn 1889, the Finnish factory owners encouraged the [[Denmark|Danish]] shipping company [[Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab]] to send their icebreaker, ''[[Bryderen]]'', to the northern [[Baltic Sea]] and try to open a path to the icebound port of Hanko. ''Bryderen'', the most powerful icebreaker in Europe at that time, had {{convert|1000|ihp|kW|abbr=on|adj=on}} steam engine and could easily break ice up to {{convert|45|cm|in|0}} thick. As word got around, people in the [[Senate of Finland]] became interested in the experiment as its result would affect the general opinions regarding icebreakers and winter navigation.<ref name=\"laurell23-24\">Laurell 1992, p. 23-24.</ref>\n\nOn 16 April 1889, two steamships were spotted approaching the lighthouse of [[Russar\u00f6]] from the south and news about unidentified vessels coming through the ice field began spreading immediately. The ships were the icebreaker ''Bryderen'' and a 912-ton cargo steamer ''Vesuv'',<ref name=\"ramsay142\">Ramsay 1949, p. 142.</ref> owned by the Danish shipping company, that was following on the channel broken by the icebreaker. During the following night, the icebreaker lost all four propeller blades, but once the replacement blades had been installed, the convoy arrived at the port of Hanko on 20 April 1889 at 13:00. Large headlines in the major Finnish newspapers reported how the ice blockade had finally been broken \u2014 a foreign icebreaker had come through the ice and was now moored at a Finnish port.<ref name=\"laurell24-26\">Laurell 1992, p. 24-26.</ref> The successful arrival of ''Bryderen'' was seen as the definite answer to the question whether or not an icebreaker would be needed in Finland.<ref name=\"ramsay144\">Ramsay 1949, p. 144.</ref>\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nShortly after the visit of ''Bryderen'', the Senate sent a call for bids for several Finnish and foreign shipyards for the construction of a steam-powered icebreaker capable of breaking a {{convert|32|ft|m|1|adj=on}} channel. Bids for a single-screw \"European-type\" icebreaker similar to the German icebreaker ''[[Eisbrecher I]]'' were received from German shipbuilder [[AG Vulcan Stettin]], Danish [[Burmeister & Wain]] and Swedish shipyards [[Kockums|Kockums AB]] and Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB. An expert committee appointed by the Senate recommended the second Swedish design, which was the second cheapest at 445,000 [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]], and the contract was signed with Bergsundet on 25 May 1889.<ref name=\"laurell29-33\" />\n\nThe construction of the icebreaker began on 18 August 1889 and she was launched on 23 December. On the same day she was given the name ''Murtaja'' after her German, Swedish and Danish counterparts \u2013 each country had named their first icebreaker simply ''Icebreaker'' in their own language.<ref name=\"laurell29-33\" /><ref name=\"ramsay147-148\">Ramsay 1949, p. 147-148.</ref>\n\n[[File:Icebreaker Murtaja on Trials.jpg|thumb|left|''Murtaja'' on sea trials in late March 1890.]]\n\nThe [[sea trials]] on 23\u201326 March 1890 were witnessed by a group of experts, among them the Finnish-Swedish [[arctic explorer]] [[Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld]], the first person to complete a voyage through the [[Northern Sea Route]]. During these trials ''Murtaja'' passed all but one of the tests for performance and general [[seaworthiness]]. Her draught at full load exceeded the contract specification by {{convert|1|ft|6|in|m}}, meaning that either her specialized hull form could not be fully utilized in icebreaking or the coal capacity would have to be reduced, affecting her range and endurance.<ref name=\"ramsay150\">Ramsay 1949, p. 150.</ref> However, the shipyard promised to do everything it could to reduce the draught of the vessel to an acceptable level and ''Murtaja'', the largest and most powerful European icebreaker at that time, was delivered to the owner on 30 March 1890. She left the shipyard on the following day and headed to Helsinki, where she was welcomed by a large cheering crowd on 2 April 1890.<ref name=\"laurell36\" /><ref name=\"ramsay152-153\">Ramsay 1949, p. 152-153.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Murtaja in Land och Stad.JPG|thumb|right|Drawing of ''Murtaja'' published in the Finnish newspaper [[Land och Stad]] on 16 April 1890, two weeks after she arrived to Finland.]]\n[[File:MECHELIN(1894) p033 The Ice-Breaker MURTAJA.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of ''Murtaja'' published in 1894.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was given the task of assisting ships to the port of Hanko. In the temporary directive, given on 5 February 1890, she was to maintain an open channel between the harbour and open water, and assist inbound and outbound ships by towing if necessary. The directive also gave some of the first guidelines for icebreakers regarding for example the qualifications required from the crew.<ref name=\"laurell34\">Laurell 1992, p. 34.</ref> When ''Murtaja'' arrived in Helsinki in early April, most of the ice had already melted and the new icebreaker was not taken into service. She returned to Finnboda for repairs under warranty in May and remained in the shipyard until mid-August.<ref name=\"laurell39-41\">Laurell 1992, p. 39-41.</ref>\n\nThe winter of 1890\u20131891 was mild, so ''Murtaja'' could not demonstrate her icebreaking capabilities to their full extent. However, she lost a large number of cast iron propeller blades and while the replacement blades could be installed at sea by trimming the vessel so that the propeller shaft was near the water surface, the heavy task took several days. For this reason the [[Helsinki Polytechnics]] later developed more durable steel blades that were also used in the subsequent icebreakers.<ref name=\"laurell42-43\">Laurell 1992, p. 42-43.</ref>\n\nDuring the first normal winters the icebreaking capability of ''Murtaja'' could be determined. She could break level ice up to {{convert|47|cm|in|0}} thick in continuous motion as long as there was no snow, in which case even {{convert|25|cm|in|0|adj=on}} ice required backing and ramming. In this method the ship was reversed two to four ship lengths before ordering full ahead, after which the ship could break new channel up to six ship lengths, almost {{convert|150|m|ft|0}}. However, in more difficult ice conditions each ramming would move the ship forwards only {{convert|10|m|ft|0|}}. In snow-covered ice and drift ice ''Murtaja'' could not operate efficiently due to her inefficient hull form. Sometimes the crew had to rely on hacking and sawing the ice or even explosives to release the ship from compressive ice fields.<ref name=\"laurell44-46\">Laurell 1992, p. 44-46.</ref>\n\nDespite her efforts the 930-ton single-screw ''Murtaja'' was not deemed powerful enough to keep the southernmost port of Finland open every winter, and the winter navigation committee appointed by the Senate came to a conclusion that a second icebreaker would be needed.<ref name=\"laurell52\">Laurell 1992, p. 52.</ref> The new icebreaker, equipped with propellers in both bow and stern, was built in 1898 and given the name [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']].<ref name=\"laurell58-59\">Laurell 1992, p. 58-59.</ref>\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nIn August 1914 [[Russian Empire|Russia]] joined the [[First World War]] and navigating in the Baltic Sea became dangerous due to [[naval mine]]s and [[Kaiserliche Marine|German]] [[U-boat]]s. The Finnish icebreakers were placed under the command of the [[Baltic Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and given the task of assisting naval ships and troop transportations in the Gulf of Finland. ''Murtaja'' was stationed with ''Sampo'' in the southern parts of the Archipelago Sea and between Turku and [[Mariehamn]]. Icebreaker assistance to merchant ships was largely neglected and the icebreakers often carried supplies for the Russian troops.<ref name=\"laurell91-93\">Laurell 1992, p. 91-93.</ref>\n\nOn 6 December 1917 the [[Parliament of Finland]] accepted the declaration of independence given by the Senate and on 29 December the icebreakers ''Murtaja'' and ''Sampo'' raised the [[flag of Finland|state flag of the independent Finland]] for the first time. However, already in early January 1918 the ship was seized by the Russian revolutionary fleet and ordered to assist the Russian troops stationed in Finland. From the beginning the Finnish officials attempted to negotiate the return of the icebreaker, but it wasn't until 5 April 1918 before ''Murtaja'' was handed back to Finland.<ref name=\"laurell99-102\">Laurell 1991, p. 99-102.</ref>\n\n''Murtaja'' survived the war without major damage and continued in service through the [[interwar period]].

The Finnish icebreakers had been equipped with gun mounts already in the 1920s and were armed with light artillery. ''Murtaja'' spent the early stages of the war in [[Viipuri]] and assisted supply ships to the port of [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Koivisto]].<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, p. 259-260.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] began on 25 June 1941, the Finnish icebreakers were re-armed and their anti-aircraft armament was improved. On 20 July, while guarding a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Motti|motti]] in the [[Battle of Hanko (1941)|Hanko Front]], the camouflaged ''Murtaja'' was attacked by a group of Soviet [[fighter-bomber]]s. None of the planes scored a direct hit, but the nearby explosions caused severe damage to the engine and fittings. On the following day ''Murtaja'' was towed to [[Crichton-Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Turku]] for repairs.<ref name=\"laurell282-284\">Laurell 1992, p. 282-284.</ref> Later the front moved east and the icebreaker fleet was disbanded in December 1941, after which some of the armament was removed and the icebreakers resumed their normal peacetime duties.<ref name=\"laurell286\">Laurell 1992, p. 286.</ref> For the remainder of the war ''Murtaja'' assisted ships without major incidents.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Decommissioning ===\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Murtaja 1850s.jpg|thumb|''Murtaja'' photographed shortly before retiring in the late 1950s.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was often criticized for her poor performance in difficult ice conditions and she was deemed old and obsolete already in 1906.<ref name=\"ramsay175-176\" /> Selling her was set as a prerequisite for ordering a new icebreaker, but while several foreign ports were interested in purchasing ''Murtaja'', in September 1906 the Senate decided to order the third state-owned icebreaker, [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']], without selling the old one.<ref name=\"laurell72\">Laurell 1992, p. 72.</ref> As more modern icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, ''Murtaja'' was again deemed obsolete and worn-out, and she was criticized for her high operating costs. She was said to be in need of complete overhaul and rebuilding in 1926, but the Finnish Board of Navigation did not agree to this until almost ten years later, although it noted that decommissioning her would probably be a better solution.<ref name=\"ramsay175-176\">Ramsay 1949, p. 175-176.</ref>\n\nDespite the criticism, ''Murtaja'' remained in service through the First and Second World Wars until the late 1950s, although during her last years in service her assistance in the [[Archipelago Sea]] was described being \"more of a moral nature\".<ref name=\"laurell330\">Laurell 1992, p. 330.</ref> The renewal of the Finnish icebreaker fleet began in 1952 after the [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union]] had been paid, and the first post-war icebreaker, [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], was commissioned in 1953. When the harsh winters of the 1950s showed that modern icebreakers were needed, a series of smaller diesel-electric icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago. The first steam-powered icebreaker to be decommissioned was the old ''Murtaja'', which was decommissioned on 3 May 1958 after almost 70 years of service. She was replaced by the new diesel-electric [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|''Karhu'']] and broken up shortly afterwards. The second ''Karhu'' class icebreaker was named [[Finnish icebreaker Murtaja (1959)|''Murtaja'']] in 1959 to honor the first state-owned icebreaker of Finland.<ref name=\"laurell332\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen231\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 231.</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n[[File:Icebreaker Murtaja docked.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''Murtaja'' showing her spoon-shaped bow during docking.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was {{convert|47.55|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|42.50|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[waterline length|at the waterline]]. Her [[moulded breadth]] was {{convert|10.95|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} and breadth at the waterline slightly smaller, {{convert|10.80|m|ft|2|abbr=out}}.
