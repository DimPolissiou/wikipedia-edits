{"title_page": "Resuscitator", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2014}}\nA '''resuscitator''' is a device using positive pressure to inflate the lungs of an [[Syncope (medicine)|unconscious]] person who is [[apnea|not breathing]], in order to keep them [[oxygen]]ated and alive. There are three basic types: a ''manual'' version (also known as a ''[[bag valve mask]]'') consisting of a mask and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a high-pressure tank. The second type is the ''Expired Air'' or breath powered resuscitator. The first appearance of the second type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957. The third type is an ''oxygen powered'' resuscitator. These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered resuscitator are Time Cycled, Volume Constant Ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box. Most modern resuscitators are designed to allow the patient to breathe on his own should he recover the ability to do so. All resuscitation devices should be able to deliver >85% oxygen when a gas source is available.\n\n== History ==\n\nResuscitators began in 1907 <ref name=\"The dawn of mechanical ventilation\">{{cite book|last=Bahns|first=Ernst|title=The Evolution of Ventilation|publisher=Dragerwerk AG|isbn=3-926762-17-9|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>  when Heinrich Dr\u00e4ger, owner of the Dr\u00e4gerwerk AG Company, produced the \"Pulmotor\" Resuscitator. Considered to be the first practical device for delivering oxygen to unconscious patients or patients in respiratory distress, the Pulmotor influenced resuscitators for many years.\n\n[[File:Lungmotor resuscitation device advertisement (newspaper, 1917).jpg|thumb|Early \"Lungmotor\" resuscitation device]]\nWhen ambulance services began to form in major cities around the world, such as in London, New York and Los Angeles, [[Emergency medical services]] or EMS was developed. In these early days, perhaps the most advanced piece of equipment carried on these ambulances were devices for delivering supplemental oxygen to patients in respiratory distress. The Pulmotor and later models, such as the Emerson Resuscitator, utilized heavy tanks of oxygen to power a device which forced air into the patient's lungs. While better than no oxygen at all, these old units were problematic. Aside from often failing to sense obstructions in the airway, the Emerson, and to a lesser degree the Pulmotor, were large, bulky and heavy. The Emerson Resuscitator required two strong men to carry it from the ambulance to the victim. Perhaps the greatest defect, however, was the fact that these units \"cycled\".\n\nCycling was a feature that was built into most resuscitators built before the 1960s, including the Pulmotor and Emerson models. To ensure that the victim's lungs were not injured from being over-inflated, the resuscitator was pre-set to provide what was considered a safe pressure of oxygen. Once the unit reached this limit, it ceased to pump oxygen. For patients suffering from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), or any form of obstructive lung disease, the delivered pressure was insufficient pressure to fill the lungs with oxygen, meaning that, for patients with any sort of obstructive lung disease, units that pressure cycled did more harm than good. Pressure cycling also meant that [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] was impossible to perform if a patient's respiration was being supported by one of these units. If chest compressions were to be done, the cycle would be retarded and the resuscitator would be unable to provide oxygen as long as the chest was being compressed. For victims of smoke inhalation and drowning, however, the benefits outweighed the negatives, so these units found a home on ambulances around the world. The devices that cycled on the basis of upper and lower pressure limits are known as pressure cycled automatic resuscitators. In the UK the introduction of BS6850:1987 Ventilatory Resuscitators confirmed that \"....automatic pressure-cycled gas-powered resuscitators are not considered suitable for such use (closed chest cardiac compression)...\" and confirmed the standards required for gas powered resuscitators and operator powered resuscitators.<ref>{{cite book|title=BS 6850:1987 British Standard Specification for Ventilatory resuscitators|year=1987|publisher=British Standards Institution|isbn=0 580 15880 2}}</ref> The following year a similar ISO standard was introduced.<ref>{{cite book|title=ISO 8382:1988 Resuscitators intended for use with humans|year=1988|publisher=International Organisation for Standardisation}}</ref> Around this date most manufacturers supplied or introduced time - volume cycled resuscitators and pressure cycled devices were discontinued.\n\nBoth the Pulmotor and the Emerson depended to a large extent upon the patient's ability to breathe the oxygen in order to be beneficial. Due to the limitations imposed by the cycling feature, this meant that patients in need of rescue breathing benefited little from the application of these devices. The Emerson and Pulmotor were utilized until the mid-1960s, when a breakthrough in the history of oxygen delivery was made: the demand valve.<ref name=\"Demand valve assembly for use with breathing or resuscitation equipment\" <ref>{{cite book|last=CHANEY|first=G.|title=US Patent 3,285,261|date=Nov 15, 1966}}</ref>\n\nThe demand valve was a revolutionary new piece of equipment. At the simple push of a button, high-flow oxygen could be delivered into the lungs of the patient without the worry of the device cycling and, thus, ceasing to pump oxygen. Any amount of pressure that might be required to inflate the lungs could be achieved, and the demand valve was better able to detect obstructions in the lungs and more able to \"work with the patient\" than the Emerson and Pulmotor could. The demand valve could also provide oxygen at any flow rate required to a conscious patient in respiratory distress. Conserving the often limited reserves of oxygen was easier with a demand valve, as oxygen was designed only to flow when either the button was depressed or the casualty inhaled. Later medical opinion decided that getting high flow oxygen into a patients airway was a factor in causing vomiting and aspiration. Demand valve resuscitators were introduced with restrictors to limit flow rates to 40 lpm. Use of the demand valve resuscitator in Europe was limited by the lack of pressure relief valve or audible alarm for high pressure.\n\n== Modern day ==\nThe [[bag valve mask|ambu-bag]] was a further advancement in resuscitation. Introduced in the 1960s by the Danish company Ambu, this device allowed two rescuers to perform CPR and ventilation on a non-breathing patient with an acceptable chance of success. The ambu-bag has now mostly replaced the demand valve as the primary method of ventilation, largely due to concerns of potential over-inflation with the demand valve by untrained rescuers. The ambu-bag, unlike the older version of the demand valve (all new models of demand valve now have pressure relief valves set at 60&nbsp;cm of water to prevent accidental overinflation of the lungs), has a \"pop-off\" valve to prevent inflation at greater than 40 pounds -per-square-inch (275.79 kilo-pascals), with the result being that it is generally more common in the pre-hospital setting than the demand valve. However, the demand valve remains popular with BLS providers, and in situations where conserving supplies of oxygen is  of paramount importance. The demand valve, while less popular today than it was previously, still remains in service, albeit with important safety features added, including the addition of a pressure-relief valve to prevent over-inflation and the restriction of its flow to 40 liters a minute.\n\nEven newer products have been developed and are now available. In 1992 the Genesis(R) II time/volume cycled resuscitator (now upgraded to meet the current, International, resuscitation guidelines and called the CAREvent(R) ALS and CA)provide the SIMV automatic ventilation mode with demand breathing for the spontaneously breathing patient. These devices work like full blown transport ventilators yet are simple enough to operate that they can be used in an emergency situation by pre-hospital healthcare providers and are small enough to be easily transportable. Having a manual override control for use during mask CPR they meet the requirements of the current resuscitation standards. The Oxylator (R) EM-100 introduced in the late 1990s and subsequently replaced by the more flexible Oxylator (R) EMX and HD are pressure cycled devices that utilize pressure, rather than time, cycling to ventilate the patient. \nMore recently the microVENT resuscitator range introduced two new models, the microVENT(R) CPR and the microVENT(R)World. These two new time/volume resuscitators meet the latest requirements for resuscitation and are lighter and smaller<ref name=\"Brochure download\">{{cite web|title=Manufacturer information|url=http://www.meditech.gb.com/Downloads.html|website=Meditech (B.N.O.S.

In July 1789, the Department of Foreign Affairs was carried over by the government established under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In September of that year, the name of the department was changed to [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. The department handled foreign relations and issued passports, and until the mid-19th century had various domestic duties.\n\nFor decades thereafter, passports were issued not only by the Department of State but also by states and cities, and by notaries public. For example, an [[internal passport]] dated 1815 was presented to Massachusetts citizen George Barker to allow him to travel as a free black man to visit relatives in Southern slave states.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrating Black Americana|url=http://video.pbs.org/video/2365418399/|website=video.pbs.org|accessdate=February 16, 2015|format=video}}</ref> Passports issued by American authorities other than the Department of State breached propriety and caused confusion abroad.

The passport requirement of the Civil War era lacked statutory authority.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} During World War I (1914\u20131918), European countries instituted passport requirements. The [[:wikisource:Travel Control Act|Travel Control Act]] of May 22, 1918, permitted the president, when the United States was at war, to proclaim a passport requirement, and President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] issued such a proclamation on August 18, 1918.

Records of the Department of State show that 130,360 passports were issued between 1810 and 1873 and that 369,844 passports were issued between 1877 and 1909. Some of those passports were family passports or group passports. A passport application could cover, variously, a wife, a child, or children, one or more servants, or a woman traveling under the protection of a man. The passport would be issued to the man. Similarly, a passport application could cover a child traveling with his or her mother. The passport would be issued to the mother. The number of Americans who traveled without passports is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/genealogy/passport/ |title=Passport Applications |publisher=Archives.gov |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[League of Nations]] held a conference in 1920 concerning passports and through-train travel, and conferences in 1926 and 1927 concerning passports. The 1920 conference put forward guidelines on the layout and features of passports, which the 1926 and 1927 conferences followed up. Those guidelines were steps in the shaping of contemporary passports. One of the guidelines was about 32-page passport booklets, such as the U.S. type III mentioned in this section, below. Another guideline was about [[#Languages|languages in passports]]. A conference on travel and tourism held by the [[United Nations]] in 1963 did not result in standardized passports. Passport standardization was accomplished in 1980 under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n\nThe design and contents of U.S. passports changed over the years.<ref>{{citation |publisher=United States Department of State, Passport Office |title=The United States Passport: Past, Present, Future |location=Washington, D.C. |date=1976 |pages=passim}}</ref> Prior to World War I the passport was typically a large ({{convert|11|x|17|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=x|&nbsp;/&nbsp;}}) diploma, with a large engraved seal of the Department of State at the top, repeated in red wax at the bottom, the bearer's description and signature on the left, and his name on the right above space for data such as \"accompanied by his wife,\" all in ornate script. In 1926, the Department of State introduced the type III passport. This had a stiff red cover, with a window cutout through which the passport number was visible. That style of passport contained 32 pages.{{sfn|Lloyd|p=130}} American passports had green covers from 1941 until 1976, when the cover was changed to blue, as part of the [[U.S. bicentennial]] celebration of 1975-1977, and remained blue afterwards until 1993. Green covers were again issued from April 1993 until March 1994, and included a special tribute to Benjamin Franklin in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the United States Consular Service. After March 1994, blue passports, with pages showing U.S. state seals, were reissued. In 2007, images showcasing landscapes of the United States as well as places and objects of significance to U.S. history were introduced.\n\nInitially, a U.S. passport was issued for two years, although by the 1950s on application by the holder a passport could be stamped so that this time was extended without reissue. Stamping for a further extension is not permitted at present. In the succeeding decades the periods of validity for adult applicants were gradually extended to three, five, and eventually ten years, the current standard.\n\nIn 1981, the United States became the first country to introduce [[machine-readable passport]]s.{{sfn|Lloyd|p=155}} In 2000, the Department of State started to issue passports with digital photos, and as of 2010, all previous series have expired.

It is the only page in a U.S. passport laminated in plastic to prevent tampering. A data page has a visual zone and a [[machine-readable passport#Format|machine-readable zone]]. The visual zone has a digitized photograph of the passport holder, data about the passport, and data about the passport holder:\n\n* Photograph\n* Type [of document, which is \"P\" for \"personal\"]\n* Code [of the issuing country, which is \"USA\" for \"United States of America\"]\n* Passport Number\n* Surname\n* Given Name(s)\n* Nationality\n* Date of Birth\n* Place of Birth (lists the state/territory followed by \"U.S.A.\" for those born in the United States; lists the ''current'' name of the country of birth for those born abroad)\n* Sex\n* Date of Issue\n* Date of Expiration\n* Authority\n* Endorsements\n\nThe [[machine-readable zone]] is present at the bottom of the page.  It consists of two lines of information: the first line is [either P, D, or S]<USA[passport holder's surname]<<[passport holder's given name(s)][sufficient angled brackets (<) to fill out the rest of the line]', and the second line is [PASSPORT NO. + 1 DIGIT]USA[DATE OF BIRTH + 1 DIGIT + SEX + DATE OF EXPIRATION + 10 DIGITS]<[6 DIGITS]'' in the second line. Both lines contain 44 characters in a fixed-width all-caps font, with the top line ending with enough left angle brackets to fill the 44 character limit.\n\nA signature page has a line for the signature of a passport holder. A passport is not valid until it is signed by the passport holder in black or blue ink. If a holder is unable to sign his passport, it is to be signed by a person who has legal authority to sign on the holder's behalf.<ref>22 C.F.R. sec. 51.4(a).</ref>\n\n====Place of birth====\nPlace of birth was first added to U.S. passports in 1917. The standards for the names of places of birth that appear in passports are listed in volume 8 of the Foreign Affairs Manual, published by the Department of State.<ref name=\"8 FAM 403.4\">[https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM040304.html 8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth] as of June 27, 2018.</ref> A request to list no place of birth in a passport is never accepted.<ref>8 FAM 403.4-6 as of 2018.</ref>\n\n=====U.S. Birthplaces=====\nFor birthplaces within the United States and its territories, it contains the name of the state or territory followed by \"U.S.A.\", except for the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[American Samoa]]. For persons born in [[Washington (U.S. State)|Washington State]] or the [[District of Columbia]], passports indicate \"Washington, U.S.A.\" or \"Washington, D.C., U.S.A.\", respectively, as the place of birth.\n\n=====Foreign birthplaces=====\nFor Americans whose place of birth is located outside the United States, only the country or [[dependent territory]] is mentioned. The name of the country is the current name of the country that is presently in control of the territory of the place of birth and thus changes upon a change of a country name. For example, Americans born before 1991 in the former [[Soviet Union]] (including the [[Baltic states]], whose annexation by the Soviet Union was never recognized by the U.S.) would have the post-Soviet country name listed as the place of birth, e.g. [[Armenia]] instead of the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Soviet Union]]. Another example is that for Americans born in the former [[Panama Canal Zone]], \"[[Panama]]\" is listed as the place of birth for people born on or after October 1, 1979; people born prior to October 1 can opt to designate the city of place of birth. A citizen born outside the United States may be able to have his city or town of birth entered in his passport, if he or she objects to the standard country name. However, if a foreign country denies a visa or entry due to the place-of-birth designation, the Department of State will issue a replacement passport at normal fees, and will not facilitate entry into the foreign country.<ref>8 FAM 403.4-5 as of 2018</ref>\n\n=====China, Taiwan, Hong Kong/Macau SARs=====\nSpecial provisions exist to deal with the complexities of American passport holders born in the [[Greater China|Greater China Region]]. per the [[One-China policy]], the United States recognizes the [[People's Republic of China]] as the sole legal government of China, and acknowledges the Chinese position that [[Taiwan]] is a part of China, while considering the status of [[Taiwan]] to be undetermined. However, Americans born in Taiwan can choose to have either \"Taiwan\", \"China\", or their city of birth listed as place of birth. Americans born in [[Hong Kong]] or [[Macau]] would have their place of birth as \"Hong Kong [[Special administrative region|SAR]]\" or \"Macau SAR,\" but the option of listing the city of birth only (e.g. \"Hong Kong\" or \"Macau\" without \"SAR\") is not available. As [[Tibet]] is recognized as part of China, the place of birth for Americans born in Tibet is written as \"China\", with the option of listing only the city of birth.<ref>8 FAM 403.4-4(D) and 8 FAM 403.4-4(E) as of 2018</ref>\n\n=====Israel and Israeli-occupied territories=====\nSpecial provisions are in place for Americans born in [[Israel]] and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]. For birth in places other than [[Jerusalem]] (using its 1948 municipal borders) and the [[Golan Heights]], \"Israel\", \"[[West Bank]]\", or \"[[Gaza Strip]]\" is used. If born before 1948, \"[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]\" may be used. For birth in the Golan Heights, \"[[Syria]]\" is used regardless of date of birth. Due to the [[Positions on Jerusalem|legal uncertainty of the status of Jerusalem]], for birth in Jerusalem within its 1948 municipal borders, \"Jerusalem\" is used regardless of date of birth.<ref name=\"8 FAM 403.4-4(A) as of 2018\">8 FAM 403.4-4(A) as of 2018</ref> In 2002, Congress passed legislation that said that American citizens born in Jerusalem may list \"Israel\" as their country of birth, although Presidents [[George W.

The message identifies the bearer as a citizen of the issuing country, requests that he or she be allowed to enter and pass through the other country, and requests further that, when necessary, he or she be given help consistent with international norms. In American passports, the message is in English, French, and Spanish. The message reads:\n\nIn [[English language|English]]:\n::''The [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State of the United States of America]] hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the citizen/national of the United States named herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give all lawful aid and protection.''\n\nin [[French language|French]]:\n::''Le Secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat des \u00c9tats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique prie par les pr\u00e9sentes toutes autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes de laisser passer le citoyen ou ressortissant des \u00c9tats-Unis titulaire du pr\u00e9sent passeport, sans d\u00e9lai ni difficult\u00e9 et, en cas de besoin, de lui accorder toute aide et protection l\u00e9gitimes.''\n\nand in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:\n::''El Secretario de Estado de los Estados Unidos de Am\u00e9rica por el presente solicita a las autoridades competentes permitir el paso del ciudadano o nacional de los Estados Unidos aqu\u00ed nombrado, sin demora ni dificultades, y en caso de necesidad, prestarle toda la ayuda y protecci\u00f3n l\u00edcitas.''\n\nThe term \"citizen/national\" and its equivalent terms (\"citoyen ou ressortissant\"; \"ciudadano o nacional\") are used in the message as some people born in [[American Samoa]], including [[Swains Island]], are [[United States nationality law#Nationals|nationals but not citizens of the United States]].\n\nThe masculine inflections of \"Le Secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat\" and \"El Secretario de Estado\" are used in all passports, regardless of the sex of the Secretary of State at the time of issue.\n\n=== Sex offenders ===\nIn November 2017, pursuant to the [[International Megan's Law]], the Department of State announced that passports of US citizens previously convicted of [[sex crimes]] against minors would be endorsed with the message, \"The bearer was convicted of a sex offense against a minor, and is a covered sex offender pursuant to [U.S. law].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/11/02/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-passports-child-sex-offenders.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The New York Times|title=Child Sex Offenders to be Named as Such in U.S. Passports|date=November 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107034731/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/11/02/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-passports-child-sex-offenders.html |archivedate= November 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Languages==\nAt a League of Nations conference in 1920 about passports and through-train travel, a recommendation was that passports be written in French (historically, the language of diplomacy) and one other language.\n\nEnglish, the [[de facto]] national language of the United States, has always been used in U.S. passports. At some point subsequent to 1920, English and French were used in passports. Spanish was added during the second [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].\n\nThe field names on the data page, the passport message, the warning on the second page that the bearer is responsible for obtaining visas, and the designations of the amendments-and-endorsements pages, are printed in English, French, and Spanish.\n\n==Biometric passport==\nThe legal driving force of biometric passports is the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, which states that [[smart-card]] [[identity card]]s may be used in lieu of [[visa (document)|visa]]s. That law also provides that foreigners who travel to the U.S., and want to enter the U.S. visa-free under the [[Visa Waiver Program]], must bear machine-readable passports that comply with international standards. If a foreign passport was issued on or after October 26, 2006, that passport must be a biometric passport.\n\nThe electronic chip in the back cover of a U.S. passport stores an image of the photograph of the passport holder, passport data, and personal data of the passport holder; and has capacity to store additional data.<ref name=\"E-Passport\" /> The capacity of the [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) chip is 64 kilobytes, which is large enough to store additional biometric identifiers in the future, such as fingerprints and iris scans. Data within the chip is signed with an [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA-2048]] [[Public key certificate|certificate]] issued to the U.S. Department of State by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization Public Key Directory|ICAO Public Key Directory]]. Any and all data must be authentic and untampered, or else the signature will be invalidated.\n\nData in a passport chip is scannable by electronic readers, a capability which is intended to speed up immigration processing. This data, along with the signature, is verified to either be valid or invalid. Like toll-road chips, data in passport chips can be read when passport chips are adjacent to readers. The passport cover contains a radio-frequency shield in the form of a wire mesh within the cover, so the cover must be opened for the data to be read. This cover acts as a [[Faraday cage]].\n\nAccording to the Department of State, the [[Basic Access Control]] (BAC) security protocol prevents access to that data unless the printed information within the passport is also known or can be guessed.<ref>{{cite web |title=The U.S. Electronic Passport Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=December 4, 2015 |url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/FAQs.html#ePassport}}</ref>\n\nAccording to privacy advocates, the BAC and the shielded cover are ineffective when a passport is open, and a passport may have to be opened for inspection in a public place such as a hotel, a bank, or an Internet cafe. An open passport is subject to unwelcome reading of chip data, such as by a government agent who is tracking a passport holder's movements or by a criminal who is intending identity theft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/renew_your_pass.html |title=Schneier on Security: Renew Your Passport Now! |publisher=Schneier.com |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Visa requirements==\n{{main|Visa requirements for United States citizens}}\n[[File:Visa requirements for United States citizens.png|thumb|450px|[[Visa requirements for United States citizens]] for holders of regular United States passports {{legend|#ed1c24|United States}}{{legend|#22b14c|Visa free access}}{{legend|#B5E61D|Visa issued upon arrival}}{{legend|#61c09a|Electronic authorization or online payment required / eVisa}}{{legend|#79D343|Both visa on arrival and eVisa available}}{{legend|#C0C0C0|Visa required prior to arrival}}{{legend|grey|Travel ban imposed by the U.S. federal government}}]]\n\nVisa requirements for United States citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the United States.

In July 1789, the Department of Foreign Affairs was carried over by the government established under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In September of that year, the name of the department was changed to [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. The department handled foreign relations and issued passports, and until the mid-19th century had various domestic duties.\n\nFor decades thereafter, passports were issued not only by the Department of State but also by states and cities, and by notaries public. For example, an [[internal passport]] dated 1815 was presented to Massachusetts citizen George Barker to allow him to travel as a free black man to visit relatives in Southern slave states.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrating Black Americana|url=http://video.pbs.org/video/2365418399/|website=video.pbs.org|accessdate=February 16, 2015|format=video}}</ref> Passports issued by American authorities other than the Department of State breached propriety and caused confusion abroad. Some European countries refused to recognize passports not issued by the Department of State, unless United States consular officials endorsed them. The problems led the Congress in 1856 to give to the Department of State the sole authority to issue passports.{{sfn|Lloyd|p=80-81}}{{efn|However, pursuant to the [[Dred Scott decision]], the Secretary of State refused a passport to a black man in Massachusetts, [[John Rock (abolitionist)|John Rock]], on grounds that, being black, he was not a United States citizen, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued him a passport describing him as a citizen of the Commonwealth, and he used it to travel to Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nwculaw.edu/john-rock-biography |title=John Rock Biography |website=[[Northwestern California University School of Law]] |date=2011 |access-date=August 30, 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nFrom 1789 through late 1941, the constitutionally established government required passports of citizens only during two periods: during the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), as well as during and shortly after [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918). The passport requirement of the Civil War era lacked statutory authority.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} During World War I (1914\u20131918), European countries instituted passport requirements. The [[:wikisource:Travel Control Act|Travel Control Act]] of May 22, 1918, permitted the president, when the United States was at war, to proclaim a passport requirement, and President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] issued such a proclamation on August 18, 1918. World War I ended on November 11, 1918, but the passport requirement lingered until March 3, 1921, the last day of the Wilson administration.<ref>Act of May 22, 1918, {{USStat|40|559}}; Proc.

Countries such as Czarist Russia and the Ottoman Empire maintained passport requirements. After World War I, many European countries retained their passport requirements. Foreign passport requirements undercut the absence of a passport requirement for Americans exiting the country, under United States law, between 1921 and 1941.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Craig |title=The Passport in America |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2009}}</ref>\n\nThe contemporary period of required passports for Americans under United States law began on November 29, 1941.<ref>Act of June 21, 1941, ch. 210, {{USStat|55|252}}; Proc.

Records of the Department of State show that 130,360 passports were issued between 1810 and 1873 and that 369,844 passports were issued between 1877 and 1909. Some of those passports were family passports or group passports. A passport application could cover, variously, a wife, a child, or children, one or more servants, or a woman traveling under the protection of a man. The passport would be issued to the man. Similarly, a passport application could cover a child traveling with his or her mother. The passport would be issued to the mother. The number of Americans who traveled without passports is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/genealogy/passport/ |title=Passport Applications |publisher=Archives.gov |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[League of Nations]] held a conference in 1920 concerning passports and through-train travel, and conferences in 1926 and 1927 concerning passports. The 1920 conference put forward guidelines on the layout and features of passports, which the 1926 and 1927 conferences followed up. Those guidelines were steps in the shaping of contemporary passports. One of the guidelines was about 32-page passport booklets, such as the U.S. type III mentioned in this section, below. Another guideline was about [[#Languages|languages in passports]]. A conference on travel and tourism held by the [[United Nations]] in 1963 did not result in standardized passports. Passport standardization was accomplished in 1980 under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n\nThe design and contents of U.S. passports changed over the years.<ref>{{citation |publisher=United States Department of State, Passport Office |title=The United States Passport: Past, Present, Future |location=Washington, D.C. |date=1976 |pages=passim}}</ref> Prior to World War I the passport was typically a large ({{convert|11|x|17|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=x|&nbsp;/&nbsp;}}) diploma, with a large engraved seal of the Department of State at the top, repeated in red wax at the bottom, the bearer's description and signature on the left, and his name on the right above space for data such as \"accompanied by his wife,\" all in ornate script. In 1926, the Department of State introduced the type III passport. This had a stiff red cover, with a window cutout through which the passport number was visible. That style of passport contained 32 pages.{{sfn|Lloyd|p=130}} American passports had green covers from 1941 until 1976, when the cover was changed to blue, as part of the [[U.S. bicentennial]] celebration of 1975-1977, and remained blue afterwards until 1993. Green covers were again issued from April 1993 until March 1994, and included a special tribute to Benjamin Franklin in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the United States Consular Service. After March 1994, blue passports, with pages showing U.S. state seals, were reissued. In 2007, images showcasing landscapes of the United States as well as places and objects of significance to U.S. history were introduced.\n\nInitially, a U.S. passport was issued for two years, although by the 1950s on application by the holder a passport could be stamped so that this time was extended without reissue. Stamping for a further extension is not permitted at present. In the succeeding decades the periods of validity for adult applicants were gradually extended to three, five, and eventually ten years, the current standard.\n\nIn 1981, the United States became the first country to introduce [[machine-readable passport]]s.{{sfn|Lloyd|p=155}} In 2000, the Department of State started to issue passports with digital photos, and as of 2010, all previous series have expired.

It is the only page in a U.S. passport laminated in plastic to prevent tampering. A data page has a visual zone and a [[machine-readable passport#Format|machine-readable zone]]. The visual zone has a digitized photograph of the passport holder, data about the passport, and data about the passport holder:\n\n* Photograph\n* Type [of document, which is \"P\" for \"personal\"]\n* Code [of the issuing country, which is \"USA\" for \"United States of America\"]\n* Passport Number\n* Surname\n* Given Name(s)\n* Nationality\n* Date of Birth\n* Place of Birth (lists the state/territory followed by \"U.S.A.\" for those born in the United States; lists the ''current'' name of the country of birth for those born abroad)\n* Sex\n* Date of Issue\n* Date of Expiration\n* Authority\n* Endorsements\n\nThe [[machine-readable zone]] is present at the bottom of the page.  It consists of two lines of information: the first line is [either P, D, or S]<USA[passport holder's surname]<<[passport holder's given name(s)][sufficient angled brackets (<) to fill out the rest of the line]', and the second line is [PASSPORT NO. + 1 DIGIT]USA[DATE OF BIRTH + 1 DIGIT + SEX + DATE OF EXPIRATION + 10 DIGITS]<[6 DIGITS]'' in the second line. Both lines contain 44 characters in a fixed-width all-caps font, with the top line ending with enough left angle brackets to fill the 44 character limit.\n\nA signature page has a line for the signature of a passport holder. A passport is not valid until it is signed by the passport holder in black or blue ink. If a holder is unable to sign his passport, it is to be signed by a person who has legal authority to sign on the holder's behalf.<ref>22 C.F.R. sec. 51.4(a).</ref>\n\n====Place of birth====\nPlace of birth was first added to U.S. passports in 1917. The standards for the names of places of birth that appear in passports are listed in volume 8 of the Foreign Affairs Manual, published by the Department of State.<ref name=\"8 FAM 403.4\">[https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM040304.html 8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth] as of June 27, 2018.</ref> A request to list no place of birth in a passport is never accepted.<ref>8 FAM 403.4-6 as of 2018.</ref>\n\n=====U.S. Birthplaces=====\nFor birthplaces within the United States and its territories, it contains the name of the state or territory followed by \"U.S.A.\", except for the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[American Samoa]]. For persons born in [[Washington (U.S. State)|Washington State]] or the [[District of Columbia]], passports indicate \"Washington, U.S.A.\" or \"Washington, D.C., U.S.A.\", respectively, as the place of birth.\n\n=====Foreign birthplaces=====\nFor Americans whose place of birth is located outside the United States, only the country or [[dependent territory]] is mentioned. The name of the country is the current name of the country that is presently in control of the territory of the place of birth and thus changes upon a change of a country name. For example, Americans born before 1991 in the former [[Soviet Union]] (including the [[Baltic states]], whose annexation by the Soviet Union was never recognized by the U.S.) would have the post-Soviet country name listed as the place of birth, e.g. [[Armenia]] instead of the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Soviet Union]]. Another example is that for Americans born in the former [[Panama Canal Zone]], \"[[Panama]]\" is listed as the place of birth for people born on or after October 1, 1979; people born prior to October 1 can opt to designate the city of place of birth. A citizen born outside the United States may be able to have his city or town of birth entered in his passport, if he or she objects to the standard country name. However, if a foreign country denies a visa or entry due to the place-of-birth designation, the Department of State will issue a replacement passport at normal fees, and will not facilitate entry into the foreign country.<ref>8 FAM 403.4-5 as of 2018</ref>\n\n=====China, Taiwan, Hong Kong/Macau SARs=====\nSpecial provisions exist to deal with the complexities of American passport holders born in the [[Greater China|Greater China Region]]. per the [[One-China policy]], the United States recognizes the [[People's Republic of China]] as the sole legal government of China, and acknowledges the Chinese position that [[Taiwan]] is a part of China, while considering the status of [[Taiwan]] to be undetermined. However, Americans born in Taiwan can choose to have either \"Taiwan\", \"China\", or their city of birth listed as place of birth. Americans born in [[Hong Kong]] or [[Macau]] would have their place of birth as \"Hong Kong [[Special administrative region|SAR]]\" or \"Macau SAR,\" but the option of listing the city of birth only (e.g. \"Hong Kong\" or \"Macau\" without \"SAR\") is not available. As [[Tibet]] is recognized as part of China, the place of birth for Americans born in Tibet is written as \"China\", with the option of listing only the city of birth.<ref>8 FAM 403.4-4(D) and 8 FAM 403.4-4(E) as of 2018</ref>\n\n=====Israel and Israeli-occupied territories=====\nSpecial provisions are in place for Americans born in [[Israel]] and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]. For birth in places other than [[Jerusalem]] (using its 1948 municipal borders) and the [[Golan Heights]], \"Israel\", \"[[West Bank]]\", or \"[[Gaza Strip]]\" is used. If born before 1948, \"[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]\" may be used. For birth in the Golan Heights, \"[[Syria]]\" is used regardless of date of birth. Due to the [[Positions on Jerusalem|legal uncertainty of the status of Jerusalem]], for birth in Jerusalem within its 1948 municipal borders, \"Jerusalem\" is used regardless of date of birth.<ref name=\"8 FAM 403.4-4(A) as of 2018\">8 FAM 403.4-4(A) as of 2018</ref> In 2002, Congress passed legislation that said that American citizens born in Jerusalem may list \"Israel\" as their country of birth, although Presidents [[George W.

The message identifies the bearer as a citizen of the issuing country, requests that he or she be allowed to enter and pass through the other country, and requests further that, when necessary, he or she be given help consistent with international norms. In American passports, the message is in English, French, and Spanish. The message reads:\n\nIn [[English language|English]]:\n::''The [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State of the United States of America]] hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the citizen/national of the United States named herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give all lawful aid and protection.''\n\nin [[French language|French]]:\n::''Le Secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat des \u00c9tats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique prie par les pr\u00e9sentes toutes autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes de laisser passer le citoyen ou ressortissant des \u00c9tats-Unis titulaire du pr\u00e9sent passeport, sans d\u00e9lai ni difficult\u00e9 et, en cas de besoin, de lui accorder toute aide et protection l\u00e9gitimes.''\n\nand in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:\n::''El Secretario de Estado de los Estados Unidos de Am\u00e9rica por el presente solicita a las autoridades competentes permitir el paso del ciudadano o nacional de los Estados Unidos aqu\u00ed nombrado, sin demora ni dificultades, y en caso de necesidad, prestarle toda la ayuda y protecci\u00f3n l\u00edcitas.''\n\nThe term \"citizen/national\" and its equivalent terms (\"citoyen ou ressortissant\"; \"ciudadano o nacional\") are used in the message as some people born in [[American Samoa]], including [[Swains Island]], are [[United States nationality law#Nationals|nationals but not citizens of the United States]].\n\nThe masculine inflections of \"Le Secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat\" and \"El Secretario de Estado\" are used in all passports, regardless of the sex of the Secretary of State at the time of issue.\n\n=== Sex offenders ===\nIn November 2017, pursuant to the [[International Megan's Law]], the Department of State announced that passports of US citizens previously convicted of [[sex crimes]] against minors would be endorsed with the message, \"The bearer was convicted of a sex offense against a minor, and is a covered sex offender pursuant to [U.S. law].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/11/02/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-passports-child-sex-offenders.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The New York Times|title=Child Sex Offenders to be Named as Such in U.S. Passports|date=November 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107034731/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/11/02/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-passports-child-sex-offenders.html |archivedate= November 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Languages==\nAt a League of Nations conference in 1920 about passports and through-train travel, a recommendation was that passports be written in French (historically, the language of diplomacy) and one other language.\n\nEnglish, the [[de facto]] national language of the United States, has always been used in U.S. passports. At some point subsequent to 1920, English and French were used in passports. Spanish was added during the second [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].\n\nThe field names on the data page, the passport message, the warning on the second page that the bearer is responsible for obtaining visas, and the designations of the amendments-and-endorsements pages, are printed in English, French, and Spanish.\n\n==Biometric passport==\nThe legal driving force of biometric passports is the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, which states that [[smart-card]] [[identity card]]s may be used in lieu of [[visa (document)|visa]]s. That law also provides that foreigners who travel to the U.S., and want to enter the U.S. visa-free under the [[Visa Waiver Program]], must bear machine-readable passports that comply with international standards. If a foreign passport was issued on or after October 26, 2006, that passport must be a biometric passport.\n\nThe electronic chip in the back cover of a U.S. passport stores an image of the photograph of the passport holder, passport data, and personal data of the passport holder; and has capacity to store additional data.<ref name=\"E-Passport\" /> The capacity of the [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) chip is 64 kilobytes, which is large enough to store additional biometric identifiers in the future, such as fingerprints and iris scans. Data within the chip is signed with an [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA-2048]] [[Public key certificate|certificate]] issued to the U.S. Department of State by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization Public Key Directory|ICAO Public Key Directory]]. Any and all data must be authentic and untampered, or else the signature will be invalidated.\n\nData in a passport chip is scannable by electronic readers, a capability which is intended to speed up immigration processing. This data, along with the signature, is verified to either be valid or invalid. Like toll-road chips, data in passport chips can be read when passport chips are adjacent to readers. The passport cover contains a radio-frequency shield in the form of a wire mesh within the cover, so the cover must be opened for the data to be read. This cover acts as a [[Faraday cage]].\n\nAccording to the Department of State, the [[Basic Access Control]] (BAC) security protocol prevents access to that data unless the printed information within the passport is also known or can be guessed.<ref>{{cite web |title=The U.S. Electronic Passport Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=December 4, 2015 |url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/FAQs.html#ePassport}}</ref>\n\nAccording to privacy advocates, the BAC and the shielded cover are ineffective when a passport is open, and a passport may have to be opened for inspection in a public place such as a hotel, a bank, or an Internet cafe. An open passport is subject to unwelcome reading of chip data, such as by a government agent who is tracking a passport holder's movements or by a criminal who is intending identity theft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/renew_your_pass.html |title=Schneier on Security: Renew Your Passport Now! |publisher=Schneier.com |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Visa requirements==\n{{main|Visa requirements for United States citizens}}\n[[File:Visa requirements for United States citizens.png|thumb|450px|[[Visa requirements for United States citizens]] for holders of regular United States passports {{legend|#ed1c24|United States}}{{legend|#22b14c|Visa free access}}{{legend|#B5E61D|Visa issued upon arrival}}{{legend|#61c09a|Electronic authorization or online payment required / eVisa}}{{legend|#79D343|Both visa on arrival and eVisa available}}{{legend|#C0C0C0|Visa required prior to arrival}}{{legend|grey|Travel ban imposed by the U.S. federal government}}]]\n\nVisa requirements for United States citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the United States.
