He was from [[Tucson, Arizona]].\n\nHe won championship titles in three divisions of the [[United States Auto Club]]: Sprints, Stocks, and Champ Cars. He won the [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] [[Sprint car racing|Sprint Car]] title in 1963 and 1966, the [[USAC Stock Car]] title in 1969 and 1970.  The Champ Car title in 1973.  His first USAC Stock Car start resulted in a runner-up finish in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in January 1968, when he drove as a substitute driver for [[Norm Nelson]].\n\nMcCluskey earned four USAC Midget Car wins, 23 USAC Sprint Car wins, 23 USAC Stock Car wins and five USAC [[Championship Car]] (national championship) wins (including his last start at Milwaukee in 1979, which is a rarety since most drivers don't win their last race in their career).  He was the USAC national champion in 1973.  He started every [[Indianapolis 500]] race from 1961 to 1979 except 1964, with a best finish of 3rd in 1973.\n\nHe also made four [[NASCAR]] [[Grand National Series]] starts from 1969 to 1977 with a best finish of second in 1970 at [[Riverside International Raceway]].\n\nHe represented the USAC series in the 1974 [[International Race of Champions]].\n\nMcCluskey raced for the Holman and Moody team in a Ford GT40 Mk.IIB at the 1967 LeMans 24hrs of Endurance, France. During this event, McCluskey is credited with pulling [[Mario Andretti]] to safety-and thus saving his life-after Andretti had seriously crashed his Ford GT40 Mk.IV when a front brake locked.\n\nMcCluskey died on August 29, 1993, just five days after his 63rd birthday after a long battle with [[cancer]]. In 2004 the local [[United Sports Arizona Race Park]] hosted the [[Roger McCluskey Sprint Car Classic]] in his honor.\n\n==Award==\nHe was inducted in the [[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum|National Sprint Car Hall of Fame]] in 1993.\n\nHe was also inducted into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2011.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/roger-mccluskey.html Roger McCluskey] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Complete USAC Championship Car results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n!

He was from [[Tucson, Arizona]].\n\nHe won championship titles in three divisions of the [[United States Auto Club]]: Sprints, Stocks, and Champ Cars. He won the [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] [[Sprint car racing|Sprint Car]] title in 1963 and 1966, the [[USAC Stock Car]] title in 1969 and 1970.  The Champ Car title in 1973.  His first USAC Stock Car start resulted in a runner-up finish in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in January 1968, when he drove as a substitute driver for [[Norm Nelson]].\n\nMcCluskey earned four USAC Midget Car wins, 23 USAC Sprint Car wins, 23 USAC Stock Car wins and five USAC [[Championship Car]] (national championship) wins (including his last start at Milwaukee in 1979, which is a rarety since most drivers don't win their last race in their career).  He was the USAC national champion in 1973.  He started every [[Indianapolis 500]] race from 1961 to 1979 except 1964, with a best finish of 3rd in 1973.\n\nHe also made four [[NASCAR]] [[Grand National Series]] starts from 1969 to 1977 with a best finish of second in 1970 at [[Riverside International Raceway]].\n\nHe represented the USAC series in the 1974 [[International Race of Champions]].\n\nMcCluskey raced for the Holman and Moody team in a Ford GT40 Mk.IIB at the 1967 LeMans 24hrs of Endurance, France. During this event, McCluskey is credited with pulling [[Mario Andretti]] to safety-and thus saving his life-after Andretti had seriously crashed his Ford GT40 Mk.IV when a front brake locked.\n\nMcCluskey died on August 29, 1993, just five days after his 63rd birthday after a long battle with [[cancer]]. In 2004 the local [[United Sports Arizona Race Park]] hosted the [[Roger McCluskey Sprint Car Classic]] in his honor.\n\n==Award==\nHe was inducted in the [[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum|National Sprint Car Hall of Fame]] in 1993.\n\nHe was also inducted into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2011.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/roger-mccluskey.html Roger McCluskey] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Complete USAC Championship Car results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n!

Originally [[serial (literature)|serialised]] in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' from August 1901 to April 1902, it is set largely on [[Dartmoor]] in [[Devon]] in England's [[West Country]] and tells the story of an attempted murder inspired by the [[legend]] of a fearsome, [[Black dog (ghost)|diabolical hound]] of supernatural origin. Sherlock Holmes and his companion [[Dr. Watson]] investigate the case. This was the first appearance of Holmes since his apparent death in \"[[The Final Problem]]\", and the success of ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' led to the character's eventual revival.<ref name=\"rendell\">{{cite news|last=Rendell|first=Ruth|authorlink=Ruth Rendell|title=A most serious and extraordinary problem |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/13/arthurconandoyle.crime|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date= 12 September 2008|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most famous stories ever written,<ref name=\"rendell\"/> in 2003, the book was listed as number 128 of 200 on the BBC's [[The Big Read]] poll of the UK's \"best-loved novel\".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top200.shtml \"BBC - The Big Read\"].

The death was attributed to a heart attack, but according to Mortimer, Sir Charles's face retained an expression of horror, and not far from the corpse the footprints of a gigantic hound were clearly visible. According to an old legend, a curse runs in the Baskerville family since the time of the [[English Civil War]], when a Sir Hugo Baskerville abducted a farm girl in the [[mire]]s of [[Dartmoor]], only for the farm girl to escape. Baskerville chased her across the moor and three of Baskerville's companions followed him only to find the girl dead of fear and exhaustion and the nobleman having been killed in turn by a huge [[Black dog (ghost)|demonic hound]]. Allegedly the same creature has been haunting the place ever since, causing the premature death of many Baskerville heirs. Sir Charles believed in the plague of the hound and so does Mortimer, who now fears for the next in line, Sir Henry Baskerville.\n\nEven though he dismisses the whole curse story as nonsense, Holmes agrees to meet Sir Henry in London as soon as Sir Henry arrives from Canada, where his branch of the family had moved in the past. He is a young and jovial good-looking fellow, sceptical toward the grim legend and eager to take possession of Baskerville Hall, even though he has just found an anonymous note in the mail, warning him to stay away from the moor. When someone tries to shoot Sir Henry while he is walking down a street, however, Holmes asks Watson to go with the young man and Mortimer to Dartmoor, in order to protect Sir Henry and search for any clue about who is menacing his life. \n \n[[File:Houn-01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sherlock Holmes examining Dr Mortimer's walking stick]]\n[[File: Houn-11 - Sir Henry Baskerville (Hound of Baskervilles, page 58).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sir Henry Baskerville]]\n[[File:Houn-48.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Holmes sees a clue in the Baskerville portrait]]\n[[File:Houn-23.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Watson meets Stapleton]]\n[[File:Houn-25.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Watson meets Miss Stapleton]]\n[[File:Houn-54 - The Hound killed by Holmes.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[hound]] killed by Holmes]]\n\nThe trio arrives at Baskerville Hall, an old and imposing manor in the middle of a vast park, managed by a butler and his wife the housekeeper. The estate is surrounded by the moor and borders the Grimpen Mire, where animals and humans can sink to death in [[quicksand]]. The news that a convict named Selden has escaped from the local gaol and is hiding in the nearby hills adds to the barren landscape and the gloomy atmosphere.\n\nThere are inexplicable events during the first night, keeping the guests awake, and only in the daylight can Watson and Sir Henry relax while exploring the neighborhood and meeting the scarce but peculiar residents of Dartmoor. Watson keeps on searching for any lead to the identity of whoever is threatening Sir Henry's life, and faithfully telegraphs the details of his investigation to Holmes. Among the residents, the Stapletons, brother and sister, stand out: Jack is overfriendly and a bit too curious toward the newly arrived, while Beryl, a rare beauty, seems all too weary of the place.\n\nDistant howls and strange sightings trouble Watson during his long walks on the hills, and his mood gets no better even inside Baskerville Hall. Watson grows suspicious of the butler, Barrymore, who at night acts as if he was signalling from a window of the house with a candle to someone on the moor. Meanwhile, Sir Henry is drawn to Beryl, who seems to be afraid of her brother's opinion on the matter. To make the puzzle more complex there are Mortimer, maybe too eager to convince Sir Henry that the curse is real; an old and grumpy neighbour, who likes to pry with his telescope into other people's houses; his daughter Laura, who had unclear ties to Sir Charles; and even a bearded man roaming free in the hills and apparently hiding on a [[Tor (rock formation)|tor]] where ancient [[tomb]]s have been excavated by Stapleton for an unclear purpose.\n\nUnknown to everyone, even to his friend Watson, Sherlock Holmes has been hiding in the moor all the time and has solved the mystery. He reveals that the hound is real and belongs to Stapleton, who seduced Laura and convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house by night, in order to frighten him with the apparition of the legendary hound. Beryl is indeed Jack's legitimate wife, abused and forced into posing as his sister to seduce Sir Henry and expose him also to the fangs of the hound. Meanwhile, the hound attempts to kill Sir Henry, but Barrymore had given the former's clothes to Selden, his brother-in-law, who dies in his place.\n\nUnfortunately the collected evidence is not enough for a jury to condemn Stapleton, so Holmes decides to use young Baskerville as a bait to catch the criminal red-handed. Sir Henry will accept an invitation to Stapleton's house and will walk back after dark, giving his enemy every chance to unleash the hound on him. Holmes and Watson pretend to leave Dartmoor by train, but instead they hide near Stapleton's house with [[Inspector Lestrade]] of [[Scotland Yard]]. Despite the dark and a thick fog, Holmes and Watson are able to kill the fearsome beast as soon as it attacks the designated victim, while Stapleton, in his panicked flight from the scene, drowns in the mire.<ref name=\"Gutenberg\">{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3070/pg3070.txt|title=The Hound of the Baskervilles|last=Conan-Doyle|first=Arthur, Sir|publisher=Project Gutenberg|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\nLAter Holmes explains to Watson that Stapleton's real name was Roger Baskerville Jr and outlines his criminal career: after marrying Beryl Garcia, Stapleton embezzeled [[public money]] and was forced to flee to England under an alias; he used the money to open a Public school in Yorkshire. Unfortunely for Stapleton, the teacher he had hired to make the school a success died of [[consumption]] as did three of his students; Stapleton has forced to close the school down and fled to his ancestrial home where he engaged in a public life of a professional entomologist; Holmes cannot prove it but believes Stapleton supplemented his waning resources by engaging in four unsolved bulgaries and one murder during his 4 year resident in the West Country. When he realized that one life was between him and a fortune, he brought about his Uncle's death. Only then did he discover the existence of Sir Henry Baskerville and nearly brought about his cousins death as well.\n\n==Origins and background==\n[[File:Clyro Court (1293400).jpg|thumb|Baskerville Hall, formally Clyro Court. It is thought this house may have provided Conan Doyle with the inspiration for ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'']]\n[[File:Fowlescombe Manor House or Mansion (geograph 2348874).jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Fowelscombe]] House, viewed in 2008, a possible model for Baskerville Hall]]\n[[File:Cromer Hall, 16 05 2010.JPG|thumb|Cromer Hall]]\n[[File:Crowsley Park - geograph.org.uk - 1713285.jpg|thumb|Crowsley Park House]]\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home [[Undershaw]] from South Africa, where he had worked as a volunteer physician at the Langman Field Hospital in [[Bloemfontein]] during the [[Second Boer War]]. He had not written about Sherlock Holmes in eight years, having killed off the character in the 1893 story \"[[The Final Problem]]\". Although ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' is set before the latter events, two years later Conan Doyle brought Holmes back for good, explaining in \"[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]\" that Holmes had faked his own death.\n\nHe was assisted with the plot by a 30-year-old ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist named [[Bertram Fletcher Robinson]] (1870\u20131907).\n\n==Inspiration==\nHis ideas came from the legend of Squire [[Richard Cabell]] of Brook Hall, in the parish of [[Buckfastleigh]], Devon,<ref name=\"Vivian 1531, p.125\">[[John Lambrick Vivian|Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L.]], (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the  [[Heraldic visitation|Heralds' Visitations]] of 1531, 1564 & 1620, Exeter, 1895, p.125, pedigree of ''Cabell of Buckfastleigh''</ref> which was the fundamental inspiration for the Baskerville tale of a hellish hound and a cursed country squire. Cabell's tomb survives in the village of Buckfastleigh.<ref name=\"bfr\">{{cite web | last = Spiring |first = Paul | title = Hugo Baskerville & Squire Richard Cabell III | publisher=BFROnline | year = 2007 | url = http://www.bfronline.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=103&Itemid=9 | accessdate =29 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Cabell Tomb&nbsp;\u2014 Buckfastleigh | work=Devon Guide | year = 2007 | url = http://www.devonguide.com/photos/img512.htm | accessdate =29 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nCabell lived for hunting, and was what in those days was described as a \"monstrously evil man\". He gained this reputation, amongst other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to the [[Devil]]. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter of [[Sir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet]] (1593\u20131674), of Fowelscombe.<ref>Vivian, pp.125,370</ref> On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed.<ref>{{cite web |title = Buckfastleigh Church |work = Legendary Dartmoor | date = 22 November 2007 | url = http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/buckfastleigh_church.htm | accessdate =29 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as the [[Yeth hound]] that Conan Doyle may have heard.\n\nWeller (2002) believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor:<ref>Weller, Philip, ''The Hound Of The Baskervilles - Hunting the Dartmoor Legend'', Devon Books, Halsgrove Publishing, c.2002, quoted in [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/723674/Dartmoor-In-the-footprints-of-a-gigantic-hound.html]</ref> [[Fowelscombe]] in the parish of [[Ugborough]], the seat of the [[Fowell Baronets]]; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh (also owned by John King (d.1861) of Fowelscombe) and Brook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell.<ref name=\"Vivian 1531, p.125\"/> It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the last century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mansion said to have inspired The Hound of the Baskervilles on sale for \u00a33m|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/mansion-said-inspired-hound-baskervilles-2493965|website=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\nStill other tales claim that Conan Doyle was inspired by a holiday in North Norfolk, where the tale of [[Black Shuck]] is well known. The pre-Gothic [[Cromer Hall]], where Conan Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/weird/weird_sherlock_holmes.shtml</ref>\n\n[[James Lynam Molloy]], a friend of Doyle's, and author of 'Love's Old Sweet Song', married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville of [[Crowsley Park]], Oxfordshire. The gates to the park had statues of hell hounds, spears through their mouths. Above the lintel there was another statue of a hell hound.\n\n===Original manuscript ===\nIn 1902, Doyle's original manuscript of the book was broken up into individual [[Leaf (books)|leaves]] as part of a promotional campaign by Doyle's American publisher \u2013 they were used in window displays by individual booksellers. Out of an estimated 185-190 leaves, only 36 are known still to exist, including all the leaves from Chapter 11, held by the [[New York Public Library]]. Other leaves are owned by university libraries and private collectors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bestofsherlock.com/baskervilles-manuscript.htm | title=The Hound of the Baskervilles: A Manuscript Census | publisher=bestofsherlock.com | date=June 10, 2013 | accessdate=9 October 2013 | author=Stock, Randall}}</ref> A newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in 2012 for US$158,500.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/doyle-sir-arthur-conan-autograph-manuscri-5636370-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=5636370&sid=0fefedbe-3bd2-422e-bcf1-c5293e9f488a | title=DOYLE, Sir Arthur Conan (1859-1930).

It incorporates five plots: the ostensible 'curse' story, the two red-herring subplots concerning Selden and the other stranger living on the moor, the actual events occurring to Baskerville as narrated by Watson, and the hidden plot to be discovered by Holmes. Doyle wrote that the novel was originally conceived as a straight 'Victorian creeper' (as seen in the works of  [[J. Sheridan Le Fanu]]), with the idea of introducing Holmes as the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' only arising later.\n\n==Publication==\nThe ''Hound of the Baskervilles'' was first serialized in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' in 1901. It was well-suited for this type of publication, as individual chapters end in [[cliffhanger]]s. It was printed in the form of a novel the following year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Publication of the Hound of the Baskervilles|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/publication-hound-baskervilles|website=History Today}}</ref>\n\n== Adaptations ==\n''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' has been adapted for many media.\n\n===Film and television adaptations===\nOver 20 film and television versions of ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' have been made.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The death was attributed to a heart attack, but according to Mortimer, Sir Charles's face retained an expression of horror, and not far from the corpse the footprints of a gigantic hound were clearly visible. According to an old legend, a curse runs in the Baskerville family since the time of the [[English Civil War]], when a Sir Hugo Baskerville abducted a farm girl in the [[mire]]s of [[Dartmoor]], only for the farm girl to escape. Baskerville chased her across the moor and three of Baskerville's companions followed him only to find the girl dead of fear and exhaustion and the nobleman having been killed in turn by a huge [[Black dog (ghost)|demonic hound]]. Allegedly the same creature has been haunting the place ever since, causing the premature death of many Baskerville heirs. Sir Charles believed in the plague of the hound and so does Mortimer, who now fears for the next in line, Sir Henry Baskerville.\n\nEven though he dismisses the whole curse story as nonsense, Holmes agrees to meet Sir Henry in London as soon as Sir Henry arrives from Canada, where his branch of the family had moved in the past. He is a young and jovial good-looking fellow, sceptical toward the grim legend and eager to take possession of Baskerville Hall, even though he has just found an anonymous note in the mail, warning him to stay away from the moor. When someone tries to shoot Sir Henry while he is walking down a street, however, Holmes asks Watson to go with the young man and Mortimer to Dartmoor, in order to protect Sir Henry and search for any clue about who is menacing his life. \n \n[[File:Houn-01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sherlock Holmes examining Dr Mortimer's walking stick]]\n[[File: Houn-11 - Sir Henry Baskerville (Hound of Baskervilles, page 58).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sir Henry Baskerville]]\n[[File:Houn-48.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Holmes sees a clue in the Baskerville portrait]]\n[[File:Houn-23.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Watson meets Stapleton]]\n[[File:Houn-25.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Watson meets Miss Stapleton]]\n[[File:Houn-54 - The Hound killed by Holmes.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[hound]] killed by Holmes]]\n\nThe trio arrives at Baskerville Hall, an old and imposing manor in the middle of a vast park, managed by a butler and his wife the housekeeper. The estate is surrounded by the moor and borders the Grimpen Mire, where animals and humans can sink to death in [[quicksand]]. The news that a convict named Selden has escaped from the local gaol and is hiding in the nearby hills adds to the barren landscape and the gloomy atmosphere.\n\nThere are inexplicable events during the first night, keeping the guests awake, and only in the daylight can Watson and Sir Henry relax while exploring the neighborhood and meeting the scarce but peculiar residents of Dartmoor. Watson keeps on searching for any lead to the identity of whoever is threatening Sir Henry's life, and faithfully telegraphs the details of his investigation to Holmes. Among the residents, the Stapletons, brother and sister, stand out: Jack is overfriendly and a bit too curious toward the newly arrived, while Beryl, a rare beauty, seems all too weary of the place.\n\nDistant howls and strange sightings trouble Watson during his long walks on the hills, and his mood gets no better even inside Baskerville Hall. Watson grows suspicious of the butler, Barrymore, who at night acts as if he was signalling from a window of the house with a candle to someone on the moor. Meanwhile, Sir Henry is drawn to Beryl, who seems to be afraid of her brother's opinion on the matter. To make the puzzle more complex there are Mortimer, maybe too eager to convince Sir Henry that the curse is real; an old and grumpy neighbour, who likes to pry with his telescope into other people's houses; his daughter Laura, who had unclear ties to Sir Charles; and even a bearded man roaming free in the hills and apparently hiding on a [[Tor (rock formation)|tor]] where ancient [[tomb]]s have been excavated by Stapleton for an unclear purpose.\n\nUnknown to everyone, even to his friend Watson, Sherlock Holmes has been hiding in the moor all the time and has solved the mystery. He reveals that the hound is real and belongs to Stapleton, who seduced Laura and convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house by night, in order to frighten him with the apparition of the legendary hound. Beryl is indeed Jack's legitimate wife, abused and forced into posing as his sister to seduce Sir Henry and expose him also to the fangs of the hound. Meanwhile, the hound attempts to kill Sir Henry, but Barrymore had given the former's clothes to Selden, his brother-in-law, who dies in his place.\n\nUnfortunately the collected evidence is not enough for a jury to condemn Stapleton, so Holmes decides to use young Baskerville as a bait to catch the criminal red-handed. Sir Henry will accept an invitation to Stapleton's house and will walk back after dark, giving his enemy every chance to unleash the hound on him. Holmes and Watson pretend to leave Dartmoor by train, but instead they hide near Stapleton's house with [[Inspector Lestrade]] of [[Scotland Yard]]. Despite the dark and a thick fog, Holmes and Watson are able to kill the fearsome beast as soon as it attacks the designated victim, while Stapleton, in his panicked flight from the scene, drowns in the mire.<ref name=\"Gutenberg\">{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3070/pg3070.txt|title=The Hound of the Baskervilles|last=Conan-Doyle|first=Arthur, Sir|publisher=Project Gutenberg|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\nLAter Holmes explains to Watson that Stapleton's real name was Roger Baskerville Jr and outlines his criminal career: after marrying Beryl Garcia, Stapleton embezzeled [[public money]] and was forced to flee to England under an alias; he used the money to open a Public school in Yorkshire. Unfortunely for Stapleton, the teacher he had hired to make the school a success died of [[consumption]] as did three of his students; Stapleton has forced to close the school down and fled to his ancestrial home where he engaged in a public life of a professional entomologist; Holmes cannot prove it but believes Stapleton supplemented his waning resources by engaging in four unsolved bulgaries and one murder during his 4 year resident in the West Country. When he realized that one life was between him and a fortune, he brought about his Uncle's death. Only then did he discover the existance of Sir Henry Baskerville and nearly brought about his cousins death as well.\n\n==Origins and background==\n[[File:Clyro Court (1293400).jpg|thumb|Baskerville Hall, formally Clyro Court.

He had not written about Sherlock Holmes in eight years, having killed off the character in the 1893 story \"[[The Final Problem]]\". Although ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' is set before the latter events, two years later Conan Doyle brought Holmes back for good, explaining in \"[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]\" that Holmes had faked his own death.\n\nHe was assisted with the plot by a 30-year-old ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist named [[Bertram Fletcher Robinson]] (1870\u20131907).\n\n==Inspiration==\nHis ideas came from the legend of Squire [[Richard Cabell]] of Brook Hall, in the parish of [[Buckfastleigh]], Devon,<ref name=\"Vivian 1531, p.125\">[[John Lambrick Vivian|Vivian, Lt.Col.

He gained this reputation, amongst other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to the [[Devil]]. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter of [[Sir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet]] (1593\u20131674), of Fowelscombe.<ref>Vivian, pp.125,370</ref> On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed.<ref>{{cite web |title = Buckfastleigh Church |work = Legendary Dartmoor | date = 22 November 2007 | url = http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/buckfastleigh_church.htm | accessdate =29 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as the [[Yeth hound]] that Conan Doyle may have heard.\n\nWeller (2002) believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor:<ref>Weller, Philip, ''The Hound Of The Baskervilles - Hunting the Dartmoor Legend'', Devon Books, Halsgrove Publishing, c.2002, quoted in [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/723674/Dartmoor-In-the-footprints-of-a-gigantic-hound.html]</ref> [[Fowelscombe]] in the parish of [[Ugborough]], the seat of the [[Fowell Baronets]]; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh (also owned by John King (d.1861) of Fowelscombe) and Brook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell.<ref name=\"Vivian 1531, p.125\"/> It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the last century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mansion said to have inspired The Hound of the Baskervilles on sale for \u00a33m|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/mansion-said-inspired-hound-baskervilles-2493965|website=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\nStill other tales claim that Conan Doyle was inspired by a holiday in North Norfolk, where the tale of [[Black Shuck]] is well known. The pre-Gothic [[Cromer Hall]], where Conan Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/weird/weird_sherlock_holmes.shtml</ref>\n\n[[James Lynam Molloy]], a friend of Doyle's, and author of 'Love's Old Sweet Song', married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville of [[Crowsley Park]], Oxfordshire. The gates to the park had statues of hell hounds, spears through their mouths. Above the lintel there was another statue of a hell hound.\n\n===Original manuscript ===\nIn 1902, Doyle's original manuscript of the book was broken up into individual [[Leaf (books)|leaves]] as part of a promotional campaign by Doyle's American publisher \u2013 they were used in window displays by individual booksellers. Out of an estimated 185-190 leaves, only 36 are known still to exist, including all the leaves from Chapter 11, held by the [[New York Public Library]].

It incorporates five plots: the ostensible 'curse' story, the two red-herring subplots concerning Selden and the other stranger living on the moor, the actual events occurring to Baskerville as narrated by Watson, and the hidden plot to be discovered by Holmes. Doyle wrote that the novel was originally conceived as a straight 'Victorian creeper' (as seen in the works of  [[J. Sheridan Le Fanu]]), with the idea of introducing Holmes as the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' only arising later.\n\n==Publication==\nThe ''Hound of the Baskervilles'' was first serialized in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' in 1901. It was well-suited for this type of publication, as individual chapters end in [[cliffhanger]]s. It was printed in the form of a novel the following year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Publication of the Hound of the Baskervilles|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/publication-hound-baskervilles|website=History Today}}</ref>\n\n== Adaptations ==\n''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' has been adapted for many media.\n\n===Film and television adaptations===\nOver 20 film and television versions of ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' have been made.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Earlier [[Varanasi]] signed partnership agreement with [[Kyoto]], Japan.\n\n==East Asia policy==\n{{Main|Asian foreign policy of Narendra Modi government}}\nFrom the very beginning, the Modi led government made it ample clear that India would focus more and more on improving relation with [[ASEAN]] and other East Asian countries as per India's [[Look East policy (India)|Look East policy]] which was formulated during [[Narasimha Rao]]'s government in 1992 for better economic engagement with its eastern neighbors, but successive government later successfully turned it into a tool for forging strategic partnership and security cooperation with countries in that region in general and Vietnam and Japan in particular.<ref name=\"Vietnam News Agency\"/> In her recent visit to [[Hanoi]], Vietnam Sushma Swaraj has stressed on the need for an [[Act East policy]]<ref name=\"Firstpost\"/> that she said should replace India's over two-decade-old Look East Policy emphasizing a more proactive role for India in this region.<ref name=\"The Economic Times\"/>\n\nEast Asia being the major focus area of his foreign policy, Modi and his foreign minister chose several Asian countries for their initial bilateral visits. He has made state visits to Bhutan and Nepal and Japan within the first 100 days of his government followed by visits of Myanmar and Australia and also hosted Asia leaders like Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] and Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng]] apart from inviting [[SAARC]] leaders in his inauguration ceremony. External Affairs Minister Swaraj has also made official visits to several Asian capitals like [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh, [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, [[Naypidaw]], Myanmar, Singapore, [[Hanoi]], Vietnam, [[Manama]], Bahrain, [[Kabul]], Afghanistan, [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, Male, Maldives, [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates [[Seoul]], South Korea and Beijing, China.\n\n===South China Sea disputes===\nThough India's exclusive economic zone does not extend into the [[South China Sea]], the region is geopolitically important to India as a high volume of its trade passes through the South China Sea. Modi intends India to act as a stabilizing force in the Indo-Pacific Region as a part of Modi's underlying [[Look East policy (India)|Act East]] foreign policy initiative .<ref>{{citation|title=Trump Is Driving Xi into Modi's Arms|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/trump-is-driving-xi-into-modis-arms/|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=27 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==South Asia policy==\n{{Further|South Asian foreign policy of the Narendra Modi government}}\nEven before becoming the Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] hinted that his foreign policy will actively focus on improving ties with India's immediate neighbors which is being termed as \"neighborhood first\" policy in the media<ref name=\"articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com\"/><ref name=\"India, Modi and the neighbourhood\"/><ref name=\"The New York Times\"/> and he started well by inviting all heads of state/heads of government of South Asian countries in his inauguration and on the second day on office he held bilateral talks with all of them individually which was dubbed as a [[List of SAARC summits|mini SAARC summit]] by the media.<ref name=\"The mini SAARC summit\"/> Later during a launch event at [[ISRO]] he has asked Indian scientists to take the endeavor to develop a dedicated ''SAARC satellite''<ref name=\"claws.in\"/> to share the fruits of the technology like tele-medicine, e-learning etc. with the people across South Asia to complement the currently operating [[Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme]] program in the region.\n\n==West Asia policy==\n{{Further|Middle Eastern foreign policy of the Narendra Modi government}}\nIndian External Affairs Ministry refers to the region of 'Middle East' as West Asia and not as Middle East which is a more popular attribution, particularly in the western countries. The region plays a vital role in India's economy as it supplies nearly two third of India's total oil import, bilateral trade is also flourishing in recent years particularly with UAE and other Gulf states. Over the years millions of Indians mostly working class have migrated to the gulf looking for jobs and they account for a sizeable share in the total remittances received from abroad.\n\n===Link West policy===\nIn an attempt to strengthen ties with India's western neighbors specially the [[Persian gulf|gulf countries]], Modi proposed this policy to complement his [[Act East policy]] concerning East Asia.

While every state except [[United States presidential election in Nebraska, 2016|Nebraska]] and [[United States presidential election in Maine, 2016|Maine]] chooses the electors by statewide vote, many states require that one elector be designated for each congressional district. These electors are chosen by each party before the general elections. A vote for that party then confirms their position.

FHHMC serves Highlands County (along with [[AdventHealth Lake Placid]]), southern [[Polk County, Florida]], and along with [[AdventHealth Wauchula]], it serves [[Hardee County, Florida]].<ref name=\"official site\">[http://www.fhheartland.org/ FHHMC website]</ref>\n\n==History==\nAdventHealth Sebring was founded in 1948 as Walker Memorial Sanitarium and Hospital.  Its name was later shortened to Walker Memorial Hospital.  Walker was located in a building on the northeast shore of [[Lake Lillian (Florida)]], then a few miles north of [[Avon Park, Florida]].  This building was built in the 1920s as a hotel.  In the 1930s it closed and was to be converted into a health resort; this never occurred, as the scheme fell apart.  In [[World War II]] the US government bought the property and turned it into an academy to train men to become pilots for the [[US Army Air Corps]], which became the [[US Army Air Forces]].  The academy closed at the end of the War.\n\nAfter the War, many Highlands County residents desired to have a hospital in the County.  The County itself lacked money to convert the old hotel into a hospital, so in 1946 various community leaders and representatives of the Seventh-day Adventist Church agreed the old hotel should be converted into a hospital.  A subsidiary group of the Adventist Church purchased the old hotel building and other buildings on the site from the Federal government in June 1947 at a 100% discount with the provision that $150,000 be raised by October 1947 to be used toward converting the building for hospital use.  The Adventist Church spent $400,000 to aid in developing the hospital.  The Ridge Area Hospital Association, led by Charles Walker, worked in the community to obtain donations for the hospital project.<ref name=\"official site\"/>\n\nJust days after the government deadline in October, Walker died of a heart attack.  It was decided to name the hospital after Walker.  The hospital was dedicated on January 6, 1948.  U.S. Senator [[Claude Pepper]] delivered the principal address.  Still after this it took much volunteer work to ready the hospital for occupancy.  Many volunteers stayed in a barracks building on the grounds while the work was done.\n\nWhen Walker Memorial opened later in 1948, it attracted a small clientele, who paid $9 a day for a room, meals and a daily [[hydrotherapy]] treatment.  The hospital after a few years stepped away from its resort-style beginning and began expanding its services.  Various changes were made to the main building and to outlying buildings and grounds.  It was said that by 1973 renovations were so extensive, that it was difficult to recognize features of the original hotel.  Also, a number of physician offices and various health clinics sprouted in the area south of the hospital.  A child care center for hospital employees was constructed three blocks south of Walker Memorial.\n\nWalker Memorial became the headquarters of what was to become Florida Hospital Heartland Division (FHHD), as outlying facilities became part of the system.  In 1982 a new satellite hospital was built just north of Lake Placid, becoming known as Florida Hospital Lake Placid.  In 1992 Hardee Memorial Hospital, in [[Wauchula, Florida]], closed and was purchased.  It was reopened and became Florida Hospital Wauchula.\n\nThe Walker Memorial building was showing its age by the 1990s and the Adventists felt it was time to build a completely new facility.  In the late 1990s work was begun on a new building seven miles to the south, the site of the current location of AdventHealth Sebring.  The new hospital, opened in 1997 on an {{convert|86|acre|adj=on}} site, was originally called Florida Hospital Sebring.  At that time FHHD and another Sebring hospital, [[Highlands Regional Medical Center (Sebring)|Highlands Regional Medical Center]], had a roughly equal footing in Highlands County in terms of size and services offered.  Highlands Regional's beginning was in 1965.  After AdventHealth Sebring opened, it became the larger hospital and has continued to grow, while Highlands Regional has stayed about the same size and has been in the same building for years.<ref name=\"official site\"/><ref>[http://www.highlandsregional.com/ Highlands Regional Medical Center website]</ref>\n\nThe old Walker site was still owned by the Adventists and for a time a few persons continued to work there.  The Walker site was put on the market and at least two groups seriously considered buying it.  Meanwhile, in fall 2004 three hurricanes ravaged Highlands County within a three-week period.  The next year another hurricane passed through.  The four hurricanes caused extensive damage to the Walker Memorial building and it was demolished about 2007.\n\nWhen the new hospital opened, it had 109 inpatient beds.  By 2001 additions had been added to the south side and AdventHealth Sebring grew in bed size.  Another inpatient area was constructed in 2004 and by 2011 the facility had 159 beds.  Services also expanded.  The emergency department has been expanded at least twice.  The latest expansion, in 2011, expanded the number of private emergency patient rooms from fourteen to thirty-two.  By 2012 1,200 persons were employed by all units in the area who worked for FHHMC.<ref name=\"official site\"/><ref>[http://www.hoovers.com/company/Florida_Hospital_Heartland_Medical_Center/ Hoovers website]</ref>\n\nAbout 2006 the Child Learning Center was constructed on the northwest corner of the AdventHealth Sebring campus.  It replaced the child care center that still existed three blocks south of the old Walker Memorial building.  About 2007 a branch of the AdventHealth Cancer Institute was opened in a new building on the southwest corner of the AdventHealth Sebring campus.  On July 1, 2010, this facility left the AdventHealth system, when it became a branch of the Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute.  In 2009 the Heart & Vascular Center opened.  The same year the Outpatient Surgery Center opened in a building on the north side of the main building.\n\nAdventHealth Sebring was struck in 2004 and 2005 by the same four hurricanes that hit the old Walker Memorial Hospital.  Also, on April 1, 2009, the hospital was locked down by an anthrax scare.  A man placed fifty envelopes on cars in hospital lots and thirty-one more envelopes on cars and in area mailboxes in an [[April Fool's Day]] joke.  The hospital was locked down for ten hours and other area business buildings were locked down.  When the envelope contents proved to be corn starch and baby powder, the hospital was taken out of lockdown.  Only the perpetrator saw any humor in his prank and he ended up in jail, facing criminal charges for causing such a disruption that ill persons in the community were put at risk.<ref>[http://www.superpages.com/bp/Sebring-FL/ Superpages.com website]</ref><ref>[http://www.manta.com/c/mtg5v5w/florida-hospital-cancer-institute Manta website]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flcancer.com/news_and_events_2010.aspx |title=Florida Specialists & Research Institute website |access-date=2012-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225181953/http://flcancer.com/news_and_events_2010.aspx |archive-date=2011-12-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Memmay Moore, \"[http://voices.yahoo.com/anthrax-scare-was-florida-mans-april-fools-joke-3076595.html Anthrax Scare Was Florida Man's April Fool's Joke] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120720050350/http://voices.yahoo.com/anthrax-scare-was-florida-mans-april-fools-joke-3076595.html |date=2012-07-20 }}\", in Yahoo Voices!</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Main building==\nThe main hospital is on a large site, so much was built at first and much has been added since 1997.  In addition to the main building, the site has always had several buildings used for storage and maintenance support.  Also, the hospital had two huge parking lots on its east and west ends.  These have been expanded several times as the hospital has become busier.\n\nJust to the south of the main building, a small lake existed.  It was divided into two bodies of water, as an entrance road was built across it.  The resulting larger lake was extensively landscaped and a large fountain was put into it.  The lake has at times been home to alligators, various birds and fish and to large turtles.  The smaller lake was only somewhat landscaped and is the only one where fishing is allowed.  These are known as [[Florida Hospital lakes]].<ref name=\"official site\"/><ref>[http://www.fishingworks.com/lakes/florida/highlands/avon-park/hog-lake/ Fishing Works website]</ref>\n\nThe HealthGrades website provides information about AdventHealth Sebring's scores on twelve patient safety indicators.  There are three possible ratings:  better, average and worse.  AdventHealth Sebring's latest score was three better, seven average and two worse.  AdventHealth Sebring was awarded the 2012 HealthGrades Orthopedics Surgery Award.  Patient satisfaction ratings for the hospital are sparse and are listed on a number of websites.  However, since they are few in number and not based on objective survey questions, they tend to be anecdotal and possibly not dependable.<ref>[http://www.hoovers.com/company/Florida_Hospital_Heartland_Medical_Center/rrrjtji-1.html Hoovers website]</ref><ref>[http://www.healthgrades.com/hospital-directory/florida-fl/ HealthGrades website]</ref>\n\n==Services elsewhere in area==\nAdventHealth Sebring has outlying physician offices and clinics in a large number of places in Sebring and Avon Park.  Many of these are on Sun N' Lake Boulevard, across the street from the hospital campus.  These include various administrative offices and various physician offices.\n\nAlso, on Sun N' Lake are the following:\n\n*AdventHealth Sebring Home Care Services.\n*Parish Nursing.\n*AdventHealth Sebring's Center for Sleep Studies.  A satellite Center for Sleep Studies is located across from AdventHealth Wauchula, being a part of that hospital.\n*The Therapy Center, at the corner of Sun N' Lakes Boulevard and [[U.S. Highway 27 (Florida)|U.S. Highway 27]].  Located just off the southeast corner of the AdventHealth Sebring campus, the Therapy Center is home to the physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy departments.  Some outlying therapy clinics were consolidated to this location.  Other physician offices are located in the Therapy Center, as well.\n*The Center for Wound Healing & Hyperbaric Medicine.  Wound Healing has an AdventHealth Wauchula satellite, sharing the same space as the satellite Center for Sleep Studies.\n*The Cardiac & Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center, which was once located in Heartland Medical Plaza (a block to the east of the AdventHealth Sebring campus) and was later inside the main building.\n*The Diabetes Center.\n\nAdventHealth Sebring has clinics and physician offices elsewhere in Sebring and Avon Park.  An outpatient laboratory is located in Heartland Medical Plaza, mentioned above.  A satellite radiology Seascape Imaging building was built in south Sebring, about three blocks south of [[Lake Jackson (Sebring, Florida)|Lake Jackson]].  Located at 2950 [[State Road 17 (Florida)|State Road 17]], it also houses physician offices.\n\nThe hospital has two physician buildings in Avon Park.  One is the Family Practice Center, at 1006 W. Pleasant Street.  Three physicians have offices there.  The other is AdventHealth Sebring Family, three blocks south of the old Walker Memorial site.  Located on the west side of [[U.S. Highway 27 (Florida)|U.S. Highway 27]], it has one physician office and a satellite outpatient laboratory.<ref name=\"official site\"/><ref>[http://healthgrades.com/group-directory/florida-fl/avon-park/family-practice-center-avon-park-3f2fc82c HealthGrades website]</ref><ref>[http://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-sunaina-khurana-xcnlw/ HealthGrades website]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Medicine|Florida}}\n* [[List of Seventh-day Adventist hospitals]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official Website}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:AdventHealth]]\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1997]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Highlands County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Hospitals in Florida]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=January 2019}}\n{{infobox hospital\n| Name = AdventHealth Sebring\n| Org/Group = [[AdventHealth]]\n| Location = [[Sun 'n Lake of Sebring, Florida]] (between [[Avon Park, Florida]], and [[Sebring, Florida]])\n| Region = Southeastern United States\n| State = [[Florida]]\n| Country = [[United States]]\n| Coordinates = {{coord|27.5393|-81.5087}}\n| Type = religious nonprofit hospital\n| Emergency = approx. 40 emergency department beds\n| Beds = 159 inpatient beds\n| Founded = 1948 as Walker Memorial Hospital\n| Website = {{URL|http://adventhealth.com/hospital/adventhealth-sebring}}\n}}\n{{Seventh-day Adventism}}\n'''AdventHealth Sebring, (formerly Florida Hospital Heartland Medical Center),''' is located in [[Highlands County, Florida]] and is part of [[AdventHealth]].
