A few hours after birth, he was baptized in the village church. His baptismal name was Miquel Josep Serra.<ref>\"Junipero Serra.\" ''Dictionary of Hispanic Biography''. Detroit: Gale, 1996.

But he showed a special interest in visiting the local [[Franciscan]] [[priory|friary]] at the church of San Bernardino within a block of the Serra family house. Attending the [[friar]]s' primary school at the church, Miquel learned reading, writing, mathematics, Latin, religion and [[liturgical music|liturgical song]], especially Gregorian chant. Gifted with a good voice, he eagerly took to vocal music. The friars sometimes let him join the community choir and sing at special church feasts. Miquel and his father Antonio often visited the friary for friendly chats with the Franciscans.<ref>Geiger, Maynard (1959).

The slight and frail Serra now embarked on his novitiate period, a rigorous year of preparation to become a full member of the Franciscan Order.

He still had seven years to go to become an [[Holy Orders|ordained]] [[Catholic priest]]. He immersed himself in rigorous studies of logic, metaphysics, cosmology, and theology.\n\nThe daily routine at the friary followed a rigid schedule: prayers, meditation, choir singing, physical chores, spiritual readings, and instruction. The friars would wake up every midnight for another round of chants. Serra's superiors discouraged letters and visitors.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=15}} In his free time, he avidly read stories about Franciscan friars roaming the provinces of Spain and around the world to win new souls for the church, often suffering [[Christian martyrs|martyrdom]] in the process. He followed the news of famous missionaries winning [[beatification]] and [[sainthood]].\n\nIn 1737, Serra became a priest, and three years later earned an ecclesiastical license to teach philosophy at the Convento de San Francisco. His philosophy course, including over 60 students, lasted three years. Among his students were fellow future missionaries [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]] and [[Juan Cresp\u00ed]].<ref>Geiger, Maynard (1959). ''The Life and Times of Padre Serra''. Richmond: William Byrd Press. p. 26.</ref> When the course ended in 1743, Serra told his students: \"I desire nothing more from you than this, that when the news of my death shall have reached your ears, I ask you to say for the benefit of my soul: 'May he rest in peace.' Nor shall I omit to do the same for you so that all of us will attain the goal for which we have been created.\"<ref>Maynard Geiger, ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra, O.F.M.: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 2, p. 375.</ref>\n\nSerra was considered intellectually brilliant by his peers. He received a doctorate in theology from the Lullian College (founded in the 14th century by [[Ramon Lull]] for the training of Franciscan missionaries) in Palma de Majorca, where he also occupied the [[Duns Scotus]] chair of philosophy until he joined the missionary [[College of San Fernando de Mexico]] in 1749.<ref name=Engelhardt>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13730b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Junipero Serra|work=newadvent.org|accessdate=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204145010/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13730b.htm|archive-date=February 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring Serra's last five years on the island of Majorca, drought and plague afflicted his home village of Petra. Serra sometimes went home from Palma for brief visits to his parents\u2014now separated\u2014and gave them some financial support. On one occasion he was called home to anoint his seriously ill father with the [[last rites]]. In one of his final visits to Petra, Serra found his younger sister Juana Mar\u00eda near death.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 28\u20139.</ref>\n\nIn 1748, Serra and Pal\u00f3u confided to each other their desire to become missionaries. Serra, now 35, was assured a prestigious career as priest and scholar if he stayed in Majorca; but he set his sights firmly on pagan lands. Applying to the colonial bureaucracy in Madrid, Serra requested that both he and Pal\u00f3u embark on a foreign mission. After weathering some administrative obstacles, they received permission and set sail for [[C\u00e1diz]], the port of departure for Spain's colonies in the Americas.\n\nWhile waiting to set sail, Serra wrote a long letter to a colleague back in Majorca, urging him to console Serra's parents\u2014now in their 70s\u2014over their only son's pending departure. \"They [my parents] will learn to see how sweet is His yoke,\" Serra wrote, \"and that He will change for them the sorrow they may now experience into great happiness. Now is not the time to muse or fret over the happenings of life but rather to be conformed entirely to the will of God, striving to prepare themselves for that happy death which of all the things of life is our principal concern.\"<ref>Jun\u00edpero Serra, letter to Francesch Serra, C\u00e1diz, August 20, 1749.

''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 4.</ref>\n\n== Ministry in the Americas ==\n\nIn 1749, Serra and the Franciscan missionary team landed in [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], on the Gulf coast of New Spain (now Mexico). To get from Veracruz to Mexico City, Serra and his Franciscan companions took the Camino Real ({{lang-en|royal path}}), a rough road stretching from sea level through tropical forests, dry plains, high plateaus and volcanic sierra mountains to an altitude of 7400 feet (2250 meters). Royal officials provided horses for the 20 Franciscan friars to ride up the Camino Real. All accepted the offer, except for Serra and one companion, a friar from [[Andalusia]]. Strictly following the rule of his patron saint [[Francis of Assisi]] that friars \"must not ride on horseback unless compelled by manifest necessity or infirmity,\" Serra insisted on walking to Mexico City. He and his fellow friar set out on the Camino Real with no money or guide, carrying only their [[Breviary|breviaries]]. They trusted in Providence and the hospitality of local people along the way.\n\nDuring the trek Serra's left foot swelled up, and a burning itch tormented him. Arriving at a farm at day's end, he could hardly stand. He attributed the swelling to a mosquito bite. His discomfort caused him to stay over at the farm another night, during which he scratched his foot and leg to excess, desperately trying to relieve the itch. The next morning his leg was raw and bleeding. This wound plagued Serra for the rest of his life.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra,: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 86\u20137. Geiger discussed Serra's wound with three medical doctors\u2014one of them Mexican\u2014to fact-check this account from Serra and his first biographer, Francisco Pal\u00f3u. Serra's wound may have been caused either by a mosquito bite or infestation by a \"chigger,\" more precisely a [[Tunga penetrans|chigoe flea]].</ref>\n\nHobbling into Mexico City, Serra joined up with his fellow friars at the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico]], a specialized training center and regional headquarters for Franciscan missionaries. Serra requested that he do his novitiate year again\u2014despite his academic prestige, and the fact that the college's novices were far younger men. Though his request was declined, Serra insisted on living as a novice at San Fernando: \"This learned university professor ... would often eat more sparingly in order to replace the student whose turn it was to read to the community. Or he would humbly carry trays and wait on tables with the lay brothers.\"<ref>Eric O'Brien, O.F.M. \"The Life of Padre Serra.\" ''Writings of Jun\u00edpero Serra''. Antonine Tibesar, editor. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1955, vol. 1, p. xxxii.</ref>\n\nBesides the routine of prayers, hymns and meditations, daily life at the secluded college included classes on the languages of Mexico's native peoples, mission administration and theology. Before completing his required year of training, Serra volunteered for a mission in the rugged Sierra Gorda, to help replace friars who had recently died there. He was accepted as mission superior. His fellow volunteer, Friar Francisco Pal\u00f3u, became Serra's assistant in his first mission.\n\n===Mission in the Sierra Gorda, Mexico===\n\nThe [[Franciscan Missions in the Sierra Gorda|Sierra Gorda Indian missions]], some 90 miles north of [[Quer\u00e9taro, Quer\u00e9taro|Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro]], were nestled in a vast region of jagged mountains, home of the [[Pame people|Pame]] people and a scattering of Spanish colonists. The Pames\u2014who centuries earlier had built a civilization with temples, idols and priests\u2014lived mainly by gathering and hunting, but also pursued agriculture. Many groups among them, adopting mobile guerrilla tactics, had eluded conquest by the Spanish military.\n\nSerra and Pal\u00f3u, arriving at the village of [[Jalpan de Serra|Jalpan]], found the mission in disarray: The parishioners, numbering fewer than a thousand, were attending neither confession nor [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]].{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=49-50}} The two missionaries set about learning the Pame language from a Mexican who had lived among the Pames. But the claim by Pal\u00f3u that Serra translated the catechism into the Pame language is questionable, as Serra himself later admitted he had great difficulties learning indigenous languages.<ref>Rose Marie Beebe, Robert M. Senkewicz, ''Jun\u00edpero Serra: California, Indians, and the Transformation of a Missionary'', University of Oklahoma Press, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vv8wBwAAQBAJ&q=indigenous%20languages Google Books]</ref>\n\nSerra involved Pames parishioners in the ritual reenactment of Jesus' forced death march. Erecting 14 stations, Serra led the procession himself, carrying an extremely heavy cross. At each station, the procession paused for a prayer, and at the end Serra sermonized on the sufferings and death of Jesus. On [[Holy Thursday]], 12 Pames elders reenacted the roles of the [[apostle]]s. Serra, in the role of Jesus, washed their feet and then, after the service, dined with them.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=501}}\n\nSerra also tackled the practical side of mission administration. Working with the college of San Fernando, he had cattle, goats, sheep, and farming tools brought to the Sierra Gorda mission. Pal\u00f3u supervised the farm labor of men of the mission; the women learned spinning, sewing and knitting. Their products were collected and rationed to the mission residents, according to personal needs. Christian Pames sold their surplus products in nearby trading centers, under the friars' supervision to protect them from cheaters. Pames who adapted successfully to mission life received their own parcels of land to raise corn, beans and pumpkins, and sometimes received oxen and seeds as well.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra, O.F.M.: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 116\u201317.</ref>\n\nWithin two years, Serra had made inroads against the Pames' traditional belief system. On his 1752 visit from the Sierra Gorda mission to the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] in Mexico City, Serra joyfully carried a goddess statue presented to him by Christian Pames. The statue, showing the face of Cachum, mother of the sun, had been erected on a hilltop shrine where some Pame chiefs lay buried.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=52}}\n\nBack in the Sierra Gorda, Serra faced a conflict between Spanish soldiers, settlers, and mission natives or \"Indians\". Following a Spanish military victory over the Pames in 1743, Spanish authorities had sent not only Franciscan missionaries, but also Spanish/Mexican soldiers and their families into the Sierra Gorda. The soldiers had the job of pursuing runaway mission Indians and securing the region for the Spanish crown. But the soldiers' land claims clashed with mission lands that Christian Pames were working.\n\nSome of the soldiers' families tried to establish a town, and the officer in charge of their deployment approved their plan. The Pames objected, threatening to defend their lands by force if necessary. Soldiers and settlers let their cattle graze on Christian Pames' farmlands and bullied Pames into working for them. Serra and the College of San Fernando sided with the Pames\u2014citing the [[Laws of the Indies]], which banned colonial settlements in mission territories.\n\nThe [[viceroy]], Spain's highest official in Mexico, suspended the intrusive colony. But the townspeople protested and stayed put. The government set up commissions and looked into alternative sites for the colony. It ordered the settlers to keep their cattle out of the Pames' fields, and to pay the Pames fairly for their labor (with the friars supervising payment). After a protracted legal struggle, the settlers moved out, and in 1755 the Pames and friars reclaimed their land.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=55-6}}\n\nCrowning his Sierra Gorda mission, Serra oversaw the construction of a splendid church in [[Jalpan de Serra|Jalpan]]. Gathering masons, carpenters, and other skilled craftsmen from Mexico City, Serra employed Christian Pames in seasonal construction work over the course of seven years to complete the church. Serra pitched in himself, carrying wooden beams and applying mortar between the stones forming the church walls.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=55}}\n\n=== Work for the Inquisition ===\n\nDuring his 1752 visit to Mexico City, Serra sent a request from the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] to the local headquarters of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. He asked that an inquisitor be appointed to preside over the Sierra Gorda. The next day, Inquisition officials appointed Serra himself as inquisitor for the whole region\u2014adding that he could exercise his powers anywhere he did missionary work in New Spain, as long as there was no regular Inquisition official in the region.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra, O.F.M.: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 115.</ref>\n\nIn September 1752, Serra filed a report to the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in Mexico City from [[Jalpan de Serra|Jalpan]], on \"evidences of witchcraft in the Sierra Gorda missions.\" He denounced several Christian non-Indians who lived in and around the mission for \"the most detestable and horrible crimes of sorcery, witchcraft and devil worship. ... If it is necessary to specify one of the persons guilty of such crimes, I accuse by name a certain Melchora de los Reyes Acosta, a married mulattress, an inhabitant of the said mission. . ... In these last days a certain Cayetana, a very clever Mexican woman of said mission, married to one P\u00e9rez, a mulatto, has confessed\u2014she, being observed and accused of similar crimes, having been held under arrest by us for some days past\u2014that in the mission there is a large congregation of [Christian non-Indians], although some Indians also join them, and that these persons, ... flying through the air at night, are in the habit of meeting in a cave on a hill near a ranch called El Saucillo, in the center of said missions, where they worship and make sacrifice to the demons who appear visibly there in the guise of young goats and various other things of that nature. ... If such evil is not attacked, the horrible corruption will spread among these poor [Indian] neophytes who are in our charge.\"<ref>\"Report to the Inquisition of Mexico City.\" Xalpan, September 1, 1752.

Yet the Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n in Mexico City, with over a thousand volumes of indexed documents on the Inquisition, apparently contains only two references to Serra's work for the Inquisition following his 1752 appointment: his preaching in Oaxaca in 1764, and his partial handling of the case of a Sierra Gorda mulatto accused of sorcery in 1766.<ref>Maynard Geiger.

Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 149</ref>{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=56}}\n\nIn 1758, Serra returned to the College of San Fernando. Over the next nine years he worked in the college's administrative offices, and as a missionary and inquisitor in the dioceses of Mexico, Puebla, Oaxaca, Valladolid, and Guadalajara. In his missionary wanderings, Serra often kept traveling on foot, despite painful leg and foot sores.\n\n=== Physical self-punishment ===\n\nEmulating an earlier Franciscan missionary and saint, [[Francis Solanus|Francisco Solano]], Serra made a habit of punishing himself physically, to purify his spirit. He wore a sackcloth spiked with bristles, or a coat interwoven with broken pieces of wire, under his gray friar's outer garment.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra,: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 146\u20137.</ref> In his austere cell, Serra kept a chain of sharp pointed iron links hanging on the wall beside his bed, to whip himself at night when sinful thoughts ran through his mind. His nightly self-flagellations at the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] caught the ears of some of his fellow friars. In his letters to his Franciscan companions, Serra often referred to himself as a \"sinner\" and a \"most unworthy priest.\"\n\nIn one of his sermons in Mexico City, while exhorting his listeners to repent their sins, Serra took out his chain, bared his shoulders and started whipping himself. Many parishioners, roused by the spectacle, began sobbing. Finally, a man climbed to the pulpit, took the chain from Serra's hand and began whipping ''him''self, declaring: \"I am the sinner who is ungrateful to God who ought to do penance for my many sins, and not the padre [Serra], who is a saint.\" The man kept whipping himself until he collapsed. After receiving the last sacraments, he later died from the ordeal.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra,: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1,  pp. 171\u20132 (drawing on Francisco Pal\u00f3u's account).</ref>\n\nDuring other sermons on the theme of repentance, Serra would hoist a large stone in one hand and, while clutching a crucifix in the other, smash the stone against his chest. Many of his listeners feared that he would strike himself dead. Later, Serra suffered chest pains and shortness of breath; Pal\u00f3u suggests that Serra's self-inflicted bruises were the cause. While preaching of hell and damnation, Serra would sear his flesh with a four-pronged candle flame\u2014emulating a famed Franciscan preacher, [[John of Capistrano]].{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=59}} Pal\u00f3u described this as \"quite violent, painful, and dangerous towards wounding his chest.\"<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra,: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1,  pp. 172\u20133.</ref>\n\nSerra did not stand alone among Catholic missionaries in displaying self-punishment at the pulpit. The more zealous Franciscan and Jesuit missionaries did likewise. But few took it to the extremes that Serra did. The regulations of the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] said that self-punishment should never be carried to the point of permanently incapacitating oneself.<ref>James J. Rawls and Walton Bean. ''California: An Interpretive History'', 8th edition. McGraw-Hill, 2003, p. 34.</ref> Some of Serra's colleagues admonished him for going too far.\n\n=== King Carlos expels the Jesuits ===\n\nOn June 24, 1767, the Viceroy of New Spain, [[Carlos Francisco de Croix, marqu\u00e9s de Croix|Carlos Francisco de Croix]], read a Spanish royal decree to Mexico's archbishop and assembled church officials:  \"Repair with an armed force to the houses of the Jesuits. Seize the persons of all of them and, within 24 hours, transport them as prisoners to the port of Veracruz. Cause to be sealed the records of said houses and records of such persons without allowing them to remove anything but their breviaries and such garments as are absolutely necessary for their journey. If after the embarkation there should be found one Jesuit in that district, even if ill or dying, you shall suffer the penalty of death.\"{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=6-7}}\n\nSpain's king [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] had plotted the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of Jesuits]] throughout his empire five months earlier. Within days of his viceroy reading the expulsion decree to Mexico's top Catholic officials, Spanish royal soldiers removed the Jesuits\u2014who offered no resistance\u2014from all their stations within ready communication range of Mexico City. Many Jesuit priests died along the rugged mountain trail to Veracruz, where overloaded ships waited to carry the survivors across the Atlantic to the [[Papal States]] on the Italian peninsula.\n\nOn the [[Baja California peninsula]], newly appointed governor [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1]] had to notify and remove the Jesuits from the chain of missions they had developed in forbidding territory over 70 years. By February 1768, Portol\u00e1 gathered the 16 Baja Jesuit missionaries in [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]], from where they sailed to mainland Mexico for deportation. Sympathetic to the Jesuits, Portol\u00e1 treated them kindly even as he removed them under the king's orders.<ref>Maynard Geiger.

In July 1767, the guardian of the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] appointed Serra president of the missions of [[Baja California]], heading a group of 15 Franciscan friars; [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]] served as his second in command.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 183\u20134.</ref> Jesuit priests had developed 13 missions on that long and arid peninsula over seven decades. Two Jesuits had died at the hands of Indians in the revolt of 1734\u20136.\n\nIn March 1768, Serra and his missionary team boarded a Spanish [[sloop]] at [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], on Mexico's Pacific coast. Sailing over 200 miles up the [[Gulf of California]], they landed at [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]] two weeks later. [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1]], governor of Las Californias, welcomed them at the [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3|Loreto mission]], founded by Jesuits in 1697. While he gave control of the church to Serra, Portol\u00e1 controlled the living quarters and rationed out food to the friars, charging their costs to the mission.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 192.</ref>\n\nSerra and Pal\u00f3u found\u2014to their unpleasant surprise\u2014that they ruled only on spiritual matters: everyday management of the mission remained in the hands of the military, who had occupied the Baja missions since evicting the Jesuits. In August 1768, New Spain's inspector general [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], displeased with the sloppy military administration of the Baja missions, ordered them turned over fully to the Franciscan friars.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|Harper & Row|1985|p=64-8}}\n\nSerra started assigning his fellow friars to the missions scattered up the length of the Baja peninsula, with its scarce water and food sources. He stayed over a year at the Loreto mission while his colleagues tried to convert Indians in the nearby mountains and deserts. Where mission workers could dam small streams, they managed to grow wheat, corn, beans, fruits and cotton\u2014always depending on the availability of water.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Franciscans found that the Indian population in the Baja California mission territories had dwindled to about 7,150. By the time the Franciscans had moved north and turned the missions over to Dominican friars in 1772, the Indian population had decreased to about 5,000. \"If it goes on at this rate,\" wrote Pal\u00f3u, \"in a short time Baja California will come to an end.\" Epidemics, especially syphilis introduced by Spanish troops, were wasting the Indians.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|Harper & Row|1985|p=66}} But Pal\u00f3u attributed the ravages of syphilis to God's retribution for the Indians' murder of the two Jesuit priests over 30 years earlier.<ref>Francisco Pal\u00f3u, November 24, 1769 report to the guardian of the college of San Fernando. MM 1847, f 273, Bancroft Library, Berkeley, California.</ref>\n\n=== Journey to San Diego ===\n\nIn 1768 [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], inspector general of New Spain, decided to send explorers and locate missions in Alta (upper) California. G\u00e1lvez aimed both to Christianize the extensive Indian populations and serve Spain's strategic interest by preventing Russian explorations and possible claims to North America's Pacific coast.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|pp=69\u201372}} G\u00e1lvez chose Serra to head the missionary team in the California expedition. Serra, now 55, eagerly seized the chance to harvest thousands of pagan souls in lands previously untouched by the church.\n\nBut as the expedition gathered in [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]], Serra's foot and leg infection had become almost crippling. The commander, [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1]], tried to dissuade him from joining the expedition, and wrote to [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez|G\u00e1lvez]] about Serra's condition. Serra's fellow friar and former student [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]] also became concerned, gently suggesting to Serra that he stay in Baja California and let the younger and stronger Pal\u00f3u make the journey to San Diego in his place. Serra rebuffed both Portol\u00e1's and Pal\u00f3u's doubts. He chided Pal\u00f3u for his suggestion: \"Let us not speak of that. I have placed all my confidence in God, of whose goodness I hope that He will grant me to reach not only San Diego to raise the standard of the Holy Cross in that port, but also Monterey.\"{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=75}}\n\nSerra suggested that the Portol\u00e1 party set off without him; he would follow and meet up with them on the way to Alta California. He then assigned friar Miguel de la Campa as chaplain to the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]], which set out from [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]] on March 9, 1769. Spending holy week at [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3|mission Loreto]], Serra set out on March 28. \"From my mission of Loreto,\" wrote Serra, \"I took along no more provisions for so long a journey than a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese. For I was there [at mission Loreto] a whole year, in economic matters, as a mere guest to receive the crumbs of the royal soldier commissioner, whose liberality at my departure did not extend beyond the aforementioned articles.\"<ref>Maynard Geiger.

Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 211.</ref>\n\nTwo servants\u2014one named Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vergerano, a 20-year-old from [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco|Magdalena]], the other a soldier guard\u2014accompanied Serra on his journey from Loreto, as he rode on a feeble mule. On April 28, 1769, Serra arrived at [[Misi\u00f3n San Francisco Borja|mission San Borja]], where he received a warm welcome from friar [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]]. Founded just seven years before by the Jesuit [[Wenceslaus Linck]], mission San Borja sat in an unusually arid region of Baja California. Continuing north, Serra stopped on May 5 to celebrate a [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] for the [[feast of the Ascension]] in the deserted church at [[Visita de Calamaju\u00e9|Calamaju\u00e9]], scarcely more than a ruined hut. The next morning he arrived at [[Misi\u00f3n Santa Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles|Santa Mar\u00eda]], where he met up with [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1|Portol\u00e1]], friar Miguel de la Campa and several members of their party. In this arid region, whose alkaline land resisted cultivation, lived the \"poorest of all\" the Indians Serra had encountered in Mexico. On Sunday May 7, Serra celebrated high Mass and preached a sermon at the mission church on the frontier of Spanish Catholicism.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=78}}\n\n==== Founding Mission Velicat\u00e1 ====\n\nAfter leaving [[Misi\u00f3n Santa Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles|Mission Santa Mar\u00eda]], Serra urged [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1|Portol\u00e1]] to move ahead of the slow pack train, so they could reach Velicat\u00e1 in time for [[Pentecost]] the next day. Portol\u00e1 agreed, so the small group traveled all day May 13 to reach Velicat\u00e1 by late evening. The advanced guard of the party greeted them there.<ref>Stephen G. Hyslop, ''Contest for California: From Spanish Colonization to the American Conquest'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2019), 33-38. {{ISBN|0806166142}}, 9780806166148</ref> \n\nOn Pentecost day, May 14, 1769, Serra founded his first mission, [[Misi\u00f3n San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a de Velicat\u00e1]], in a mud hut that had served as a makeshift church when friar [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]] had traveled up on Easter to conduct the sacraments for the [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada|Fernando Rivera]] expedition, the overland party that had preceded the Portol\u00e1 party. The founding celebration took place \"with all the neatness of holy poverty,\" in Serra's words. Smoke from the soldiers' guns, fired in repeated volleys, served as incense.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=79}}\n\nThe new mission lacked Indians to convert. A few days later, friar Miguel de la Campa notified Serra that a few natives had arrived. Serra joyously rushed out to welcome twelve Indian, men and boys. \"Then I saw what I could hardly begin to believe when I read about it,\" wrote Serra. \"... namely, that they go about entirely naked like Adam in paradise before the fall. ... We treated with them for a long time; and although they saw all of us clothed, they nevertheless showed not the least trace of shame in their manner of nudity.\" Serra placed both hands upon their heads as a token of paternal affection. He then handed them figs, which they ate immediately. One of the Indian men gave Serra roasted [[agave]] stalks and four fishes. In return, Portol\u00e1 and his soldiers offered tobacco leaves and various food items.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=80}}\n\nThrough a Christian Indian interpreter, Serra told the Indians that de la Campa would stay at the mission to serve them. According to Stephen Hyslop, \"[Serra's] goal and that of his fellow friars was not to confirm Indians [sic] in their seeming innocence, like 'Adam in the garden, before sin', but to make them aware of their sins and move them to repent.\"<ref>Hyslop, 35-36.</ref> The motive behind gifts of food, tobacco, and the like was, \"in the words of Serra's colleague and biographer, Father Francisco Pal\u00f3u, spiritual conquest meant enticing Indians [sic] with food and clothing, by whih means they could be indoctrinated as Christians and 'gradually acquire a knowledge of what is spiritually good and evil' \".<ref>Francisco Pal\u00f3u, ''Pal\u00f3u's Life of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra'', trans.

Now this inflammation has reached halfway up my leg.\" Portol\u00e1 again tried to persuade Serra to withdraw from the expedition, offering to \"have you carried back to the first mission where you can recuperate, and we will continue our journey.\" Serra countered that \"God ... has given me the strength to come so far. ... Even though I should die on the way, I shall not turn back. They can bury me wherever they wish and I shall gladly be left among the pagans, if it be God's will.\" Portol\u00e1 had a stretcher prepared, so that Christian Indians traveling with the expedition could carry Serra along the trail.<ref>Maynard Geiger.

When Coronel objected that he knew only how to heal animals' wounds, Serra rejoined: \"Well then, son, just imagine that I am an animal. ... Make me the same remedy that you would apply to an animal.\" Coronel then crushed some [[tallow]] between stones and mixed it with green desert herbs. After heating the mix, he applied it to Serra's foot and leg. The next morning, Serra felt \"much improved and I celebrated Mass. ... I was enabled to make the daily trek just as if I did not have any ailment. ... There is no swelling but only the itching which I feel at times.\"<ref>Maynard Geiger.

They passed through desert terrain into oak savanna in June, often camping and sleeping under large oaks. From a high hill on June 20, their advance scouts saw the Pacific Ocean in the distance. Reaching its shores that evening, the party called the spot Ensenada de Todos Santos (All Saints' Cove, today simply [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]]). They now had less than 80 miles (130 kilometers) to reach San Diego.\n\nPressing north, they stayed close to the ocean. On June 23, they came upon a large Indian village where they enjoyed a pleasant stopover. The natives appeared healthy, robust and friendly, immediately repeating the Spanish words they heard. Some danced for the party, offering them fish and mussels. \"We were all enamored of them,\" wrote Serra. \"In fact, all the pagans have pleased me, but these in particular have stolen my heart.\"{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=84}} The next morning, soldiers traded with the Indians, swapping handkerchiefs and larger pieces of cloth for fish amidst lively bargaining.\n\nThe Indians now encountered by the party near the coast appeared well-fed and more eager to receive cloth than food. On June 25, as the party struggled to cross a series of ravines, they noticed many Indians following them. When they camped for the night, the Indians pressed close. Whenever Serra placed his hands on their heads, they placed theirs on his. Coveting cloth, some begged Serra for the friar's habit he wore. Several women passed Serra's spectacles around with delight from hand to hand, until one man dashed off with them. Serra's companions rushed to recover them, the only pair of spectacles Serra possessed.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=85-6}}\n\n==== Arrival in San Diego ====\n\nOn June 28, sergeant [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ortega|Jos\u00e9 Ortega]], who had ridden ahead to meet the [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada|Rivera]] party in San Diego, returned with fresh animals and letters to Serra from friars [[Juan Cresp\u00ed]] and Fernando Parr\u00f3n.

Tensions with the local [[Kumeyaay people]] made it difficult to attract converts. The Indians accepted the trinkets Serra offered as rewards for visiting the new mission. But their craving for Spanish cloth irritated the soldiers, who accused them of stealing. Some of the Kumeyaay teased and taunted the sick soldiers. To warn them away, soldiers fired their guns into the air. The Christian Indians from Baja who remained with the Spaniards did not know the Kumeyaay language.<ref>Don DeNevi and Noel Francis Moholy.

After Mass, four soldiers went down to the beach to bring padre Fernando Parr\u00f3n back from the ''San Carlos'', where he had been celebrating Mass.\n\nObserving the mission and its neighboring huts sparsely protected, a group of over 20 Indians attacked with bows and arrows. The four remaining soldiers, aided by the blacksmith and carpenter, returned fire with muskets and pistols. Serra, clutching a Jesus figurine in one hand and a Mary figurine in the other, prayed to God to save both sides from casualties. The blacksmith, Chac\u00f3n, ran about the Spanish huts unprotected by a leather jacket, shouting: \"Long live the faith of Jesus Christ and may these dogs, enemies of that faith, die!\"<ref>Maynard Geiger.

He soon learned enough Spanish for Serra to view him as an envoy to help convert the Kumeyaay. Serra urged the boy to persuade some parents to bring their young child to the mission, so that Serra could administer [[Infant baptism#Roman Catholic Church|Catholic baptism]] to the child by pouring water over his head.\n\nA few days later, a group of Indians arrived at the mission carrying a naked baby boy. The Spaniards interpreted their sign language as a desire to have the boy baptized. Serra covered the child with some clothing and asked the corporal of the guard to sponsor the baptism. Dressed in [[surplice]] and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], Serra read the initial prayers and performed the ceremonies to prepare for baptism. But just as he lifted the baptismal shell, filled it with water and readied to pour it over the baby's head, some Indians grabbed the child from the corporal's arms and ran away to their village in fear. The other Kumeyaay visitors followed them, laughing and jeering. The frustrated Serra never forgot this incident; recounting it years later brought tears to his eyes. Serra attributed the Indians' behavior to his own sins.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.''

On January 24, 1770, the 74 exhausted men of the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] returned from their exploratory journey up the coast to San Francisco. They had survived by slaughtering and eating their mules along the return trek south.

Weighing the risk of his soldiers dying of starvation, Portol\u00e1 set a deadline of March 19, the [[St Joseph's Day|feast of saint Joseph]], patron of his expedition: If no ship arrived by that day\u2014Portol\u00e1 told Serra\u2014he would march his men south the next morning. The anguished Serra, along with friar Juan Cresp\u00ed, insisted on staying in San Diego in the event of the Portol\u00e1 group's departure. Boarding the ''San Carlos'' (still anchored in San Diego Bay), Serra told captain Vicente Vila of Portol\u00e1's plan. Vila agreed to stay in the harbor until the relief ship arrived\u2014and to welcome Serra and Cresp\u00ed aboard if they got stranded by Portol\u00e1's departure.\n\nOn the morning of March 19, Serra celebrated Mass and preached a sermon at the forlorn mission on Presidio Hill. No ship appeared in the bay that morning. But around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the sails of a ship\u2014the ''San Antonio''\u2014came into view on the horizon. It sailed past San Diego Bay, destined for Monterey. When it got to the Santa Barbara Channel, its sailors made landfall to fetch fresh water. There they learned from Indians that the Portol\u00e1 expedition had returned south. So the ''San Antonio'' also turned south, anchoring in San Diego Bay on March 23.<ref>Maynard Geiger.

He remained there as \"Father Presidente\" of the [[Alta California]] missions. In 1771, Serra relocated the mission to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]], which became known as \"Mission Carmel\" and served as his headquarters.\nUnder his presidency were founded:\n\n* [[Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcal\u00e1]], July 16, 1769, present-day San Diego, California.\n* [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo]], June 3, 1770, present-day Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.\n* [[Mission San Antonio de Padua]], July 14, 1771\n* [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]], September 8, 1771, present-day San Gabriel, California.\n* [[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa]], September 1, 1772, present-day city of San Luis Obispo, California.\n* [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]], November 1, 1776, present-day San Juan Capistrano\n* [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]], June 29, 1776, present-day San Francisco, California chain of missions.\n* [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]], January 12, 1777, present-day city of Santa Clara, California, and\n* [[Mission San Buenaventura]], March 31, 1782, present-day Ventura, California.\n\nSerra was also present at the founding of the [[Presidio of Santa Barbara]] (Santa Barbara, California) on April 21, 1782, but was prevented from locating the mission there because of the animosity of Governor [[Felipe de Neve]].\n\nHe began in San Diego on July 16, 1769, and established his headquarters near the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]], but soon moved a few miles south to establish [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo]] in today's [[Carmel, California]].<ref name=SerraClub />\n\nThe missions were primarily designed to bring the [[Catholic faith]] to the native peoples. Other aims were to integrate the neophytes into Spanish society,  to provide a framework for organizing the natives into a productive workforce in support of new extensions of Spanish power, and to train them to take over ownership and management of the land. As head of the order in California, Serra not only dealt with church officials, but also with Spanish officials in Mexico City and with the local military officers who commanded the nearby [[garrison]].\n\nIn 1773, difficulties with [[Pedro Fages]], the military commander, compelled Serra to travel to Mexico City to argue before [[List of viceroys of New Spain|Viceroy]] [[Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli y Urs\u00faa]] for the removal of Fages as the Governor of California Nueva. At the capital of Mexico, by order of Viceroy Bucareli, he printed up ''Representaci\u00f3n'' in 32 articles. Bucareli ruled in Serra's favor on 30 of the 32 charges brought against Fages, and removed him from office in 1774, after which time Serra returned to California. In 1778, Serra, although not a bishop,  was given [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] to administer the sacrament of [[confirmation]] for the faithful in California. After he had exercised his privilege for a year, Governor [[Felipe de Neve]] directed him to suspend administering the sacrament until he could present the papal brief. For nearly two years Serra refrained, and then Viceroy Majorga gave instructions to the effect that Serra was within his rights.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nFranciscans saw the Indians as children of God who deserved the opportunity for salvation, and would make good Christians. Converted Indians were segregated from Indians who had not yet embraced Christianity, lest there be a relapse. To understand the impetus behind missionary efforts in the 18th century, one must take into account the era's views on the salvation of unbaptized infants. While there were many controversies in the Church's history, the fate of unbaptized infants has never been definitively settled by an [[ecumenical council]] of Bishops in the Catholic church. Catholics are therefore free to speculate, and hold a variety of opinions on the matter.<!-- Several theologians from the 12th Century onward (notably Peter Abelard) had suggested that unbaptized infants would spend eternity in natural happiness in Limbo, and several mystics such as Mary of Agreda and Marcel Van had affirmed that unbaptized children ultimately go to Heaven. --> In the 18th century, most Catholic speculation regarding the ultimate end of unbaptized infants was still in line with the early [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], who believed that unbaptized infants would receive the mildest chastisements in Hell, but no reward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|title=The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptised|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> For Serra and his companions, therefore, instructing the natives so that their children might also be saved would have most likely been a great concern.

Indians who were baptized were required to live at the mission and conscripted into forced labor as plowmen, shepherds, cattle herders, blacksmiths, and carpenters on the mission.

The number of civilian colonists in Alta California never exceeded 3,200, and the missions with their Indian populations were critical to keeping the region within Spain's political orbit.

But he showed a special interest in visiting the local [[Franciscan]] [[priory|friary]] at the church of San Bernardino within a block of the Serra family house. Attending the [[friar]]s' primary school at the church, Miquel learned reading, writing, mathematics, Latin, religion and [[liturgical music|liturgical song]], especially Gregorian chant. Gifted with a good voice, he eagerly took to vocal music. The friars sometimes let him join the community choir and sing at special church feasts. Miquel and his father Antonio often visited the friary for friendly chats with the Franciscans.<ref>Geiger, Maynard (1959).

The slight and frail Serra now embarked on his novitiate period, a rigorous year of preparation to become a full member of the Franciscan Order.

He still had seven years to go to become an [[Holy Orders|ordained]] [[Catholic priest]]. He immersed himself in rigorous studies of logic, metaphysics, cosmology, and theology.\n\nThe daily routine at the friary followed a rigid schedule: prayers, meditation, choir singing, physical chores, spiritual readings, and instruction. The friars would wake up every midnight for another round of chants. Serra's superiors discouraged letters and visitors.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=15}} In his free time, he avidly read stories about Franciscan friars roaming the provinces of Spain and around the world to win new souls for the church, often suffering [[Christian martyrs|martyrdom]] in the process. He followed the news of famous missionaries winning [[beatification]] and [[sainthood]].\n\nIn 1737, Serra became a priest, and three years later earned an ecclesiastical license to teach philosophy at the Convento de San Francisco. His philosophy course, including over 60 students, lasted three years. Among his students were fellow future missionaries [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]] and [[Juan Cresp\u00ed]].<ref>Geiger, Maynard (1959). ''The Life and Times of Padre Serra''. Richmond: William Byrd Press. p. 26.</ref> When the course ended in 1743, Serra told his students: \"I desire nothing more from you than this, that when the news of my death shall have reached your ears, I ask you to say for the benefit of my soul: 'May he rest in peace.' Nor shall I omit to do the same for you so that all of us will attain the goal for which we have been created.\"<ref>Maynard Geiger, ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra, O.F.M.: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 2, p. 375.</ref>\n\nSerra was considered intellectually brilliant by his peers. He received a doctorate in theology from the Lullian College (founded in the 14th century by [[Ramon Lull]] for the training of Franciscan missionaries) in Palma de Majorca, where he also occupied the [[Duns Scotus]] chair of philosophy until he joined the missionary [[College of San Fernando de Mexico]] in 1749.<ref name=Engelhardt>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13730b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Junipero Serra|work=newadvent.org|accessdate=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204145010/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13730b.htm|archive-date=February 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring Serra's last five years on the island of Majorca, drought and plague afflicted his home village of Petra. Serra sometimes went home from Palma for brief visits to his parents\u2014now separated\u2014and gave them some financial support. On one occasion he was called home to anoint his seriously ill father with the [[last rites]]. In one of his final visits to Petra, Serra found his younger sister Juana Mar\u00eda near death.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 28\u20139.</ref>\n\nIn 1748, Serra and Pal\u00f3u confided to each other their desire to become missionaries. Serra, now 35, was assured a prestigious career as priest and scholar if he stayed in Majorca; but he set his sights firmly on pagan lands. Applying to the colonial bureaucracy in Madrid, Serra requested that both he and Pal\u00f3u embark on a foreign mission. After weathering some administrative obstacles, they received permission and set sail for [[C\u00e1diz]], the port of departure for Spain's colonies in the Americas.\n\nWhile waiting to set sail, Serra wrote a long letter to a colleague back in Majorca, urging him to console Serra's parents\u2014now in their 70s\u2014over their only son's pending departure. \"They [my parents] will learn to see how sweet is His yoke,\" Serra wrote, \"and that He will change for them the sorrow they may now experience into great happiness. Now is not the time to muse or fret over the happenings of life but rather to be conformed entirely to the will of God, striving to prepare themselves for that happy death which of all the things of life is our principal concern.\"<ref>Jun\u00edpero Serra, letter to Francesch Serra, C\u00e1diz, August 20, 1749.

''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 4.</ref>\n\n== Ministry in the Americas ==\n\nIn 1749, Serra and the Franciscan missionary team landed in [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], on the Gulf coast of New Spain (now Mexico). To get from Veracruz to Mexico City, Serra and his Franciscan companions took the Camino Real ({{lang-en|royal path}}), a rough road stretching from sea level through tropical forests, dry plains, high plateaus and volcanic sierra mountains to an altitude of 7400 feet (2250 meters). Royal officials provided horses for the 20 Franciscan friars to ride up the Camino Real. All accepted the offer, except for Serra and one companion, a friar from [[Andalusia]]. Strictly following the rule of his patron saint [[Francis of Assisi]] that friars \"must not ride on horseback unless compelled by manifest necessity or infirmity,\" Serra insisted on walking to Mexico City. He and his fellow friar set out on the Camino Real with no money or guide, carrying only their [[Breviary|breviaries]]. They trusted in Providence and the hospitality of local people along the way.\n\nDuring the trek Serra's left foot swelled up, and a burning itch tormented him. Arriving at a farm at day's end, he could hardly stand. He attributed the swelling to a mosquito bite. His discomfort caused him to stay over at the farm another night, during which he scratched his foot and leg to excess, desperately trying to relieve the itch. The next morning his leg was raw and bleeding. This wound plagued Serra for the rest of his life.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra,: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 86\u20137. Geiger discussed Serra's wound with three medical doctors\u2014one of them Mexican\u2014to fact-check this account from Serra and his first biographer, Francisco Pal\u00f3u. Serra's wound may have been caused either by a mosquito bite or infestation by a \"chigger,\" more precisely a [[Tunga penetrans|chigoe flea]].</ref>\n\nHobbling into Mexico City, Serra joined up with his fellow friars at the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico]], a specialized training center and regional headquarters for Franciscan missionaries. Serra requested that he do his novitiate year again\u2014despite his academic prestige, and the fact that the college's novices were far younger men. Though his request was declined, Serra insisted on living as a novice at San Fernando: \"This learned university professor ... would often eat more sparingly in order to replace the student whose turn it was to read to the community. Or he would humbly carry trays and wait on tables with the lay brothers.\"<ref>Eric O'Brien, O.F.M. \"The Life of Padre Serra.\" ''Writings of Jun\u00edpero Serra''. Antonine Tibesar, editor. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1955, vol. 1, p. xxxii.</ref>\n\nBesides the routine of prayers, hymns and meditations, daily life at the secluded college included classes on the languages of Mexico's native peoples, mission administration and theology. Before completing his required year of training, Serra volunteered for a mission in the rugged Sierra Gorda, to help replace friars who had recently died there. He was accepted as mission superior. His fellow volunteer, Friar Francisco Pal\u00f3u, became Serra's assistant in his first mission.\n\n===Mission in the Sierra Gorda, Mexico===\n\nThe [[Franciscan Missions in the Sierra Gorda|Sierra Gorda Indian missions]], some 90 miles north of [[Quer\u00e9taro, Quer\u00e9taro|Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro]], were nestled in a vast region of jagged mountains, home of the [[Pame people|Pame]] people and a scattering of Spanish colonists. The Pames\u2014who centuries earlier had built a civilization with temples, idols and priests\u2014lived mainly by gathering and hunting, but also pursued agriculture. Many groups among them, adopting mobile guerrilla tactics, had eluded conquest by the Spanish military.\n\nSerra and Pal\u00f3u, arriving at the village of [[Jalpan de Serra|Jalpan]], found the mission in disarray: The parishioners, numbering fewer than a thousand, were attending neither confession nor [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]].{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=49-50}} The two missionaries set about learning the Pame language from a Mexican who had lived among the Pames. But the claim by Pal\u00f3u that Serra translated the catechism into the Pame language is questionable, as Serra himself later admitted he had great difficulties learning indigenous languages.<ref>Rose Marie Beebe, Robert M.

Erecting 14 stations, Serra led the procession himself, carrying an extremely heavy cross. At each station, the procession paused for a prayer, and at the end Serra sermonized on the sufferings and death of Jesus. On [[Holy Thursday]], 12 Pames elders reenacted the roles of the [[apostle]]s. Serra, in the role of Jesus, washed their feet and then, after the service, dined with them.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=501}}\n\nSerra also tackled the practical side of mission administration. Working with the college of San Fernando, he had cattle, goats, sheep, and farming tools brought to the Sierra Gorda mission. Pal\u00f3u supervised the farm labor of men of the mission; the women learned spinning, sewing and knitting. Their products were collected and rationed to the mission residents, according to personal needs. Christian Pames sold their surplus products in nearby trading centers, under the friars' supervision to protect them from cheaters. Pames who adapted successfully to mission life received their own parcels of land to raise corn, beans and pumpkins, and sometimes received oxen and seeds as well.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra, O.F.M.: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 116\u201317.</ref>\n\nWithin two years, Serra had made inroads against the Pames' traditional belief system. On his 1752 visit from the Sierra Gorda mission to the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] in Mexico City, Serra joyfully carried a goddess statue presented to him by Christian Pames. The statue, showing the face of Cachum, mother of the sun, had been erected on a hilltop shrine where some Pame chiefs lay buried.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=52}}\n\nBack in the Sierra Gorda, Serra faced a conflict between Spanish soldiers, settlers, and mission natives or \"Indians\". Following a Spanish military victory over the Pames in 1743, Spanish authorities had sent not only Franciscan missionaries, but also Spanish/Mexican soldiers and their families into the Sierra Gorda. The soldiers had the job of pursuing runaway mission Indians and securing the region for the Spanish crown. But the soldiers' land claims clashed with mission lands that Christian Pames were working.\n\nSome of the soldiers' families tried to establish a town, and the officer in charge of their deployment approved their plan. The Pames objected, threatening to defend their lands by force if necessary. Soldiers and settlers let their cattle graze on Christian Pames' farmlands and bullied Pames into working for them. Serra and the College of San Fernando sided with the Pames\u2014citing the [[Laws of the Indies]], which banned colonial settlements in mission territories.\n\nThe [[viceroy]], Spain's highest official in Mexico, suspended the intrusive colony. But the townspeople protested and stayed put. The government set up commissions and looked into alternative sites for the colony. It ordered the settlers to keep their cattle out of the Pames' fields, and to pay the Pames fairly for their labor (with the friars supervising payment). After a protracted legal struggle, the settlers moved out, and in 1755 the Pames and friars reclaimed their land.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=55-6}}\n\nCrowning his Sierra Gorda mission, Serra oversaw the construction of a splendid church in [[Jalpan de Serra|Jalpan]]. Gathering masons, carpenters, and other skilled craftsmen from Mexico City, Serra employed Christian Pames in seasonal construction work over the course of seven years to complete the church. Serra pitched in himself, carrying wooden beams and applying mortar between the stones forming the church walls.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=55}}\n\n=== Work for the Inquisition ===\n\nDuring his 1752 visit to Mexico City, Serra sent a request from the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] to the local headquarters of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. He asked that an inquisitor be appointed to preside over the Sierra Gorda. The next day, Inquisition officials appointed Serra himself as inquisitor for the whole region\u2014adding that he could exercise his powers anywhere he did missionary work in New Spain, as long as there was no regular Inquisition official in the region.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra, O.F.M.: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 115.</ref>\n\nIn September 1752, Serra filed a report to the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in Mexico City from [[Jalpan de Serra|Jalpan]], on \"evidences of witchcraft in the Sierra Gorda missions.\" He denounced several Christian non-Indians who lived in and around the mission for \"the most detestable and horrible crimes of sorcery, witchcraft and devil worship. ... If it is necessary to specify one of the persons guilty of such crimes, I accuse by name a certain Melchora de los Reyes Acosta, a married mulattress, an inhabitant of the said mission. . ... In these last days a certain Cayetana, a very clever Mexican woman of said mission, married to one P\u00e9rez, a mulatto, has confessed\u2014she, being observed and accused of similar crimes, having been held under arrest by us for some days past\u2014that in the mission there is a large congregation of [Christian non-Indians], although some Indians also join them, and that these persons, ... flying through the air at night, are in the habit of meeting in a cave on a hill near a ranch called El Saucillo, in the center of said missions, where they worship and make sacrifice to the demons who appear visibly there in the guise of young goats and various other things of that nature. ... If such evil is not attacked, the horrible corruption will spread among these poor [Indian] neophytes who are in our charge.\"<ref>\"Report to the Inquisition of Mexico City.\" Xalpan, September 1, 1752.

Yet the Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n in Mexico City, with over a thousand volumes of indexed documents on the Inquisition, apparently contains only two references to Serra's work for the Inquisition following his 1752 appointment: his preaching in Oaxaca in 1764, and his partial handling of the case of a Sierra Gorda mulatto accused of sorcery in 1766.<ref>Maynard Geiger.

Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 149</ref>{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=56}}\n\nIn 1758, Serra returned to the College of San Fernando. Over the next nine years he worked in the college's administrative offices, and as a missionary and inquisitor in the dioceses of Mexico, Puebla, Oaxaca, Valladolid, and Guadalajara. In his missionary wanderings, Serra often kept traveling on foot, despite painful leg and foot sores.\n\n=== Physical self-punishment ===\n\nEmulating an earlier Franciscan missionary and saint, [[Francis Solanus|Francisco Solano]], Serra made a habit of punishing himself physically, to purify his spirit. He wore a sackcloth spiked with bristles, or a coat interwoven with broken pieces of wire, under his gray friar's outer garment.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra,: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 146\u20137.</ref> In his austere cell, Serra kept a chain of sharp pointed iron links hanging on the wall beside his bed, to whip himself at night when sinful thoughts ran through his mind. His nightly self-flagellations at the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] caught the ears of some of his fellow friars. In his letters to his Franciscan companions, Serra often referred to himself as a \"sinner\" and a \"most unworthy priest.\"\n\nIn one of his sermons in Mexico City, while exhorting his listeners to repent their sins, Serra took out his chain, bared his shoulders and started whipping himself. Many parishioners, roused by the spectacle, began sobbing. Finally, a man climbed to the pulpit, took the chain from Serra's hand and began whipping ''him''self, declaring: \"I am the sinner who is ungrateful to God who ought to do penance for my many sins, and not the padre [Serra], who is a saint.\" The man kept whipping himself until he collapsed. After receiving the last sacraments, he later died from the ordeal.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra,: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1,  pp. 171\u20132 (drawing on Francisco Pal\u00f3u's account).</ref>\n\nDuring other sermons on the theme of repentance, Serra would hoist a large stone in one hand and, while clutching a crucifix in the other, smash the stone against his chest. Many of his listeners feared that he would strike himself dead. Later, Serra suffered chest pains and shortness of breath; Pal\u00f3u suggests that Serra's self-inflicted bruises were the cause. While preaching of hell and damnation, Serra would sear his flesh with a four-pronged candle flame\u2014emulating a famed Franciscan preacher, [[John of Capistrano]].{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=59}} Pal\u00f3u described this as \"quite violent, painful, and dangerous towards wounding his chest.\"<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra,: The Man Who Never Turned Back''. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1,  pp. 172\u20133.</ref>\n\nSerra did not stand alone among Catholic missionaries in displaying self-punishment at the pulpit. The more zealous Franciscan and Jesuit missionaries did likewise. But few took it to the extremes that Serra did. The regulations of the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] said that self-punishment should never be carried to the point of permanently incapacitating oneself.<ref>James J. Rawls and Walton Bean. ''California: An Interpretive History'', 8th edition. McGraw-Hill, 2003, p. 34.</ref> Some of Serra's colleagues admonished him for going too far.\n\n=== King Carlos expels the Jesuits ===\n\nOn June 24, 1767, the Viceroy of New Spain, [[Carlos Francisco de Croix, marqu\u00e9s de Croix|Carlos Francisco de Croix]], read a Spanish royal decree to Mexico's archbishop and assembled church officials:  \"Repair with an armed force to the houses of the Jesuits. Seize the persons of all of them and, within 24 hours, transport them as prisoners to the port of Veracruz. Cause to be sealed the records of said houses and records of such persons without allowing them to remove anything but their breviaries and such garments as are absolutely necessary for their journey. If after the embarkation there should be found one Jesuit in that district, even if ill or dying, you shall suffer the penalty of death.\"{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=6-7}}\n\nSpain's king [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] had plotted the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of Jesuits]] throughout his empire five months earlier. Within days of his viceroy reading the expulsion decree to Mexico's top Catholic officials, Spanish royal soldiers removed the Jesuits\u2014who offered no resistance\u2014from all their stations within ready communication range of Mexico City. Many Jesuit priests died along the rugged mountain trail to Veracruz, where overloaded ships waited to carry the survivors across the Atlantic to the [[Papal States]] on the Italian peninsula.\n\nOn the [[Baja California peninsula]], newly appointed governor [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1]] had to notify and remove the Jesuits from the chain of missions they had developed in forbidding territory over 70 years. By February 1768, Portol\u00e1 gathered the 16 Baja Jesuit missionaries in [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]], from where they sailed to mainland Mexico for deportation. Sympathetic to the Jesuits, Portol\u00e1 treated them kindly even as he removed them under the king's orders.<ref>Maynard Geiger.

Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 182\u20133.</ref>\n\n== President of Baja California missions ==\n\nInto the vacuum created by the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus#Jesuits expelled from Mexico (New Spain)|Jesuits' expulsion from Mexico]], stepped Franciscan missionaries. In July 1767, the guardian of the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]] appointed Serra president of the missions of [[Baja California]], heading a group of 15 Franciscan friars; [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]] served as his second in command.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 183\u20134.</ref> Jesuit priests had developed 13 missions on that long and arid peninsula over seven decades. Two Jesuits had died at the hands of Indians in the revolt of 1734\u20136.\n\nIn March 1768, Serra and his missionary team boarded a Spanish [[sloop]] at [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], on Mexico's Pacific coast. Sailing over 200 miles up the [[Gulf of California]], they landed at [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]] two weeks later. [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1]], governor of Las Californias, welcomed them at the [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3|Loreto mission]], founded by Jesuits in 1697. While he gave control of the church to Serra, Portol\u00e1 controlled the living quarters and rationed out food to the friars, charging their costs to the mission.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.'' Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 192.</ref>\n\nSerra and Pal\u00f3u found\u2014to their unpleasant surprise\u2014that they ruled only on spiritual matters: everyday management of the mission remained in the hands of the military, who had occupied the Baja missions since evicting the Jesuits. In August 1768, New Spain's inspector general [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], displeased with the sloppy military administration of the Baja missions, ordered them turned over fully to the Franciscan friars.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|Harper & Row|1985|p=64-8}}\n\nSerra started assigning his fellow friars to the missions scattered up the length of the Baja peninsula, with its scarce water and food sources. He stayed over a year at the Loreto mission while his colleagues tried to convert Indians in the nearby mountains and deserts. Where mission workers could dam small streams, they managed to grow wheat, corn, beans, fruits and cotton\u2014always depending on the availability of water.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Franciscans found that the Indian population in the Baja California mission territories had dwindled to about 7,150. By the time the Franciscans had moved north and turned the missions over to Dominican friars in 1772, the Indian population had decreased to about 5,000. \"If it goes on at this rate,\" wrote Pal\u00f3u, \"in a short time Baja California will come to an end.\" Epidemics, especially syphilis introduced by Spanish troops, were wasting the Indians.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|Harper & Row|1985|p=66}} But Pal\u00f3u attributed the ravages of syphilis to God's retribution for the Indians' murder of the two Jesuit priests over 30 years earlier.<ref>Francisco Pal\u00f3u, November 24, 1769 report to the guardian of the college of San Fernando. MM 1847, f 273, Bancroft Library, Berkeley, California.</ref>\n\n=== Journey to San Diego ===\n\nIn 1768 [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], inspector general of New Spain, decided to send explorers and locate missions in Alta (upper) California. G\u00e1lvez aimed both to Christianize the extensive Indian populations and serve Spain's strategic interest by preventing Russian explorations and possible claims to North America's Pacific coast.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|pp=69\u201372}} G\u00e1lvez chose Serra to head the missionary team in the California expedition. Serra, now 55, eagerly seized the chance to harvest thousands of pagan souls in lands previously untouched by the church.\n\nBut as the expedition gathered in [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]], Serra's foot and leg infection had become almost crippling. The commander, [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1]], tried to dissuade him from joining the expedition, and wrote to [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez|G\u00e1lvez]] about Serra's condition. Serra's fellow friar and former student [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]] also became concerned, gently suggesting to Serra that he stay in Baja California and let the younger and stronger Pal\u00f3u make the journey to San Diego in his place. Serra rebuffed both Portol\u00e1's and Pal\u00f3u's doubts. He chided Pal\u00f3u for his suggestion: \"Let us not speak of that. I have placed all my confidence in God, of whose goodness I hope that He will grant me to reach not only San Diego to raise the standard of the Holy Cross in that port, but also Monterey.\"{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=75}}\n\nSerra suggested that the Portol\u00e1 party set off without him; he would follow and meet up with them on the way to Alta California. He then assigned friar Miguel de la Campa as chaplain to the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]], which set out from [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]] on March 9, 1769. Spending holy week at [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3|mission Loreto]], Serra set out on March 28. \"From my mission of Loreto,\" wrote Serra, \"I took along no more provisions for so long a journey than a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese. For I was there [at mission Loreto] a whole year, in economic matters, as a mere guest to receive the crumbs of the royal soldier commissioner, whose liberality at my departure did not extend beyond the aforementioned articles.\"<ref>Maynard Geiger.

Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 211.</ref>\n\nTwo servants\u2014one named Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vergerano, a 20-year-old from [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco|Magdalena]], the other a soldier guard\u2014accompanied Serra on his journey from Loreto, as he rode on a feeble mule. On April 28, 1769, Serra arrived at [[Misi\u00f3n San Francisco Borja|mission San Borja]], where he received a warm welcome from friar [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]]. Founded just seven years before by the Jesuit [[Wenceslaus Linck]], mission San Borja sat in an unusually arid region of Baja California. Continuing north, Serra stopped on May 5 to celebrate a [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] for the [[feast of the Ascension]] in the deserted church at [[Visita de Calamaju\u00e9|Calamaju\u00e9]], scarcely more than a ruined hut. The next morning he arrived at [[Misi\u00f3n Santa Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles|Santa Mar\u00eda]], where he met up with [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1|Portol\u00e1]], friar Miguel de la Campa and several members of their party. In this arid region, whose alkaline land resisted cultivation, lived the \"poorest of all\" the Indians Serra had encountered in Mexico. On Sunday May 7, Serra celebrated high Mass and preached a sermon at the mission church on the frontier of Spanish Catholicism.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=78}}\n\n==== Founding Mission Velicat\u00e1 ====\n\nAfter leaving [[Misi\u00f3n Santa Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles|Mission Santa Mar\u00eda]], Serra urged [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1|Portol\u00e1]] to move ahead of the slow pack train, so they could reach Velicat\u00e1 in time for [[Pentecost]] the next day. Portol\u00e1 agreed, so the small group traveled all day May 13 to reach Velicat\u00e1 by late evening. The advanced guard of the party greeted them there.<ref>Stephen G. Hyslop, ''Contest for California: From Spanish Colonization to the American Conquest'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2019), 33-38. {{ISBN|0806166142}}, 9780806166148</ref> \n\nOn Pentecost day, May 14, 1769, Serra founded his first mission, [[Misi\u00f3n San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a de Velicat\u00e1]], in a mud hut that had served as a makeshift church when friar [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]] had traveled up on Easter to conduct the sacraments for the [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada|Fernando Rivera]] expedition, the overland party that had preceded the Portol\u00e1 party. The founding celebration took place \"with all the neatness of holy poverty,\" in Serra's words. Smoke from the soldiers' guns, fired in repeated volleys, served as incense.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=79}}\n\nThe new mission lacked Indians to convert. A few days later, friar Miguel de la Campa notified Serra that a few natives had arrived. Serra joyously rushed out to welcome twelve Indian, men and boys. \"Then I saw what I could hardly begin to believe when I read about it,\" wrote Serra. \"... namely, that they go about entirely naked like Adam in paradise before the fall. ... We treated with them for a long time; and although they saw all of us clothed, they nevertheless showed not the least trace of shame in their manner of nudity.\" Serra placed both hands upon their heads as a token of paternal affection. He then handed them figs, which they ate immediately. One of the Indian men gave Serra roasted [[agave]] stalks and four fishes. In return, Portol\u00e1 and his soldiers offered tobacco leaves and various food items.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=80}}\n\nThrough a Christian Indian interpreter, Serra told the Indians that de la Campa would stay at the mission to serve them. According to Stephen Hyslop, \"[Serra's] goal and that of his fellow friars was not to confirm Indians [sic] in their seeming innocence, like 'Adam in the garden, before sin', but to make them aware of their sins and move them to repent.\"<ref>Hyslop, 35-36.</ref> The motive behind gifts of food, tobacco, and the like was, \"in the words of Serra's colleague and biographer, Father Francisco Pal\u00f3u, spiritual conquest meant enticing Indians [sic] with food and clothing, by whih means they could be indoctrinated as Christians and 'gradually acquire a knowledge of what is spiritually good and evil' \".<ref>Francisco Pal\u00f3u, ''Pal\u00f3u's Life of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra'', trans.

Now this inflammation has reached halfway up my leg.\" Portol\u00e1 again tried to persuade Serra to withdraw from the expedition, offering to \"have you carried back to the first mission where you can recuperate, and we will continue our journey.\" Serra countered that \"God ... has given me the strength to come so far. ... Even though I should die on the way, I shall not turn back. They can bury me wherever they wish and I shall gladly be left among the pagans, if it be God's will.\" Portol\u00e1 had a stretcher prepared, so that Christian Indians traveling with the expedition could carry Serra along the trail.<ref>Maynard Geiger.

When Coronel objected that he knew only how to heal animals' wounds, Serra rejoined: \"Well then, son, just imagine that I am an animal. ... Make me the same remedy that you would apply to an animal.\" Coronel then crushed some [[tallow]] between stones and mixed it with green desert herbs. After heating the mix, he applied it to Serra's foot and leg. The next morning, Serra felt \"much improved and I celebrated Mass. ... I was enabled to make the daily trek just as if I did not have any ailment. ... There is no swelling but only the itching which I feel at times.\"<ref>Maynard Geiger.

They passed through desert terrain into oak savanna in June, often camping and sleeping under large oaks. From a high hill on June 20, their advance scouts saw the Pacific Ocean in the distance. Reaching its shores that evening, the party called the spot Ensenada de Todos Santos (All Saints' Cove, today simply [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]]). They now had less than 80 miles (130 kilometers) to reach San Diego.\n\nPressing north, they stayed close to the ocean. On June 23, they came upon a large Indian village where they enjoyed a pleasant stopover. The natives appeared healthy, robust and friendly, immediately repeating the Spanish words they heard. Some danced for the party, offering them fish and mussels. \"We were all enamored of them,\" wrote Serra. \"In fact, all the pagans have pleased me, but these in particular have stolen my heart.\"{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=84}} The next morning, soldiers traded with the Indians, swapping handkerchiefs and larger pieces of cloth for fish amidst lively bargaining.\n\nThe Indians now encountered by the party near the coast appeared well-fed and more eager to receive cloth than food. On June 25, as the party struggled to cross a series of ravines, they noticed many Indians following them. When they camped for the night, the Indians pressed close. Whenever Serra placed his hands on their heads, they placed theirs on his. Coveting cloth, some begged Serra for the friar's habit he wore. Several women passed Serra's spectacles around with delight from hand to hand, until one man dashed off with them. Serra's companions rushed to recover them, the only pair of spectacles Serra possessed.{{sfn|DeNevi|Moholy|1985|p=85-6}}\n\n==== Arrival in San Diego ====\n\nOn June 28, sergeant [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ortega|Jos\u00e9 Ortega]], who had ridden ahead to meet the [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada|Rivera]] party in San Diego, returned with fresh animals and letters to Serra from friars [[Juan Cresp\u00ed]] and Fernando Parr\u00f3n.

Tensions with the local [[Kumeyaay people]] made it difficult to attract converts. The Indians accepted the trinkets Serra offered as rewards for visiting the new mission. But their craving for Spanish cloth irritated the soldiers, who accused them of stealing. Some of the Kumeyaay teased and taunted the sick soldiers. To warn them away, soldiers fired their guns into the air. The Christian Indians from Baja who remained with the Spaniards did not know the Kumeyaay language.<ref>Don DeNevi and Noel Francis Moholy.

After Mass, four soldiers went down to the beach to bring padre Fernando Parr\u00f3n back from the ''San Carlos'', where he had been celebrating Mass.\n\nObserving the mission and its neighboring huts sparsely protected, a group of over 20 Indians attacked with bows and arrows. The four remaining soldiers, aided by the blacksmith and carpenter, returned fire with muskets and pistols. Serra, clutching a Jesus figurine in one hand and a Mary figurine in the other, prayed to God to save both sides from casualties. The blacksmith, Chac\u00f3n, ran about the Spanish huts unprotected by a leather jacket, shouting: \"Long live the faith of Jesus Christ and may these dogs, enemies of that faith, die!\"<ref>Maynard Geiger.

As local Indians cremated their dead, the wailing of their women sounded from local villages. Yet Serra wrote six months later, in a letter to the guardian of the [[College of San Fernando de Mexico|college of San Fernando]], that \"both our men and theirs sustained wounds\"\u2014without mentioning any Indian deaths.

He soon learned enough Spanish for Serra to view him as an envoy to help convert the Kumeyaay. Serra urged the boy to persuade some parents to bring their young child to the mission, so that Serra could administer [[Infant baptism#Roman Catholic Church|Catholic baptism]] to the child by pouring water over his head.\n\nA few days later, a group of Indians arrived at the mission carrying a naked baby boy. The Spaniards interpreted their sign language as a desire to have the boy baptized. Serra covered the child with some clothing and asked the corporal of the guard to sponsor the baptism. Dressed in [[surplice]] and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], Serra read the initial prayers and performed the ceremonies to prepare for baptism. But just as he lifted the baptismal shell, filled it with water and readied to pour it over the baby's head, some Indians grabbed the child from the corporal's arms and ran away to their village in fear. The other Kumeyaay visitors followed them, laughing and jeering. The frustrated Serra never forgot this incident; recounting it years later brought tears to his eyes. Serra attributed the Indians' behavior to his own sins.<ref>Maynard Geiger. ''The Life and Times of Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra: The Man Who Never Turned Back.''

On January 24, 1770, the 74 exhausted men of the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] returned from their exploratory journey up the coast to San Francisco. They had survived by slaughtering and eating their mules along the return trek south.

Weighing the risk of his soldiers dying of starvation, Portol\u00e1 set a deadline of March 19, the [[St Joseph's Day|feast of saint Joseph]], patron of his expedition: If no ship arrived by that day\u2014Portol\u00e1 told Serra\u2014he would march his men south the next morning. The anguished Serra, along with friar Juan Cresp\u00ed, insisted on staying in San Diego in the event of the Portol\u00e1 group's departure. Boarding the ''San Carlos'' (still anchored in San Diego Bay), Serra told captain Vicente Vila of Portol\u00e1's plan. Vila agreed to stay in the harbor until the relief ship arrived\u2014and to welcome Serra and Cresp\u00ed aboard if they got stranded by Portol\u00e1's departure.\n\nOn the morning of March 19, Serra celebrated Mass and preached a sermon at the forlorn mission on Presidio Hill. No ship appeared in the bay that morning. But around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the sails of a ship\u2014the ''San Antonio''\u2014came into view on the horizon. It sailed past San Diego Bay, destined for Monterey. When it got to the Santa Barbara Channel, its sailors made landfall to fetch fresh water. There they learned from Indians that the Portol\u00e1 expedition had returned south. So the ''San Antonio'' also turned south, anchoring in San Diego Bay on March 23.<ref>Maynard Geiger.

He remained there as \"Father Presidente\" of the [[Alta California]] missions. In 1771, Serra relocated the mission to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]], which became known as \"Mission Carmel\" and served as his headquarters.\nUnder his presidency were founded:\n\n* [[Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcal\u00e1]], July 16, 1769, present-day San Diego, California.\n* [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo]], June 3, 1770, present-day Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.\n* [[Mission San Antonio de Padua]], July 14, 1771\n* [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]], September 8, 1771, present-day San Gabriel, California.\n* [[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa]], September 1, 1772, present-day city of San Luis Obispo, California.\n* [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]], November 1, 1776, present-day San Juan Capistrano\n* [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]], June 29, 1776, present-day San Francisco, California chain of missions.\n* [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]], January 12, 1777, present-day city of Santa Clara, California, and\n* [[Mission San Buenaventura]], March 31, 1782, present-day Ventura, California.\n\nSerra was also present at the founding of the [[Presidio of Santa Barbara]] (Santa Barbara, California) on April 21, 1782, but was prevented from locating the mission there because of the animosity of Governor [[Felipe de Neve]].\n\nHe began in San Diego on July 16, 1769, and established his headquarters near the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]], but soon moved a few miles south to establish [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo]] in today's [[Carmel, California]].<ref name=SerraClub />\n\nThe missions were primarily designed to bring the [[Catholic faith]] to the native peoples. Other aims were to integrate the neophytes into Spanish society,  to provide a framework for organizing the natives into a productive workforce in support of new extensions of Spanish power, and to train them to take over ownership and management of the land. As head of the order in California, Serra not only dealt with church officials, but also with Spanish officials in Mexico City and with the local military officers who commanded the nearby [[garrison]].\n\nIn 1773, difficulties with [[Pedro Fages]], the military commander, compelled Serra to travel to Mexico City to argue before [[List of viceroys of New Spain|Viceroy]] [[Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli y Urs\u00faa]] for the removal of Fages as the Governor of California Nueva. At the capital of Mexico, by order of Viceroy Bucareli, he printed up ''Representaci\u00f3n'' in 32 articles. Bucareli ruled in Serra's favor on 30 of the 32 charges brought against Fages, and removed him from office in 1774, after which time Serra returned to California. In 1778, Serra, although not a bishop,  was given [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] to administer the sacrament of [[confirmation]] for the faithful in California. After he had exercised his privilege for a year, Governor [[Felipe de Neve]] directed him to suspend administering the sacrament until he could present the papal brief. For nearly two years Serra refrained, and then Viceroy Majorga gave instructions to the effect that Serra was within his rights.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nFranciscans saw the Indians as children of God who deserved the opportunity for salvation, and would make good Christians. Converted Indians were segregated from Indians who had not yet embraced Christianity, lest there be a relapse. To understand the impetus behind missionary efforts in the 18th century, one must take into account the era's views on the salvation of unbaptized infants. While there were many controversies in the Church's history, the fate of unbaptized infants has never been definitively settled by an [[ecumenical council]] of Bishops in the Catholic church. Catholics are therefore free to speculate, and hold a variety of opinions on the matter.<!-- Several theologians from the 12th Century onward (notably Peter Abelard) had suggested that unbaptized infants would spend eternity in natural happiness in Limbo, and several mystics such as Mary of Agreda and Marcel Van had affirmed that unbaptized children ultimately go to Heaven. --> In the 18th century, most Catholic speculation regarding the ultimate end of unbaptized infants was still in line with the early [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], who believed that unbaptized infants would receive the mildest chastisements in Hell, but no reward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html|title=The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptised|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> For Serra and his companions, therefore, instructing the natives so that their children might also be saved would have most likely been a great concern.

The number of civilian colonists in Alta California never exceeded 3,200, and the missions with their Indian populations were critical to keeping the region within Spain's political orbit.

It is part of the [[Central Conservation Area]]; which protects [[tropical forest]] area near [[San Ram\u00f3n, Costa Rica|San Ramon]]. The reserve operates under the direction of the [[University of Costa Rica]] and the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE).\n\n== History ==\nThe Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve (RBAMB) was created in 1975 by executive decree number 4960-A as the Reserva Forestal de San Ram\u00f3n (San Ramon Forest Reserve). In 1991, by the executive decree number 20172-M was redefined as the San Ram\u00f3n Protection Zone. Finally, on August 20, 1993, by the law number '''7354''', was officially published in the government gazette as the Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve.\n\n== Administration==\nFor the administration of the Reserve, the Council of the University of Costa Rica at San Ram\u00f3n (known as West Branch) approved in Session No. 521 of June 9, 1993, the Standards for the management of the station Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve. Part of this article indicates that the RBAMB must be administered by a director, who shall be a professor at the headquarters of the west branch. In addition, there is an advisory committee called the General Advisory Committee and Technical Research Advisory Committee.\nthe General Advisory Committee consists of the Research Coordinator, the Director of the Department of Natural Sciences, the Director of the reserve, the director of the Biology Section and a professor of this section. Part of the activities of this Committee are: promoting and approving the different programs or operating plans for the management of the Reserve and determine the fees for the use of facilities and decide on the distribution of resources economic as well as improvements to be promoted in their facilities. The current director is Biologist M.Sc.

It is part of the [[Central Conservation Area]]; which protects [[tropical forest]] area near [[San Ram\u00f3n, Costa Rica|San Ramon]]. The reserve operates under the direction of the [[University of Costa Rica]] and the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications (MINAET).\n\n== History ==\nThe Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve (RBAMB) was created in 1975 by executive decree number 4960-A as the Reserva Forestal de San Ram\u00f3n (San Ramon Forest Reserve). In 1991, by the executive decree number 20172-M was redefined as the San Ram\u00f3n Protection Zone. Finally, on August 20, 1993, by the law number '''7354''', was officially published in the government gazette as the Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve.\n\n== Administration==\nFor the administration of the Reserve, the Council of the University of Costa Rica at San Ram\u00f3n (known as West Branch) approved in Session No. 521 of June 9, 1993, the Standards for the management of the station Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve. Part of this article indicates that the RBAMB must be administered by a director, who shall be a professor at the headquarters of the west branch. In addition, there is an advisory committee called the General Advisory Committee and Technical Research Advisory Committee.\nthe General Advisory Committee consists of the Research Coordinator, the Director of the Department of Natural Sciences, the Director of the reserve, the director of the Biology Section and a professor of this section. Part of the activities of this Committee are: promoting and approving the different programs or operating plans for the management of the Reserve and determine the fees for the use of facilities and decide on the distribution of resources economic as well as improvements to be promoted in their facilities. The current director is Biologist M.Sc. Ronald S\u00e1nchez Porras.\n\n== Research and Publications ==\nMost of the  publications (45%) are associated with plants, 12.6% with fungi and lichens, 2.5% birds, 11.4% to arthropods, 3.8% to reptiles and amphibians, 16.4% with soils, nutrients and climate, 7% with administrative and outreach, and 1.3% in phytochemistry.
