He is best known for his [[Socialism|socialist]] cartoons, especially those drawn for the left-wing political magazine ''[[The Masses]]'' between 1911 and 1917.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nArt Young was born January 14, 1866, near [[Orangeville, Illinois|Orangeville]], in [[Stephenson County, Illinois]].  His family moved to [[Monroe, Wisconsin]], when he was a year old. He enrolled in the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|Chicago Academy of Design]] in 1884, where he studied under [[John Vanderpoel|J. H. Vanderpoel]]. His first published cartoon appeared the same year in the trade paper, ''Nimble Nickel''. Also in that same year, he began working for a succession of [[Chicago]] newspapers including the ''Evening Mail'', the ''[[Chicago Daily News|Daily News]]'', and the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Tribune]]''.\n\nIn 1888, Young resumed his studies, first at the [[Art Students League of New York]] (until 1889), then at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in [[Paris]] (1889\u201390). Following a long convalescence, he joined the ''[[Chicago Inter-Ocean]]'' (1892), to which he contributed [[political cartoon]]s and drawings for its Sunday color supplement.\n\nIn 1895 he married Elizabeth North. In 1895 or 1896, he worked briefly for the ''Denver Times'', then moved again to New York City after his separation with North, where he sold drawings to the humor magazines ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', and drew cartoons for [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York Evening Journal]]'' and Sunday ''[[New York American]]''. From 1902 to 1906, Young studied rhetoric at [[Cooper Union]] in order to improve his skills as a cartoonist.\n\n===''The Masses''===\n[[File:2108-young-arrestthisman.jpg|alt=|thumb|Political cartoon by Art Young, first published in Young's magazine, ''[[Good Morning (magazine)|Good Morning]]'', Aug. 1921]]\n\nYoung started out as a generally apolitical [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], but gradually became interested in [[left wing]] ideas, and by 1906 or so considered himself a socialist. Young would begin increasingly to associate with such political leftist as [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and Piet Vlag, both of whom he would work with at the radical socialist monthly, ''[[The Masses]]''. He became firmly ensconced in the radical environment of Greenwich Village after moving there in 1910. He became politically active, and by 1910, [[Racism|racial]] and [[Sexism|sexual discrimination]] and the apparent injustices of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system became prevalent themes in his work. Young would explain these sentiments in his autobiography, ''Art Young: His Life and Times'' (1939),\n\n<blockquote>\nI am antagonistic to the money-making fetish because it sidetracks our natural selves, leaving us no alternative but to accept the situation and take ''any'' kind of work for a weekly wage [...] We are caught and hurt by the system, and the more sensitive we are to life's highest values the harder it is to bear the abuse.<ref>Young, Art. ''Art Young: His Life and Times.'' Ed. John Nicholas Beffel. New York: Sheridan, 1939. 452. Print</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn an attempt to curb this abuse, Young ran for the [[New York State Assembly]] on the ticket of the Socialist Party of New York City (Part of the [[Socialist Party of America]], SPUSA) in 1913 but was unsuccessful.\n\nOne facet of the establishment Young challenged in his cartoons and drawings was the [[Associated Press]]. His attacks became overt and damning once he joined the staff of the ''Masses'' as a co-editor and contributor. He held this position from 1911 to 1918. Young was one of the few original editorial members that stayed with the magazine for its entire run until it folded in December 1917. In July 1913, the magazine published Young's cartoon \"Poisoned at the Source\", which depicted the AP's president, [[Frank Brett Noyes|Frank B. Noyes]], poisoning a well labeled \"The News\" with lies, suppressed facts, slander, and prejudice. The cartoon was a response to the lack of national news coverage on the [[Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912]] in [[Kanawha County, West Virginia]]. The strike had lasted more than a year, and was characterized by deadly clashes between miners and militia hired by the coal companies. The coal companies were successful in having the Federal government declare martial law under a military tribunal, an egregious act according to the editors of the ''Masses''.\n\nThe fact that little had been heard about these occurrences outside of West Virginia troubled those on the magazine's staff. Young's cartoon and Max Eastman's editorial, published in the same issue, claimed the AP had willfully suppressed the facts in order to aid the coal companies. The AP responded in kind with two suits of libel against Eastman and Young on November 1913 and January 1914. Both suits eventually were dropped after Young and Eastman's attorney subpoenaed the records of the AP's Pittsburgh office, possibly out of fear that the testimony and evidence would be damaging after becoming public through the legal proceedings.\n\n===''The Liberator''===\nIn 1918 Young subsequently helped to establish a similar publication to the ''Masses'', the above-mentioned ''Liberator''.  He also served as an illustrator and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] correspondent for ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]'' (1912\u201317) until the magazine released him due to his outspoken anti-war sentiments. In 1918, Young again ran unsuccessfully for public office on the Socialist ticket, this time for the [[New York State Senate]].\n\nUnhappy with the way that editors Max and Crystal Eastman and a few others were able to live off the struggling magazine, while he received a nominal fee or worked pro bono, Young left ''The Liberator'' in 1919 to start a magazine of his own, ''[[Good Morning (magazine)|Good Morning]]''. This publication was later absorbed by the ''Art Young Quarterly'' in 1922.\n\n===Other publications===\nYoung also contributed illustrations to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', ''[[New Leader]]'', ''[[New Masses]]'', ''The Coming Nation'', ''Dawn'', ''The Call'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (after 1930), and ''Big Stick''.  Of the many books he wrote, two, ''On My Way'' (1928) and ''Art Young: His Life and Times'' (1939), are autobiographical.  Of special note are his series of drawings depicting Hell, published in ''[[Cosmopolitan magazine]]'' and in several books, including ''Through Hell With Hiprah Hunt'', available at Google Books.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Through Hell with Hiprah Hunt\n|author=Arthur Henry Young,  Art Young\n|year=1901\n|publisher=Zimmerman's\n|isbn=\n|url=https://archive.org/details/throughhellwith00youngoog\n|quote=hiprah.\n}}</ref> He issued a collection of his drawings, ''The Best of Art Young'', in 1936.\n\n===Legal difficulties===\n====First ''Masses'' Trial====\n[[File:Having Their Fling.jpg|thumb|''Having Their Fling'' by Art Young was brought into court as evidence during the second trial in September/October 1918.]]\nYoung would continue to get himself into legal trouble with his drawings during his years at the ''Masses''. In October 1917, Art Young, [[Max Eastman]], [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[Floyd Dell]], Merrill Rogers, and a one-time contributor were charged under the [[Espionage Act]] by the federal government on the charge of conspiracy to obstruct enlistment. The trial began in April the following year and Young was asked to justify his cartoon \"Having Their Fling\" in which four men, an editor, a capitalist, a politician, and a minister are depicted dancing in orgiastic bliss as Satan leads a band of war implements. Young stated he was simply illustrating [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman's]] well-known saying that \"war is hell.\" It seemed appropriate to Young, then, to have Satan as the conductor. The first trial ended in a hung jury. The official tally was 11-1 for conviction.\n\n====Second ''Masses'' Trial====\nThe second trial began in September 1918, and it was as full of humor and irreverence as the first, perhaps more humorous for the historian than for Young. Throughout the trial, Young had the tendency to nap, an act that brought him dangerously close to being charged with contempt of court. Afraid Young would get into more trouble than he already was, his attorneys insisted he be awakened and given a pencil and pad. Young took the pencil and pad and quickly completed a self-portrait. The drawing, \"Art Young on Trial for His Life\", appeared in the ''[[The Liberator (socialist)|Liberator]]'' in June 1918. The cartoon depicted Young slumped in a chair, dozing the trial away.\n\nYoung's propensity for napping worked to the defendant's advantage during the closing arguments. Prosecutor Barnes, wrapped in an American flag and giving a moving speech, told a story of a dead soldier in France. This soldier, Barnes claimed, \"is but one of a thousand whose voices are not silent. He died for you and he died for me. He died for Max Eastman. He died for John Reed. He died for Merrill Rogers.

He is best known for his [[Socialism|socialist]] cartoons, especially those drawn for the left-wing political magazine ''[[The Masses]]'' between 1911 and 1917.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nArt Young was born January 14, 1866, near [[Orangeville, Illinois|Orangeville]], in [[Stephenson County, Illinois]].  His family moved to [[Monroe, Wisconsin]], when he was a year old. He enrolled in the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|Chicago Academy of Design]] in 1884, where he studied under [[John Vanderpoel|J. H. Vanderpoel]]. His first published cartoon appeared the same year in the trade paper, ''Nimble Nickel''. Also in that same year, he began working for a succession of [[Chicago]] newspapers including the ''Evening Mail'', the ''[[Chicago Daily News|Daily News]]'', and the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Tribune]]''.\n\nIn 1888, Young resumed his studies, first at the [[Art Students League of New York]] (until 1889), then at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in [[Paris]] (1889\u201390). Following a long convalescence, he joined the ''[[Chicago Inter-Ocean]]'' (1892), to which he contributed [[political cartoon]]s and drawings for its Sunday color supplement.\n\nIn 1895 he married Elizabeth North. In 1895 or 1896, he worked briefly for the ''Denver Times'', then moved again to New York City after his separation with North, where he sold drawings to the humor magazines ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', and drew cartoons for [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York Evening Journal]]'' and Sunday ''[[New York American]]''. From 1902 to 1906, Young studied rhetoric at [[Cooper Union]] in order to improve his skills as a cartoonist.\n\n===''The Masses''===\n[[File:2108-young-arrestthisman.jpg|alt=|thumb|Political cartoon by Art Young, first published in Young's magazine, ''[[Good Morning (magazine)|Good Morning]]'', Aug. 1921]]\n\nYoung started out as a generally apolitical [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], but gradually became interested in [[left wing]] ideas, and by 1906 or so considered himself a socialist. Young would begin increasingly to associate with such political leftist as [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and Piet Vlag, both of whom he would work with at the radical socialist monthly, ''[[The Masses]]''. He became firmly ensconced in the radical environment of Greenwich Village after moving there in 1910. He became politically active, and by 1910, [[Racism|racial]] and [[Sexism|sexual discrimination]] and the apparent injustices of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system became prevalent themes in his work. Young would explain these sentiments in his autobiography, ''Art Young: His Life and Times'' (1939),\n\n<blockquote>\nI am antagonistic to the money-making fetish because it sidetracks our natural selves, leaving us no alternative but to accept the situation and take ''any'' kind of work for a weekly wage [...] We are caught and hurt by the system, and the more sensitive we are to life's highest values the harder it is to bear the abuse.<ref>Young, Art. ''Art Young: His Life and Times.'' Ed. John Nicholas Beffel. New York: Sheridan, 1939. 452. Print</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn an attempt to curb this abuse, Young ran for the [[New York State Assembly]] on the ticket of the Socialist Party of New York City (Part of the [[Socialist Party of America]], SPUSA) in 1913 but was unsuccessful.\n\nOne facet of the establishment Young challenged in his cartoons and drawings was the [[Associated Press]]. His attacks became overt and damning once he joined the staff of the ''Masses'' as a co-editor and contributor. He held this position from 1911 to 1918. Young was one of the few original editorial members that stayed with the magazine for its entire run until it folded in December 1917. In July 1913, the magazine published Young's cartoon \"Poisoned at the Source\", which depicted the AP's president, [[Frank Brett Noyes|Frank B. Noyes]], poisoning a well labeled \"The News\" with lies, suppressed facts, slander, and prejudice. The cartoon was a response to the lack of national news coverage on the [[Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912]] in [[Kanawha County, West Virginia]]. The strike had lasted more than a year, and was characterized by deadly clashes between miners and militia hired by the coal companies. The coal companies were successful in having the Federal government declare martial law under a military tribunal, an egregious act according to the editors of the ''Masses''.\n\nThe fact that little had been heard about these occurrences outside of West Virginia troubled those on the magazine's staff. Young's cartoon and Max Eastman's editorial, published in the same issue, claimed the AP had willfully suppressed the facts in order to aid the coal companies. The AP responded in kind with two suits of libel against Eastman and Young on November 1913 and January 1914. Both suits eventually were dropped after Young and Eastman's attorney subpoenaed the records of the AP's Pittsburgh office, possibly out of fear that the testimony and evidence would be damaging after becoming public through the legal proceedings.\n\n===''The Liberator''===\nIn 1918 Young subsequently helped to establish a similar publication to the ''Masses'', the above-mentioned ''Liberator''.  He also served as an illustrator and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] correspondent for ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]'' (1912\u201317) until the magazine released him due to his outspoken anti-war sentiments. In 1918, Young again ran unsuccessfully for public office on the Socialist ticket, this time for the [[New York State Senate]].\n\nUnhappy with the way that editors Max and Crystal Eastman and a few others were able to live off the struggling magazine, while he received a nominal fee or worked pro bono, Young left ''The Liberator'' in 1919 to start a magazine of his own, ''[[Good Morning (magazine)|Good Morning]]''. This publication was later absorbed by the ''Art Young Quarterly'' in 1922.\n\n===Other publications===\nYoung also contributed illustrations to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', ''[[New Leader]]'', ''[[New Masses]]'', ''The Coming Nation'', ''Dawn'', ''The Call'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (after 1930), and ''Big Stick''.  Of the many books he wrote, two, ''On My Way'' (1928) and ''Art Young: His Life and Times'' (1939), are autobiographical.  Of special note are his series of drawings depicting Hell, published in ''[[Cosmopolitan magazine]]'' and in several books, including ''Through Hell With Hiprah Hunt'', available at Google Books.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Through Hell with Hiprah Hunt\n|author=Arthur Henry Young,  Art Young\n|year=1901\n|publisher=Zimmerman's\n|isbn=\n|url=https://archive.org/details/throughhellwith00youngoog\n|quote=hiprah.\n}}</ref> He issued a collection of his drawings, ''The Best of Art Young'', in 1936.\n\n===Legal difficulties===\n====First ''Masses'' Trial====\n[[File:Having Their Fling.jpg|thumb|''Having Their Fling'' by Art Young was brought into court as evidence during the second trial in September/October 1918.]]\nYoung would continue to get himself into legal trouble with his drawings during his years at the ''Masses''. In October 1917, Art Young, [[Max Eastman]], [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[Floyd Dell]], Merrill Rogers, and a one-time contributor were charged under the [[Espionage Act]] by the federal government on the charge of conspiracy to obstruct enlistment. The trial began in April the following year and Young was asked to justify his cartoon \"Having Their Fling\" in which four men, an editor, a capitalist, a politician, and a minister are depicted dancing in orgiastic bliss as Satan leads a band of war implements. Young stated he was simply illustrating [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman's]] well-known saying that \"war is hell.\" It seemed appropriate to Young, then, to have Satan as the conductor. The first trial ended in a hung jury. The official tally was 11-1 for conviction.\n\n====Second ''Masses'' Trial====\nThe second trial began in September 1918, and it was as full of humor and irreverence as the first, perhaps more humorous for the historian than for Young. Throughout the trial, Young had the tendency to nap, an act that brought him dangerously close to being charged with contempt of court. Afraid Young would get into more trouble than he already was, his attorneys insisted he be awakened and given a pencil and pad. Young took the pencil and pad and quickly completed a self-portrait. The drawing, \"Art Young on Trial for His Life\", appeared in the ''[[The Liberator (socialist)|Liberator]]'' in June 1918. The cartoon depicted Young slumped in a chair, dozing the trial away.\n\nYoung's propensity for napping worked to the defendant's advantage during the closing arguments. Prosecutor Barnes, wrapped in an American flag and giving a moving speech, told a story of a dead soldier in France. This soldier, Barnes claimed, \"is but one of a thousand whose voices are not silent. He died for you and he died for me. He died for Max Eastman. He died for John Reed. He died for Merrill Rogers. He demands that these men be punished.\"<ref>Fishbein, Leslie. ''Rebels in Bohemia: The Radicals of The'' Masses, 1911-1917. Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina P, 1982. 28.

It would be the last time Young appeared in court for the charges, as they were dropped after failing twice to garner any convictions.\n\n===Death===\nArt Young died on December 29, 1943, at the Hotel Irving in [[New York City]] at age 77.<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Art Young |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/12/31/archives/art-young.html |quote=Art Young, who died in this city Wednesday night at the age of 77, wouldn't have liked to have it said that he was a lovable soul in spite of his sometimes heterodox opinions.

They were Cecil Walker, Doug Dawson, T Marshall ([[Grafton Athletic]]), [[Charles Savory]], T McWhirter, G Cook, N Vause, V McCollum, Alf Gault, T Lambert, E Tiernan, F Stubbs, W. G. Handle ([[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]), B Hart, F Gladding, A Powley, Chas Mann ([[North Shore Albions]]), [[William Moeki]], G Jones, W Harris, S Magee, S Greer ([[City Rovers]]), A Miller, C Sinton, and L O'Leary (Sunnyside). City Rovers had sent ninety men to war by this time and twenty-one had been wounded and five killed. The Sunnyside club had only nine members left and one of those who had gone to the war (W Shaughnessey) said that in the trenches he had made a list of league players from various clubs which totaled 120. All three of the Sunnyside secretaries had enlisted and the executive was also gone. Ponsonby had also had over eighty of its member join the war effort.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =At the Front/Footballers Distinguish Themselves\n| page =6\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 107\n| date = 1917-05-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170505.2.50\n| accessdate = 2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\nThirty three teams entered the six grades. This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. [[Grafton Athletic]] also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy for the first time with a 12\u20136 win over [[City Rovers]] in the final. By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|season]] following on the footsteps of [[City Rovers]] who had won both titles the year prior.\n\nAt the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious [[Auckland Rugby Union]] club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[City Rovers]] at the end of the season. The team would go on to struggle for numbers itself in 1918 before eventually amalgamating with [[Grafton Athletic]].\n\nIn 1916 the fence around [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] had been removed by the council which made it very difficult to collect gate revenue. The league had however secured land which would be developed as [[Carlaw Park]] with the aim being to secure the ground and gain revenue from ticket sales in the future.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=9th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1917}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1918 Auckland Rugby League season|1918]]}}\n        {{end}}\n\n==First Grade Championship==\nTwenty three first grade season matches were played which was less than previous seasons but owing to the fact that both [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] and [[Grafton Athletic]] were forced to drop out of the competition due to a lack of players as a result of so many leaving to join the war effort.

City Rovers had sent ninety men to war by this time and twenty-one had been wounded and five killed. The Sunnyside club had only nine members left and one of those who had gone to the war (W Shaughnessey) said that in the trenches he had made a list of league players from various clubs which totaled 120. All three of the Sunnyside secretaries had enlisted and the executive was also gone.

This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. [[Grafton Athletic]] also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy for the first time with a 12\u20136 win over [[City Rovers]] in the final. By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|season]] following on the footsteps of [[City Rovers]] who had won both titles the year prior.\n\nAt the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious [[Auckland Rugby Union]] club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[City Rovers]] at the end of the season. The team would go on to struggle for numbers itself in 1918 before eventually amalgamating with [[Grafton Athletic]].\n\nIn 1916 the fence around [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] had been removed by the council which made it very difficult to collect gate revenue. The league had however secured land which would be developed as [[Carlaw Park]] with the aim being to secure the ground and gain revenue from ticket sales in the future.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=9th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1917}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1918 Auckland Rugby League season|1918]]}}\n        {{end}}\n\n==First Grade Championship==\nTwenty three first grade season matches were played which was less than previous seasons but owing to the fact that both [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] and [[Grafton Athletic]] were forced to drop out of the competition due to a lack of players as a result of so many leaving to join the war effort.

It showed a progression from straightforward rock towards [[folk music|folk]] and acoustic music.\n\nWhile hard rock influences were still present, such as on \"[[Immigrant Song]]\", acoustic-based songs such as \"[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows#Led Zeppelin version|Gallows Pole]]\" and \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\" showed Led Zeppelin were capable of playing different styles successfully. The band wrote most of the material themselves, but as with prior records, included two songs that were re-interpretations of earlier works: \"Gallows Pole\", based on a traditional English folk song, by way of American singer [[Fred Gerlach]]; and \"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\", a reworking of a blues song by [[Bukka White]].\n\nThe acoustic material developed from a songwriting session between band members [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] at [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage in Wales, which influenced the musical direction. The songs were recorded in three locations. Much of the work was done at [[Headley Grange]], a country house, using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]. Additional sessions were held in more traditional recording studios, such as [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] and [[Olympic Studios]] in London. As with the prior album, the band eschewed the use of guest musicians, with all music performed by band members Page (guitars), Plant (vocals), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, keyboards), and [[John Bonham]] (drums). The range of instruments played by the band was greatly enhanced on this album, with Jones especially emerging as a talented multi-instrumentalist, playing a wide range of keyboard and stringed instruments, including various [[synthesizer]]s, [[mandolin]] and [[double bass]], in addition to his usual bass guitar. As with prior albums, Page served as producer on the album, with mixing done by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].\n\nThe album was one of the most anticipated of 1970, and its shipping date was held up by the intricate inner sleeve design based around a [[volvelle]], with numerous images visible through holes in the outer cover. It was an immediate commercial success upon release and topped the UK and US charts. Although critics were typically confused over the change in musical style and gave the album a mixed response, ''Led Zeppelin III'' has since been acknowledged as representing an important milestone in the band's history and a turning point in their music.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107 (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|right|Three songs on ''Led Zeppelin III'' were written by [[Jimmy Page|Page]] and [[Robert Plant|Plant]] while holidaying in [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Phil Sutcliffe|title=Back to Nature|journal=Q Magazine Special Led Zeppelin edition|date=2003|page= 34}}</ref>]]\n\nBy 1970, Led Zeppelin had achieved commercial success in both the UK and the US with their first two albums. They were determined to have a proper break, having recorded most of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' in various locations while on tour, financing the sessions with the album sales and tour receipts.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Following an exhausting [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Spring 1970|concert tour of North America]] that spring, lead singer [[Robert Plant]] recommended to guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] that they should retreat to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], an 18th-century cottage in [[Snowdonia]], Wales, on a hilltop overlooking the [[River Dyfi|Dyfi Valley]], {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} north of the market town [[Machynlleth]]. Plant had spent holidays there with his family.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|McParland|2018|p=29}}\n\nThis remote setting had no running water or electric power, which encouraged a slight change of musical direction for the band towards an emphasis on acoustic arrangements.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=52, 55}} Page later explained that the tranquillity of Bron-Yr-Aur stood in sharp contrast to the continual touring of 1969, affecting the overall tone of the songwriting and dominance of acoustic guitars.<ref name=Schulps>{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Schulps|url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp|title=Interview with Jimmy Page|publisher=[[Trouser Press]]|publication-date=October 1977}}</ref> His playing was influenced by folk guitarists [[Davey Graham]] and [[Bert Jansch]], who regularly used alternative guitar tunings. Plant also recalled the band were \"obsessed with change\" and enjoyed listening to [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]].<ref name=williamson>{{cite journal|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|authorlink=Nigel Williamson|title=Good Times...Bad Times|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|publication-date=May 2005|page=56}}</ref> The band specifically wanted a change in direction, to show they could play any style of music they wanted.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=96}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe first recording sessions for ''Led Zeppelin III'' took place at [[Olympic Studios]] in November 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}} A press statement from manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] said the group were recording a non-album track to be released as a single, but this was ultimately abandoned. Further sessions took place towards the end of the year, in between touring, before the decision was made to stop working and take a break at Bron-Yr-Aur.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=74}} After preparing material for the album there, Page and Plant were joined by drummer [[John Bonham]] and bassist/keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] at [[Headley Grange]], a mansion in [[East Hampshire]], to rehearse the songs. The rural atmosphere gave a relaxed feel to the sessions, and the band found it to be a more enjoyable environment in which to develop songs than a studio in the city.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}\n\nThe album was recorded between May and June 1970 at Headley Grange (using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]) and at Olympic, with further recording at Island Records' [[Basing Street Studios]] in [[Notting Hill]] the following month. Mixing took place at Ardent Studios, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], in August 1970, partway through the group's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Summer 1970|sixth American concert tour]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=76}} The album was produced by Page and engineered by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Led Zeppelin III|publisher=Atlantic Records|id=K50002|year=1970}}</ref> Page had first met Manning when the latter's band, [[Lawson and Four More]], had supported Page's old band [[the Yardbirds]] in 1966. Manning had been to several Led Zeppelin shows, and this led to Page asking him to engineer the new album.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=77}}\n\n==Songs==\n''Led Zeppelin III'' marked a change in focus for the band, from late 1960s hard rock to a [[psychedelic folk]] and [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} These styles had been present to a lesser degree on the band's first two releases, such as \"[[Babe I'm Gonna Leave You]]\" and \"[[Ramble On]]\", from the first and second albums, respectively. However, on this album, the group used more acoustic arrangements, and they would remain prominent to various degrees in the group's later releases.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=73,75}} With ''Led Zeppelin III'', the group's songwriting dynamic also changed, from Page's domination of the first two albums towards a more democratic situation in which all four group members contributed their own compositions and ideas.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Plant wrote all of the lyrics, with the exception of \"Tangerine\".<ref name=MM70/>\n\n===Side one===\n\"[[Immigrant Song]]\" was written about the [[Viking invasions of England]] and inspired by a [[Led Zeppelin Tour of Iceland, Bath and Germany, Summer 1970|short tour of Iceland]] in June 1970. It was released as a single in the US and became a top 20 hit. It was the opening song for the band's appearance at the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music]] and at subsequent gigs for the next two years.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} It was popularised in the 2003 movie ''[[School of Rock]]'', after [[Jack Black]] made a short video with fans asking for permission for its use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/led-zeppelin-allow-song-to-be-used-in-school-of-rock-movie/|title=LED ZEPPELIN Allow Song To Be Used In 'School Of Rock' Movie|website=Blabbermouth|date=8 September 2003|accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref> Page clarified that the song's opening is a combination of a voice and echo feedback.<ref name=MM70>{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/led-zeppelin-page-on-zeppelin-iii|title=Led Zeppelin: Page on Zeppelin III|first=Chris|last=Welch|work=Melody Maker|date=24 October 1970|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n\"Friends\" is an acoustic track that uses [[C6 tuning|C6 chord open tuning]] (C-A-C-G-C-E).<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/50-greatest-led-zeppelin-songs|title=The 50 Greatest Led Zeppelin Songs|first=Jimmy|last=Brown|journal=Guitar World|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref> It includes a [[string section]] arranged by Jones, which Page had wanted to achieve an Indian style of sound.<ref name=MM70/> The song was re-recorded as an experimental arrangement with the Bombay Orchestra in March 1972, along with \"Four Sticks\" from the following untitled album, commonly known as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971).{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49\u201350}} That arrangement appeared on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/passage-to-india-the-true-story-of-zeppelin-s-secret-bombay-sessions|title=Led Zeppelin in India: the true story behind the secret Bombay sessions|work=Louder|date=23 July 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref> The song segues into \"Celebration Day\" via a [[Moog synthesiser]] drone.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n\"[[Since I've Been Loving You]]\" was one of the first songs to be written for the album, in late 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} It is a blues song in the key of [[C minor]], featuring Jones on [[Hammond organ]] and bass pedals, simultaneously.<ref name=MM70/> The song became a live performance staple for the band throughout the rest of their career, replacing \"[[I Can't Quit You Baby]]\" from the [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]] as the band's slow blues showcase, with Page's guitar solo featured on both the recorded version and in the band's live show.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=47,50}}\n\n\"Out on the Tiles\" was written by Bonham, who came up with the idea for the riffs that run through the track. The introduction was used to open live versions of \"[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]\" (from ''Led Zeppelin IV'') and Bonham's drum solo on the 1977 US tour.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows#Led Zeppelin version|Gallows Pole]]\" is an updated arrangement of a traditional folk song called \"[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows]]\", inspired by a version recorded by [[Fred Gerlach]]. Page played a variety of acoustic and electric guitars and banjo, while Jones played mandolin as well as bass.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}} It was reworked by Page and Plant for their 1994 album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r207800/review|title=''No Quarter'': Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded \u2013 Review|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|website=AllMusic|accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Tangerine (Led Zeppelin song)|Tangerine]]\" was written by Page in 1968, when the Yardbirds were still together. The track features [[pedal steel guitar]] as well as acoustic. It was added to the group's live acoustic set in 1971 and performed regularly into the following year. It was then revived as a four-part harmony arrangement in 1975.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}\n\n\"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\" had the original title of \"The Boy Next Door\". It was written in Bron-Yr-Aur about the problems two people faced in a relationship and the clashes with their families. The song became a staple part of the group's acoustic set throughout the 1970s and was played at the Bath Festival, where Led Zeppelin performed acoustically for the first time in the UK.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=72}} Page thought highly of Plant's lyrics and considered it a breakthrough in their development as a songwriting team.<ref name=RS2006>{{Cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Mikal |title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin |journal=Rolling Stone |issue=1006 |date=10 August 2006 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-long-shadow-of-led-zeppelin-184055/ |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> The pair had gone for a walk and, on their return, sat down by a ravine with a tape recorder, where Page started to play the tune, to which Plant improvised a verse.<ref name=MM70/>\n\n\"[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]\" was originally called \"Jennings Farm Blues\" and recorded as an electric arrangement, at the end of 1969. It was subsequently reworked as an acoustic number and featured Bonham playing spoons. The closing track, \"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\", was based on the [[Bukka White]] blues song \"[[Shake 'Em On Down]]\" and named as a tribute to their friend and folk singer, [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]. The original LP credited the arrangement to \"Charles Obscure\", a band in-joke.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=92}} It features Plant's voice fed through a [[vibrato]] amplifier.<ref name=MM70/>\n\n===Unreleased material===\nPage said that the group had 16 tracks to choose from for release on ''Led Zeppelin III''.<ref name=MM70/> Six other songs that were recorded during the ''Led Zeppelin III'' sessions were released at a later date: \"Poor Tom\" was released on ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''; \"Bron-Yr-Aur\" was included on the 1975 double album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''; \"[[Hey, Hey, What Can I Do]]\" was released as the B-side to the 1970 \"Immigrant Song\" single, and on the 1972 [[sampler album]] ''[[The New Age of Atlantic]]''{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}, later appearing on the first [[Led Zeppelin Box Set|box set]] in 1990 and then [[Led Zeppelin Deluxe Edition#Coda|''Coda'' (Deluxe Edition)]] in 2015 with \"St. Tristan's Sword\"; and both \"Jennings Farm Blues\" and \"[[Key to the Highway]]/[[Trouble in Mind (song)|Trouble in Mind]]\" later appeared on the 2014 [[Led Zeppelin Deluxe Edition#Led Zeppelin III|deluxe edition of the album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/led-zeppelin-iii-deluxe-edition-mr0004121583|title=''Led Zeppelin III'' [Deluxe Edition] \u2013 Review|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|website=AllMusic|accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Packaging and artwork==\n[[File:Led Zeppelin III volvelle .jpg|alt=|thumb|The volvelle used on the front cover]]\n\n''Led Zeppelin III'''s original [[vinyl record|vinyl]] edition was packaged in a gatefold sleeve with an innovative cover, designed by [[Zacron]], a multi-media artist whom Page had met in 1963 whilst Zacron was a student at [[Kingston College of Art]].{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=77}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zacron.com/view-item.asp?iid=4 |title=Zacron \u2013 Led Zeppelin III Rock album cover, strictly limited world edition plus 50 a/p's signed by Zacron Gallery |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117131508/https://www.zacron.com/view-item.asp?iid=4 |archivedate=17 January 2008 }}</ref> Zacron subsequently graduated from the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and became a lecturer at the [[University of Leeds]]. Page asked him if he would help design a sleeve for the album and, on 24 January 1970, Zacron met the band at their gig at his university and agreed to do the cover. That spring, he met the band members individually and took a series of photos of each of them, which would be put into a collage.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=77\u201378}}\n\nThe cover and interior gatefold art consisted of a surreal collection of seemingly random images on a white background, many of them connected thematically with flight or aviation. Behind the front cover was a rotatable laminated card disc, or [[volvelle]], covered with more images, including photos of the band members, which showed through holes in the cover; moving an image into place behind one hole would usually bring one or two others into place behind other holes.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=78}} The back cover was a composite shot of the best photographs from the photography sessions.

It showed a progression from straightforward rock towards [[folk music|folk]] and acoustic music.\n\nWhile hard rock influences were still present, such as on \"[[Immigrant Song]]\", acoustic-based songs such as \"[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows#Led Zeppelin version|Gallows Pole]]\" and \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\" showed Led Zeppelin were capable of playing different styles successfully. The band wrote most of the material themselves, but as with prior records, included two songs that were re-interpretations of earlier works: \"Gallows Pole\", based on a traditional English folk song, by way of American singer [[Fred Gerlach]]; and \"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\", a reworking of a blues song by [[Bukka White]].\n\nThe acoustic material developed from a songwriting session between band members [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] at [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage in Wales, which influenced the musical direction. The songs were recorded in three locations. Much of the work was done at [[Headley Grange]], a country house, using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]. Additional sessions were held in more traditional recording studios, such as [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] and [[Olympic Studios]] in London. As with the prior album, the band eschewed the use of guest musicians, with all music performed by band members Page (guitars), Plant (vocals), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, keyboards), and [[John Bonham]] (drums). The range of instruments played by the band was greatly enhanced on this album, with Jones especially emerging as a talented multi-instrumentalist, playing a wide range of keyboard and stringed instruments, including various [[synthesizer]]s, [[mandolin]] and [[double bass]], in addition to his usual bass guitar. As with prior albums, Page served as producer on the album, with mixing done by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].\n\nThe album was one of the most anticipated of 1970, and its shipping date was held up by the intricate inner sleeve design based around a [[volvelle]], with numerous images visible through holes in the outer cover. It was an immediate commercial success upon release and topped the UK and US charts. Although critics were typically confused over the change in musical style and gave the album a mixed response, ''Led Zeppelin III'' has since been acknowledged as representing an important milestone in the band's history and a turning point in their music.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107 (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|right|Three songs on ''Led Zeppelin III'' were written by [[Jimmy Page|Page]] and [[Robert Plant|Plant]] while holidaying in [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Phil Sutcliffe|title=Back to Nature|journal=Q Magazine Special Led Zeppelin edition|date=2003|page= 34}}</ref>]]\n\nBy 1970, Led Zeppelin had achieved commercial success in both the UK and the US with their first two albums. They were determined to have a proper break, having recorded most of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' in various locations while on tour, financing the sessions with the album sales and tour receipts.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Following an exhausting [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Spring 1970|concert tour of North America]] that spring, lead singer [[Robert Plant]] recommended to guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] that they should retreat to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], an 18th-century cottage in [[Snowdonia]], Wales, on a hilltop overlooking the [[River Dyfi|Dyfi Valley]], {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} north of the market town [[Machynlleth]]. Plant had spent holidays there with his family.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|McParland|2018|p=29}}\n\nThis remote setting had no running water or electric power, which encouraged a slight change of musical direction for the band towards an emphasis on acoustic arrangements.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=52, 55}} Page later explained that the tranquillity of Bron-Yr-Aur stood in sharp contrast to the continual touring of 1969, affecting the overall tone of the songwriting and dominance of acoustic guitars.<ref name=Schulps>{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Schulps|url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp|title=Interview with Jimmy Page|publisher=[[Trouser Press]]|publication-date=October 1977}}</ref> His playing was influenced by folk guitarists [[Davey Graham]] and [[Bert Jansch]], who regularly used alternative guitar tunings. Plant also recalled the band were \"obsessed with change\" and enjoyed listening to [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]].<ref name=williamson>{{cite journal|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|authorlink=Nigel Williamson|title=Good Times...Bad Times|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|publication-date=May 2005|page=56}}</ref> The band specifically wanted a change in direction, to show they could play any style of music they wanted.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=96}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe first recording sessions for ''Led Zeppelin III'' took place at [[Olympic Studios]] in November 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}} A press statement from manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] said the group were recording a non-album track to be released as a single, but this was ultimately abandoned. Further sessions took place towards the end of the year, in between touring, before the decision was made to stop working and take a break at Bron-Yr-Aur.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=74}} After preparing material for the album there, Page and Plant were joined by drummer [[John Bonham]] and bassist/keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] at [[Headley Grange]], a mansion in [[East Hampshire]], to rehearse the songs. The rural atmosphere gave a relaxed feel to the sessions, and the band found it to be a more enjoyable environment in which to develop songs than a studio in the city.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}\n\nThe album was recorded between May and June 1970 at Headley Grange (using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]) and at Olympic, with further recording at Island Records' [[Basing Street Studios]] in [[Notting Hill]] the following month. Mixing took place at Ardent Studios, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], in August 1970, partway through the group's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Summer 1970|sixth American concert tour]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=76}} The album was produced by Page and engineered by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Led Zeppelin III|publisher=Atlantic Records|id=K50002|year=1970}}</ref> Page had first met Manning when the latter's band, [[Lawson and Four More]], had supported Page's old band [[the Yardbirds]] in 1966. Manning had been to several Led Zeppelin shows, and this led to Page asking him to engineer the new album.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=77}}\n\n==Songs==\n''Led Zeppelin III'' marked a change in focus for the band, from late 1960s hard rock to a [[psychedelic folk]] and [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} These styles had been present to a lesser degree on the band's first two releases, such as \"[[Babe I'm Gonna Leave You]]\" and \"[[Ramble On]]\", from the first and second albums, respectively. However, on this album, the group used more acoustic arrangements, and they would remain prominent to various degrees in the group's later releases.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=73,75}} With ''Led Zeppelin III'', the group's songwriting dynamic also changed, from Page's domination of the first two albums towards a more democratic situation in which all four group members contributed their own compositions and ideas.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Plant wrote all of the lyrics, with the exception of \"Tangerine\".<ref name=MM70/>\n\n===Side one===\n\"[[Immigrant Song]]\" was written about the [[Viking invasions of England]] and inspired by a [[Led Zeppelin Tour of Iceland, Bath and Germany, Summer 1970|short tour of Iceland]] in June 1970. It was released as a single in the US and became a top 20 hit. It was the opening song for the band's appearance at the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music]] and at subsequent gigs for the next two years.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} It was popularised in the 2003 movie ''[[School of Rock]]'', after [[Jack Black]] made a short video with fans asking for permission for its use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/led-zeppelin-allow-song-to-be-used-in-school-of-rock-movie/|title=LED ZEPPELIN Allow Song To Be Used In 'School Of Rock' Movie|website=Blabbermouth|date=8 September 2003|accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref> Page clarified that the song's opening is a combination of a voice and echo feedback.<ref name=MM70>{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/led-zeppelin-page-on-zeppelin-iii|title=Led Zeppelin: Page on Zeppelin III|first=Chris|last=Welch|work=Melody Maker|date=24 October 1970|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n\"Friends\" is an acoustic track that uses [[C6 tuning|C6 chord open tuning]] (C-A-C-G-C-E).<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/50-greatest-led-zeppelin-songs|title=The 50 Greatest Led Zeppelin Songs|first=Jimmy|last=Brown|journal=Guitar World|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref> It includes a [[string section]] arranged by Jones, which Page had wanted to achieve an Indian style of sound.<ref name=MM70/> The song was re-recorded as an experimental arrangement with the Bombay Orchestra in March 1972, along with \"Four Sticks\" from the following untitled album, commonly known as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971).{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49\u201350}} That arrangement appeared on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/passage-to-india-the-true-story-of-zeppelin-s-secret-bombay-sessions|title=Led Zeppelin in India: the true story behind the secret Bombay sessions|work=Louder|date=23 July 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref> The song segues into \"Celebration Day\" via a [[Moog synthesiser]] drone.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n\"[[Since I've Been Loving You]]\" was one of the first songs to be written for the album, in late 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} It is a blues song in the key of [[C minor]], featuring Jones on [[Hammond organ]] and bass pedals, simultaneously.<ref name=MM70/> The song became a live performance staple for the band throughout the rest of their career, replacing \"[[I Can't Quit You Baby]]\" from the [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]] as the band's slow blues showcase, with Page's guitar solo featured both on the recorded version and in the band's live show.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=47,50}}\n\n\"Out on the Tiles\" was written by Bonham, who came up with the idea for the riffs that run through the track. The introduction was used to open live versions of \"[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]\" (from ''Led Zeppelin IV'') and Bonham's drum solo on the 1977 US tour.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows#Led Zeppelin version|Gallows Pole]]\" is an updated arrangement of a traditional folk song called \"[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows]]\", inspired by a version recorded by [[Fred Gerlach]]. Page played a variety of acoustic and electric guitars and banjo, while Jones played mandolin as well as bass.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}} It was reworked by Page and Plant for their 1994 album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r207800/review|title=''No Quarter'': Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded \u2013 Review|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|website=AllMusic|accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Tangerine (Led Zeppelin song)|Tangerine]]\" was written by Page in 1968, when the Yardbirds were still together. The track features [[pedal steel guitar]] as well as acoustic. It was added to the group's live acoustic set in 1971 and performed regularly into the following year. It was then revived as a four-part harmony arrangement in 1975.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}\n\n\"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\" had the original title of \"The Boy Next Door\". It was written in Bron-Yr-Aur about the problems two people faced in a relationship and the clashes with their families. The song became a staple part of the group's acoustic set throughout the 1970s and was played at the Bath Festival, where Led Zeppelin performed acoustically for the first time in the UK.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=72}} Page thought highly of Plant's lyrics and considered it a breakthrough in their development as a songwriting team.<ref name=RS2006>{{Cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Mikal |title=The Long Shadow of Led Zeppelin |journal=Rolling Stone |issue=1006 |date=10 August 2006 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-long-shadow-of-led-zeppelin-184055/ |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> The pair had gone for a walk and, on their return, sat down by a ravine with a tape recorder, where Page started to play the tune, to which Plant improvised a verse.<ref name=MM70/>\n\n\"[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]\" was originally called \"Jennings Farm Blues\" and recorded as an electric arrangement, at the end of 1969. It was subsequently reworked as an acoustic number and featured Bonham playing spoons. The closing track, \"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\", was based on the [[Bukka White]] blues song \"[[Shake 'Em On Down]]\" and named as a tribute to their friend and folk singer, [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]. The original LP credited the arrangement to \"Charles Obscure\", a band in-joke.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=92}} It features Plant's voice fed through a [[vibrato]] amplifier.<ref name=MM70/>\n\n===Unreleased material===\nPage said that the group had 16 tracks to choose from for release on ''Led Zeppelin III''.<ref name=MM70/> Six other songs that were recorded during the ''Led Zeppelin III'' sessions were released at a later date: \"Poor Tom\" was released on ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''; \"Bron-Yr-Aur\" was included on the 1975 double album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''; \"[[Hey, Hey, What Can I Do]]\" was released as the B-side to the 1970 \"Immigrant Song\" single, and on the 1972 [[sampler album]] ''[[The New Age of Atlantic]]''{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}, later appearing on the first [[Led Zeppelin Box Set|box set]] in 1990 and then [[Led Zeppelin Deluxe Edition#Coda|''Coda'' (Deluxe Edition)]] in 2015 with \"St. Tristan's Sword\"; and both \"Jennings Farm Blues\" and \"[[Key to the Highway]]/[[Trouble in Mind (song)|Trouble in Mind]]\" later appeared on the 2014 [[Led Zeppelin Deluxe Edition#Led Zeppelin III|deluxe edition of the album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/led-zeppelin-iii-deluxe-edition-mr0004121583|title=''Led Zeppelin III'' [Deluxe Edition] \u2013 Review|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|website=AllMusic|accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Packaging and artwork==\n[[File:Led Zeppelin III volvelle .jpg|alt=|thumb|The volvelle used on the front cover]]\n\n''Led Zeppelin III'''s original [[vinyl record|vinyl]] edition was packaged in a gatefold sleeve with an innovative cover, designed by [[Zacron]], a multi-media artist whom Page had met in 1963 whilst Zacron was a student at [[Kingston College of Art]].{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=77}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zacron.com/view-item.asp?iid=4 |title=Zacron \u2013 Led Zeppelin III Rock album cover, strictly limited world edition plus 50 a/p's signed by Zacron Gallery |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117131508/https://www.zacron.com/view-item.asp?iid=4 |archivedate=17 January 2008 }}</ref> Zacron subsequently graduated from the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and became a lecturer at the [[University of Leeds]]. Page asked him if he would help design a sleeve for the album and, on 24 January 1970, Zacron met the band at their gig at his university and agreed to do the cover. That spring, he met the band members individually and took a series of photos of each of them, which would be put into a collage.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=77\u201378}}\n\nThe cover and interior gatefold art consisted of a surreal collection of seemingly random images on a white background, many of them connected thematically with flight or aviation. Behind the front cover was a rotatable laminated card disc, or [[volvelle]], covered with more images, including photos of the band members, which showed through holes in the cover; moving an image into place behind one hole would usually bring one or two others into place behind other holes.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=78}} The back cover was a composite shot of the best photographs from the photography sessions. Zacron chose the images because he wanted to \"show them as the giant force they were in music\".{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=78}} In France, this album was released with a different album cover, simply showing a photo of the four band members.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Led Zeppelin III|publisher=Atlantic Records|id=940 051|year=1970}}</ref>\n\nZacron later said that, upon his completion of the artwork, Page telephoned him while he was in New York to express his satisfaction with the results, saying, \"I think it is fantastic\".<ref>''\"Hats Off to Zacron\", [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'', December 2007</ref> However, he later thought the artwork was unsatisfactory because of working to a deadline.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Brad |last=Tolinski |first2=Greg |last2=Di Bendetto |title=Light and Shade|journal=Guitar World|date=January 1998}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album reviews\n| title = Retrospective professional ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11457|title=''Led Zeppelin III'' \u2013 Album review|first=Stephen Thomas |last= Erlewine|accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n| rev2Score = B+<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=0-89919-025-1|chapter=Led Zeppelin: Led Zeppelin III|chapter-url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2012|accessdate=6 September 2018|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref> \n| rev3 = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=McCormick|first=Neil|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/10782738/Led-Zeppelins-albums-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html|title=Led Zeppelin's albums ranked from worst to best|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"acclaimed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A206.htm |title=Led Zeppelin ''Led Zeppelin III'' |publisher=[[Acclaimed Music]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616081607/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A206.htm|archivedate=16 June 2010}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Great Rock Discography]]''\n| rev5Score = 9/10<ref name=\"acclaimed\"/>\n| rev6 = [[Music Story]]\n| rev6Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"acclaimed\"/>\n|rev7 = ''[[MusicHound|MusicHound Rock]]''\n|rev7score = 3.5/5<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|authorlink=Gary Graff|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel (eds)|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57859-061-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/662 662]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/662}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1097454/a/Led+Zeppelin+III.htm |title=Q Review |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=16 August 1994 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/led-zeppelin/albumguide |title=Led Zeppelin: Album Guide |magazine=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] |accessdate=8 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301030118/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/led-zeppelin/albumguide |archivedate=1 March 2014 }}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]''\n| rev10Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-iii-album-of-the-week-club-review| title = Led Zeppelin: Led Zeppelin III - Album Of The Week Club review | accessdate = 29 January 2020 | last = Rock | first = Classic | date = 25 November 2019 | publisher = [[Loudersound]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Led Zeppelin III'' was one of the most anticipated albums of 1970, and advance orders in the US alone were close to the million mark.

Nearby are gentrified [[Mt Eden]], [[Kingsland, Auckland|Kingsland]], and Chinese-influenced Balmoral. The village has a post office, chemists, medical and legal practices, real estate agencies and a community centre.\n\nThe village architecture is art deco influenced, and most has survived, except the original village cinema.  The surrounding streets are wooden villas and bungalows from the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe volcanic cone of Owairaka [[Mount Albert, New Zealand|(Mt Albert)]] forms Sandringham\u2019s view to the west, and the [http://Roy%20Clements%20Treeway Roy Clements Treeway] on Meola Creek leads from nearby Ferguson Avenue to Rocket Park and the Mt Albert Community Centre.\n\nSandringham was named after [[Sandringham House|the country house]] of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] in [[Norfolk]], England, still used by the present royal family.\n\nThe main road is Sandringham Road which runs more or less north-south. At the northern end, [[Kingsland, New Zealand|Kingsland]] is located near the [[Eden Park|Eden Park stadium]]. Sandringham Village is located at the southern end of Sandringham Road just before it connects with Mount Albert Road. The top New Zealand [[Association football|football]] club [[Central United]] play at the [[Kiwitea Street|Kiwitea Street Stadium]] in Sandringham. The local Secondary schools are [[Mount Albert Grammar School]], [[Marist College, New Zealand|Marist College]] and [[St Peter's College, Auckland|St Peter's College]].\n\n==History==\nThe Sandringham suburb began as a small farming settlement known as Cabbage Tree Swamp, named for the prevalence of ''[[Cabbage tree (New Zealand)|cordyline australis]]'' and the area's predisposition to flooding. The first European settlers in the area were mainly engaged in dairy farming or growing produce. By 1862, there were sixteen properties along what was then Cabbage Tree Swamp Road.<ref>{{cite news|title=Public Notification|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=DSC18620429.2.2.5|accessdate=29 March 2011|newspaper=Daily Southern Cross|date=29 April 1862}}</ref> In 1877, Cabbage Tree Swamp residents successfully lobbied to have the road's name changed to Kingsland Road.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Dick|title=In Old Mount Albert|year=1983|publisher=Southern Cross Book|location=Auckland, NZ|edition=2nd enlarged|page=41}}</ref> The road and suburb were renamed again as Edendale in 1916, and finally as Sandringham in 1929.\n\nThrough the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the suburb grew slowly and remained mostly farmland and scrub. There was no water supply in the district by 1900<ref>{{cite news|title=Old Man Burned To Death|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC19000123.2.17.3|accessdate=29 March 2011|newspaper=The Colonist|date=23 January 1900|page=4}}</ref> and by 1924 the area was still without gas or electricity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories of Mt Albert|year=1999|publisher=Auckland City Libraries|location=Auckland, NZ|editor=Patsy Burton and Alison Fitzpatrick|page=7}}</ref> Flooding was a major problem in the area. Eden Park and Gribblehurst Park became lakes during heavy winter rain, as did the reserve land east of Sandringham Shops. After a heavy storm in 1919, locals recalled boating through the streets and floodwaters \"flowing through the bay windows\" of one low-lying house.<ref>{{cite news|title=[no title]|newspaper=Sandringham Star|date=May 1961|page=1}}</ref> Substantial development only came around 1925 with the construction of the tramline, resulting in the core of what is now the Sandringham Shopping Centre being built. Rows of evenly spaced streets spread on each side of Sandringham road and were lined with wooden [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] houses. Large parts of the area remained undeveloped however, and services such as telephone, electricity and gas were only provided at a minimum level.\n\nOver the following decades more retail buildings were constructed. Large-scale subdivision of farmland began in the 1920s, and [[California Bungalow|Californian bungalows]] began to dominate the architecture of the area. Around 1927, the Mayfair Cinema was built, an elegant building in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Neo-Greek]] style; it was demolished in the early 1990s. The Sandringham Service Station, still operating in 2011, was first erected by Sydney Waring in 1929.<ref name=\"Truttman 2008 24\">{{cite web|last=Truttman|first=Lisa|title=Sandringham Shopping Centre: character heritage study|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/district/updates/t132b/Sandringhamshoppingcentrecharacterstudy.pdf|publisher=Auckland City Council|accessdate=29 March 2011 |author2=Matthews & Matthews Architects Ltd |author3=R.A. Skidmore Urban Design Ltd |page=24|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, what little remained of the farmland was developed as [[state housing]]. Sandringham Village is a virtually intact example of an interwar suburban shopping precinct.\n\nAs part of the [[Eden (New Zealand electorate)|Eden electorate]], Sandringham became a [[Prohibition|no-licence]] area from 1909 until 2000, meaning that alcohol could not be sold. As a result, there are no public houses in Sandringham. Plans to build a tavern at 597 Sandringham Road were successfully opposed by residents in 2001.<ref name=\"Truttman 2008 24\"/>\n\n===Local Government===\nSandringham falls within the [[Mount Albert (New Zealand electorate)|Mt Albert]] constituency for the national [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Electorate Boundaries|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/mapping/|publisher=Elections New Zealand}}</ref>  In terms of local government, Sandringham comes under the [[Albert-Eden Local Board]],  of [[Auckland Council]].

Nearby are gentrified [[Mt Eden]], [[Kingsland, Auckland|Kingsland]], and Chinese-influenced Balmoral. The village has a post office, chemists, medical and legal practices, real estate agencies and a community centre.\n\nThe village architecture is art deco influenced, and most has survived, except the original village cinema.

At the northern end, [[Kingsland, New Zealand|Kingsland]] is located near the [[Eden Park|Eden Park stadium]]. Sandringham Village is located at the southern end of Sandringham Road just before it connects with Mount Albert Road.

The first European settlers in the area were mainly engaged in dairy farming or growing produce. By 1862, there were sixteen properties along what was then Cabbage Tree Swamp Road.<ref>{{cite news|title=Public Notification|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=DSC18620429.2.2.5|accessdate=29 March 2011|newspaper=Daily Southern Cross|date=29 April 1862}}</ref> In 1877, Cabbage Tree Swamp residents successfully lobbied to have the road's name changed to Kingsland Road.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Dick|title=In Old Mount Albert|year=1983|publisher=Southern Cross Book|location=Auckland, NZ|edition=2nd enlarged|page=41}}</ref> The road and suburb were renamed again as Edendale in 1916, and finally as Sandringham in 1929.\n\nThrough the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the suburb grew slowly and remained mostly farmland and scrub. There was no water supply in the district by 1900<ref>{{cite news|title=Old Man Burned To Death|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC19000123.2.17.3|accessdate=29 March 2011|newspaper=The Colonist|date=23 January 1900|page=4}}</ref> and by 1924 the area was still without gas or electricity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Memories of Mt Albert|year=1999|publisher=Auckland City Libraries|location=Auckland, NZ|editor=Patsy Burton and Alison Fitzpatrick|page=7}}</ref> Flooding was a major problem in the area. Eden Park and Gribblehurst Park became lakes during heavy winter rain, as did the reserve land east of Sandringham Shops. After a heavy storm in 1919, locals recalled boating through the streets and floodwaters \"flowing through the bay windows\" of one low-lying house.<ref>{{cite news|title=[no title]|newspaper=Sandringham Star|date=May 1961|page=1}}</ref> Substantial development only came around 1925 with the construction of the tramline, resulting in the core of what is now the Sandringham Shopping Centre being built. Rows of evenly spaced streets spread on each side of Sandringham road and were lined with wooden [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] houses. Large parts of the area remained undeveloped however, and services such as telephone, electricity and gas were only provided at a minimum level.\n\nOver the following decades more retail buildings were constructed. Large-scale subdivision of farmland began in the 1920s, and [[California Bungalow|Californian bungalows]] began to dominate the architecture of the area. Around 1927, the Mayfair Cinema was built, an elegant building in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Neo-Greek]] style; it was demolished in the early 1990s. The Sandringham Service Station, still operating in 2011, was first erected by Sydney Waring in 1929.<ref name=\"Truttman 2008 24\">{{cite web|last=Truttman|first=Lisa|title=Sandringham Shopping Centre: character heritage study|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/district/updates/t132b/Sandringhamshoppingcentrecharacterstudy.pdf|publisher=Auckland City Council|accessdate=29 March 2011 |author2=Matthews & Matthews Architects Ltd |author3=R.A.

Sandringham Village is a virtually intact example of an interwar suburban shopping precinct.\n\nAs part of the [[Eden (New Zealand electorate)|Eden electorate]], Sandringham became a [[Prohibition|no-licence]] area from 1909 until 2000, meaning that alcohol could not be sold. As a result, there are no public houses in Sandringham.

He plays one of Lucas Barton's goons (one of three competitors at a video game competition) and had no lines. He worked as a child actor in the early 1990s, often playing roles much younger than his chronological age, and as late as 2002 he was still playing teenagers while in his mid-20s. He appeared in a variety of [[commercials]] and TV and movie roles, working opposite such actors as [[Chuck Norris]] (''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]''), [[Roseanne Barr]] (''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''), and [[Tracey Ullman]] (''[[Tracey Takes On...]]''). Eventually, he was cast as the lead in the FOX TV series ''[[Great Scott! (TV series)|Great Scott!]]'', which was canceled five weeks later.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nDuring many of his auditions, Maguire found himself auditioning for roles opposite another rising actor, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. The pair quickly became friends and made an informal pact to help each other get parts in their movies/TV shows/other projects. For example, both auditioned for the same part in the [[Parenthood (1990 TV series)|1990 TV series]] based on the 1989 comedy ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]''. DiCaprio was cast, and Maguire later got a guest role at least partly on DiCaprio's recommendation.

He plays one of Lucas Barton's goons (one of three competitors at a video game competition) and had no lines. He worked as a child actor in the early 1990s, often playing roles much younger than his chronological age, and as late as 2002 he was still playing teenagers while in his mid-20s. He appeared in a variety of [[commercials]] and TV and movie roles, working opposite such actors as [[Chuck Norris]] (''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]''), [[Roseanne Barr]] (''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''), and [[Tracey Ullman]] (''[[Tracey Takes On...]]''). Eventually, he was cast as the lead in the FOX TV series ''[[Great Scott! (TV series)|Great Scott!]]'', which was canceled five weeks later.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nDuring many of his auditions, Maguire found himself auditioning for roles opposite another rising actor, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. The pair quickly became friends and made an informal pact to help each other get parts in their movies/TV shows/other projects. For example, both auditioned for the same part in the [[Parenthood (1990 TV series)|1990 TV series]] based on the 1989 comedy ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]''. DiCaprio was cast, and Maguire later got a guest role at least partly on DiCaprio's recommendation. The same scenario played itself out during casting for the 1993 movie ''[[This Boy's Life (film)|This Boy's Life]]'' (featuring [[Robert De Niro]] as the lead); DiCaprio got the main teen role (coincidentally, the character was named \"Toby\") and Maguire got a part as one of Toby's friends.<ref>Conversations with Leonardo di Caprio September 23, 2014, SAG Foundation</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1990s, he was working steadily but was also becoming involved in the hard-partying lifestyle of some of his fellow young actors. In 1995, he requested director [[Allan Moyle]] to release him from his part in the movie ''[[Empire Records]]''. Moyle agreed, and all of Maguire's scenes were deleted from the final film.<ref name=\"AskMen1\">[http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_150/150c_tobey_maguire.html Men of the Week in Entertainment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007175339/http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_150/150c_tobey_maguire.html |date=October 7, 2008 }}; retrieved May 14, 2007.</ref> Maguire then sought help for a [[alcoholism|drinking problem]] from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]; he has been sober ever since.<ref name=\"AA\">[http://www.addictioninfo.org/articles/1463/1/Tobey-Maguire-reveals-AA-meetings/Page1.html Tobey Maguire Reveals AA Meetings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190915/http://www.addictioninfo.org/articles/1463/1/Tobey-Maguire-reveals-AA-meetings/Page1.html |date=July 29, 2016 }}, published April 12, 2007; retrieved May 14, 2007.</ref>\n\nAs part of his recovery from alcoholism and learning to deal with his self-described \"addictive and compulsive nature\",<ref name=\"AA\" /> Maguire changed his career path slightly to obtain roles where he and DiCaprio would not always be in competition for the same part, and the move paid off when given the role of Paul Hood, a teenage boarding school student whose narration anchors the action, in [[Ang Lee]]'s 1997 film, ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]].''

It's not nearly operating on the same prescient level as, say, ''The Good Fight'', nor quite the radical re-imagining of fairy tales as advertised.
