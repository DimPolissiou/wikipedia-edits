It is the third film in the [[Home Alone (series)|''Home Alone'' series]] and the first not to feature actor [[Macaulay Culkin]] and the cast from the previous films, nor director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] and composer [[John Williams]]. The film is directed by [[Raja Gosnell]] (in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]), who served as the editor of both original films. It stars [[Alex D. Linz]] as Alex Pruitt, an 8-year-old child prodigy who defends his home from a dangerous band of criminals who work for a North Korean terrorist organization.\n\nThe film was followed by a [[television film|made-for-television]] sequel, ''[[Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House]]'', in 2002.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nThe movie opens to a scene in [[Hong Kong]], a city located in [[China]], a [[country]] located in [[East Asia]]. Peter Beaupre, Alice Ribbons, Burton Jernigan, and Earl Unger are four internationally wanted hitmen working for a North Korean terrorist organization. Having stolen a US$10 million missile-cloaking computer chip, the thieves put it inside a remote control car to sneak it past security at the  airport. However, a luggage mix-up occurs, causing a woman named Mrs. Hess to inadvertently take the thieves' bag containing the car, while returning home to Chicago. The four thieves arrive in Chicago and systematically search every house in Hess's suburban neighborhood to find the chip.\n\nMeanwhile, Alex Pruitt is given the remote control car by Hess for shoveling her driveway, but she lectures him for scratching in public. He returns home and removes his shirt to discover that he has [[chickenpox]], and therefore must stay out of school. The next day, Alex discovers the thieves while spying on his neighbors. He attaches a camera to the remote control car and uses it to spy on them, leading to the thieves chasing it when they spot it. Wondering what the thieves want with the toy car, Alex opens it and discovers the stolen chip. He informs the local Air Force Recruitment Center about the chip while asking if they can forward the information about the chip to the right authorities.\n\nThe thieves conclude that Alex has been watching them and decide to pursue him. As a snowstorm hits Chicago, the thieves block off the road to the house and Alice duct tapes Hess to a chair in her garage and leaves the door open. By this point, Alex has rigged his house with booby traps and prepares to set them off with his pet rat, Doris, and his brother's loud-mouthed parrot. After their numerous break-in attempts are foiled by Alex's traps, the thieves infiltrate the house and search for Alex. Alex flees to the attic and takes the [[dumbwaiter]] down to the basement, then runs outside and calls to Alice, Jernigan, and Unger. The thieves see Alex and notice a trampoline below them. Jernigan and Unger jump to pursue Alex, but the trampoline gives way and they fall into a frozen pool. Alice wriggles her way into the dumbwaiter chute but falls down to the basement because Alex removed the bottom.\n\nAlex rescues Hess and is cornered by Beaupre, but scares him off with a bubble gun resembling a [[Glock]]. Meanwhile, FBI agents arrive at Alex's siblings' school, after being tipped off by the recruitment center. Alex's family brings the agents to their house, where the police arrive and arrest Alice, Jernigan, and Unger. However, Beaupre flees to the snow fort in the backyard. The parrot drives the remote control car into the snow fort and threatens to light fireworks, which are lined around the inside. Beaupre offers a cracker, but the parrot demands two. Since he only has one, the parrot then lights the fireworks and flees. Beaupre is discovered and arrested.\n\nLater, Alex and his family celebrate with his father returning home from a business trip. Hess, who befriends Alex after he successfully rescues her, is there, along with the FBI and the police, while Alex's house is being repaired. Then the thieves are shown having their mugshot photos taken and they appear to have caught Alex's chickenpox.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alex D.

However, by 1994, Culkin was no longer acting. As a result, the idea was reworked, centering on a new cast of characters. It was filmed in [[Chicago]] and [[Evanston, Illinois]], with the airport scenes in the beginning of the film being shot at two different [[concourse]]s at [[O'Hare International Airport]].\n\n[[20th Century Fox Animation|Fox Family Films]] was the division of [[20th Century Fox]] responsible for the production on the film.<ref name=\"VarietyFoxRenamedToon\">{{cite news|last1=Petrikin|first1=Chris|title=Fox renamed that toon|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/fox-renamed-that-toon-1117467902/|accessdate=March 31, 2018|work=Variety|date=February 18, 1998}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Home Alone 3: Music From The Motion Picture\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = December 12, 1997\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Fox Music]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Home Alone (franchise)|Home Alone]]\n | type       = film score\n | prev_title = [[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (soundtrack)|Home Alone 2]]\n | prev_year  = 1992\n | title      = Home Alone 3\n | year       = 1997\n | next_title =\n | next_year  =\n}}\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Track listing\n| extra_column = Artist(s)\n| title1   = My Town\n| extra1   = Cartoon Boyfriend\n| length1  = 3:18\n| title2   = All I Wanted Was a Skateboard\n| extra2   = [[Super Deluxe (band)|Super Deluxe]]\n| length2  = 2:34\n| title3   = I Want It All\n| extra3   = [[Dance Hall Crashers]]\n| length3  = 3:19\n| title4   = [[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\n| extra4   = [[Chuck Berry]]\n| length4  = 2:20\n| title5   = [[School Days (Chuck Berry song)|School Day (Ring!

However, by 1994, Culkin was no longer acting. As a result, the idea was reworked, centering on a new cast of characters. It was filmed in [[Chicago]] and [[Evanston, Illinois]], with the airport scenes in the beginning of the film being shot at two different [[concourse]]s at [[O'Hare International Airport]].\n\n[[20th Century Fox Animation|Fox Family Films]] was the division of [[20th Century Fox]] responsible for the production on the film.<ref name=\"VarietyFoxRenamedToon\">{{cite news|last1=Petrikin|first1=Chris|title=Fox renamed that toon|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/fox-renamed-that-toon-1117467902/|accessdate=March 31, 2018|work=Variety|date=February 18, 1998}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Home Alone 3: Music From The Motion Picture\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = December 12, 1997\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Fox Music]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Home Alone (franchise)|Home Alone]]\n | type       = film score\n | prev_title = [[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (soundtrack)|Home Alone 2]]\n | prev_year  = 1992\n | title      = Home Alone 3\n | year       = 1997\n | next_title =\n | next_year  =\n}}\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Track listing\n| extra_column = Artist(s)\n| title1   = My Town\n| extra1   = Cartoon Boyfriend\n| length1  = 3:18\n| title2   = All I Wanted Was a Skateboard\n| extra2   = [[Super Deluxe (band)|Super Deluxe]]\n| length2  = 2:34\n| title3   = I Want It All\n| extra3   = [[Dance Hall Crashers]]\n| length3  = 3:19\n| title4   = [[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\n| extra4   = [[Chuck Berry]]\n| length4  = 2:20\n| title5   = [[School Days (Chuck Berry song)|School Day (Ring!
