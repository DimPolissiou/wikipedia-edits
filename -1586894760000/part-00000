[[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s 23,000 Frenchmen defeated an attack of 28,000 [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrians]] under [[Feldzeugmeister|General of the Artillery]] [[Jozsef Alvinczi]], ending Austria's fourth and final attempt to relieve the [[Siege of Mantua (1796-1797)|Siege of Mantua]]. Rivoli further demonstrated Napoleon's brilliance as a military commander and led to the French consolidation of northern Italy.\n\n==Forces==\nSee [[Rivoli 1797 Campaign Order of Battle]].\n\n==Prelude==\nAlvinczi's plan was to rush and overwhelm [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Barth\u00e9lemy Joubert]] in the mountains east of [[Lake Garda]] by concentrating 28,000 men in five separate columns, and thereby gain access to the open country north of [[Mantua]] where Austrian superior numbers would be able to defeat Bonaparte's smaller [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]].  Alvinczi attacked Joubert's 10,000 men on 12 January. However Joubert held him off and was subsequently joined by [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and, at 2 am on 14 January, by Bonaparte, who brought up elements of [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]]'s division to support Joubert's efforts to form a defensive line on favorable ground just north of Rivoli on the Trambasore Heights. The battle would be a contest between Alvinczi's efforts to concentrate his dispersed columns versus the arrival of French reinforcements.\n\n==Battle==\nThe morning of Saturday 14 January found Alvinczi engaging the division of Joubert. He had united three Austrian columns between [[Caprino Veronese|Caprino]] on the right and the chapel of San Marco on the left; the brigade of [[Franz Joseph, Marquis de Lusignan|Franz Josef de Lusignan]] was advancing to the north of [[Monte Baldo]]; and the troops of [[Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich]] and [[Josef Philipp Vukassovich]] were pouring down the roads on either side of the [[Adige]]. Before daybreak as the French were moving on the road from [[Rivoli Veronese|Rivoli]] to Incanale Joubert attacked and drove the Austrians from the chapel of San Marco.<ref>Reginald George Burton (2010). Napoleon's Campaigns in Italy 1796\u20131797 & 1800, p. 84. {{ISBN|978-0-85706-356-4}}</ref>\n\nAt 9 a.m., the Austrian brigades of Samuel Koblos and [[Anton Lipthay de Kisfalud|Anton Lipthay]] counterattacked the French forces on the Trambasore Heights. Another column under Prince [[Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen|Heinrich of Reuss-Plauen]] attempted to turn the French right via the Rivoli gorge. Meanwhile, on the French right flank, Vukassovich had advanced down the east bank of the Adige and had established batteries opposite Osteria. The fire of his guns and the pressure from Quosdanovich forced the French out of the village of Osteria and onto the Rivoli plateau. By about 11 a.m. the position of Bonaparte was becoming desperate: an Austrian column under Lusignan was cutting off his retreat south of Rivoli. To reopen his line of retreat Bonaparte turned to Massena's 18th [[Demi-brigade]] (\"the Brave\"), newly arrived from [[Lake Garda]]. Meanwhile, Alvinczi was on the Trambasore Heights urging his victorious battalions forward, though they were unformed by combat and rough terrain.\n\nWith the 18th dispatched to check Lusignan, Bonaparte turned all his attention to  Quosdanovich. He understood the defeat of this column was the key to the battle. Unfortunately the French had very few reserves left and mostly had to accomplish this with troops already at hand. Making the best of interior lines and his advantage in artillery, Bonaparte thinned out Joubert's lines facing the Austrians frontally at the Trambasore Heights as much as possible and concentrated them before the gorge. A battery of 15 French guns were massed and poured [[canister shot]] at point blank range into the advancing Austrian column that was emerging from the gorge. This devastating firepower struck first on the advancing Austrian [[dragoon]]s who broke and stampeded through their own infantry causing mass chaos. At this juncture the brigade of [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]] assaulted the column frontally while Joubert laid down heavy flanking fire from San Marco. Here [[Antoine Charles Louis de Lasalle|Antoine Charles de Lasalle]] with just 26 horseman of the 22nd Horse [[Chasseur]]s charged into the melee. Lasalle's men captured a whole Austrian battalion and seized 5 enemy flags.\nIn the centre the battle was not yet won; [[Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko|Joseph Ocskay]] renewed his attack from San Marco and drove back the brigade of [[Honor\u00e9 Vial]]. But at midday French cavalry under [[Joachim Murat]] charged the flanks of Ocskay's troops, which were driven back to the positions they occupied in the morning.<ref>Reginald George Burton (2010). Napoleon's Campaigns in Italy 1796\u20131797 & 1800, p. 85. {{ISBN|978-0-85706-356-4}}</ref>\n\nQuosdanovich realized he could not force the defile and ordered his troops to fall back out of artillery range.

The Battle of Rivoli was Bonaparte's greatest victory at the time. After that he turned his attention to [[Giovanni Marchese di Provera|Giovanni di Provera]]. On 13 January his corps (9,000 men) had crossed north of [[Legnano]] and driven straight for the relief of [[Mantua]] which was besieged by French forces under [[Jean-Mathieu-Philibert S\u00e9rurier|Jean S\u00e9rurier]]. At night on 15 January Provera sent a message to [[Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser]] to break out in a concerted attack. On 16 January, when Wurmser attacked he was driven back into Mantua by S\u00e9rurier. The Austrians were attacked from the front by Mass\u00e9na (who had force marched from Rivoli) and from the rear by the division of [[Pierre Augereau]], and were thus forced to surrender the entire force. The Austrian army in [[North Italy]] had ceased to exist. On 2 February Mantua surrendered with its garrison of 16,000 men, all that remained of an army of 30,000. The troops marched out with the 'honours of war', and laid down their arms. Wurmser with his staff and an escort were allowed to go free. The remainder were sent to Austria after swearing an oath to not serve against the French for a year, 1,500 guns were found in the fortress.<ref>Reginald George Burton (2010).

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s 23,000 Frenchmen defeated an attack of 28,000 [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrians]] under [[Feldzeugmeister|General of the Artillery]] [[Jozsef Alvinczi]], ending Austria's fourth and final attempt to relieve the [[Siege of Mantua (1796-1797)|Siege of Mantua]]. Rivoli further demonstrated Napoleon's brilliance as a military commander and led to the French consolidation of northern Italy.\n\n==Forces==\nSee [[Rivoli 1797 Campaign Order of Battle]].\n\n==Prelude==\nAlvinczi's plan was to rush and overwhelm [[Barth\u00e9lemy Catherine Joubert|Barth\u00e9lemy Joubert]] in the mountains east of [[Lake Garda]] by concentrating 28,000 men in five separate columns, and thereby gain access to the open country north of [[Mantua]] where Austrian superior numbers would be able to defeat Bonaparte's smaller [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]].  Alvinczi attacked Joubert's 10,000 men on 12 January. However Joubert held him off and was subsequently joined by [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] and, at 2 am on 14 January, by Bonaparte, who brought up elements of [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]]'s division to support Joubert's efforts to form a defensive line on favorable ground just north of Rivoli on the Trambasore Heights. The battle would be a contest between Alvinczi's efforts to concentrate his dispersed columns versus the arrival of French reinforcements.\n\n==Battle==\nThe morning of Saturday 14 January found Alvinczi engaging the division of Joubert. He had united three Austrian columns between [[Caprino Veronese|Caprino]] on the right and the chapel of San Marco on the left; the brigade of [[Franz Joseph, Marquis de Lusignan|Franz Josef de Lusignan]] was advancing to the north of [[Monte Baldo]]; and the troops of [[Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich]] and [[Josef Philipp Vukassovich]] were pouring down the roads on either side of the [[Adige]]. Before daybreak as the French were moving on the road from [[Rivoli Veronese|Rivoli]] to Incanale Joubert attacked and drove the Austrians from the chapel of San Marco.<ref>Reginald George Burton (2010). Napoleon's Campaigns in Italy 1796\u20131797 & 1800, p. 84. {{ISBN|978-0-85706-356-4}}</ref>\n\nAt 9 a.m., the Austrian brigades of Samuel Koblos and [[Anton Lipthay de Kisfalud|Anton Lipthay]] counterattacked the French forces on the Trambasore Heights. Another column under Prince [[Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen|Heinrich of Reuss-Plauen]] attempted to turn the French right via the Rivoli gorge. Meanwhile, on the French right flank, Vukassovich had advanced down the east bank of the Adige and had established batteries opposite Osteria. The fire of his guns and the pressure from Quosdanovich forced the French out of the village of Osteria and onto the Rivoli plateau. By about 11 a.m. the position of Bonaparte was becoming desperate: an Austrian column under Lusignan was cutting off his retreat south of Rivoli. To reopen his line of retreat Bonaparte turned to Massena's 18th [[Demi-brigade]] (\"the Brave\"), newly arrived from [[Lake Garda]]. Meanwhile, Alvinczi was on the Trambasore Heights urging his victorious battalions forward, though they were unformed by combat and rough terrain.\n\nWith the 18th dispatched to check Lusignan, Bonaparte turned all his attention to  Quosdanovich. He understood the defeat of this column was the key to the battle. Unfortunately the French had very few reserves left and mostly had to accomplish this with troops already at hand. Making the best of interior lines and his advantage in artillery, Bonaparte thinned out Joubert's lines facing the Austrians frontally at the Trambasore Heights as much as possible and concentrated them before the gorge. A battery of 15 French guns were massed and poured [[canister shot]] at point blank range into the advancing Austrian column that was emerging from the gorge. This devastating firepower struck first on the advancing Austrian [[dragoon]]s who broke and stampeded through their own infantry causing mass chaos. At this juncture the brigade of [[Charles Leclerc (general)|Charles Leclerc]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} assaulted the column frontally while Joubert laid down heavy flanking fire from San Marco. Here [[Antoine Charles Louis de Lasalle|Antoine Charles de Lasalle]] with just 26 horseman of the 22nd Horse [[Chasseur]]s charged into the melee. Lasalle's men captured a whole Austrian battalion and seized 5 enemy flags.\nIn the centre the battle was not yet won; [[Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko|Joseph Ocskay]] renewed his attack from San Marco and drove back the brigade of [[Honor\u00e9 Vial]]. But at midday French cavalry under [[Joachim Murat]] charged the flanks of Ocskay's troops, which were driven back to the positions they occupied in the morning.<ref>Reginald George Burton (2010). Napoleon's Campaigns in Italy 1796\u20131797 & 1800, p. 85. {{ISBN|978-0-85706-356-4}}</ref>\n\nQuosdanovich realized he could not force the defile and ordered his troops to fall back out of artillery range. Meanwhile, while Lusignan was being engaged frontally by the brigade of [[Guillaume Brune]], the division of [[Gabriel Venance Rey|Gabriel Rey]], coming up from [[Castelnuovo del Garda|Castelnuovo]] and the brigade of [[Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno|Claude Victor]] (reserve) began to arrive.

{"title_page": "Muwaqqit", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n{{use British English|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Dar al-Muwaqqit.jpg|thumb|[[Dar al-Muwaqqit]] (\"house of the ''muwaqqit''\") in the [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]], [[Fez, Morocco]]]]\n\n{{EngvarB|date=January 2020}}\nIn [[Islamic history]], a '''''muwaqqit''''' ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0648\u0642\u062a}}, more rarely '''''miqati''''') was an astronomer tasked with the [[timekeeping]] and the regulation of [[Salah times|prayer times]] in an Islamic institution like a [[mosque]] or a [[madrasa]]. Unlike the [[muazzin]] (reciter of the [[Adhan|call to prayer]]) who was usually selected for his piety and voice, a ''muwaqqit'' was selected for his knowledge and skill in astronomy. Not all mosques had a ''muwaqqit''. The office of a ''muwaqqit'' was first recorded in the late 13th century in the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] and then spread to various parts of the [[Islamic world]]. Even then, many major mosques only relied on muazzins to determine prayer times using traditional methods. The lack of historical sources and research makes it difficult to ascertain the specific functions and roles of the ''muwaqqit''. There is uncertainty among [[history of science|historians of science]] whether the ''muwaqqit'' was a specialised office whose holder dealt exclusively with astronomical matters, or if it was part of a broader role of a teacher (''mudarris'') who also worked and taught in other fields.\n\nDuring its peak in the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries, prominent scientists held the post of ''muwaqqit''. For example, [[Ibn al-Shatir]] (1304\u20131375) and [[Shams al-Din Abu Abd Allah al-Khalili|Shams al-Din al-Khalili]] (1320\u20131380) formed a team of ''muwaqqits'' in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of Damascus. Syria and Egypt were the major centres of ''muwaqqit'' activity in these centuries, while the office spread to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Hejaz]], [[Tunis]], and Yemen. The office continued to be recorded up to the nineteenth century, although ''muwaqqits'' produced fewer treatises and instruments than in earlier times. Today, mosques use prayer time-tables produced by religious or scientific agencies or clocks programmed for this purpose. These allow for the exact determination of prayer times without the specialised skills of a ''muwaqqit''.\n\n== Background ==\nMuslims observe [[salah]], the daily ritual prayer, at prescribed times based on the [[hadith]] or the tradition of [[Muhammad]] (c. 570\u2013632). There are five obligatory prayers each day, whose permitted times are limited by daily astronomical phenomena.{{sfn|Wensinck|1993|pp=26\u201327}} For example, the time for the [[Maghrib prayer]] starts after [[sunset]] and ends when the red [[twilight]] has disappeared.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=150}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1993|p=27}} Because the start and end times for prayers are related to the solar [[diurnal motion]], they vary throughout the year and depend on the local latitude and longitude when expressed in [[Time zone|local time]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=289}} The term ''miqat'' in the sense of \"time of a prayer\" is attested to in the [[Quran]] and hadith, although the Quran does not explicitly define those times.{{sfn|Wensinck|1993|p=27}}{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}} The term ''<nowiki/>'ilm al-miqat'' refers to the study of determining prayer times based on the position of the Sun and the stars in the sky and has been recorded since the early days of Islam.{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}}\n\nBefore the ''muwaqqits'' appeared, the [[muazzin]] had been the office most associated with the regulation of the prayer times. The post can be traced back to Muhammad's lifetime and its role and history are well documented. The main duty of a muazzin is to recite the [[adhan|call to prayer]] (''adhan'') to announce the beginning of a prayer time. Before the use of a [[loudspeaker]], this was usually done from the top of a [[minaret]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}} The minaret provided the muazzin with a vantage point to observe phenomena such as sunset which marks the start time of Maghrib.{{sfn|King|1996|p=289}}\n\n== Duties ==\n[[File:Quadrant pivotant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], often produced and used by the ''muwaqqits''.]]\nThe main duty of the ''muwaqqit'' was timekeeping and the regulation of daily prayer times in mosques, madrasas, or other institutions using astronomy and other exact sciences.{{sfn|King|1983|p=534}} At its zenith in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, major mosques often employed prominent astronomers as ''muwaqqits''. In addition to regulating prayer times, they wrote treatises on astronomy, especially on timekeeping and the use of related instruments such as [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]s and [[sundials]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}}{{sfn|King|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=130}} They were also responsible for other religious matters related to their astronomical expertise, such as the keeping of the [[Islamic calendar]] and the determination of the [[qibla]] (the direction to Mecca used for prayers).{{sfn|King|1998|p=159}}\n\n[[David A. King (historian)|David A. King]], a historian of astronomy, presents the ''muwaqqit'' as a specialised profession, a mosque astronomer \"in the service of Islam\" who produced a large body of treatises and instruments, even though their work did not necessarily influence the practices of the muazzins and the [[faqih|jurists]] who largely used traditional methods. The knowledge of a ''muwaqqit'' was passed to his students who specifically intended to be the next generation of the profession. King's description is based on his research into the [[primary source|primary works]] of the ''muwaqqits'' and contemporary Islamic legal texts.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=130}} On the other hand, a historian of science [[Sonja Brentjes]] proposes that the ''muwaqqit'' is to be seen as \"only one facet of another persona, mostly that of a ''[[mudarris]]'' (teacher)\".{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=130\u2013131, 134}} The astronomical keeping of prayer times as well as the construction and maintenance of a mosque's astronomical instruments were just a normal part of academic activities in Muslim cities of the time. Someone titled ''muwaqqit'' was also likely to be highly learned in other disciplines, including [[Fiqh|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. The discipline of ''ilm al-miqat'' (the science of timekeeping) was widely learned and not only by someone who aspired to be a ''muwaqqit''; a muazzin could well have had an identical education as a ''muwaqqit''.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=145}} Brentjes' assessment is based on [[Secondary source|secondary]] biographies of the ''muwaqqits'' during the Mamluk era, including the works of [[Al-Sakhawi]], a prominent 15th-century author and [[Hadith studies|hadith scholar]].{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=130}} Both King and Brentjes say that it is difficult to ascertain the role of the ''muwaqqits'' due to the lack of research and historical sources on the topic.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=145}}{{sfn|King|1998|p=162}}\n\n=== Salary ===\nLittle information is available about the salary of the ''muwaqqits''. King could only provide several figures given in ''waqfiyyas'' or financial documents of mosques in fifteenth and sixteenth century Cairo. The Mosque of the Emir of Qanim paid a ''muwaqqit'' 200 [[dirham]] (silver coin) per month\u2014compared to 900 for an imam, 500 for a ''[[khatib]]'', 200 for a muazzin and 300 for a servant mentioned in the same document. Other figures King found were cumulative: 1400 dirham divided among about 16 muazzins and ''muwaqqits'', and 600 dirham divided among an unknown number of ''muwaqqits''.{{sfn|King|1998|p=302}}{{sfn|King|1996|p=160}} According to Brentjes, these remunerations were relatively low, leading a ''muwaqqit'' to take up other jobs at the same time, including teaching.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=134\u2013135}} The data presented by King is limited to one city and does not cover mosques with prominent ''muwaqqits'', such as the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in Damascus.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=302\u2013303}}\n\n=== Relations with the muazzin ===\nThe responsibilities of a ''muwaqqit'' were related to those of the muazzins who announced the start time of a prayer by reciting the ''adhan''.{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}}{{sfn|Pedersen|1991|p=677}} Unlike the office of the ''muwaqqit'' which required special knowledge in astronomy, the muazzin were typically chosen for their piety and beautiful voice. Mosques did not always have ''muwaqqits''. Even major mosques often relied on a muazzin's traditional knowledge to determine prayer times.{{sfn|King|1983|p=534}} Brentjes speculates that the ''muwaqqit'' might have evolved from a specialised muazzin,{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=139}} and that there might not have been a clear delineation between the two offices.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=141}} Some celebrated ''muwaqqits'', including [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]] and [[Ibn al-Shatir]], were known to have once been muazzins, and many individuals held both offices simultaneously.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Le Caire mosqu\u00e9e Amr ibn al-As.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]] (today part of Cairo), where the official title of ''muwaqqit'' was first recorded.]]\nUnlike the muazzin whose history and origin has been well-studied, the origin of the ''muwaqqit'' is unclear. The earliest known record shows that the office already existed in the thirteenth century [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} According to King, the first ''muwaqqit'' known by name was Abu al-Hasan ali ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Sim'un (died 685 [[Hijri calendar|AH]] or 1286/1287 CE), a ''muwaqqit'' in the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]], Egypt for 30 years. His son Muhammad al-Wajih (died 701 H or 1301/1302 CE) and grandson Muhammad al-Majd also served as ''muwaqqit'' there.{{sfn|King|1996|p=298\u2013299}} At the same time, similar offices likely existed in [[Al-Andalus]] and the [[Maghreb]] with different names.{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} In [[Al-Andalus]], in the late 13th century, astronomers Ahmad and Husayn\u2014father and son from the ibn Baso family\u2014computed prayer times for the Great Mosque of [[Granada, Spain|Granada]]. Manuscripts refer to them with various titles, including ''al-muadhdhin al-mubarak'', ''al-imam al-mu'addil al-mubarak'', ''al-shaykh al-mu'addil'', ''amin al-awqat'', and ''muwaqqit''.{{sfn|King|1996|p=299}} The [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] employed the astronomer Muhammad al-Sanhaji ({{fl|c. 1307}}) in a similar position with the title ''al-mu'addil''.{{sfn|King|1996|p=300}} A manual of professions from around 1300 by the Egyptian author [[Ibn al-Ukhuwwa]] mentioned the post of the muazzin and its duties and requirements but did not mention the ''muwaqqit''.{{sfn|King|1983|p=534}}\n\n=== In the 14th and 15th centuries ===\n[[File:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Minaret of the Bride, Damascus, Holy Land, ca. 1895.jpg|thumb|The [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], a major centre of ''muwaqqit'' activity in the 14th and 15th centuries.]]\nIf the office of the ''muwaqqit'' indeed originated in Egypt, it soon spread to [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The [[Ibrahimi Mosque]] in [[Hebron]] employed the ''muwaqqit'' Ibrahim ibn Ahmad. In 1306, he made a copy of an astronomical work by Nasir al-Din ibn Sim'un (died 1337), a member of the same family as the early ''muwaqqits'' in Fustat.{{sfn|King|1998|p=156}} Another ''muwaqqit'', [[Ibn al-Sarraj]] ({{fl|c. 1325}}), served in [[Aleppo]] where he designed and created various astronomical instruments and wrote treatises about their construction and use.{{sfn|King|1998|p=157}} \n\nStill in Syria, [[Ibn al-Shatir]] (1304\u20131375) led a team of ''muwaqqits'' in the [[Umayyad Mosque]], Damascus. He wrote two [[zij|''zij''es]] (astronomical tables) and made [[astrolabe]]s and [[sundial]]s. Apart from timekeeping, he also worked on [[planetary theory|planetary theories]] and wrote a treatise on the movements of the Sun, the moon, and the planets. He moved away from [[Ptolemaic model|Ptolemaic geocentrism]] and produced models which were still geocentric but were mathematically identical to those later proposed by [[Copernicus]] (1473 \u2013 1543).{{sfn|King|1998|p=157}}{{sfn|King|1996|p=306}} According to King, Ibn al-Shatir's works represent the \"culmination\" of planetary astronomy in the Islamic world.{{sfn|King|1998|p=157}} Ibn al-Shatir's colleague [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]] (1320\u20131380), a ''muwaqqit'' of the [[Yalbugha Mosque]] before joining the Umayyad Mosque, wrote prayer timetables for Damascus and tables for finding [[qibla]] (sacred directions) from any locality.{{sfn|King|1998|p=157}} The activities of the ''muwaqqits'' were not universally approved of by Islamic jurists. The [[qadi]] (judge) of Damascus [[Taj al-Din al-Subki]] denounced the ''muwaqqits'', whose ranks according to him were filled with astrologers (''munajjimun'') and magicians (''kuhhan'').{{sfn|King|1996|p=306\u2013307, 329 no. 8}} Astrological topics were inevitably read by astronomers of the time because they were often included in astronomy textbooks, and a few ''muwaqqits'' were recorded to have studied astrology.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=125}}\n\nBy the end of the fourteenth century, the activity of the ''muwaqqits'' had been recorded in Egypt, Syria, Palestine, the [[Hejaz]] (including [[Mecca]], and [[Medina]]), [[Tunis]], and [[Yemen]].{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=141, 144\u2013145}}{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} In the following century, the practice spread to [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} According to King, there is no evidence of ''muwaqqit'' activity in more easterly parts of the Islamic world, including Iraq, Iran, India and Central Asia.{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} According to Brentjes, it is possible that the discipline of ''miqat'' spread eastwards as part of an exchange prompted by trade, pilgrimage, and travel for knowledge even though no written evidence has been found.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=131, 144}}\n\nIn the fifteenth century, the center of ''muwaqqit'' activities shifted to Egypt, especially the [[Al-Azhar Mosque]] in Cairo, but their scientific outputs were reduced. Among the well-known ''muwaqqits'', [[Sibt al-Maridini]] (1423\u20131506) of Al-Azhar wrote treatises on timekeeping. He used simpler astronomical methods which became popular in Egypt and Syria. King speculates that he might have \"unwittingly\" contributed to the decline of astronomy in the Middle East because his works outcompeted more advanced texts. Other ''muwaqqits'' recorded in various mosques in fifteenth century Cairo include al-Kawm al-Rishi, 'Izz al-Din al-Wafa'i, al-Karadisi, and Abd al-Qadir al-Ajmawi. In addition, Egyptian astronomers Ibn al-Majdi and Ibn Abi al-Fath al-Sufi wrote extensively on religious timekeeping using more advanced astronomy than Sibt al-Maradani, but they were not formally attached to any mosque.{{sfn|King|1996|p=307}}\n\n=== After the fifteenth century ===\n[[File: Istanbul - Mesquita de Solim\u00e0 - Porta de Muvakkithane.JPG|thumb|The ''{{ill|muvakkithane|tr|muvakkithane}}'' (\"the lodge of the ''muwaqqit''\") of the [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]] in Istanbul]]\n''Ilm al-miqat'' and the activity of the ''muwaqqits'' ({{lang-tr|muvakkitler}}, singular {{lang|tr|muvakkit}}) continued into the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which conquered the Mamluks in 1517), although now they produced less scientific works compared to the zenith in the 14th and 15th centuries.{{sfn|King|1993|p=32}} Their work was overseen by the [[m\u00fcneccimba\u015f\u0131]] (chief imperial astrologer).{{sfn|Wishnitzer|2015|p=25}} The Turkish historian of science [[Ayd\u0131n Say\u0131l\u0131]] noted that many mosques in Istanbul have buildings or rooms called ''{{ill|muvakkithane|tr|muvakkithane|lt=muvakkithanes}}'' (\"lodge of the ''muwaqqit''\").{{sfn|King|1996|p=287}}{{sfn|King|1993|p=32}} Ottoman sultans and other notables built and patronized them as acts of piety and philanthropy. Such constructions became more common over time, peaking during the late eighteenth and the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Wishnitzer|2015|pp=25\u201326}} Ottoman astronomers produced prayer timetables in locations previously without them,{{sfn|King|1996|p=308}} and in the eighteenth century, the architect Salih Efendi wrote timekeeping tables which were popular among the ''muwaqqits'' of the imperial capital.{{sfn|King|1993|p=32}} As the use of mechanical clocks became common during the eighteenth century, the ''muwaqqits'' included them as part of their standard tools and many became experts at making and repairing clocks.{{sfn|Wishnitzer|2015|p=30}} Ottoman ''muwaqqits'' also adapted existing tables to the Ottoman convention of defining 12:00&nbsp;o'clock at sunset, requiring varying amounts of time shifts each day.{{sfn|King|1993|p=30}} Setting one's personal watch according to the clocks at ''muvakkithanes'' was a common practice after the spread of personal timepieces in late eighteenth century.{{sfn|Wishnitzer|2015|p=30}} Activities of the ''muwaqqits'' were also recorded in Syria (especially the Umayyad Mosque) and Egypt up to the nineteenth century.{{sfn|King|1996|p=308}}\n\n== Calculating prayer times today ==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 350\n | footer = ''Left'': A board with precalculated prayer times in a mosque.

Unlike the [[muazzin]] (reciter of the [[Adhan|call to prayer]]) who was usually selected for his piety and voice, a ''muwaqqit'' was selected for his knowledge and skill in astronomy. Not all mosques had a ''muwaqqit''. The office of a ''muwaqqit'' was first recorded in the late 13th century in the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] and then spread to various parts of the [[Islamic world]]. Even then, many major mosques only relied on muazzins to determine prayer times using traditional methods. The lack of historical sources and research makes it difficult to ascertain the specific functions and roles of the ''muwaqqit''. There is uncertainty among [[history of science|historians of science]] whether the ''muwaqqit'' was a specialised office whose holder dealt exclusively with astronomical matters, or if it was part of a broader role of a teacher (''mudarris'') who also worked and taught in other fields.\n\nDuring its peak in the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries, prominent scientists held the post of ''muwaqqit''. For example, [[Ibn al-Shatir]] (1304\u20131375) and [[Shams al-Din Abu Abd Allah al-Khalili|Shams al-Din al-Khalili]] (1320\u20131380) formed a team of ''muwaqqits'' in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of Damascus. Syria and Egypt were the major centres of ''muwaqqit'' activity in these centuries, while the office spread to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Hejaz]], [[Tunis]], and Yemen. The office continued to be recorded up to the nineteenth century, although ''muwaqqits'' produced fewer treatises and instruments than in earlier times. Today, mosques use prayer time-tables produced by religious or scientific agencies or clocks programmed for this purpose. These allow for the exact determination of prayer times without the specialised skills of a ''muwaqqit''.\n\n== Background ==\nMuslims observe [[salah]], the daily ritual prayer, at prescribed times based on the [[hadith]] or the tradition of [[Muhammad]] (c. 570\u2013632). There are five obligatory prayers each day, whose permitted times are limited by daily astronomical phenomena.{{sfn|Wensinck|1993|pp=26\u201327}} For example, the time for the [[Maghrib prayer]] starts after [[sunset]] and ends when the red [[twilight]] has disappeared.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=150}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1993|p=27}} Because the start and end times for prayers are related to the solar [[diurnal motion]], they vary throughout the year and depend on the local latitude and longitude when expressed in [[Time zone|local time]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=289}} The term ''miqat'' in the sense of \"time of a prayer\" is attested to in the [[Quran]] and hadith, although the Quran does not explicitly define those times.{{sfn|Wensinck|1993|p=27}}{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}} The term ''<nowiki/>'ilm al-miqat'' refers to the study of determining prayer times based on the position of the Sun and the stars in the sky and has been recorded since the early days of Islam.{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}}\n\nBefore the ''muwaqqits'' appeared, the [[muazzin]] had been the office most associated with the regulation of the prayer times. The post can be traced back to Muhammad's lifetime and its role and history are well documented. The main duty of a muazzin is to recite the [[adhan|call to prayer]] (''adhan'') to announce the beginning of a prayer time. Before the use of a [[loudspeaker]], this was usually done from the top of a [[minaret]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}} The minaret provided the muazzin with a vantage point to observe phenomena such as sunset which marks the start time of Maghrib.{{sfn|King|1996|p=289}}\n\n== Duties ==\n[[File:Quadrant pivotant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], often produced and used by the ''muwaqqits''.]]\nThe main duty of the ''muwaqqit'' was timekeeping and the regulation of daily prayer times in mosques, madrasas, or other institutions using astronomy and other exact sciences.{{sfn|King|1983|p=534}} At its zenith in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, major mosques often employed prominent astronomers as ''muwaqqits''. In addition to regulating prayer times, they wrote treatises on astronomy, especially on timekeeping and the use of related instruments such as [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]s and [[sundials]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}}{{sfn|King|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=130}} They were also responsible for other religious matters related to their astronomical expertise, such as the keeping of the [[Islamic calendar]] and the determination of the [[qibla]] (the direction to Mecca used for prayers).{{sfn|King|1998|p=159}}\n\n[[David A. King (historian)|David A. King]], a historian of astronomy, presents the ''muwaqqit'' as a specialised profession, a mosque astronomer \"in the service of Islam\" who produced a large body of treatises and instruments, even though their work did not necessarily influence the practices of the muazzins and the [[faqih|jurists]] who largely used traditional methods. The knowledge of a ''muwaqqit'' was passed to his students who specifically intended to be the next generation of the profession. King's description is based on his research into the [[primary source|primary works]] of the ''muwaqqits'' and contemporary Islamic legal texts.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=130}} On the other hand, a historian of science [[Sonja Brentjes]] proposes that the ''muwaqqit'' is to be seen as \"only one facet of another persona, mostly that of a ''[[mudarris]]'' (teacher)\".{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=130\u2013131, 134}} The astronomical keeping of prayer times as well as the construction and maintenance of a mosque's astronomical instruments were just a normal part of academic activities in Muslim cities of the time. Someone titled ''muwaqqit'' was also likely to be highly learned in other disciplines, including [[Fiqh|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. The discipline of ''ilm al-miqat'' (the science of timekeeping) was widely learned and not only by someone who aspired to be a ''muwaqqit''; a muazzin could well have had an identical education as a ''muwaqqit''.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=145}} Brentjes' assessment is based on [[Secondary source|secondary]] biographies of the ''muwaqqits'' during the Mamluk era, including the works of [[Al-Sakhawi]], a prominent 15th-century author and [[Hadith studies|hadith scholar]].{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=130}} Both King and Brentjes say that it is difficult to ascertain the role of the ''muwaqqits'' due to the lack of research and historical sources on the topic.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=145}}{{sfn|King|1998|p=162}}\n\n=== Salary ===\nLittle information is available about the salary of the ''muwaqqits''. King could only provide several figures given in ''waqfiyyas'' or financial documents of mosques in fifteenth and sixteenth century Cairo. The Mosque of the Emir of Qanim paid a ''muwaqqit'' 200 [[dirham]] (silver coin) per month\u2014compared to 900 for an imam, 500 for a ''[[khatib]]'', 200 for a muazzin and 300 for a servant mentioned in the same document. Other figures King found were cumulative: 1400 dirham divided among about 16 muazzins and ''muwaqqits'', and 600 dirham divided among an unknown number of ''muwaqqits''.{{sfn|King|1998|p=302}}{{sfn|King|1996|p=160}} According to Brentjes, these remunerations were relatively low, leading a ''muwaqqit'' to take up other jobs at the same time, including teaching.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=134\u2013135}} The data presented by King is limited to one city and does not cover mosques with prominent ''muwaqqits'', such as the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in Damascus.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=302\u2013303}}\n\n=== Relations with the muazzin ===\nThe responsibilities of a ''muwaqqit'' were related to those of the muazzins who announced the start time of a prayer by reciting the ''adhan''.{{sfn|King|1996|p=286}}{{sfn|Pedersen|1991|p=677}} Unlike the office of the ''muwaqqit'' which required special knowledge in astronomy, the muazzin were typically chosen for their piety and beautiful voice. Mosques did not always have ''muwaqqits''. Even major mosques often relied on a muazzin's traditional knowledge to determine prayer times.{{sfn|King|1983|p=534}} Brentjes speculates that the ''muwaqqit'' might have evolved from a specialised muazzin,{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=139}} and that there might not have been a clear delineation between the two offices.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=141}} Some celebrated ''muwaqqits'', including [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]] and [[Ibn al-Shatir]], were known to have once been muazzins, and many individuals held both offices simultaneously.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Le Caire mosqu\u00e9e Amr ibn al-As.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]] (today part of Cairo), where the official title of ''muwaqqit'' was first recorded.]]\nUnlike the muazzin whose history and origin has been well-studied, the origin of the ''muwaqqit'' is unclear. The earliest known record shows that the office already existed in the thirteenth century [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} According to King, the first ''muwaqqit'' known by name was Abu al-Hasan ali ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Sim'un (died 685 [[Hijri calendar|AH]] or 1286/1287 CE), a ''muwaqqit'' in the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]], Egypt for 30 years. His son Muhammad al-Wajih (died 701 H or 1301/1302 CE) and grandson Muhammad al-Majd also served as ''muwaqqit'' there.{{sfn|King|1996|p=298\u2013299}} At the same time, similar offices likely existed in [[Al-Andalus]] and the [[Maghreb]] with different names.{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} In [[Al-Andalus]], in the late 13th century, astronomers Ahmad and Husayn\u2014father and son from the ibn Baso family\u2014computed prayer times for the Great Mosque of [[Granada, Spain|Granada]]. Manuscripts refer to them with various titles, including ''al-muadhdhin al-mubarak'', ''al-imam al-mu'addil al-mubarak'', ''al-shaykh al-mu'addil'', ''amin al-awqat'', and ''muwaqqit''.{{sfn|King|1996|p=299}} The [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] employed the astronomer Muhammad al-Sanhaji ({{fl|c. 1307}}) in a similar position with the title ''al-mu'addil''.{{sfn|King|1996|p=300}} A manual of professions from around 1300 by the Egyptian author [[Ibn al-Ukhuwwa]] mentioned the post of the muazzin and its duties and requirements but did not mention the ''muwaqqit''.{{sfn|King|1983|p=534}}\n\n=== In the 14th and 15th centuries ===\n[[File:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Minaret of the Bride, Damascus, Holy Land, ca. 1895.jpg|thumb|The [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], a major centre of ''muwaqqit'' activity in the 14th and 15th centuries.]]\nIf the office of the ''muwaqqit'' indeed originated in Egypt, it soon spread to [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The [[Ibrahimi Mosque]] in [[Hebron]] employed the ''muwaqqit'' Ibrahim ibn Ahmad. In 1306, he made a copy of an astronomical work by Nasir al-Din ibn Sim'un (died 1337), a member of the same family as the early ''muwaqqits'' in Fustat.{{sfn|King|1998|p=156}} Another ''muwaqqit'', [[Ibn al-Sarraj]] ({{fl|c. 1325}}), served in [[Aleppo]] where he designed and created various astronomical instruments and wrote treatises about their construction and use.{{sfn|King|1998|p=157}} \n\nStill in Syria, [[Ibn al-Shatir]] (1304\u20131375) led a team of ''muwaqqits'' in the [[Umayyad Mosque]], Damascus. He wrote two [[zij|''zij''es]] (astronomical tables) and made [[astrolabe]]s and [[sundial]]s. Apart from timekeeping, he also worked on [[planetary theory|planetary theories]] and wrote a treatise on the movements of the Sun, the moon, and the planets. He moved away from [[Ptolemaic model|Ptolemaic geocentrism]] and produced models which were still geocentric but were mathematically identical to those later proposed by [[Copernicus]] (1473 \u2013 1543).{{sfn|King|1998|p=157}}{{sfn|King|1996|p=306}} According to King, Ibn al-Shatir's works represent the \"culmination\" of planetary astronomy in the Islamic world.{{sfn|King|1998|p=157}} Ibn al-Shatir's colleague [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]] (1320\u20131380), a ''muwaqqit'' of the [[Yalbugha Mosque]] before joining the Umayyad Mosque, wrote prayer timetables for Damascus and tables for finding [[qibla]] (sacred directions) from any locality.{{sfn|King|1998|p=157}} The activities of the ''muwaqqits'' were not universally approved of by Islamic jurists. The [[qadi]] (judge) of Damascus [[Taj al-Din al-Subki]] denounced the ''muwaqqits'', whose ranks according to him were filled with astrologers (''munajjimun'') and magicians (''kuhhan'').{{sfn|King|1996|p=306\u2013307, 329 no. 8}} Astrological topics were inevitably read by astronomers of the time because they were often included in astronomy textbooks, and a few ''muwaqqits'' were recorded to have studied astrology.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|p=125}}\n\nBy the end of the fourteenth century, the activity of the ''muwaqqits'' had been recorded in Egypt, Syria, Palestine, the [[Hejaz]] (including [[Mecca]], and [[Medina]]), [[Tunis]], and [[Yemen]].{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=141, 144\u2013145}}{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} In the following century, the practice spread to [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} According to King, there is no evidence of ''muwaqqit'' activity in more easterly parts of the Islamic world, including Iraq, Iran, India and Central Asia.{{sfn|King|1996|p=288}} According to Brentjes, it is possible that the discipline of ''miqat'' spread eastwards as part of an exchange prompted by trade, pilgrimage, and travel for knowledge even though no written evidence has been found.{{sfn|Brentjes|2008|pp=131, 144}}\n\nIn the fifteenth century, the center of ''muwaqqit'' activities shifted to Egypt, especially the [[Al-Azhar Mosque]] in Cairo, but their scientific outputs were reduced. Among the well-known ''muwaqqits'', [[Sibt al-Maridini]] (1423\u20131506) of Al-Azhar wrote treatises on timekeeping. He used simpler astronomical methods which became popular in Egypt and Syria. King speculates that he might have \"unwittingly\" contributed to the decline of astronomy in the Middle East because his works outcompeted more advanced texts. Other ''muwaqqits'' recorded in various mosques in fifteenth century Cairo include al-Kawm al-Rishi, 'Izz al-Din al-Wafa'i, al-Karadisi, and Abd al-Qadir al-Ajmawi. In addition, Egyptian astronomers Ibn al-Majdi and Ibn Abi al-Fath al-Sufi wrote extensively on religious timekeeping using more advanced astronomy than Sibt al-Maradani, but they were not formally attached to any mosque.{{sfn|King|1996|p=307}}\n\n=== After the fifteenth century ===\n[[File: Istanbul - Mesquita de Solim\u00e0 - Porta de Muvakkithane.JPG|thumb|The ''{{ill|muvakkithane|tr|muvakkithane}}'' (\"the lodge of the ''muwaqqit''\") of the [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]] in Istanbul]]\n''Ilm al-miqat'' and the activity of the ''muwaqqits'' ({{lang-tr|muvakkitler}}, singular {{lang|tr|muvakkit}}) continued into the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which conquered the Mamluks in 1517), although now they produced less scientific works compared to the zenith in the 14th and 15th centuries.{{sfn|King|1993|p=32}} Their work was overseen by the [[m\u00fcneccimba\u015f\u0131]] (chief imperial astrologer).{{sfn|Wishnitzer|2015|p=25}} The Turkish historian of science [[Ayd\u0131n Say\u0131l\u0131]] noted that many mosques in Istanbul have buildings or rooms called ''{{ill|muvakkithane|tr|muvakkithane|lt=muvakkithanes}}'' (\"lodge of the ''muwaqqit''\").{{sfn|King|1996|p=287}}{{sfn|King|1993|p=32}} Ottoman sultans and other notables built and patronized them as acts of piety and philanthropy.
