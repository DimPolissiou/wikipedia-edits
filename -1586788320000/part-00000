Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"utr\"> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name=gonzalez/><ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host. [[Mumps]], polio, and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] cause more severe disease in adults, while others like rotavirus cause more severe infection in infants. It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Jawetz, Melnick, & Adelberg\u2019s Medical Microbiology |edition=28|last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\n\nA viral infection does not always cause disease.

Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]]. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" /><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Walther Mothes | author2=Nathan M.

The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Viral pathogenesis''' is the study of how [[virus]]es cause diseases in their target [[Host (biology)|host]]s, usually carried out at the cellular or molecular level.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"utr\"> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name=gonzalez/><ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host. [[Mumps]], polio, and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] cause more severe disease in adults, while others like rotavirus cause more severe infection in infants. It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Jawetz, Melnick, & Adelberg\u2019s Medical Microbiology |edition=28|last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\n\nA viral infection does not always cause disease.

Viruses often induce direct cytopathic effects to disrupt cellular functions.<ref name=gonzalez/> This could be through releasing toxic proteins or enzymes to degrade host metabolic precursors, or inhibiting the synthesis of important host factors, proteins, DNA and/or RNA.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\">{{Cite book|title=Fenner's Veterinary Virology|last=MacLachlan|first=James|last2=Dubovi|first2=Edward|date=2011|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=9780123751584|edition=4th}}</ref> Namely, viral proteins of herpes simplex virus can degrade host DNA and inhibit host cell DNA replication and mRNA transcription.<ref name =\"robbins\" /> Poliovirus can inactivate proteins involved in host mRNA translation without affecting poliovirus mRNA translation.

Notable examples include [[measles virus]], [[HIV]], [[Human orthopneumovirus|respiratory syncytial virus]].<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/>\n[[File:Virus lifestyle persistence strategies.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|alt=A graph summarising the various virus \"lifestyle strategies, acute, chronic and latent|The \"lifestyle\" strategies of viruses in host cells. Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]]. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" /><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Walther Mothes | author2=Nathan M.

The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]].<ref name=\"immunopatho1\"> {{Cite journal | author=Barry T.Rouse | title=Virus-Induced Immunopathology | journal=Advances in Viral Research | volume=47 | year=1996 | pages=353-376 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-3527(08)60739-3 }}  </ref><ref name=\"immunopatho2\"> {{Cite journal | author=Barry T.Rouse, Sharvan Sehrawat | title=Immunity and immunopathology to viruses: what decides the outcome? | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=10 | year=2010 | pages=514-526| doi=10.1038/nri2802 }} </ref>\n\n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms.<ref name=\"immunopatho1\"/><ref name=\"immunopatho2\"/> In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''.

The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 | doi-access=free }}  </ref> Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDamage caused by host immune system", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}

The name \"[[wild onion (disambiguation)|wild onion]]\" is applied to a number of ''Allium'' species, but ''A. cepa'' is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions.<ref name=\"FNA\">{{eFloras|1|200027457|Allium cepa |first1=Dale W. |last1=McNeal Jr. |first2=T. D. |last2=Jacobsen |volume=26}}</ref> The onion is most frequently a [[biennial plant|biennial]] or a [[perennial plant]], but is usually treated as an [[Annual plant|annual]] and harvested in its first growing season.\n\nThe onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the [[Delia antiqua|onion fly]], the [[Ditylenchus dipsaci|onion eelworm]], and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of ''A. cepa'', such as [[shallot]]s and [[potato onion]]s, produce multiple bulbs.\n\nOnions are cultivated and used around the world. As a food item, they are usually served cooked, as a [[vegetable]] or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make [[Pickled onion|pickles]] or [[chutney]]s. They are [[pungent]] when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\n[[File:ARS red onion.jpg|thumb|Roots, leaves and developing bulb]]\nThe onion plant (''Allium cepa''), also known as the bulb onion<ref name=GRIN>{{GRIN | ''Allium cepa'' var.

The English word [[chive]] is also derived from the Old French ''cive'', which derived from ''cepa''.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe onion plant has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7,000 years.  It is a [[biennial plant]], but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of {{convert|15|to|45|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up, beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that grows out of a [[basal disc]]. From the underside of the disc, a bundle of [[Fibrous root system|fibrous roots]] extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells.<ref name=RHS />\n\nIn the autumn, the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then normally harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring.

Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require a high level of [[Soil#Nutrients|nutrients]] in the soil. [[Phosphorus]] is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. [[Nitrogen]] and [[potash]] can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caes.uga.edu/publications/pubDetail.cfm?pk_id=7749 |title=2007 Onion Production Guide |author=Boyhan, George E.; Kelley, W. Terry (eds.) |year=2007 |website=Production Guides |publisher=University of Georgia: College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> Bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity. Most traditional European onions are referred to as \"long-day\" onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as \"intermediate-day\" types, requiring only 12\u201313 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, \"short-day\" onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11\u201312 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/onion-bulb-formation-strongly-linked-day-length |title=Onion bulb formation is strongly linked with day length |author=Savonen, Carol |date=2006-07-13 |website= |publisher=Oregon State University Extension Service |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in [[Hardiness zone|USDA zones]] 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;9.<ref name=almanac /> Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to \"[[Bolting (horticulture)|bolt]]\", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/onion/onion-bolting.htm |title=What is Onion Bolting and how to Keep an Onion from Bolting |author=Rhoades, Jackie |website=Gardening Know How |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref>\n\nOnions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown [[bulb|bulbs called \"sets\"]].

The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need much water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be stored, they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying, then placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They are stored effectively in a well-ventilated, cool place.<ref name=RHS />\n\n=== Pests and diseases ===\n[[File:Uienvlieg maden.jpg|thumb|left|Larvae of the onion fly]]\n\nOnions suffer from a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants.<ref name=Hessayon>{{cite book |title=Be your own Vegetable Doctor |last=Hessayon |first=D.G. |authorlink = D. G.

The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agroatlas.ru/en/content/pests/Delia_antiqua/ |title=''Delia antiqua'' (Meigen): Onion Fly |website=Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nThe onion eelworm (''[[Ditylenchus dipsaci]]''), a tiny parasitic soil-living [[nematode]], causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing [[carrot]]s, [[parsnip]]s, and [[bean]]s, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenaction.co.uk/techniques/pests/onion_eelworm.htm |title=Onion Eelworm (''Ditylenchus dipsaci'') |year=2011 |website=GardenAction  |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWhite rot of onions, leeks, and garlic is caused by the soil-borne fungus ''[[Stromatinia cepivora|Sclerotium cepivorum]]''. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of [[Mycelium|mycelia]], which later produces small, globular black structures called [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]]. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=226 |title=Onion white rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nNeck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage. It is caused by ''[[Botrytis allii]]'', which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of [[spore]]s are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=747 |title=Onion neck rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Storage in the home ===\n[[File:\u0c09\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Pickled onion]]\n\nCooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at [[room temperature]], optimally in a single layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw moisture from [[vegetables]] with which they are stored which may cause them to [[Decomposition|decay]].<ref name=almanac /><ref name=Jauron>{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/news/2009/jul/062201.htm |title=Harvesting and storing onions |author=Jauron, Richard |date=2009-07-27 |publisher=Iowa State University Extension |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref>\n\nSweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month.

''aggregatum'') ===\nThis group contains shallots and potato onions, also referred to as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs from a master. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.<ref name=\"Rabinowitch 20-21\" />\n\nI'itoi onion is a prolific multiplier onion cultivated in the [[Baboquivari Peak Wilderness]], Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and is easy to grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1&nbsp;in below the surface and 12&nbsp;in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back in the heat of summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/programs/ark_product_detail/iitoi_onion/ |title=I'Itoi Onion |year=2010 |website=Ark of Taste |publisher=Slow Food USA |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==== Hybrids with ''A. cepa'' parentage ====\nA number of hybrids are cultivated that have ''A. cepa'' parentage, such as the [[Diploid#Polyploid types|diploid]] [[tree onion]] or Egyptian onion (''A.'' \u00d7''proliferum''), and the [[Triploid#Polyploid types|triploid]] onion (''A.'' \u00d7''cornutum'').\n\nThe tree onion or Egyptian onion produces bulblets in the umbel instead of flowers, and is now known to be a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of ''A. cepa'' and ''A. fistulosum''.

The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the [[Delia antiqua|onion fly]], the [[Ditylenchus dipsaci|onion eelworm]], and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of ''A. cepa'', such as [[shallot]]s and [[potato onion]]s, produce multiple bulbs.\n\nOnions are cultivated and used around the world. As a food item, they are usually served cooked, as a [[vegetable]] or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make [[Pickled onion|pickles]] or [[chutney]]s. They are [[pungent]] when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\n[[File:ARS red onion.jpg|thumb|Roots, leaves and developing bulb]]\nThe onion plant (''Allium cepa''), also known as the bulb onion<ref name=GRIN>{{GRIN | ''Allium cepa'' var.

The English word [[chive]] is also derived from the Old French ''cive'', which derived from ''cepa''.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe onion plant has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7,000 years.  It is a [[biennial plant]], but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of {{convert|15|to|45|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up, beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that grows out of a [[basal disc]]. From the underside of the disc, a bundle of [[Fibrous root system|fibrous roots]] extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells.<ref name=RHS />\n\nIn the autumn, the leaves die back and the outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then normally harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point in the middle of the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The [[inflorescence]] takes the form of a globular [[umbel]] of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.<ref name=RHS /> The average pH of an onion is around 5.5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foodsafety.wisc.edu/business_food/files/Approximate_pH.pdf|title=Approximate pH Values of Common Foods and Ingredients|website=Wisconsin Food Safety and Health|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224184605/http://www.foodsafety.wisc.edu/business_food/files/Approximate_pH.pdf|archive-date=2012-12-24|url-status=dead|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Origin and history ===\n[[File:An onion, woodcut, 1547 Wellcome L0029214.jpg|thumb|Woodcut, 1547]]\n\nBecause the wild onion is [[extinction|extinct]] and ancient records of using onions span [[Western Asia|western]] and [[Eastern Asia|eastern]] Asia, the geographic origin of the onion is uncertain,<ref name=\"cumo\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WqfACQAAQBAJ&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248 |title=Onion.

Most traditional European onions are referred to as \"long-day\" onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as \"intermediate-day\" types, requiring only 12\u201313 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, \"short-day\" onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11\u201312 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/onion-bulb-formation-strongly-linked-day-length |title=Onion bulb formation is strongly linked with day length |author=Savonen, Carol |date=2006-07-13 |website= |publisher=Oregon State University Extension Service |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in [[Hardiness zone|USDA zones]] 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;9.<ref name=almanac /> Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to \"[[Bolting (horticulture)|bolt]]\", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/onion/onion-bolting.htm |title=What is Onion Bolting and how to Keep an Onion from Bolting |author=Rhoades, Jackie |website=Gardening Know How |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref>\n\nOnions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown [[bulb|bulbs called \"sets\"]].

The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need much water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be stored, they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying, then placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes.

The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants.<ref name=Hessayon>{{cite book |title=Be your own Vegetable Doctor |last=Hessayon |first=D.G. |authorlink = D. G.

The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agroatlas.ru/en/content/pests/Delia_antiqua/ |title=''Delia antiqua'' (Meigen): Onion Fly |website=Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nThe onion eelworm (''[[Ditylenchus dipsaci]]''), a tiny parasitic soil-living [[nematode]], causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing [[carrot]]s, [[parsnip]]s, and [[bean]]s, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenaction.co.uk/techniques/pests/onion_eelworm.htm |title=Onion Eelworm (''Ditylenchus dipsaci'') |year=2011 |website=GardenAction  |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWhite rot of onions, leeks, and garlic is caused by the soil-borne fungus ''[[Stromatinia cepivora|Sclerotium cepivorum]]''. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of [[Mycelium|mycelia]], which later produces small, globular black structures called [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]]. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=226 |title=Onion white rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\nNeck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage. It is caused by ''[[Botrytis allii]]'', which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of [[spore]]s are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=747 |title=Onion neck rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Storage in the home ===\n[[File:\u0c09\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Pickled onion]]\n\nCooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at [[room temperature]], optimally in a single layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears.

The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs from a master. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.<ref name=\"Rabinowitch 20-21\" />\n\nI'itoi onion is a prolific multiplier onion cultivated in the [[Baboquivari Peak Wilderness]], Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and is easy to grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1&nbsp;in below the surface and 12&nbsp;in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back in the heat of summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/programs/ark_product_detail/iitoi_onion/ |title=I'Itoi Onion |year=2010 |website=Ark of Taste |publisher=Slow Food USA |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==== Hybrids with ''A. cepa'' parentage ====\nA number of hybrids are cultivated that have ''A. cepa'' parentage, such as the [[Diploid#Polyploid types|diploid]] [[tree onion]] or Egyptian onion (''A.'' \u00d7''proliferum''), and the [[Triploid#Polyploid types|triploid]] onion (''A.'' \u00d7''cornutum'').\n\nThe tree onion or Egyptian onion produces bulblets in the umbel instead of flowers, and is now known to be a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of ''A. cepa'' and ''A. fistulosum''.

'Pran' is grown extensively in the northern Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. There are very small genetic differences between 'Pran' and the Croatian clone 'Ljutika', implying a [[monophyletic]] origin for this species.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Friesen, N.  |author2=M.

Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=27\u201328}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=42\u201343}}\n\n=== Undergraduate years ===\nHawking began his university education at [[University College, Oxford]],<ref name=whoswho /> in October 1959 at the age of 17.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonely{{snd}}he found the academic work \"ridiculously easy\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=46\u201347, 51}} His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, \"It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it.\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=29}} A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort \"to be one of the boys\". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the [[University College Boat Club (Oxford)|University College Boat Club]], where he [[coxswain (rowing)|coxed]] a rowing crew.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfn|Hawking|1992|loc=p. 44}} The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=50}} Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his [[final examination|finals]] a challenge, and he decided to answer only [[theoretical physics]] questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours degree]] was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in [[cosmology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}} Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a ''[[oral exam|viva]]'' (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=54}}\n\nHawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the viva to describe his plans, he said, \"If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First.\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=54\u201355}} He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners \"were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}} After receiving a [[First Class Honours#First-class honours|first-class]] [[Honours degree|BA (Hons.) degree]] in physics and completing a trip to [[Iran]] with a friend, he began his graduate work at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], in October 1962.<ref name=whoswho />{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n=== Graduate years ===\nHawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult. He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned [[Dennis William Sciama]], one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than noted Yorkshire astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=58}} and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in [[general relativity]] and cosmology.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=33\u201334}} After being diagnosed with [[motor neurone disease]], Hawking fell into a depression{{snd}}though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=61\u201363}} His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded. With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=36}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=69\u201370}} Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student [[Jayant Narlikar]] at a lecture in June 1964.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=42}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nWhen Hawking began his graduate studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the [[Big Bang]] and [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] theories.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=34}} Inspired by [[Roger Penrose]]'s theorem of a [[spacetime]] singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this topic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/stephen-hawkings-phd-thesis-explained-simply|title=Stephen Hawking's PhD thesis, explained simply|access-date=27 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213201244/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/stephen-hawkings-phd-thesis-explained-simply|archive-date=13 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=71\u201372}} Hawking's thesis<ref name=hawkingphd /> was approved in 1966.<ref name=\"hawkingphd\" /> There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College]] at Cambridge;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=43\u201344}} he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=47}} and his essay \"Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time\" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious [[Adams Prize]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=47}}\n\n== Career ==\n{{Cosmology|scientists}}\n\n=== 1966\u20131975 ===\nIn his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the [[Penrose\u2013Hawking singularity theorems|singularity theorem]] concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 [[Gravity Research Foundation]] competition.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=101}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=61, 64}} In 1970, they published a proof that if the universe obeys [[general relativity|the general theory of relativity]] and fits any of the [[Friedmann equations|models]] of [[physical cosmology]] developed by [[Alexander Friedmann]], then it must have begun as a singularity.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=64\u201365}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=115\u201316}}<ref name=\"Auto2J-7\" /> In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=49}}\n\nIn 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as [[Second law of black hole mechanics|the second law of black hole dynamics]], that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=65\u201367}} With [[James M. Bardeen]] and [[Brandon Carter]], he proposed the four [[laws of black hole mechanics]], drawing an analogy with [[thermodynamics]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=38}} To Hawking's irritation, [[Jacob Bekenstein]], a graduate student of [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]], went further\u2014and ultimately correctly\u2014to apply thermodynamic concepts literally.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=67\u201368}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=123\u201324}}\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner Israel, and David C. Robinson strongly supported Wheeler's [[no-hair theorem]], one that states that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created, it can be completely described by the properties of [[mass]], [[electrical charge]] and rotation.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=33}}<ref name=\"HawkingIsrael1989\" /> His essay titled \"Black Holes\" won the [[Gravity Research Foundation]] Award in January 1971.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=35}} Hawking's first book, ''[[The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time]],'' written with [[George Francis Rayner Ellis|George Ellis]], was published in 1973.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=68}}\n\nBeginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of [[quantum gravity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=39}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=68}} His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] and [[Alexei Starobinsky]], whose work showed that according to the [[uncertainty principle]], rotating black holes emit particles.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=146}} To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=70}} and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their [[Black hole entropy|entropy]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=146}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=41}}\n\nHis results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as [[Hawking radiation]], which may continue until they exhaust their energy and [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporate]].<ref name=\"Auto2J-9\" /><ref name=\"Auto2J-10\" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=69\u201373}} Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=70\u201374}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=42\u201343}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=150\u201351}} Hawking was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1974|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974]], a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation. At the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=44}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=133}}\n\nHawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in 1974. He worked with a friend on the faculty, [[Kip Thorne]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=82, 86}}<ref name=rsbm/> and engaged him in a [[scientific wager]] about whether the [[Astrophysical X-ray source|X-ray source]] [[Cygnus X-1]] was a black hole. The wager was an \"insurance policy\" against the proposition that black holes did not exist.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=86\u201388}} Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in 1990, a bet that was the first of several he was to make with Thorne and others.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=150,189, 219}} Hawking had maintained ties to Caltech, spending a month there almost every year since this first visit.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=95}}\n\n=== 1975\u20131990 ===\nHawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in gravitational physics. The mid to late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=90}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=132\u201333}} He also received increasing academic recognition of his work.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}} In 1975, he was awarded both the [[Eddington Medal]] and the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences|Pius XI Gold Medal]], and in 1976 the [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics|Dannie Heineman Prize]], the [[Maxwell Medal and Prize]] and the [[Hughes Medal]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=162}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xv}} He was appointed a professor with a chair in [[gravitational physics]] in 1977.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}} The following year he received the [[Albert Einstein Medal]] and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}\n\nIn 1979, Hawking was elected [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the University of Cambridge.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}<ref name=lucasian>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3248858/Stephen-Hawking-to-retire-as-Cambridges-Professor-of-Mathematics.html|title=Stephen Hawking to retire as Cambridge's Professor of Mathematics|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=15 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316023008/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3248858/Stephen-Hawking-to-retire-as-Cambridges-Professor-of-Mathematics.html|archive-date=16 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> His inaugural lecture in this role was titled: \"Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?\" and proposed [[N=8 Supergravity]] as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=93\u201394}} His promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to his accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=92\u201393}} At the same time, he was also making a transition in his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. \"I would rather be right than rigorous\", he told Kip Thorne.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=96}} In 1981, he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. This [[Black hole information paradox|information paradox]] violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and led to years of debate, including \"[[the Black Hole War]]\" with [[Leonard Susskind]] and [[Gerard 't Hooft]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=96\u2013101}}<ref name=\"Susskind2008\" />\n\n[[Inflation (cosmology)|Cosmological inflation]]{{snd}}a theory proposing that following the Big Bang, the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion{{snd}}was proposed by [[Alan Guth]] and also developed by [[Andrei Linde]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=108\u201311}} Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and [[Gary Gibbons]]<ref name=rsbm/> organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on \"The Very Early Universe\" at Cambridge University, a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=111\u201314}}<ref name=\"Auto2J-12\" /><ref name=\"Auto2J-13\" /> Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe.

It proposed that prior to the [[Planck epoch]], the [[universe]] had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.<ref name=\"Auto2J-14\" /> The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there{{snd}}it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end.{{sfn|Baird|2007|loc=p. 234}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=180\u201383}} Initially, the no-boundary proposal predicted a [[Shape of the universe|closed universe]], which had implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained, \"If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began.\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=129}}\n\nHawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' \"Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=130}} In his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In ''A Brief History of Time'' he wrote: \"If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason{{snd}}for then we should know the mind of God.\"<ref name=\"sample\" /> In the same book he suggested that the existence of God was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with [[Neil Turok]] led to the realisation that the existence of God was also compatible with an open universe.{{sfn|Yulsman|2003|loc=pp.&nbsp;174\u2013176}}\n\nFurther work by Hawking in the area of [[Arrow of time|arrows of time]] led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=180\u2013182}} A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by [[Raymond Laflamme]] led Hawking to withdraw this concept.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=182}} Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American [[Franklin Medal]],{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=274}} and in the [[1982 New Year Honours]]

Hawking.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=140\u201342}} The book was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and it proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of

co-edited a book on [[Euclidean quantum gravity]] with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=180}} In 1994, at Cambridge's [[Newton Institute]], Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as \"The Nature of Space and Time\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=188}} In 1997, he conceded a 1991 public [[scientific wager]] made with Kip Thorne and [[John Preskill]] of [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a \"cosmic censorship conjecture\"{{snd}}that there could be no \"naked singularities\" unclothed within a horizon{{snd}}was correct.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=189\u201390}}\n\nAfter discovering his concession might have been premature, a new and more refined wager was made. This one specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=190}} The same year, Thorne, Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time concerning the [[black hole information paradox]].<ref name=\"Auto2J-18\" /><ref name=\"concedbet\" /> Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be \"new\", and not from inside the black hole [[event horizon]]. Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.<ref name=\"presskill\" />\n\nHawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. A film version of ''A Brief History of Time'', directed by [[Errol Morris]] and produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], premiered in 1992.

During their first years of marriage, Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree at Westfield College. They travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits. Jane began a PhD programme through Westfield College in [[Medieval Spanish literature#Lyric poetry of the Middle Ages|medieval Spanish poetry]] (completed in 1981). The couple had three children: Robert, born May 1967,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=45\u201347}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=92\u201398}} [[Lucy Hawking|Lucy]], born November 1969,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=65}} and Timothy, born April 1979.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}\n\nHawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, even{{snd}}in a precedent set during their courtship{{snd}}with Jane.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=37\u201339, 77}} His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=78}} Upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]], Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care.

[[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]], with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant.

After several prototypes that did not perform as planned, they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup [[SwiftKey]], which used a system similar to his original technology. Hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system, which was further developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking's papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.<ref name=\"dt70\" /><ref name=\"Medeiros\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/|title=How Intel Gave Stephen Hawking a Voice|first=Joao|last=Medeiros|date=13 January 2015|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=14 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314050104/https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/|archive-date=14 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"hacked\" /><ref name=\"start\" />\n\nBy 2009, he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin.

Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase.

As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry.

He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the [[University College Boat Club (Oxford)|University College Boat Club]], where he [[coxswain (rowing)|coxed]] a rowing crew.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfn|Hawking|1992|loc=p. 44}} The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=50}} Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his [[final examination|finals]] a challenge, and he decided to answer only [[theoretical physics]] questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours degree]] was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in [[cosmology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}} Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a ''[[oral exam|viva]]'' (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=54}}\n\nHawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student.

This [[Black hole information paradox|information paradox]] violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and led to years of debate, including \"[[the Black Hole War]]\" with [[Leonard Susskind]] and [[Gerard 't Hooft]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=96\u2013101}}<ref name=\"Susskind2008\" />\n\n[[Inflation (cosmology)|Cosmological inflation]]{{snd}}a theory proposing that following the Big Bang, the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion{{snd}}was proposed by [[Alan Guth]] and also developed by [[Andrei Linde]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=108\u201311}} Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and [[Gary Gibbons]]<ref name=rsbm/> organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on \"The Very Early Universe\" at Cambridge University, a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=111\u201314}}<ref name=\"Auto2J-12\" /><ref name=\"Auto2J-13\" /> Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe.

It proposed that prior to the [[Planck epoch]], the [[universe]] had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.<ref name=\"Auto2J-14\" /> The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole.

As Hawking explained, \"If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began.\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=129}}\n\nHawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' \"Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=130}} In his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In ''A Brief History of Time'' he wrote: \"If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason{{snd}}for then we should know the mind of God.\"<ref name=\"sample\" /> In the same book he suggested that the existence of God was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with [[Neil Turok]] led to the realisation that the existence of God was also compatible with an open universe.{{sfn|Yulsman|2003|loc=pp.&nbsp;174\u2013176}}\n\nFurther work by Hawking in the area of [[Arrow of time|arrows of time]] led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=180\u2013182}} A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by [[Raymond Laflamme]] led Hawking to withdraw this concept.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=182}} Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American [[Franklin Medal]],{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=274}} and in the [[1982 New Year Honours]]

Hawking.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=140\u201342}} The book was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and it proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of

co-edited a book on [[Euclidean quantum gravity]] with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=180}} In 1994, at Cambridge's [[Newton Institute]], Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as \"The Nature of Space and Time\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=188}} In 1997, he conceded a 1991 public [[scientific wager]] made with Kip Thorne and [[John Preskill]] of [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a \"cosmic censorship conjecture\"{{snd}}that there could be no \"naked singularities\" unclothed within a horizon{{snd}}was correct.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=189\u201390}}\n\nAfter discovering his concession might have been premature, a new and more refined wager was made. This one specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=190}} The same year, Thorne, Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time concerning the [[black hole information paradox]].<ref name=\"Auto2J-18\" /><ref name=\"concedbet\" /> Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be \"new\", and not from inside the black hole [[event horizon]]. Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.<ref name=\"presskill\" />\n\nHawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. A film version of ''A Brief History of Time'', directed by [[Errol Morris]] and produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], premiered in 1992. Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical, but he was persuaded otherwise. The film, while a critical success, was not widely released.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=168\u201370}} A popular-level collection of essays, interviews, and talks titled ''[[Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays]]'' was published in 1993,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=178}} and a six-part television series ''[[Stephen Hawking's Universe]]'' and a companion book appeared in 1997.

The following year, Hawking was diagnosed with [[motor neuron disease]]. In October 1964, the couple became engaged to marry, aware of the potential challenges that lay ahead due to Hawking's shortened life expectancy and physical limitations.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=37\u201340}} Hawking later said that the engagement gave him \"something to live for\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=40}} The two were married on 14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St Albans.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nThe couple resided in Cambridge, within Hawking's walking distance to the [[Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] (DAMTP). During their first years of marriage, Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree at Westfield College. They travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits. Jane began a PhD programme through Westfield College in [[Medieval Spanish literature#Lyric poetry of the Middle Ages|medieval Spanish poetry]] (completed in 1981). The couple had three children: Robert, born May 1967,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=45\u201347}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=92\u201398}} [[Lucy Hawking|Lucy]], born November 1969,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=65}} and Timothy, born April 1979.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}\n\nHawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, even{{snd}}in a precedent set during their courtship{{snd}}with Jane.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=37\u201339, 77}} His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=78}} Upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]], Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and [[Bernard Carr]] travelled with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=82\u201383}}<ref name=\"black\" /> The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in Pasadena.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=83\u201388}}\n\nHawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home and a new job, as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]]. [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]], with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant. With Page's help and that of a secretary, Jane's responsibilities were reduced so she could return to her doctoral thesis and her new interest in singing.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 89\u201390}}\n\nAround December 1977, Jane met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir. Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family, and by the mid-1980s, he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiv, 79}}{{sfn|Hawking|2007|pp=279\u201380}} According to Jane, her husband was accepting of the situation, stating \"he would not object so long as I continued to love him\".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=79}}{{sfn|Hawking|2007|p=285}} Jane and Hellyer Jones determined not to break up the family, and their relationship remained platonic for a long period.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nBy the 1980s, Hawking's marriage had been strained for many years. Jane felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and assistants.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 164\u201365}} The impact of his celebrity was challenging for colleagues and family members, while the prospect of living up to a worldwide fairytale image was daunting for the couple.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 185}}<ref name=\"dt70\" /> Hawking's views of religion also contrasted with her strong Christian faith and resulted in tension.<ref name=\"dt70\" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 80\u201381}}<ref name=\"obs2004\" /> After a tracheotomy in 1985, Hawking required a nurse 24/7 and nursing care was split across 3 shifts daily. In the late 1980s, Hawking grew close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers, and family members, who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 145}} In February 1990, Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 165}} and departed the family home.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp = x\u2013xix}} After his divorce from Jane in 1995, Hawking married Mason in September,{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp = x\u2013xix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 186\u201387}} declaring, \"It's wonderful{{snd}}I have married the woman I love.\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 187}}\n\nIn 1999, Jane Hawking published a memoir, ''Music to Move the Stars'', describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown. Its revelations caused a sensation in the media but, as was his usual practice regarding his personal life, Hawking made no public comment except to say that he did not read biographies about himself.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=187, 192}} After his second marriage, Hawking's family felt excluded and marginalised from his life.<ref name=obs2004 /><ref name= sundaytimes /> For a period of about five years in the early 2000s, his family and staff became increasingly worried that he was being physically abused.<ref name= sundaytimes />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=197, 225}} Police investigations took place, but were closed as Hawking refused to make a complaint.<ref name= sundaytimes /><ref name=\"Auto2J-21\" /><ref name=\"Auto2J-22\" />\n\nIn 2006, Hawking and Mason quietly divorced,<ref name=\"Auto2J-25\" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=225}} and Hawking resumed closer relationships with Jane, his children, and his grandchildren.<ref name=\"dt70\" />{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=225}} Reflecting on this happier period, a revised version of Jane's book, re-titled ''Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen'', appeared in 2007,<ref name=\"sundaytimes\" /> and was made into a film, ''[[The Theory of Everything (2014 film)|The Theory of Everything]]'', in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eddie Redmayne wins first Oscar for 'Theory of Everything'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-awards-oscars-actor/eddie-redmayne-wins-first-oscar-for-theory-of-everything-idUSKBN0LR0AF20150223|access-date=7 March 2015|agency=Reuters|date=10 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201132243/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-awards-oscars-actor/eddie-redmayne-wins-first-oscar-for-theory-of-everything-idUSKBN0LR0AF20150223|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Disability ===\nHawking had a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of [[motor neuron disease]] (MND; also known as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), or [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease), a fatal [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease that results in the death of motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed him over decades.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=32}}<ref name=\"Auto2J-6\" /> The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly [[dysarthria|slurred]] and his family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas, and medical investigations were begun.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=59}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=34\u201335}} The MND diagnosis came when Hawking was 21, in 1963.

To communicate with others, someone who knew him well would interpret his speech into intelligible speech.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=81\u201382}} Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge,{{sfn|Mialet|2003|pp=450\u201351}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=79, 149}} including adapted student housing at the university.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=273\u201374}} In general, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a [[disability rights]] champion: while wanting to help others, he also sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=193\u201394}} His lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=194}}\n\nDuring a visit to [[CERN]] on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking contracted [[pneumonia]], which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused, but the consequence was a [[tracheotomy]], which required round-the-clock nursing care and the removal of what remained of his speech.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=135\u201336}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=232\u201336}} The [[National Health Service]] was ready to pay for a [[nursing home]], but Jane was determined that he would live at home.

One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=139}}\n\nFor his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose [[Partner-assisted scanning|letters on a spelling card]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=136}} but in 1986 he received a computer program called the \"Equalizer\" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also suffered from ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write.<ref name=\"Medeiros\" /> In a method he used for the rest of his life, Hawking could now simply press a switch to select phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2,500\u20133,000 that were [[Switch access scanning|scanned]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=137\u201338}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=236\u201337}} The program was originally run on a desktop computer. Elaine Mason's husband, David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=140}}\n\nReleased from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, Hawking commented that \"I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice.\"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=140\u201341}} The voice he used had an American accent and is no longer produced.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=138}}<ref name=\"Auto2J-15\" /> Despite the later availability of other voices, Hawking retained this original voice, saying that he preferred it and identified with it.<ref name=\"Auto2J-16\" /> Originally, Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to [[Typing#Alphanumeric entry|15 words a minute]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=175}} Lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the [[speech synthesis|speech synthesizer]] in short sections to be delivered.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=138}}\n\nHawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=224}}<ref name=\"tech\" /><ref name=\"hacked\" /> with a rate of about one word per minute.<ref name=\"tech\" /> With this decline there was a risk of his developing [[locked-in syndrome]], so Hawking collaborated with [[Intel]] researchers on systems that could translate his [[Neural oscillation|brain patterns]] or facial expressions into switch activations. After several prototypes that did not perform as planned, they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup [[SwiftKey]], which used a system similar to his original technology.

Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase.
