''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), p. 633.</ref> The song first charted on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart reaching number one for nine weeks, then hit number one on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart for 11 weeks.

The scene cuts between the band hanging around on the roof of the apartments where the old man lives, spying on a man harassing a woman. When the man drags her away, the old man dons his superhero suit and follows. In between shots of the old hero chasing the [[Villain|bad guy]] and failing to protect himself against a group of [[Goth subculture|goth]]s, the band is shown playing in a club (the Cowboy Palace Saloon in LA) with several other elderly people dressed as caricatures of comic villains. Several of these people are seen riding a mechanical bull during the final chorus. The video comes to a close when the old man dives through the skylight and catches the bad guy off guard, possibly knocking him out by falling on top of him. The video ends with the old man smiling, giving a thumbs up to the camera, having successfully completed his mission.\n\n==Live performances==\n\"Kryptonite\" was first performed live in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] on January 15, 1997.
