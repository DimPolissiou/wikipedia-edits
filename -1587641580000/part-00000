It comes from the [[Arabic]] ''\u1e25ar\u012bm'', which can mean \"a sacred inviolable place\", \"harem\" or  \"female members of the family\". In English the term harem can mean also \"the wives (or concubines) of a polygamous man.\" The [[triliteral]] ''[[\u1e24-R-M]]'' appears in other terms related to the notion of interdiction such as ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden), ''[[mahram]]'' (unmarriageable relative), ''[[ihram]]'' (a pilgrim's state of ritual consecration during the [[Hajj]]) and ''al-\u1e24aram al-\u0160ar\u012bf'' (\"the noble sanctuary\", which can refer to the [[Temple Mount]] or the sanctuary of [[Mecca]]).{{sfn|Wehr|1976|pp=171-172}}\n\nIn [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish of the Ottoman era]], the harem, i.e., the part of the house reserved for women was called ''[[Haremlik|hareml\u0131k]]'', while the space open for men was known as ''[[Selamlik|selaml\u0131k]]''.{{sfn|Quataert|2005|p=152}}\n\nThe practice of female seclusion is not exclusive to Islam, but the English word harem usually denotes the domestic space reserved for women in Muslim households.<ref name=seclusion-patel/><ref>{{Dictionary.com|harem|accessdate=2017-04-04}}</ref> Some scholars have used the term to refer to polygynous royal households throughout history.{{sfn|Betzig|2013}}\n\n==''The ideal of seclusion''==\n[[File:4 New entrant to a princes harem. Jaipur, late 18 century, National Museum New Delhi (2).jpg|thumb|New entrant to a prince's harem. Jaipur, late 18 century, National Museum, New Delhi]]\n\n[[Leila Ahmed]] describes the ''ideal of seclusion'' as a \"a man's right to keep his women concealed\u2014invisible to other men.\" Ahmed identifies the practice of seclusion as a social ideal and one of the major factors that shaped the lives of women in the Mediterranean Middle East. {{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=103}}  For example, contemporary sources from the Byzantine Empire describe the social mores that governed women's lives. Women were not supposed to be seen in public. They were guarded by eunuchs and could only leave the home \"veiled and suitably chaperoned.\" Some of these customs were borrowed from the Persians, but Greek society also influenced the development of patriarchal tradition.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|pp=26-28}}\n\nThe ideal of seclusion was not fully realized as social reality.  This was in part because working class women often held jobs that required interaction with men.<ref name=seclusion-patel>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Youshaa Patel|title=Seclusion|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t355/e0184|url-access=subscription}}</ref>  In the Byzantine empire, the very ideal of gender segregation created economic opportunities for women as midwives, doctors, bath attendants and artisans, since it was considered inappropriate for men to attend to women's needs. At times women lent and invested money and engaged in other commercial activities.\n{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=27}} Historical records shows that the women of 14th-century [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] Cairo freely visited public events alongside men, despite objections of religious scholars.<ref name=seclusion-patel/> The practice of gender segregation in Islam was influenced by an interplay of religion, customs and politics.<ref name=seclusion-doumato/><ref name=seclusion-patel/>\n\nFemale seclusion has historically signaled social and economic prestige.<ref name=seclusion-patel/> Eventually, the norms of female seclusion spread beyond the elites, but the practice remained characteristic of upper and middle classes, for whom the financial ability to allow one's wife to remain at home was a mark of high status.<ref name=seclusion-doumato/><ref name=seclusion-patel/> In some regions, such as the Arabian peninsula, seclusion of women was practiced by poor families at the cost of great hardship, but it was generally economically unrealistic for the lower classes.<ref name=seclusion-doumato/>\n\nWhere historical evidence is available, it indicates that the harem was much more likely to be monogamous. For example, in late Ottoman Istanbul, only 2.29 percent of married men were polygynous, with the average number of wives being 2.08. In some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, prevalence of women in agricultural work leads to wider practice of polygyny, but makes seclusion impractical. In contrast, in Eurasian and North African rural communities that rely on male-dominated plough farming, seclusion is economically possible but polygyny is undesirable. This indicates that the fundamental characteristic of the harem is seclusion of women rather than polygyny.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Schi\u0307ck, \u0130rvi\u0307n Cemi\u0307l | year= 2009 | title=Space: Harem: Overview|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures|editor=Suad Joseph|publisher=Brill| doi= 10.1163/1872-5309_ewic_EWICCOM_0283 }}</ref>\n\n== Pre-Islamic origins ==\nThe idea of the harem or seclusion of women did not originate with [[Muhammad]] or [[Islam]].{{sfn|Britannica|2002}} The practice of secluding women was common to many [[Ancient Near East]] communities, especially where polygamy was permitted.<ref name=Brit>{{EB1911|noprescript=1|wstitle=Harem}}</ref> In pre-Islamic Assyria, Persia, and Egypt, most royal courts had a harem, where the ruler\u2019s wives and concubines lived with female attendants, and eunuchs.{{sfn|Britannica|2002}} ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]'' uses the term ''harem'' to describe the practices of the ancient Near East.<ref name=iranica-ancient>{{cite encyclopedia|author=A.

According to Greek sources, the nobility of the [[Medes]] kept no less than five wives who were watched over by eunuchs.<ref name=iranica-ancient/> Greek historians report that Persian notables of the [[Achaemenid empire]] as well as the king himself had several wives and a larger number of concubines. The [[Old Persian]] word for the harem is not attested, but it can be reconstructed as ''x\u0161ap\u0101.st\u0101na'' (lit. night station or place where one spends the night). The chief consort, who was usually the mother of the heir to the throne, was in charge of the household. She had her own living quarters, revenues, and a large staff. Three other groups of women lives in separate quarters: the other legal wives, royal princesses, and concubines.<ref name=iranica-ancient/> The Achaemenid harem served as a model for later Iranian empires, and the institution remained almost unchanged. Little is known about the harems of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], but the information about the [[Sasanian]] harem reveals a picture that closely mirrors Achaemenid customs. A peculiar characteristic of the Sasanian royalty and aristocracy, which was attested in later times under the Safavid and Qajar empires, was that the highest female rank was not necessarily given to the chief wife, but could be held by a daughter or a sister.<ref name=iranica-ancient/>\n\nAccording to [[Sasanian]] legend, of all the Persian kings, [[Khosrow II]] was the most extravagant in his hedonism. He searched his realm to find the most beautiful girls, and it was rumored that about 3,000 of them were kept in his harem. This practice was widely condemned and it was counted as one of the crimes for which he was later tried and executed. Khosrow himself claimed that he sent his favorite wife [[Shirin]] every year to offer them a possibility of leaving his harem with a dowry for marriage, but that their luxurious lifestyle always prompted them to refuse his offer.<ref name=iranica-ancient/>\n\nSouth Asian traditions of female seclusion, called ''[[purdah]]'', may have been influenced by Islamic customs, but the practice of segregation by gender in [[Hindu]] society predates the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Kumkum Chatterjee|title=Purdah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to the Body|editor=Colin Blakemore |editor2=Sheila Jennett|page=570|quote=Purdah [...] refers to the various modes of shielding women from the sight primarily of men (other than their husbands or men of their natal family) in the South Asian subcontinent.

Conquests had brought enormous wealth and large numbers of slaves to the Muslim elite. The majority of the slaves were women and children,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Morony, Michael G.

As the size of the harem grew, men indulged to satiety. Satiety within the individual harem meant boredom for the one man and neglect for the many women. Under these conditions ... satisfaction by perverse and unnatural means crept into society, particularly in its upper classes.<ref name=\"Abbott, Nabia 1946\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe marketing of human beings, particularly women, as objects for sexual use meant that elite men owned the vast majority of women they interacted with, and related to them as would masters to slaves.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=85}} Being a slave meant relative lack of autonomy during this time period, and belonging to a harem caused a wife and her children to have little insurance of stability and continued support due to the volatile politics of harem life.\n\nElite men expressed in literature the horror they felt for the humiliation and degradation of their daughters and female relatives. For example, the verses addressed to Hasan ibn al-Firat on the death of his daughter read:\n:: To Abu Hassan I offer condolences.\n:: At times of disaster and catastrophe\n:: God multiplies rewards for the patient.\n:: To be patient in misery\n:: Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift.\n:: Among the blessings of God undoubtedly\n:: Is the preservation of sons\n:: And the death of daughters.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=87}}\n\nEven so, courtesans and princesses produced prestigious and important poetry.

In contrast to the medieval European views, which conceived Muslim women as victimized but powerful through their charms and deceit, during the era of European colonialism the \"imaginary harem\" came to represent what Orientalist scholars saw as an abased and subjugated status of women in the Islamic civilization. These notions served to cast the West as culturally superior and justify the colonial enterprise.<ref name=EIMW/> Under the influence of [[The Thousand and One Nights]], the harem was often conceived as a personal brothel, where numerous women lounged in suggestive poses, directing their strong but oppressed sexuality toward a single man in a form of \"competitive lust\".<ref name=OEIW/><ref name=EIMW/>\n\nA centuries-old theme in Western culture is the depiction of European women forcibly taken into Oriental harems\u2014evident for example in the [[Mozart]] opera ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' (\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\") concerning the attempt of the hero Belmonte to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the ''seraglio''/harem of the [[Pasha]] Selim; or in [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'', in chapter 12 of which the old woman relates her experiences of being sold into harems across the Ottoman Empire.\n\nMuch of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Il corsaro]]'' takes place in the harem of the Pasha Seid\u2014where Gulnara, the Pasha's favorite, chafes at life in the harem, and longs for freedom and true love. Eventually she falls in love with the dashing invading corsair Corrado, kills the Pasha and escapes with the corsair\u2014only to discover that he loves another woman.\n\n''[[The Lustful Turk]]'', a well-known British [[erotic]] novel, was also based on the theme of Western women forced into sexual slavery in the harem of the [[Dey]] of [[Algiers]], while in ''[[A Night in a Moorish Harem]]'', a Western man is invited into a harem and engages in forbidden sex with nine concubines. In both works, the theme of \"West vs. Orient\" is clearly interwoven with the sexual themes.\n\nThe [[The Sheik (novel)|Sheik]] novel and the [[The Sheik (film)|Sheik]] film, a Hollywood production from 1921, are both controversial and probably the best known works created by exploiting the motif.<ref name=up>[http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/13513.html \"The Sheik\"].

It comes from the [[Arabic]] ''\u1e25ar\u012bm'', which can mean \"a sacred inviolable place\", \"harem\" or  \"female members of the family\". In English the term harem can mean also \"the wives (or concubines) of a polygamous man.\" The [[triliteral]] ''[[\u1e24-R-M]]'' appears in other terms related to the notion of interdiction such as ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden), ''[[mahram]]'' (unmarriageable relative), ''[[ihram]]'' (a pilgrim's state of ritual consecration during the [[Hajj]]) and ''al-\u1e24aram al-\u0160ar\u012bf'' (\"the noble sanctuary\", which can refer to the [[Temple Mount]] or the sanctuary of [[Mecca]]).{{sfn|Wehr|1976|pp=171-172}}\n\nIn [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish of the Ottoman era]], the harem, i.e., the part of the house reserved for women was called ''[[Haremlik|hareml\u0131k]]'', while the space open for men was known as ''[[Selamlik|selaml\u0131k]]''.{{sfn|Quataert|2005|p=152}}\n\nThe practice of female seclusion is not exclusive to Islam, but the English word harem usually denotes the domestic space reserved for women in Muslim households.<ref name=seclusion-patel/><ref>{{Dictionary.com|harem|accessdate=2017-04-04}}</ref> Some scholars have used the term to refer to polygynous royal households throughout history.{{sfn|Betzig|2013}}\n\n==''The ideal of seclusion''==\n[[File:4 New entrant to a princes harem. Jaipur, late 18 century, National Museum New Delhi (2).jpg|thumb|New entrant to a prince's harem. Jaipur, late 18 century, National Museum, New Delhi]]\n\n[[Leila Ahmed]] describes the ''ideal of seclusion'' as a \"a man's right to keep his women concealed\u2014invisible to other men.\" Ahmed identifies the practice of seclusion as a social ideal and one of the major factors that shaped the lives of women in the Mediterranean Middle East. {{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=103}}  For example, contemporary sources from the Byzantine Empire describe the social mores that governed women's lives. Women were not supposed to be seen in public. They were guarded by eunuchs and could only leave the home \"veiled and suitably chaperoned.\" Some of these customs were borrowed from the Persians, but Greek society also influenced the development of patriarchal tradition.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|pp=26-28}}\n\nThe ideal of seclusion was not fully realized as social reality.  This was in part because working class women often held jobs that required interaction with men.<ref name=seclusion-patel>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Youshaa Patel|title=Seclusion|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t355/e0184|url-access=subscription}}</ref>  In the Byzantine empire, the very ideal of gender segregation created economic opportunities for women as midwives, doctors, bath attendants and artisans, since it was considered inappropriate for men to attend to women's needs. At times women lent and invested money and engaged in other commercial activities.\n{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=27}} Historical records shows that the women of 14th-century [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] Cairo freely visited public events alongside men, despite objections of religious scholars.<ref name=seclusion-patel/> The practice of gender segregation in Islam was influenced by an interplay of religion, customs and politics.<ref name=seclusion-doumato/><ref name=seclusion-patel/>\n\nFemale seclusion has historically signaled social and economic prestige.<ref name=seclusion-patel/> Eventually, the norms of female seclusion spread beyond the elites, but the practice remained characteristic of upper and middle classes, for whom the financial ability to allow one's wife to remain at home was a mark of high status.<ref name=seclusion-doumato/><ref name=seclusion-patel/> In some regions, such as the Arabian peninsula, seclusion of women was practiced by poor families at the cost of great hardship, but it was generally economically unrealistic for the lower classes.<ref name=seclusion-doumato/>\n\nWhere historical evidence is available, it indicates that the harem was much more likely to be monogamous. For example, in late Ottoman Istanbul, only 2.29 percent of married men were polygynous, with the average number of wives being 2.08. In some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, prevalence of women in agricultural work leads to wider practice of polygyny, but makes seclusion impractical. In contrast, in Eurasian and North African rural communities that rely on male-dominated plough farming, seclusion is economically possible but polygyny is undesirable. This indicates that the fundamental characteristic of the harem is seclusion of women rather than polygyny.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Schi\u0307ck, \u0130rvi\u0307n Cemi\u0307l | year= 2009 | title=Space: Harem: Overview|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Women & Islamic Cultures|editor=Suad Joseph|publisher=Brill| doi= 10.1163/1872-5309_ewic_EWICCOM_0283 }}</ref>\n\n== Pre-Islamic origins ==\nThe idea of the harem or seclusion of women did not originate with [[Muhammad]] or [[Islam]].{{sfn|Britannica|2002}} The practice of secluding women was common to many [[Ancient Near East]] communities, especially where polygamy was permitted.<ref name=Brit>{{EB1911|noprescript=1|wstitle=Harem}}</ref> In pre-Islamic Assyria, Persia, and Egypt, most royal courts had a harem, where the ruler\u2019s wives and concubines lived with female attendants, and eunuchs.{{sfn|Britannica|2002}} ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]]'' uses the term ''harem'' to describe the practices of the ancient Near East.<ref name=iranica-ancient>{{cite encyclopedia|author=A.

According to Greek sources, the nobility of the [[Medes]] kept no less than five wives who were watched over by eunuchs.<ref name=iranica-ancient/> Greek historians report that Persian notables of the [[Achaemenid empire]] as well as the king himself had several wives and a larger number of concubines. The [[Old Persian]] word for the harem is not attested, but it can be reconstructed as ''x\u0161ap\u0101.st\u0101na'' (lit. night station or place where one spends the night). The chief consort, who was usually the mother of the heir to the throne, was in charge of the household. She had her own living quarters, revenues, and a large staff. Three other groups of women lives in separate quarters: the other legal wives, royal princesses, and concubines.<ref name=iranica-ancient/> The Achaemenid harem served as a model for later Iranian empires, and the institution remained almost unchanged. Little is known about the harems of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], but the information about the [[Sasanian]] harem reveals a picture that closely mirrors Achaemenid customs. A peculiar characteristic of the Sasanian royalty and aristocracy, which was attested in later times under the Safavid and Qajar empires, was that the highest female rank was not necessarily given to the chief wife, but could be held by a daughter or a sister.<ref name=iranica-ancient/>\n\nAccording to [[Sasanian]] legend, of all the Persian kings, [[Khosrow II]] was the most extravagant in his hedonism. He searched his realm to find the most beautiful girls, and it was rumored that about 3,000 of them were kept in his harem. This practice was widely condemned and it was counted as one of the crimes for which he was later tried and executed. Khosrow himself claimed that he sent his favorite wife [[Shirin]] every year to offer them a possibility of leaving his harem with a dowry for marriage, but that their luxurious lifestyle always prompted them to refuse his offer.<ref name=iranica-ancient/>\n\nSouth Asian traditions of female seclusion, called ''[[purdah]]'', may have been influenced by Islamic customs, but the practice of segregation by gender in [[Hindu]] society predates the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Kumkum Chatterjee|title=Purdah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to the Body|editor=Colin Blakemore |editor2=Sheila Jennett|page=570|quote=Purdah [...] refers to the various modes of shielding women from the sight primarily of men (other than their husbands or men of their natal family) in the South Asian subcontinent.

Conquests had brought enormous wealth and large numbers of slaves to the Muslim elite. The majority of the slaves were women and children,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Morony, Michael G. Iraq after the Muslim conquest. Gorgias Press LLC, 2005</ref> many of whom had been dependents or harem-members of the defeated [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] upper classes.<ref name=\"Abbott, Nabia 1946\">Abbott, Nabia.

As the size of the harem grew, men indulged to satiety. Satiety within the individual harem meant boredom for the one man and neglect for the many women. Under these conditions ... satisfaction by perverse and unnatural means crept into society, particularly in its upper classes.<ref name=\"Abbott, Nabia 1946\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe marketing of human beings, particularly women, as objects for sexual use meant that elite men owned the vast majority of women they interacted with, and related to them as would masters to slaves.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=85}} Being a slave meant relative lack of autonomy during this time period, and belonging to a harem caused a wife and her children to have little insurance of stability and continued support due to the volatile politics of harem life.\n\nElite men expressed in literature the horror they felt for the humiliation and degradation of their daughters and female relatives. For example, the verses addressed to Hasan ibn al-Firat on the death of his daughter read:\n:: To Abu Hassan I offer condolences.\n:: At times of disaster and catastrophe\n:: God multiplies rewards for the patient.\n:: To be patient in misery\n:: Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift.\n:: Among the blessings of God undoubtedly\n:: Is the preservation of sons\n:: And the death of daughters.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=87}}\n\nEven so, courtesans and princesses produced prestigious and important poetry.

[[Nur Jahan]], chief consort of [[Jahangir]], was the most powerful and influential woman at court during a period when the Mughal Empire was at the peak of its power and glory. More decisive and proactive than her husband, she is considered by historians to have been the real [[power behind the throne]] for more than fifteen years. Nur Jahan was granted certain honours and privileges which were never enjoyed by any Mughal empress before or after. Nur Jahan was the only Mughal empress to have coinage struck in her name.<ref>{{harvnb|Nath|1990|p=64}}</ref> She was often present when the Emperor held court, and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell. She was given charge of his imperial seal, implying that her perusal and consent were necessary before any document or order received legal validity. The Emperor sought her views on most matters before issuing orders. The only other Mughal empress to command such devotion from her husband was Nur Jahan's niece [[Mumtaz Mahal]], for whom [[Shah Jahan]] built the [[Taj Mahal]] as a mausoleum. However, Mumtaz took no interest in affairs of state and Nur Jahan is therefore unique in the annals of the Mughal Empire for the political influence she wielded.\n\n===Safavid Empire===\n\nThe royal harem played an important role in the history of [[Safavid Empire|Safavid Persia]].

In contrast to the medieval European views, which conceived Muslim women as victimized but powerful through their charms and deceit, during the era of European colonialism the \"imaginary harem\" came to represent what Orientalist scholars saw as an abased and subjugated status of women in the Islamic civilization. These notions served to cast the West as culturally superior and justify the colonial enterprise.<ref name=EIMW/> Under the influence of [[The Thousand and One Nights]], the harem was often conceived as a personal brothel, where numerous women lounged in suggestive poses, directing their strong but oppressed sexuality toward a single man in a form of \"competitive lust\".<ref name=OEIW/><ref name=EIMW/>\n\nA centuries-old theme in Western culture is the depiction of European women forcibly taken into Oriental harems\u2014evident for example in the [[Mozart]] opera ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' (\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\") concerning the attempt of the hero Belmonte to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the ''seraglio''/harem of the [[Pasha]] Selim; or in [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'', in chapter 12 of which the old woman relates her experiences of being sold into harems across the Ottoman Empire.\n\nMuch of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Il corsaro]]'' takes place in the harem of the Pasha Seid\u2014where Gulnara, the Pasha's favorite, chafes at life in the harem, and longs for freedom and true love. Eventually she falls in love with the dashing invading corsair Corrado, kills the Pasha and escapes with the corsair\u2014only to discover that he loves another woman.\n\n''[[The Lustful Turk]]'', a well-known British [[erotic]] novel, was also based on the theme of Western women forced into sexual slavery in the harem of the [[Dey]] of [[Algiers]], while in ''[[A Night in a Moorish Harem]]'', a Western man is invited into a harem and engages in forbidden sex with nine concubines. In both works, the theme of \"West vs. Orient\" is clearly interwoven with the sexual themes.\n\nThe [[The Sheik (novel)|Sheik]] novel and the [[The Sheik (film)|Sheik]] film, a Hollywood production from 1921, are both controversial and probably the best known works created by exploiting the motif.<ref name=up>[http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/13513.html \"The Sheik\"].

[[Kerbala]], against [[corruption]] and a national government that protestors saw as unaccountable for its actions. After the [[History of Iraq (2003\u20132011)|U.S. occupation (2003\u201311)]], oligarchs and warlords were perceived to have taken control over Iraq. While the country produces more oil than the [[United Arab Emirates]], the oil revenues were seen by protestors as failing to be spent on maintenance of hospitals and roads. A widely used slogan in this phase of the protests was: \"We want a homeland\"\u2014reflecting a longing both for a sense of unity and for a self-determined life in dignity.<ref name=Zeit13Nov>{{in lang|de}} [https://www.zeit.de/2019/47/irak-proteste-iran-vorherrschaft-naher-osten 'Sie wollen B\u00fcrger sein' (They want to be citizens)].

Retrieved 28 November 2019.</ref>\n\nWhile at daytime protesters from all strata of Iraqi society peacefully took to the streets and squares of cities like Kerbala, later at night, youths from the suburbs sought violent confrontations, using [[molotov cocktail]]s and burning car-tyres, which was answered by the state security forces with tear gas, rubber bullets, deadly snipers and even patrol vehicles lethally ramming into crowds.<ref name=Zeit13Nov/>\n\n=== Role of ''Intercept'' Iranian influence report ===\n{{Main|The Iran Cables (2019)}}\nA leaked 700-page document reported on 18 November by ''[[The Intercept]]'' and shared with ''[[The New York Times]]'' documented \"far more than was previously understood about the extent to which Iran and the United States [had] used Iraq as a staging area for their spy games.\" The documents were mostly Iranian intelligence officials' communications from their visits to Iraq in 2014 and 2015.<ref name=\"Intercept_Iranian_SpyComplexRevealed\" /> ''[[Al-Monitor]]'' described the report as having \"shaken Iraq's political foundations, giving more energy and persistence to the protestors and exposing huge scandals that affect almost all Iraqi politicians.\"<ref name=\"alMonitor_Intercept_report\" /> ''The Intercept'' highlighted a report of a meeting at the Iranian Embassy in Baghdad in relation to the concern that [[Haider al-Abadi]], a proposed new prime minister for Iraq, was not sufficiently under Iranian influence. The meeting expressed satisfaction that eight of the ministers under Abadi were sufficiently \"in complete harmony\", \"close\", in a \"special relationship\" or \"loyal to\" Iran, including Foreign Minister [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]] and Minister of Transportation [[Baqir Jabr al-Zubeidi|Bayan Jabr Solagh]], and two were \"better than the previous [ones]\".

Friends of the victims and security services told ''[[Thomson Reuters]]'' that the assassination had been ordered by an Iran-backed militia. Interviews by ''Thomson Reuters'' with officials and activists indicated a \"pattern of mass arrests, intimidation and torture, and in some cases targeted killings of Iraqi protesters\", with six activists \"shot dead in or near their homes\" over the year from November 2018 to October 2019, that was attributed by the interviewees to an Iran-backed militia. The activists had criticized the militias and been threatened for their activism. In November, gunmen in unmarked cars killed activist Adnan Rustum in Baghdad and another activist in Amara.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAn Iranian official contacted by ''Thomson Reuters'' said the claims of assassinations and threats by Iran-backed militias were \"baseless\".{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Iraqi Prime Minister stated during a parliament meeting, \u201cHuge demonstrations against me duly materialized and Trump called again to threaten that if I did not comply with his demands, then he would have Marine snipers on tall buildings target protesters and security personnel alike in order to pressure me. I refused again and handed in my resignation. To this day the Americans insist on us rescinding our deal with the Chinese.\u201d Mahdi says he was also \u201cthreatened with false-flag sniper shootings of both protesters and security personnel in order to inflame the situation\u201d, \u201cAfter this, when our Minister of Defense publicly stated that a third party was targeting both protestors and security personnel alike (just as Trump had threatened he would do), I received a new call from Trump threatening to kill both me and the Minister of Defense if we kept on talking about this \u201cthird party\u201d.\n\nTwo Iraqi security officials contacted by ''Thomson Reuters'' stated the beating and electrocution of detained protestors, and the [[coercion|forcing]] of detained protestors to promise media silence were common. Iraqi government security spokesperson Abdul Karim Khalaf said that any evidence of torture should be investigated but no claims had been confirmed.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\nThe [[human rights in Iraq|human rights]] committee of the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|Iraqi parliament]] called for an official investigation into the \"' assassinations and kidnappings' of activists and bloggers.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nHassan Wahab of the Amal Association [[human rights group]] said, \"Those [protestors] detained and released are only released on bail.

[[Kerbala]], against [[corruption]] and a national government that protestors saw as unaccountable for its actions. After the [[History of Iraq (2003\u20132011)|U.S. occupation (2003\u201311)]], oligarchs and warlords were perceived to have taken control over Iraq. While the country produces more oil than the [[United Arab Emirates]], the oil revenues were seen by protestors as failing to be spent on maintenance of hospitals and roads. A widely used slogan in this phase of the protests was: \"We want a homeland\"\u2014reflecting a longing both for a sense of unity and for a self-determined life in dignity.<ref name=Zeit13Nov>{{in lang|de}} [https://www.zeit.de/2019/47/irak-proteste-iran-vorherrschaft-naher-osten 'Sie wollen B\u00fcrger sein' (They want to be citizens)].

Friends of the victims and security services told ''[[Thomson Reuters]]'' that the assassination had been ordered by an Iran-backed militia. Interviews by ''Thomson Reuters'' with officials and activists indicated a \"pattern of mass arrests, intimidation and torture, and in some cases targeted killings of Iraqi protesters\", with six activists \"shot dead in or near their homes\" over the year from November 2018 to October 2019, that was attributed by the interviewees to an Iran-backed militia. The activists had criticized the militias and been threatened for their activism. In November, gunmen in unmarked cars killed activist Adnan Rustum in Baghdad and another activist in Amara.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAn Iranian official contacted by ''Thomson Reuters'' said the claims of assassinations and threats by Iran-backed militias were \"baseless\".{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Iraqi Prime Minister stated during a parliament meeting, \u201cHuge demonstrations against me duly materialized and Trump called again to threaten that if I did not comply with his demands, then he would have Marine snipers on tall buildings target protesters and security personnel alike in order to pressure me. I refused again and handed in my resignation.

They are used in areas where drinking water is unavailable, so that clean water is obtained from dirty water or from plants by exposing them to sunlight.\n\nThere are many types of solar still, including large scale [[concentrated solar still]]s and '''condensation traps''' (better known as '''moisture traps''' amongst [[survivalists]]). In a solar still, impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic or glass.

A pit is dug into the earth, at the bottom of which is placed the receptacle that will be used to catch the condensed water. Small branches are placed with one of their ends inside the receptacle and their other ends up over the edge of the pit, forming a funnel to direct the condensed water into the receptacle. A lid is then built over this funnel, using more small branches, leaves, grasses, etc. The completed trap is left overnight, and moisture can be collected from the receptacle in the morning.\n\nThis method relies on the formation of [[dew]] or [[frost]] on the receptacle, funnel, and lid. Forming dew collects on and runs down the outside of the funnel and into the receptacle. This water would typically [[evaporate]] with the morning sun and thus vanish, but the lid traps the evaporating water and raises the [[humidity]] within the trap, reducing the amount of water that is lost. The shade produced by the lid also reduces the temperature within the trap, which further reduces the rate of water loss to\n\n=== Modern method ===\nToday, with the advent of [[plastic]] sheeting, the moisture trap has become more efficient.\n\nThe method is very similar to that described above, but a single sheet of plastic is used instead of branches and leaves. The greater efficiency of this type of trap arises from the waterproof nature of the plastic, which doesn't let any water vapour pass through it (some water vapour escapes through the leaves and branches of the first method). This efficiency requires a certain amount of diligence of the part of the user, in that the plastic sheet must be firmly attached to the ground on all sides; this is often accomplished by using stones to weight the sheet down and/or covering the edges of the plastic sheet with earth (such as that dug out to make the hole in which the trap sits). Weighting the centre of the plastic sheet down with a stone forms the funnel via which the condensed water will run into the receptacle.\n\n=== Transpiration method ===\nWater can be obtained by placing clear plastic bags over the leafy branch of a ''non-poisonous'' tree and tightly closing the bag's open end around the branch.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Meagher|first1=Bert|last2=Reid|first2=Dennis|last3=Harvey|first3=Ross|title=Aids to survival: a handbook on outback survival|date=2007|publisher=Western Australia Police Academy|location=Maylands, W.A.|isbn=978-0-646-36303-5|page=24|edition=25th|url=http://www.vks737.on.net/pdfs/survival.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref> Any holes in the bag must be sealed to prevent the loss of water vapour.\n\nDuring photosynthesis plants lose water through a process called [[transpiration]]. A clear plastic bag sealed around a branch allows photosynthesis to continue, but traps the evaporating water causing the [[vapour pressure]] of water to rise to a point where it begins to condense on the surface of the plastic bag. Gravity then causes the water to run to the lowest part of the bag. Water is collected by [[tap (valve)|tapping]] the bag and then resealing it. The leaves will continue to produce water as the roots draw it from the ground and photosynthesis occurs.\n\nThe vapour pressure of water in the sealed bag can rise so high that the leaves can no longer transpire, consequently when using this method, the water should be drained off every two hours and stored. Tests indicate that if this is not done the leaves stop producing water.\n\nIf there are no large trees in the area, clumps of grass or small bushes can be placed inside the bag. If this is done the foliage will have to be replaced at regular intervals when water production is reduced, particularly if the foliage must be uprooted to place it in the bag.\n\nEfficiency is greatest when the bag receives maximum sunshine at all times. Exposed roots are tested for water content. Soft, pulpy roots will yield the greatest amount of liquid for the least amount of effort.\n\n== Condensation trap efficiency ==\nCondensation traps are not in themselves a sustainable source of water; they are sources for extending or supplementing existing water sources or supplies, and should not be relied on to provide a person's daily requirement for water, since a trap measuring {{cvt|400|mm}} in diameter by {{cvt|300|mm}} deep will only yield around {{cvt|100|to|150|mL|USfloz}} per day.\n\nOne method to increase the water output is to [[urinate]] into the pit before placing the receptacle in. This increases the moisture content of the earth, reducing the amount of water vapour that the earth can subsequently absorb.\n\n==Materials==\nA simple basin-type solar still can be constructed with 2\u20134 stones, plastic film or transparent [[glass]], a central weight to make a point and a container for the condensate. A cubic hole in moist ground is created of about {{cvt|300|mm}} on each side. Into the centre of this hole, a collection container is placed. Then a sheet of plastic film is stretched over the hole. Stills can also be made from water bottles or plastic bags.<ref>[http://www.instructables.com/id/Uncle-Johns-portable-solar-water-distiller-Fo/]</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Transpiration bag===\nAn alternative method of the solar still is called the transpiration bag.<ref>Munilla, R.
