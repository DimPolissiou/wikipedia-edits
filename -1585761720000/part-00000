In order to make Microsoft Bob more accessible for its intended audience, he decided to create a new face based on the lettering style of comic books he had in his office, specifically ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (lettered by [[John Costanza]]) and ''[[Watchmen]]'' (lettered by [[Dave Gibbons]]).<ref name=\"wsj-ill-will\">{{cite news\n| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123992364819927171\n| title = Typeface Inspired by Comic Books Has Become a Font of Ill Will\n| accessdate = 2009-04-19\n| date = 2009-04-17\n| last = Steel\n| first = Emily\n| work = [[The Wall Street Journal]]\n| publisher = [[Dow Jones & Company, Inc.]]\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090420022303/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123992364819927171.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\n| archivedate = 2009-04-20\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nHe completed the face too late for inclusion in Microsoft Bob, but the programmers of [[3D Movie Maker|Microsoft 3D Movie Maker]], which also used cartoon guides and speech bubbles adopted it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techspot.com/trivia/41-now-world-most-hated-font-comic-sans-first/|title=Now the world's most hated font, Comic Sans was first used in what Microsoft product?|website=TechSpot}}</ref> The speech bubbles eventually were phased out and replaced by actual sound, but Comic Sans stayed for the program\u2019s [[pop-up window]]s and help sections.

{"title_page": "M\u00f6bius transformation", "text_new": "{{Short description|Rational function of the form (az + b)/(cz + d)}}\n{{distinguish|M\u00f6bius transform|M\u00f6bius function}}\n\nIn [[geometry]] and [[complex analysis]], a '''M\u00f6bius transformation''' of the [[complex plane]] is a [[rational function]] of the form\n\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{a z + b}{c z + d}</math>\n\nof one [[complex number|complex]] variable ''z''; here the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are complex numbers satisfying ''ad'' \u2212 ''bc'' \u2260 0.\n\nGeometrically, a M\u00f6bius transformation can be obtained by first performing [[stereographic projection]] from the plane to the [[sphere|unit two-sphere]], rotating and moving the sphere to a new location and orientation in space, and then performing stereographic projection (from the new position of the sphere) to the plane.{{sfn|Arnold|Rogness|2008|loc=Theorem 1}}\nThese transformations preserve angles, map every straight line to a line or circle, and map every circle to a line or circle.\n\nThe M\u00f6bius transformations are the [[projective transformation]]s of the [[complex projective line]]. They form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the '''M\u00f6bius group''', which is the [[projective linear group]] PGL(2,'''C'''). Together with its [[subgroup]]s, it has numerous applications in mathematics and physics.\n\nM\u00f6bius transformations are named in honor of [[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius]]; they are also variously named '''[[homography|homographies]]''', '''homographic transformations''', '''linear fractional transformations''', '''bilinear transformations''', or '''fractional linear transformations'''.\n\n== Overview ==\nM\u00f6bius transformations are defined on the [[Riemann sphere|extended complex plane]] <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}} = \\mathbf{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}</math> (i.e., the [[complex plane]] augmented by the [[point at infinity]]).\n\n[[Stereographic projection]] identifies <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}</math> with a sphere, which is then called the [[Riemann sphere]]; alternatively, <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}</math> can be thought of as the complex [[projective line]] <math>\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{P}^1</math>.  The M\u00f6bius transformations are exactly the [[bijective]] [[conformal map|conformal]] maps from the Riemann sphere to itself, i.e., the [[automorphism group|automorphisms]] of the Riemann sphere as a [[complex manifold]]; alternatively, they are the automorphisms of <math>\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{P}^1</math> as an algebraic variety.  Therefore, the set of all M\u00f6bius transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]].  This group is called the M\u00f6bius group, and is sometimes denoted <math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}})\\,</math>.\n\nThe M\u00f6bius group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the group of orientation-preserving [[isometry|isometries]] of [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] and therefore plays an important role when studying [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s.\n\nIn [[physics]], the [[identity component]] of the [[Lorentz group]] acts on the [[celestial sphere]] in the same way that the M\u00f6bius group acts on the Riemann sphere. In fact, these two groups are isomorphic. An observer who accelerates to relativistic velocities will see the pattern of constellations as seen near the Earth continuously transform according to infinitesimal M\u00f6bius transformations. This observation is often taken as the starting point of [[twistor theory]].\n\nCertain [[subgroup]]s of the M\u00f6bius group form the automorphism groups of the other [[simply-connected]] Riemann surfaces (the [[complex plane]] and the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]]). As such, M\u00f6bius transformations play an important role in the theory of [[Riemann surface]]s. The [[fundamental group]] of every Riemann surface is a [[discrete subgroup]] of the M\u00f6bius group (see [[Fuchsian group]] and [[Kleinian group]]).\nA particularly important discrete subgroup of the M\u00f6bius group is the [[modular group]]; it is central to the theory of many [[fractal]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[elliptic curve]]s and [[Pellian equation]]s.\n\nM\u00f6bius transformations can be more generally defined in spaces of dimension ''n''>2 as the bijective conformal orientation-preserving maps from the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] to the ''n''-sphere. Such a transformation is the most general form of conformal mapping of a domain. According to [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)|Liouville's theorem]] a M\u00f6bius transformation can be expressed as a composition of translations, [[Similarity (geometry)|similarities]], orthogonal transformations and inversions.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe general form of a M\u00f6bius transformation is given by\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{a z + b}{c z + d}</math>\nwhere ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are any [[complex number]]s satisfying {{math|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc'' \u2260 0}}. If {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}, the rational function defined above is a constant since\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{a z + b}{c z + d} = \\frac{a(cz+d)}{c(cz+d)} - \\frac{a d -bc}{c(c z + d)} = \\frac{a}{c}</math>\nand is thus not considered a M\u00f6bius transformation.\n\nIn case {{math|''c'' \u2260 0}}, this definition is extended to the whole [[Riemann sphere]] by defining\n:<math>f\\left(\\frac{-d}{c}\\right) = \\infin \\text{ and } f(\\infin) = \\frac{a}{c}.</math>\n\nIf {{math|1=''c'' = 0}}, we define\n:<math>f(\\infin) = \\infin.</math>\n\nThus a M\u00f6bius transformation is always a bijective [[holomorphic function]] from the Riemann sphere to the Riemann sphere.\n\nThe set of all M\u00f6bius transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]]. This group can be given the structure of a [[complex manifold]] in such a way that composition and inversion are [[holomorphic map]]s. The M\u00f6bius group is then a [[complex Lie group]]. The M\u00f6bius group is usually denoted <math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}})</math> as it is the [[automorphism group]] of the Riemann sphere.\n\n== Fixed points ==\nEvery non-identity M\u00f6bius transformation has two [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] <math>\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2</math> on the Riemann sphere. Note that the fixed points are counted here with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]; the parabolic transformations are those where the fixed points coincide. Either or both of these fixed points may be the point at infinity.\n\n=== Determining the fixed points ===\nThe fixed points of the transformation\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}</math>\nare obtained by solving the fixed point equation f(\u03b3) = \u03b3. For ''c'' \u2260 0, this has two roots obtained by expanding this equation to\n:<math>c \\gamma^2 - (a - d) \\gamma - b = 0 \\ ,</math>\nand applying the [[quadratic formula]]. The roots are\n:<math>\\gamma_{1,2} = \\frac{(a - d) \\pm \\sqrt{(a-d)^2 + 4bc}}{2c} = \\frac{(a - d) \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2c}</math>\nwith discriminant\n:<math> \\Delta =(\\operatorname{tr}\\mathfrak{H})^2 - 4\\operatorname{det}\\mathfrak{H}=(a+d)^2 - 4(ad-bc)</math>.\nParabolic transforms have coincidental fixed points due to zero discriminant. For ''c'' nonzero and nonzero discriminant the transform is elliptic or hyperbolic.\n\nWhen ''c'' = 0, the quadratic equation degenerates into a linear equation and the transform is linear. This corresponds to the situation that one of the fixed points is the point at infinity. When ''a'' \u2260 ''d'' the second fixed point is finite and is given by\n\n:<math>\\gamma=-\\frac{b}{a-d}.</math>\n\nIn this case the transformation will be a simple transformation composed of [[translation (mathematics)|translation]]s, [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, and [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]]s:\n\n:<math>z \\mapsto \\alpha z + \\beta.\\,</math>\n\nIf ''c'' = 0 and ''a'' = ''d'', then both fixed points are at infinity, and the M\u00f6bius transformation corresponds to a pure translation:\n:<math>z \\mapsto z + \\beta.</math>\n\n=== Topological proof ===\nTopologically, the fact that (non-identity) M\u00f6bius transformations fix 2 points (with multiplicity) corresponds to the [[Euler characteristic]] of the sphere being 2:\n:<math>\\chi(\\hat{\\mathbf{C}})=2.</math>\n\nFirstly, the [[projective linear group]] PGL(2,''K'') is [[n-transitive|sharply 3-transitive]]&nbsp;\u2013 for any two ordered triples of distinct points, there is a unique map that takes one triple to the other, just as for M\u00f6bius transforms, and by the same algebraic proof (essentially [[dimension counting]], as the group is 3-dimensional). Thus any map that fixes at least 3 points is the identity.\n\nNext, one can see by identifying the  M\u00f6bius group with <math>PGL(2,\\mathbb C)</math> that any M\u00f6bius function is homotopic to the identity. Indeed, any member of the [[general linear group]] can be reduced to the identity map by Gauss-Jordan elimination, this shows that the projective linear group is path-connected as well, providing a homotopy to the identity map. The [[Lefschetz\u2013Hopf theorem]] states that the sum of the indices (in this context, multiplicity) of the fixed points of a map with finitely many fixed points equals the [[Lefschetz number]] of the map, which in this case is the trace of the identity map on homology groups, which is simply the Euler characteristic.\n\nBy contrast, the projective linear group of the real projective line, PGL(2,'''R''') need not fix any points&nbsp;\u2013 for example <math>(1+x)/(1-x)</math> has no (real) fixed points: as a complex transformation it fixes \u00b1''i''<ref group=\"note\">Geometrically this map is the [[stereographic projection]] of a rotation by 90\u00b0 around \u00b1''i'' with period 4, which takes <math>0 \\mapsto 1 \\mapsto \\infty \\mapsto -1 \\mapsto 0.</math></ref>&nbsp;\u2013 while the map 2''x'' fixes the two points of 0 and \u221e. This corresponds to the fact that the Euler characteristic of the circle (real projective line) is 0, and thus the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says only that it must fix at least 0 points, but possibly more.\n\n=== Normal form ===\nM\u00f6bius transformations are also sometimes written in terms of their fixed points in so-called '''normal form'''. We first treat the non-parabolic case, for which there are two distinct fixed points.\n\n''Non-parabolic case'':\n\nEvery non-parabolic transformation is [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to a dilation/rotation, i.e. a transformation of the form\n\n:<math>z \\mapsto k z \\, </math>\n\n(''k''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''C''') with fixed points at 0 and \u221e. To see this define a map\n\n:<math>g(z) = \\frac{z - \\gamma_1}{z - \\gamma_2}</math>\n\nwhich sends the points (\u03b3<sub>1</sub>, \u03b3<sub>2</sub>) to (0, \u221e). Here we assume that \u03b3<sub>1</sub> and \u03b3<sub>2</sub> are distinct and finite. If one of them is already at infinity then ''g'' can be modified so as to fix infinity and send the other point to 0.\n\nIf ''f'' has distinct fixed points (\u03b3<sub>1</sub>, \u03b3<sub>2</sub>) then the transformation <math>gfg^{-1}</math> has fixed points at 0 and \u221e and is therefore a dilation: <math>gfg^{-1}(z) = kz</math>. The fixed point equation for the transformation ''f'' can then be written\n:<math>\\frac{f(z)-\\gamma_1}{f(z)-\\gamma_2} = k \\frac{z-\\gamma_1}{z-\\gamma_2}.</math>\n\nSolving for ''f'' gives (in matrix form):\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(k; \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma_1 - k\\gamma_2 & (k - 1) \\gamma_1\\gamma_2 \\\\\n1 - k                &  k\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nor, if one of the fixed points is at infinity:\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(k; \\gamma, \\infty) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk & (1 - k) \\gamma \\\\\n0 &  1\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nFrom the above expressions one can calculate the derivatives of ''f'' at the fixed points:\n\n:<math>f'(\\gamma_1)= k\\,</math> and <math>f'(\\gamma_2)= 1/k.\\,</math>\n\nObserve that, given an ordering of the fixed points, we can distinguish one of the multipliers (''k'') of ''f'' as the '''characteristic constant''' of ''f''. Reversing the order of the fixed points is equivalent to taking the inverse multiplier for the characteristic constant:\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(k; \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2) = \\mathfrak{H}(1/k; \\gamma_2, \\gamma_1).</math>\n\nFor loxodromic transformations, whenever |''k''| > 1, one says that \u03b3<sub>1</sub> is the '''repulsive''' fixed point, and \u03b3<sub>2</sub> is the '''attractive''' fixed point. For |''k''| < 1, the roles are reversed.\n\n''Parabolic case'':\n\nIn the parabolic case there is only one fixed point \u03b3. The transformation sending that point to \u221e is\n\n:<math>g(z) = \\frac{1}{z - \\gamma}</math>\n\nor the identity if \u03b3 is already at infinity. The transformation <math>gfg^{-1}</math> fixes infinity and is therefore a translation:\n\n:<math>gfg^{-1}(z) = z + \\beta\\,.</math>\n\nHere, \u03b2 is called the '''translation length'''. The fixed point formula for a parabolic transformation is then\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{f(z)-\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{z-\\gamma} + \\beta.</math>\n\nSolving for ''f'' (in matrix form) gives\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(\\beta; \\gamma) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1+\\gamma\\beta    & - \\beta \\gamma^2  \\\\\n\\beta            &   1-\\gamma \\beta\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nor, if \u03b3 = \u221e:\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(\\beta; \\infty) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & \\beta  \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nNote that \u03b2 is ''not'' the characteristic constant of ''f'', which is always 1 for a parabolic transformation. From the above expressions one can calculate:\n:<math>f'(\\gamma) = 1.\\,</math>\n\n== Poles of the transformation ==\n\nThe point <math>z_\\infty = - \\frac{d}{c}</math> is called the pole of <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math>; it is that point which is transformed to the point at infinity under <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math>.\n\nThe inverse pole <math>Z_\\infty = \\frac{a}{c}</math> is that point to which the point at infinity is transformed.\nThe point midway between the two poles is always the same as the point midway between the two fixed points:\n\n:<math>\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 = z_\\infty + Z_\\infty.</math>\n\nThese four points are the vertices of a parallelogram which is sometimes called the '''characteristic parallelogram''' of the transformation.\n\nA transform <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> can be specified with two fixed points \u03b3<sub>1</sub>, \u03b3<sub>2</sub> and the pole <math>z_\\infty</math>.\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\infty & - \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 \\\\\n1        & - z_\\infty\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\;\\;\nZ_\\infty = \\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 - z_\\infty.\n</math>\n\nThis allows us to derive a formula for conversion between ''k'' and <math>z_\\infty</math> given <math>\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2</math>:\n:<math>z_\\infty = \\frac{k \\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2}{1 - k}</math>\n:<math>k= \\frac{\\gamma_2 - z_\\infty}{\\gamma_1 - z_\\infty}\n= \\frac{Z_\\infty - \\gamma_1}{Z_\\infty - \\gamma_2}\n= \\frac {a - c \\gamma_1}{a - c \\gamma_2},</math>\n\nwhich reduces down to\n:<math>k = \\frac{(a + d) + \\sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{(a + d) - \\sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}.</math>\n\nThe last expression coincides with one of the (mutually reciprocal) [[eigenvalue]] ratios <math> \\lambda_1\\over \\lambda_2</math> of the matrix\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nrepresenting the transform (compare the discussion in the preceding section about the characteristic constant of a transformation). Its characteristic polynomial is equal to\n:<math>\n\\det (\\lambda I_2- \\mathfrak{H})\n=\\lambda^2-\\operatorname{tr} \\mathfrak{H}\\,\\lambda+\n\\det \\mathfrak{H}\n=\\lambda^2-(a+d)\\lambda+(ad-bc)\n</math>\nwhich has roots\n:<math> \\lambda_{i}=\\frac{(a + d) \\pm \\sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{2}=\\frac{(a + d) \\pm \\sqrt {(a + d)^2 - 4(ad-b c)}}{2}=c\\gamma_i+d \\ .\n</math>\n\n==Simple  M\u00f6bius transformations and composition ==\n\nA M\u00f6bius transformation can be [[Function composition|composed]] as a sequence of simple transformations.\n\nThe following simple transformations are also M\u00f6bius transformations:\n\n<math>  f(z) = z+b\\quad (a=1,c = 0 ,d=1 ) </math>\nis a [[translation (geometry)|translation]]\n\n<math>  f(z) = az \\quad (b=0,c = 0 ,d=1 ) </math>\nis a combination of a ([[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] and a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]])\nIf <math>  |a| =1 </math> then it is a rotation, if <math>  a \\in \\mathbb{R} </math> then it is a homothety\n\n<math>f(z)= 1/z \\quad (a=0, b=1, c = 1 ,d=0 ) </math> ([[inversive geometry|inversion]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] with respect to the real axis)\n\n=== Composition of simple transformations===\n\nLet:\n\n* <math>f_1(z)= z+d/c \\quad</math> ([[translation (geometry)|translation]] by ''d''/''c'')\n* <math>f_2(z)= 1/z \\quad</math> ([[inversive geometry|inversion]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] with respect to the real axis)\n* <math>f_3(z)= \\frac{bc-ad}{c^2} z \\quad</math> ([[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] and [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]])\n* <math>f_4(z)= z+a/c \\quad</math> (translation by ''a''/''c'')\n\nThen these functions can be [[Function composition|composed]], giving\n\n:<math> f_4\\circ f_3\\circ f_2\\circ f_1 (z)= f(z) = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d} </math>\n\nThis decomposition makes many properties of the M\u00f6bius transformation obvious.\n\n== Elementary properties ==\nA M\u00f6bius transformation is equivalent to a sequence of simpler transformations.\nThe composition  makes many properties of the M\u00f6bius transformation obvious.\n\n=== Formula for the inverse transformation ===\nThe existence of the inverse M\u00f6bius transformation and its explicit formula are easily derived by the composition of the inverse functions of the simpler transformations. That is, define functions ''g''<sub>1</sub>, ''g''<sub>2</sub>, ''g''<sub>3</sub>, ''g''<sub>4</sub> such that each ''g<sub>i</sub>'' is the inverse of ''f<sub>i</sub>''. Then the composition\n: <math>g_1\\circ g_2\\circ g_3\\circ g_4 (z) = f^{-1}(z) = \\frac{dz-b}{-cz+a}</math> gives a formula for the inverse.\n\n=== Preservation of angles and generalized circles ===\nFrom this decomposition, we see that M\u00f6bius transformations carry over all non-trivial properties of [[circle inversion]]. For example, the preservation of angles is reduced to proving that circle inversion preserves angles since the other types of transformations are dilation and [[isometries]] (translation, reflection, rotation), which trivially preserve angles.\n\nFurthermore, M\u00f6bius transformations map [[generalized circle]]s to generalized circles since circle inversion has this property. A generalized circle is either a circle or a line, the latter being considered as a circle through the point at infinity. Note that a M\u00f6bius transformation does not necessarily map circles to circles and lines to lines: it can mix the two. Even if it maps a circle to another circle, it does not necessarily map the first circle's center to the second circle's center.\n\n=== Cross-ratio preservation ===\n[[Cross-ratio]]s are invariant under M\u00f6bius transformations. That is, if a M\u00f6bius transformation maps four distinct points <math>z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4</math> to four distinct points <math>w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4</math> respectively, then\n:<math>\\frac{(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)}{(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_4)} =\\frac{(w_1-w_3)(w_2-w_4)}{(w_2-w_3)(w_1-w_4)}. </math>\n\nIf one of the points <math>z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4</math> is the point at infinity, then the cross-ratio has to be defined by taking the appropriate limit; e.g. the cross-ratio of <math>z_1, z_2, z_3, \\infin</math> is\n:<math>\\frac{(z_1-z_3)}{(z_2-z_3)}.</math>\n\nThe cross ratio of four different points is real if and only if there is a line or a circle passing through them. This is another way to show that M\u00f6bius transformations preserve generalized circles.\n\n=== Conjugation ===\nTwo points ''z''<sub>1</sub> and ''z''<sub>2</sub> are '''conjugate''' with respect to a generalized circle ''C'', if, given a generalized circle ''D'' passing through ''z''<sub>1</sub> and ''z''<sub>2</sub> and cutting ''C'' in two points ''a'' and ''b'', {{nowrap|(''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>; ''a'', ''b'')}} are in [[harmonic cross-ratio]] (i.e. their cross ratio is \u22121). This property does not depend on the choice of the circle ''D''. This property is also sometimes referred to as being '''symmetric''' with respect to a line or circle.<ref>{{citation|last=Olsen|first=John|title=The Geometry of Mobius Transformations |url=http://www.johno.dk/mathematics/moebius.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{mathworld|id=SymmetricPoints|title=Symmetric Points}}</ref>\n\nTwo points ''z'', ''z''<sup>\u2217</sup> are conjugate with respect to a line, if they are [[reflection symmetry|symmetric]] with respect to the line. Two points are conjugate with respect to a circle if they are exchanged by the [[inversive geometry|inversion]] with respect to this circle.\n\nThe point ''z''<sup>\u2217</sup> conjugate to ''z'' when ''L'' is the line determined by the vector based ''e<sup>i\u03b8</sup>'' at the point ''z''<sub>0</sub> can be explicitly given as\n:<math>z^* = e^{2i\\theta} \\overline{z - z_0} + z_0.</math>\n\nThe point ''z''<sup>\u2217</sup> conjugate to ''z'' when ''C'' is the circle of radius ''r'' centered ''z''<sub>0</sub> can be explicitly given as\n:<math>z^* = \\frac{r^2}{\\overline{z - z_0}} + z_0</math>\n\nSince M\u00f6bius transformations preserve generalized circles and cross-ratios, they preserve also the conjugation.\n\n== Projective matrix representations ==\nThe natural [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of PGL(2,'''C''') on the [[complex projective line]] '''CP'''<sup>1</sup> is exactly the natural action of the M\u00f6bius group on the Riemann sphere, where the projective line '''CP'''<sup>1</sup> and the Riemann sphere are identified as follows:\n:<math>[z_1 : z_2]\\ \\thicksim [z_1/z_2,\\ 1].</math>\nHere [''z''<sub>1</sub>:''z''<sub>2</sub>] are [[homogeneous coordinates]] on '''CP'''<sup>1</sup>; the point [1:0] corresponds to the point \u221e of the Riemann sphere.\nBy using homogeneous coordinates, many concrete calculations involving M\u00f6bius transformations can be simplified, since no case distinctions dealing with \u221e are required.\n\nWith every [[invertible matrix|invertible]] complex 2-by-2 matrix\n:<math>\\mathfrak H = \\begin{pmatrix} a & c \\\\ b & d \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nwe can associate the M\u00f6bius transformation\n:<math>[z,\\ 1]\\begin{pmatrix} a & c \\\\ b & d \\end{pmatrix} \\ = \\ [az + b,\\ cz + d] \\ = \\ \\left [\\frac{a z + b}{c z + d},\\ 1\\right ] \\ = \\ f(z).</math>\nThe condition ''ad'' \u2212 ''bc'' \u2260 0 is equivalent to the condition that the [[determinant]] of above matrix be nonzero, i.e. that the matrix be invertible.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that then the [[matrix multiplication|product]] of two matrices will be associated with the composition of the two corresponding M\u00f6bius transformations. In other words, the map\n:<math>\\pi\\colon \\operatorname{GL}(2,\\mathbf C) \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf C})</math>\nfrom the [[general linear group]] GL(2,'''C''') to the M\u00f6bius group, which sends the matrix <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> to the transformation ''f'', is a [[group homomorphism]].\n\nNote that any matrix obtained by multiplying <math>\\mathfrak H</math> by a complex scalar \u03bb determines the same transformation, so a M\u00f6bius transformation determines its matrix only [[up to]] scalar multiples. In other words: the [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of {{pi}} consists of all scalar multiples of the [[identity matrix]] ''I'', and the [[first isomorphism theorem]] of group theory states that the [[quotient group]] GL(2,'''C''')&thinsp;/&thinsp;(('''C{{Hair space}}\\{{Hair space}}{0}''')''I'') is isomorphic to the M\u00f6bius group. This quotient group is known as the [[projective linear group]] and is usually denoted PGL(2,'''C''').\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}) \\cong \\operatorname{PGL}(2,\\mathbf C).</math>\nThe same identification of PGL(2,''K'') with the group of fractional linear transformations and with the group of projective linear automorphisms of the projective line holds over any field ''K'', a fact of algebraic interest, particularly for finite fields, though the case of the complex numbers has the greatest geometric interest.\n\nIf one restricts <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> to matrices of determinant one, the map {{pi}} restricts to a surjective map from the [[special linear group]] SL(2,'''C''') to the M\u00f6bius group; in the restricted setting the kernel is formed by plus and minus the identity, and the quotient group SL(2,'''C''')&thinsp;/&thinsp;{\u00b1''I''}, denoted by PSL(2,'''C'''), is therefore also isomorphic to the M\u00f6bius group:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf C}) \\cong \\operatorname{PSL}(2,\\mathbf C).</math>\nFrom this we see that the M\u00f6bius group is a 3-dimensional complex Lie group (or a 6-dimensional real Lie group). It is a [[Semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] non-[[Compact group|compact]] Lie group.\n\nNote that there are precisely two matrices with unit determinant which can be used to represent any given M\u00f6bius transformation. That is, SL(2,'''C''') is a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of PSL(2,'''C'''). Since SL(2,'''C''') is [[simply-connected]] it is the [[universal cover]] of the M\u00f6bius group. Therefore, the [[fundamental group]] of the M\u00f6bius group is '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n=== Specifying a transformation by three points ===\n\nGiven a set of three distinct points ''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>, ''z''<sub>3</sub> on the Riemann sphere and a second set of distinct points ''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ''w''<sub>3</sub>, there exists precisely one M\u00f6bius transformation ''f''(''z'')  with ''f''(''z''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i'' = 1,2,3. (In other words: the [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of the M\u00f6bius group on the Riemann sphere is ''sharply 3-transitive''.) There are several ways to determine ''f''(''z'') from the given sets of points.\n\n==== Mapping first to 0, 1, \u221e ====\nIt is easy to check that the M\u00f6bius transformation\n\n:<math>f_1(z)= \\frac {(z-z_1)(z_2-z_3)}{(z-z_3)(z_2-z_1)}</math>\n\nwith matrix\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}\nz_2 - z_3 & -z_1 (z_2 - z_3)\\\\\nz_2-z_1 & -z_3 (z_2-z_1)\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nmaps ''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>, ''z''<sub>3</sub> to 0, 1, \u221e, respectively. If one of the ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> is \u221e, then the proper formula for <math>\\mathfrak{H}_1</math> is obtained from the above one by first dividing all entries by ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> and then taking the limit ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2192 \u221e.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{H}_2</math> is similarly defined to map ''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ''w''<sub>3</sub> to 0, 1, \u221e, then the matrix <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> which maps ''z''<sub>1,2,3</sub> to ''w''<sub>1,2,3</sub> becomes\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H} = \\mathfrak{H}_2^{-1} \\mathfrak{H}_1.</math>\n\nThe stabilizer of {0, 1, \u221e} (as an unordered set) is a subgroup known as the [[anharmonic group]].\n\n==== Explicit determinant formula ====\nThe equation\n:<math>w=\\frac{az+b}{cz+d}</math>\nis equivalent to the equation of a standard [[hyperbola]]\n:<math>\\, c wz -az+dw -b=0 </math>\nin the (''z'',''w'')-plane. The problem of constructing a M\u00f6bius transformation <math> \\mathfrak{H}(z) </math> mapping a triple <math> (z_1, z_2, z_3 )</math> to another triple <math>(w_1, w_2, w_3 )</math> is thus equivalent to finding the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' of the hyperbola passing through the points <math> (z_i, w_i ) </math>. An explicit equation can be found by evaluating the [[determinant]]\n:<math>\\det \\begin{pmatrix} zw & z & w & 1 \\\\ z_1w_1 & z_1 & w_1 & 1 \\\\   z_2w_2 & z_2 & w_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3w_3 & z_3 & w_3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\nby means of a [[Laplace expansion]] along the first row. This results in the determinant formulae\n:<math>a=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 & w_1 & 1 \\\\   z_2w_2 & w_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3w_3 & w_3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\n:<math>b=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 & z_1 & w_1 \\\\   z_2w_2 & z_2 & w_2 \\\\   z_3w_3 & z_3 & w_3 \\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\n:<math>c=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1 & w_1 & 1 \\\\   z_2 & w_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3 & w_3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\n:<math>d=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 & z_1 & 1 \\\\  z_2w_2 & z_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3w_3 & z_3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nfor the coefficients ''a,b,c,d'' of the representing matrix <math>\\, \\mathfrak{H} =\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\  c & d \\end{pmatrix} </math>. The constructed matrix <math> \\mathfrak{H} </math> has determinant equal to <math> (z_1-z_2) (z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_3)(w_1-w_2) (w_1-w_3)(w_2-w_3) </math> which does not vanish if the ''z<sub>i</sub>'' resp. ''w<sub>i</sub>'' are pairwise different thus the M\u00f6bius transformation is well-defined. If one of the points ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> or ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> is \u221e, then we first divide all four determinants by this variable and then take the limit as the variable approaches \u221e.\n\n== Subgroups of the M\u00f6bius group ==\nIf we require the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' of a M\u00f6bius transformation to be real numbers with {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc'' {{=}} 1}}, we obtain a subgroup of the M\u00f6bius group denoted as [[PSL2(R)|PSL(2,'''R''')]]. This is the group of those M\u00f6bius transformations that map the [[upper half-plane]] {{nowrap|''H'' {{=}} ''x'' + i''y'' : ''y'' > 0}} to itself, and is equal to the group of all [[biholomorphic]] (or equivalently: [[bijective]], [[conformal map|conformal]] and orientation-preserving) maps {{nowrap|''H'' \u2192 ''H''}}. If a proper [[Riemannian metric|metric]] is introduced, the upper half-plane becomes a model of the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] ''H''<sup>{{Hair space}}2</sup>, the [[Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model]], and PSL(2,'''R''') is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of ''H''<sup>{{Hair space}}2</sup> in this model.\n\nThe subgroup of all M\u00f6bius transformations that map the open disk {{nowrap|''D'' {{=}} ''z'' : {{abs|''z''}} < 1}} to itself consists of all transformations of the form\n:<math>f(z) = e^{i\\phi} \\frac{z + b}{\\bar{b} z + 1}</math>\nwith <math>\\phi</math> \u2208 '''R''', ''b'' \u2208 '''C''' and |''b''| < 1. This is equal to the group of all biholomorphic (or equivalently: bijective, angle-preserving and orientation-preserving) maps {{nowrap|''D'' \u2192 ''D''}}. By introducing a suitable metric, the open disk turns into another model of the hyperbolic plane, the [[Poincar\u00e9 disk model]], and this group is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of ''H''<sup>{{Hair space}}2</sup> in this model.\n\nSince both of the above subgroups serve as isometry groups of ''H''<sup>{{Hair space}}2</sup>, they are isomorphic. A concrete isomorphism is given by [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] with the transformation\n:<math>f(z)=\\frac{z+i}{iz+1}</math>\nwhich bijectively maps the open unit disk to the upper half plane.\n\nAlternatively, consider an open disk with radius ''r'', centered at ''r''{{Hair space}}''i''.

The classification has both algebraic and geometric significance. Geometrically, the different types result in different transformations of the complex plane, as the figures below illustrate.\n\nThe four types can be distinguished by looking at the [[trace (matrix)|trace]] <math>\\operatorname{tr}\\,\\mathfrak{H}=a+d</math>. Note that the trace is invariant under [[conjugacy class|conjugation]], that is,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}\\,\\mathfrak{GHG}^{-1} = \\operatorname{tr}\\,\\mathfrak{H},</math>\n\nand so every member of a conjugacy class will have the same trace. Every M\u00f6bius transformation can be written such that its representing matrix <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> has determinant one (by multiplying the entries with a suitable scalar). Two M\u00f6bius transformations <math> \\mathfrak{H}, \\mathfrak{H}'</math> (both not equal to the identity transform) with <math> \\det \\mathfrak{H}=\\det\\mathfrak{H}'=1 </math> are conjugate if and only if <math> \\operatorname{tr}^2\\,\\mathfrak{H}= \\operatorname{tr}^2\\,\\mathfrak{H}'.</math>\n\n=== Parabolic transforms ===\n[[File:Smith chart explanation.svg|thumb|500px|right|The [[Smith chart]], used by [[electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] for analyzing [[transmission line]]s, is a visual depiction of the parabolic M\u00f6bius transformation {{nowrap begin}}''z''{{=}}(\u0393+1)/(\u2212\u0393+1).{{nowrap end}} Each point on the Smith chart simultaneously represents both a value of ''z'' (bottom left), and the corresponding value of \u0393 (bottom right), for  &#124;\u0393 &#124;&lt;1.]]\nA non-identity M\u00f6bius transformation defined by a matrix <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> of determinant one is said to be ''parabolic'' if\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}^2\\mathfrak{H} = (a+d)^2 = 4</math>\n\n(so the trace is plus or minus 2; either can occur for a given transformation since <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> is determined only up to sign). In fact one of the choices for <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> has the same [[characteristic polynomial]] ''X''<sup>2</sup>\u22122''X''+1 as the identity matrix, and is therefore [[unipotent]]. A M\u00f6bius transform is parabolic if and only if it has exactly one fixed point in the [[Riemann sphere|extended complex plane]] <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}=\\mathbf{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}</math>, which happens if and only if it can be defined by a matrix [[conjugacy class|conjugate to]]\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhich describes a translation in the complex plane.\n\nThe set of all parabolic M\u00f6bius transformations with a ''given'' fixed point in <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}</math>, together with the identity, forms a [[group (mathematics)|subgroup]] isomorphic to the group of matrices\n\n:<math>\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\mid b\\in\\mathbf C\\right\\};</math>\n\nthis is an example of the [[unipotent|unipotent radical]] of a [[Borel subgroup]] (of the M\u00f6bius group, or of SL(2,'''C''') for the matrix group; the notion is defined for any [[reductive Lie group]]).\n\n=== Characteristic constant ===\nAll non-parabolic transformations have two fixed points and are defined by a matrix conjugate to\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwith the complex number \u03bb not equal to 0, 1 or \u22121, corresponding to a dilation/rotation through multiplication by the complex number ''k'' = \u03bb<sup>2</sup>, called the '''characteristic constant''' or '''multiplier''' of the transformation.\n\n=== Elliptic transforms ===\nThe transformation is said to be ''elliptic'' if it can be represented by a matrix <math>\\mathfrak H</math> whose trace is [[real number|real]] with\n\n:<math>0 \\le \\operatorname{tr}^2\\mathfrak{H} < 4.\\,</math>\n\nA transform is elliptic if and only if |\u03bb| = 1 and \u03bb \u2260 \u00b11.

Thus, all M\u00f6bius transformations of finite [[order (group theory)|order]] are elliptic transformations, namely exactly those where \u03bb is a [[root of unity]], or, equivalently, where \u03b1 is a [[Rational number|rational]] multiple of [[pi|{{pi}}]]. The simplest possibility of a fractional multiple means ''\u03b1'' = {{pi}}/2, which is also the unique case of <math>\\operatorname{tr}\\mathfrak{H} = 0</math>, is also denoted as a '''{{visible anchor|circular transform}}'''; this corresponds geometrically to rotation by 180\u00b0 about two fixed points. This class is represented in matrix form as:\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nThere are 3 representatives fixing {0, 1, \u221e}, which are the three transpositions in the symmetry group of these 3 points: <math>1/z,</math> which fixes 1 and swaps 0 with ''\u221e'' (rotation by 180\u00b0 about the points 1 and \u22121), <math>1-z</math>, which fixes ''\u221e'' and swaps 0 with 1 (rotation by 180\u00b0 about the points 1/2 and ''\u221e''), and <math>z/(z - 1)</math> which fixes 0 and swaps 1 with ''\u221e'' (rotation by 180\u00b0 about the points 0 and 2).\n\n=== Hyperbolic transforms ===\nThe transform is said to be ''hyperbolic'' if it can be represented by a matrix <math>\\mathfrak H</math> whose trace is [[real number|real]] with\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}^2\\mathfrak{H} > 4.\\,</math>\n\nA transform is hyperbolic if and only if \u03bb is real and \u03bb \u2260 \u00b11.\n\n=== Loxodromic transforms ===\nThe transform is said to be ''loxodromic'' if <math>\\operatorname{tr}^2\\mathfrak{H}</math> is not in [0,4]. A transformation is loxodromic if and only if <math>|\\lambda|\\ne 1</math>.\n\nHistorically, [[navigation]] by [[loxodrome]] or [[rhumb line]] refers to a path of constant [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]; the resulting path is a [[logarithmic spiral]], similar in shape to the transformations of the complex plane that a loxodromic M\u00f6bius transformation makes.

The terminology is due to considering half the absolute value of the trace, |tr|/2, as the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the transformation&nbsp;\u2013 division by 2 corrects for the dimension, so the identity has eccentricity 1 (tr/''n'' is sometimes used as an alternative for the trace for this reason), and absolute value corrects for the trace only being defined up to a factor of \u00b11 due to working in PSL. Alternatively one may use half the trace ''squared'' as a proxy for the eccentricity squared, as was done above; these classifications (but not the exact eccentricity values, since squaring and absolute values are different) agree for real traces but not complex traces. The same terminology is used for the [[SL2(R)#Classification of elements|classification of elements of SL(2, '''R''')]] (the 2-fold cover), and [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Analogous classifications|analogous classifications]] are used elsewhere. Loxodromic transformations are an essentially complex phenomenon, and correspond to complex eccentricities.\n\n== Geometric interpretation of the characteristic constant ==\nThe following picture depicts (after stereographic transformation from the sphere to the plane) the two fixed points of a M\u00f6bius transformation in the non-parabolic case:\n\n[[File:Mobius Identity.jpeg]]\n\nThe characteristic constant can be expressed in terms of its [[Natural logarithm|logarithm]]:\n:<math>e^{\\rho + \\alpha i} = k. \\;</math>\nWhen expressed in this way, the real number \u03c1 becomes an expansion factor. It indicates how repulsive the fixed point \u03b3<sub>1</sub> is, and how attractive \u03b3<sub>2</sub> is. The real number \u03b1 is a rotation factor, indicating to what extent the transform rotates the plane anti-clockwise about \u03b3<sub>1</sub> and clockwise about \u03b3<sub>2</sub>.\n\n=== Elliptic transformations ===\nIf \u03c1 = 0, then the fixed points are neither attractive nor repulsive but indifferent, and the transformation is said to be ''elliptic''. These transformations tend to move all points in circles around the two fixed points. If one of the fixed points is at infinity, this is equivalent to doing an affine rotation around a point.\n\nIf we take the [[one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any elliptic M\u00f6bius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a family of circles which is nested between the two fixed points on the Riemann sphere. In general, the two fixed points can be any two distinct points.\n\nThis has an important physical interpretation.\nImagine that some observer rotates with constant angular velocity about some axis. Then we can take the two fixed points to be the North and South poles of the celestial sphere. The appearance of the night sky is now transformed continuously in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of elliptic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, \u221e, and with the number \u03b1 corresponding to the constant angular velocity of our observer.\n\nHere are some figures illustrating the effect of an elliptic M\u00f6bius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):\n\n[[File:Mobius Small Neg Elliptical.jpeg]]\n\n[[File:Mobius Large Pos Elliptical.jpeg]]\n\nThese pictures illustrate the effect of a single M\u00f6bius transformation. The one-parameter subgroup which it generates ''continuously'' moves points along the family of circular arcs suggested by the pictures.\n\n=== Hyperbolic transformations ===\n\nIf \u03b1 is zero (or a multiple of 2{{pi}}), then the transformation is said to be ''hyperbolic''. These transformations tend to move points along circular paths from one fixed point toward the other.\n\nIf we take the [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any hyperbolic M\u00f6bius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a certain family of circular arcs ''away'' from the first fixed point and ''toward'' the second fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.\n\nThis too has an important physical interpretation. Imagine that an observer accelerates (with constant magnitude of acceleration) in the direction of the North pole on his celestial sphere. Then the appearance of the night sky is transformed in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of hyperbolic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, \u221e, with the real number \u03c1 corresponding to the magnitude of his acceleration vector. The stars seem to move along longitudes, away from the South pole toward the North pole. (The longitudes appear as circular arcs under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane.)\n\nHere are some figures illustrating the effect of a hyperbolic M\u00f6bius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):\n\n[[File:Mobius Small Neg Hyperbolic.jpeg]]\n\n[[File:Mobius Large Pos Hyperbolic.jpeg]]\n\nThese pictures resemble the field lines of a positive and a negative electrical charge located at the fixed points, because the circular flow lines subtend a constant angle between the two fixed points.\n\n=== Loxodromic transformations ===\n\nIf both \u03c1 and \u03b1 are nonzero, then the transformation is said to be ''loxodromic''. These transformations tend to move all points in S-shaped paths from one fixed point to the other.\n\nThe word \"[[loxodrome]]\" is from the Greek: \"\u03bb\u03bf\u03be\u03bf\u03c2 (loxos), ''slanting'' + \u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (dromos), ''course''\". When [[sailing]] on a constant [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] \u2013 if you maintain a heading of (say) north-east, you will eventually wind up sailing around the [[north pole]] in a [[logarithmic spiral]]. On the [[mercator projection]] such a course is a straight line, as the north and south poles project to infinity. The angle that the loxodrome subtends relative to the lines of longitude (i.e. its slope, the \"tightness\" of the spiral) is the argument of ''k''. Of course, M\u00f6bius transformations may have their two fixed points anywhere, not just at the north and south poles. But any loxodromic transformation will be conjugate to a transform that moves all points along such loxodromes.\n\nIf we take the [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any loxodromic M\u00f6bius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a certain family of curves, ''away'' from the first fixed point and ''toward'' the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often around the other fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.\n\nYou can probably guess the physical interpretation in the case when the two fixed points are 0, \u221e: an observer who is both rotating (with constant angular velocity) about some axis and moving along the ''same'' axis, will see the appearance of the night sky transform according to the one-parameter subgroup of loxodromic transformations with fixed points 0, \u221e, and with \u03c1, \u03b1 determined respectively by the magnitude of the actual linear and angular velocities.\n\n=== Stereographic projection ===\nThese images show M\u00f6bius transformations [[stereographic projection|stereographically projected]] onto the [[Riemann sphere]]. Note in particular that when projected onto a sphere, the special case of a fixed point at infinity looks no different from having the fixed points in an arbitrary location.\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''One fixed point at infinity'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-elip-inf-480.png|thumb|Elliptic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-hyp-inf-480.png|thumb|Hyperbolic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-lox-inf-480.png|thumb|Loxodromic]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Fixed points diametrically opposite'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-elip-opp-480.png|thumb|Elliptic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-hyp-opp-480.png|thumb|Hyperbolic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-lox-opp-480.png|thumb|Loxodromic]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Fixed points in an arbitrary location'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-elip-arb-480.png|thumb|Elliptic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-hyp-arb-480.png|thumb|Hyperbolic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-lox-arb-480.png|thumb|Loxodromic]]\n|}\n\n== Iterating a transformation ==\n\nIf a transformation <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> has fixed points \u03b3<sub>1</sub>, \u03b3<sub>2</sub>, and characteristic constant ''k'', then <math>\\mathfrak{H}' = \\mathfrak{H}^n</math> will have <math>\\gamma_1' = \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2' = \\gamma_2, k' = k^n</math>.\n\nThis can be used to [[iterate (math)|iterate]] a transformation, or to animate one by breaking it up into steps.\n\nThese images show three points (red, blue and black) continuously iterated under transformations with various characteristic constants.\n\n{| style=\"margin: auto;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Mobius23621.jpeg]] || [[File:Mobius23622.jpeg]] || [[File:Mobius23623.jpeg]] ||\n|-\n|\n|}\n\nAnd these images demonstrate what happens when you transform a circle under Hyperbolic, Elliptical, and Loxodromic transforms.

The [[null cone]] ''S'' consists of those points where ''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0; the ''future null cone'' ''N''<sup>+</sup> are those points on the null cone with ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;>&nbsp;0. The [[celestial sphere]] is then identified with the collection of rays in ''N''<sup>+</sup> whose initial point is the origin of '''R'''<sup>4</sup>. The collection of [[linear transformation]]s on '''R'''<sup>4</sup> with positive [[determinant]] preserving the quadratic form ''Q'' and preserving the time direction form the [[restricted Lorentz group]] SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3).\n\nIn connection with the geometry of the celestial sphere, the group of transformations SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) is identified with the group PSL(2,'''C''') of M\u00f6bius transformations of the sphere. To each (''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>4</sup>, associate the [[hermitian matrix]]\n\n:<math>X=\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_0+x_1 & x_2+ix_3\\\\\nx_2-ix_3 & x_0-x_1\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe [[determinant]] of the matrix ''X'' is equal to ''Q''(''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>). The [[special linear group]] acts on the space of such matrices via\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>X\\mapsto AXA^*</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nfor each ''A'' \u2208 SL(2,'''C'''), and this action of SL(2,'''C''') preserves the determinant of ''X'' because {{nowrap|1=det ''A'' = 1}}. Since the determinant of ''X'' is identified with the quadratic form ''Q'', SL(2,'''C''') acts by Lorentz transformations. On dimensional grounds, SL(2,'''C''') covers a neighborhood of the identity of SO(1,3). Since SL(2,'''C''') is connected, it covers the entire restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3). Furthermore, since the [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of the action ({{EquationNote|1}}) is the subgroup {\u00b1''I''}, then passing to the [[quotient group]] gives the [[group isomorphism]]\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\operatorname{PSL}(2,\\mathbf{C})\\cong SO^+(1,3).</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nFocusing now attention on the case when (''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>) is null, the matrix ''X'' has zero determinant, and therefore splits as the [[outer product]] of a complex two-vector \u03be with its complex conjugate:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>X = \\xi\\bar{\\xi}^T=\\xi\\xi^*.</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nThe two-component vector \u03be is acted upon by SL(2,'''C''') in a manner compatible with ({{EquationNote|1}}). It is now clear that the kernel of the representation of SL(2,'''C''') on hermitian matrices is {\u00b1''I''}.\n\nThe action of PSL(2,'''C''') on the celestial sphere may also be described geometrically using [[stereographic projection]]. Consider first the hyperplane in '''R'''<sup>4</sup> given by ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. The celestial sphere may be identified with the sphere ''S''<sup>+</sup> of intersection of the hyperplane with the future null cone ''N''<sup>+</sup>. The stereographic projection from the north pole (1,0,0,1) of this sphere onto the plane ''x''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 takes a point with coordinates (1,''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>) with\n\n:<math>x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1</math>\n\nto the point\n\n:<math>\\left(1, \\frac{x_1}{1-x_3}, \\frac{x_2}{1-x_3},0\\right).</math>\n\nIntroducing the [[complex number|complex]] coordinate\n\n:<math>\\zeta = \\frac{x_1+ix_2}{1-x_3},</math>\n\nthe inverse stereographic projection gives the following formula for a point (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>) on ''S''<sup>+</sup>:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_1 &= \\frac{\\zeta+\\bar{\\zeta}}{\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}+1}\\\\\nx_2 &= \\frac{\\zeta-\\bar{\\zeta}}{i(\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}+1)}\\\\\nx_3 &= \\frac{\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}-1}{\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}+1}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nThe action of SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) on the points of ''N''<sup>+</sup> does not preserve the hyperplane ''S''<sup>+</sup>, but acting on points in ''S''<sup>+</sup> and then rescaling so that the result is again in ''S''<sup>+</sup> gives an action of SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) on the sphere which goes over to an action on the complex variable \u03b6. In fact, this action is by fractional linear transformations, although this is not easily seen from this representation of the celestial sphere. Conversely, for any fractional linear transformation of \u03b6 variable goes over to a unique Lorentz transformation on ''N''<sup>+</sup>, possibly after a suitable (uniquely determined) rescaling.\n\nA more invariant description of the stereographic projection which allows the action to be more clearly seen is to consider the variable \u03b6&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z'':''w'' as a ratio of a pair of homogeneous coordinates for the complex projective line '''CP'''<sup>1</sup>. The stereographic projection goes over to a transformation from '''C'''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;{0} to ''N''<sup>+</sup> which is homogeneous of degree two with respect to real scalings\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>(z,w)\\mapsto (x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)=(z\\bar{z}+w\\bar{w}, z\\bar{z}-w\\bar{w}, z\\bar{w}+w\\bar{z}, i^{-1}(z\\bar{w}-w\\bar{z}))</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nwhich agrees with ({{EquationNote|4}}) upon restriction to scales in which <math>z\\bar{z}+w\\bar{w}=1.</math> The components of ({{EquationNote|5}}) are precisely those obtained from the outer product\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_0+x_1 & x_2+ix_3\\\\\nx_2-ix_3 & x_0-x_1\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n2\\begin{bmatrix}\nz\\\\ w\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\bar{z}&\\bar{w}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nIn summary, the action of the restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) agrees with that of the M\u00f6bius group PSL(2,'''C'''). This motivates the following definition. In dimension ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;2, the '''M\u00f6bius group''' M\u00f6b(''n'') is the group of all orientation-preserving [[conformal geometry|conformal]] [[isometry|isometries]] of the round sphere ''S''<sup>''n''</sup> to itself. By realizing the conformal sphere as the space of future-pointing rays of the null cone in the Minkowski space '''R'''<sup>1,n+1</sup>, there is an isomorphism of M\u00f6b(''n'') with the restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1,''n''+1) of Lorentz transformations with positive determinant, preserving the direction of time.\n\nCoxeter began instead with the equivalent quadratic form <math>Q(x_1,\\ x_2,\\ x_3 \\ x_4) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - x_4^2 .</math>\n\nHe identified the Lorentz group with transformations for which {''x'' : Q(''x'') = -1} is [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable]]. Then he interpreted the x's as [[homogeneous coordinates]]  and {''x'' : Q(''x'') = 0}, the [[null cone]], as the [[Cayley absolute]] for a hyperbolic space of points {''x'' : Q(''x'') < 0}. Next, Coxeter introduced the variables\n:<math>\\xi = \\frac {x_1}{x_4} , \\ \\eta = \\frac {x_2}{x_4}, \\ \\zeta = \\frac {x_3}{x_4} </math>\n\nso that the Lorentz-invariant quadric corresponds to the sphere <math>\\xi^2 + \\eta^2 + \\zeta^2 = 1 .</math> Coxeter notes that [[Felix Klein]] also wrote of this correspondence, applying stereographic projection from (0, 0, 1) to the complex plane <math>z = \\frac{\\xi + i \\eta}{1 - \\zeta}.</math>\nCoxeter used the fact that circles of the inversive plane represent planes of hyperbolic space, and the general homography is the product of inversions in two or four circles, corresponding to the general hyperbolic displacement which is the product of inversions in two or four planes.\n\n=== Hyperbolic space ===\nAs seen above, the M\u00f6bius group PSL(2,'''C''') acts on Minkowski space as the group of those isometries that preserve the origin, the orientation of space and the direction of time. Restricting to the points where ''Q''=1 in the positive light cone, which form a model of [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, we see that the M\u00f6bius group acts on ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup> as a group of orientation-preserving isometries. In fact, the M\u00f6bius group is equal to the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.\n\nIf we use the [[Poincar\u00e9 disk model|Poincar\u00e9 ball model]], identifying the unit ball in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> with ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, then we can think of the Riemann sphere as the \"conformal boundary\" of ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>. Every orientation-preserving isometry of ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup> gives rise to a M\u00f6bius transformation on the Riemann sphere and vice versa; this is the very first observation leading to the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjectures in physics.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bilinear transform]]\n* [[Conformal geometry]]\n* [[Fuchsian group]]\n* [[Generalised circle]]\n* [[Hyperbolic geometry]]\n* [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]]\n* [[Inversion transformation]]\n* [[Kleinian group]]\n* [[Lie sphere geometry]]\n* [[Linear fractional transformation]]\n* [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)]]\n* [[Lorentz group]]\n* [[Modular group]]\n* [[Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model]]\n* [[Projective geometry]]\n* [[Projective line over a ring]]\n* [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n'''Specific'''\n{{reflist|40em}}\n'''General'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation |last=Arnold |first=Douglas N. |last2=Rogness |first2=Jonathan |year=2008 |title=M\u00f6bius Transformations Revealed |journal=Notices of the AMS |pages=1226\u20131231 |volume=55 |issue=10 |url=http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/papers/moebius.pdf }}\n* {{citation | first=Alan F.|last=Beardon | title=The Geometry of Discrete Groups | publisher=New York: Springer-Verlag | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-387-90788-8}}\n* {{citation | first=G.

They form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the '''M\u00f6bius group''', which is the [[projective linear group]] PGL(2,'''C'''). Together with its [[subgroup]]s, it has numerous applications in mathematics and physics.\n\nM\u00f6bius transformations are named in honor of [[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius]]; they are also variously named '''[[homography|homographies]]''', '''homographic transformations''', '''linear fractional transformations''', '''bilinear transformations''', or '''fractional linear transformations'''.\n\n== Overview ==\nM\u00f6bius transformations are defined on the [[Riemann sphere|extended complex plane]] <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}} = \\mathbf{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}</math> (i.e., the [[complex plane]] augmented by the [[point at infinity]]).\n\n[[Stereographic projection]] identifies <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}</math> with a sphere, which is then called the [[Riemann sphere]]; alternatively, <math>\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}</math> can be thought of as the complex [[projective line]] <math>\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{P}^1</math>.  The M\u00f6bius transformations are exactly the [[bijective]] [[conformal map|conformal]] maps from the Riemann sphere to itself, i.e., the [[automorphism group|automorphisms]] of the Riemann sphere as a [[complex manifold]]; alternatively, they are the automorphisms of <math>\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{P}^1</math> as an algebraic variety.  Therefore, the set of all M\u00f6bius transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]].  This group is called the M\u00f6bius group, and is sometimes denoted <math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}})\\,</math>.\n\nThe M\u00f6bius group is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the group of orientation-preserving [[isometry|isometries]] of [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] and therefore plays an important role when studying [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s.\n\nIn [[physics]], the [[identity component]] of the [[Lorentz group]] acts on the [[celestial sphere]] in the same way that the M\u00f6bius group acts on the Riemann sphere. In fact, these two groups are isomorphic. An observer who accelerates to relativistic velocities will see the pattern of constellations as seen near the Earth continuously transform according to infinitesimal M\u00f6bius transformations. This observation is often taken as the starting point of [[twistor theory]].\n\nCertain [[subgroup]]s of the M\u00f6bius group form the automorphism groups of the other [[simply-connected]] Riemann surfaces (the [[complex plane]] and the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]]). As such, M\u00f6bius transformations play an important role in the theory of [[Riemann surface]]s. The [[fundamental group]] of every Riemann surface is a [[discrete subgroup]] of the M\u00f6bius group (see [[Fuchsian group]] and [[Kleinian group]]).\nA particularly important discrete subgroup of the M\u00f6bius group is the [[modular group]]; it is central to the theory of many [[fractal]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[elliptic curve]]s and [[Pellian equation]]s.\n\nM\u00f6bius transformations can be more generally defined in spaces of dimension ''n''>2 as the bijective conformal orientation-preserving maps from the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] to the ''n''-sphere. Such a transformation is the most general form of conformal mapping of a domain. According to [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)|Liouville's theorem]] a M\u00f6bius transformation can be expressed as a composition of translations, [[Similarity (geometry)|similarities]], orthogonal transformations and inversions.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe general form of a M\u00f6bius transformation is given by\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{a z + b}{c z + d}</math>\nwhere ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are any [[complex number]]s satisfying {{math|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc'' \u2260 0}}. If {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}, the rational function defined above is a constant since\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{a z + b}{c z + d} = \\frac{a(cz+d)}{c(cz+d)} - \\frac{a d -bc}{c(c z + d)} = \\frac{a}{c}</math>\nand is thus not considered a M\u00f6bius transformation.\n\nIn case {{math|''c'' \u2260 0}}, this definition is extended to the whole [[Riemann sphere]] by defining\n:<math>f\\left(\\frac{-d}{c}\\right) = \\infin \\text{ and } f(\\infin) = \\frac{a}{c}.</math>\n\nIf {{math|1=''c'' = 0}}, we define\n:<math>f(\\infin) = \\infin.</math>\n\nThus a M\u00f6bius transformation is always a bijective [[holomorphic function]] from the Riemann sphere to the Riemann sphere.\n\nThe set of all M\u00f6bius transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]]. This group can be given the structure of a [[complex manifold]] in such a way that composition and inversion are [[holomorphic map]]s. The M\u00f6bius group is then a [[complex Lie group]]. The M\u00f6bius group is usually denoted <math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}})</math> as it is the [[automorphism group]] of the Riemann sphere.\n\n== Fixed points ==\nEvery non-identity M\u00f6bius transformation has two [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] <math>\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2</math> on the Riemann sphere. Note that the fixed points are counted here with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]; the parabolic transformations are those where the fixed points coincide. Either or both of these fixed points may be the point at infinity.\n\n=== Determining the fixed points ===\nThe fixed points of the transformation\n:<math>f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}</math>\nare obtained by solving the fixed point equation f(\u03b3) = \u03b3. For ''c'' \u2260 0, this has two roots obtained by expanding this equation to\n:<math>c \\gamma^2 - (a - d) \\gamma - b = 0 \\ ,</math>\nand applying the [[quadratic formula]]. The roots are\n:<math>\\gamma_{1,2} = \\frac{(a - d) \\pm \\sqrt{(a-d)^2 + 4bc}}{2c} = \\frac{(a - d) \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2c}</math>\nwith discriminant\n:<math> \\Delta =(\\operatorname{tr}\\mathfrak{H})^2 - 4\\operatorname{det}\\mathfrak{H}=(a+d)^2 - 4(ad-bc)</math>.\nParabolic transforms have coincidental fixed points due to zero discriminant. For ''c'' nonzero and nonzero discriminant the transform is elliptic or hyperbolic.\n\nWhen ''c'' = 0, the quadratic equation degenerates into a linear equation and the transform is linear. This corresponds to the situation that one of the fixed points is the point at infinity. When ''a'' \u2260 ''d'' the second fixed point is finite and is given by\n\n:<math>\\gamma=-\\frac{b}{a-d}.</math>\n\nIn this case the transformation will be a simple transformation composed of [[translation (mathematics)|translation]]s, [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, and [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]]s:\n\n:<math>z \\mapsto \\alpha z + \\beta.\\,</math>\n\nIf ''c'' = 0 and ''a'' = ''d'', then both fixed points are at infinity, and the M\u00f6bius transformation corresponds to a pure translation:\n:<math>z \\mapsto z + \\beta.</math>\n\n=== Topological proof ===\nTopologically, the fact that (non-identity) M\u00f6bius transformations fix 2 points (with multiplicity) corresponds to the [[Euler characteristic]] of the sphere being 2:\n:<math>\\chi(\\hat{\\mathbf{C}})=2.</math>\n\nFirstly, the [[projective linear group]] PGL(2,''K'') is [[n-transitive|sharply 3-transitive]]&nbsp;\u2013 for any two ordered triples of distinct points, there is a unique map that takes one triple to the other, just as for M\u00f6bius transforms, and by the same algebraic proof (essentially [[dimension counting]], as the group is 3-dimensional). Thus any map that fixes at least 3 points is the identity.\n\nNext, one can see by identifying the  M\u00f6bius group with <math>PGL(2,\\mathbb C)</math> that any M\u00f6bius function is homotopic to the identity. Indeed, any member of the [[general linear group]] can be reduced to the identity map by Gauss-Jordan elimination, this shows that the projective linear group is path-connected as well, providing a homotopy to the identity map. The [[Lefschetz\u2013Hopf theorem]] states that the sum of the indices (in this context, multiplicity) of the fixed points of a map with finitely many fixed points equals the [[Lefschetz number]] of the map, which in this case is the trace of the identity map on homology groups, which is simply the Euler characteristic.\n\nBy contrast, the projective linear group of the real projective line, PGL(2,'''R''') need not fix any points&nbsp;\u2013 for example <math>(1+x)/(1-x)</math> has no (real) fixed points: as a complex transformation it fixes \u00b1''i''<ref group=\"note\">Geometrically this map is the [[stereographic projection]] of a rotation by 90\u00b0 around \u00b1''i'' with period 4, which takes <math>0 \\mapsto 1 \\mapsto \\infty \\mapsto -1 \\mapsto 0.</math></ref>&nbsp;\u2013 while the map 2''x'' fixes the two points of 0 and \u221e. This corresponds to the fact that the Euler characteristic of the circle (real projective line) is 0, and thus the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says only that it must fix at least 0 points, but possibly more.\n\n=== Normal form ===\nM\u00f6bius transformations are also sometimes written in terms of their fixed points in so-called '''normal form'''. We first treat the non-parabolic case, for which there are two distinct fixed points.\n\n''Non-parabolic case'':\n\nEvery non-parabolic transformation is [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to a dilation/rotation, i.e. a transformation of the form\n\n:<math>z \\mapsto k z \\, </math>\n\n(''k''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''C''') with fixed points at 0 and \u221e. To see this define a map\n\n:<math>g(z) = \\frac{z - \\gamma_1}{z - \\gamma_2}</math>\n\nwhich sends the points (\u03b3<sub>1</sub>, \u03b3<sub>2</sub>) to (0, \u221e). Here we assume that \u03b3<sub>1</sub> and \u03b3<sub>2</sub> are distinct and finite. If one of them is already at infinity then ''g'' can be modified so as to fix infinity and send the other point to 0.\n\nIf ''f'' has distinct fixed points (\u03b3<sub>1</sub>, \u03b3<sub>2</sub>) then the transformation <math>gfg^{-1}</math> has fixed points at 0 and \u221e and is therefore a dilation: <math>gfg^{-1}(z) = kz</math>. The fixed point equation for the transformation ''f'' can then be written\n:<math>\\frac{f(z)-\\gamma_1}{f(z)-\\gamma_2} = k \\frac{z-\\gamma_1}{z-\\gamma_2}.</math>\n\nSolving for ''f'' gives (in matrix form):\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(k; \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma_1 - k\\gamma_2 & (k - 1) \\gamma_1\\gamma_2 \\\\\n1 - k                &  k\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nor, if one of the fixed points is at infinity:\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(k; \\gamma, \\infty) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk & (1 - k) \\gamma \\\\\n0 &  1\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nFrom the above expressions one can calculate the derivatives of ''f'' at the fixed points:\n\n:<math>f'(\\gamma_1)= k\\,</math> and <math>f'(\\gamma_2)= 1/k.\\,</math>\n\nObserve that, given an ordering of the fixed points, we can distinguish one of the multipliers (''k'') of ''f'' as the '''characteristic constant''' of ''f''. Reversing the order of the fixed points is equivalent to taking the inverse multiplier for the characteristic constant:\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(k; \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2) = \\mathfrak{H}(1/k; \\gamma_2, \\gamma_1).</math>\n\nFor loxodromic transformations, whenever |''k''| > 1, one says that \u03b3<sub>1</sub> is the '''repulsive''' fixed point, and \u03b3<sub>2</sub> is the '''attractive''' fixed point. For |''k''| < 1, the roles are reversed.\n\n''Parabolic case'':\n\nIn the parabolic case there is only one fixed point \u03b3. The transformation sending that point to \u221e is\n\n:<math>g(z) = \\frac{1}{z - \\gamma}</math>\n\nor the identity if \u03b3 is already at infinity. The transformation <math>gfg^{-1}</math> fixes infinity and is therefore a translation:\n\n:<math>gfg^{-1}(z) = z + \\beta\\,.</math>\n\nHere, \u03b2 is called the '''translation length'''. The fixed point formula for a parabolic transformation is then\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{f(z)-\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{z-\\gamma} + \\beta.</math>\n\nSolving for ''f'' (in matrix form) gives\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(\\beta; \\gamma) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1+\\gamma\\beta    & - \\beta \\gamma^2  \\\\\n\\beta            &   1-\\gamma \\beta\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nor, if \u03b3 = \u221e:\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}(\\beta; \\infty) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & \\beta  \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nNote that \u03b2 is ''not'' the characteristic constant of ''f'', which is always 1 for a parabolic transformation. From the above expressions one can calculate:\n:<math>f'(\\gamma) = 1.\\,</math>\n\n== Poles of the transformation ==\n\nThe point <math>z_\\infty = - \\frac{d}{c}</math> is called the pole of <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math>; it is that point which is transformed to the point at infinity under <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math>.\n\nThe inverse pole <math>Z_\\infty = \\frac{a}{c}</math> is that point to which the point at infinity is transformed.\nThe point midway between the two poles is always the same as the point midway between the two fixed points:\n\n:<math>\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 = z_\\infty + Z_\\infty.</math>\n\nThese four points are the vertices of a parallelogram which is sometimes called the '''characteristic parallelogram''' of the transformation.\n\nA transform <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> can be specified with two fixed points \u03b3<sub>1</sub>, \u03b3<sub>2</sub> and the pole <math>z_\\infty</math>.\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\infty & - \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 \\\\\n1        & - z_\\infty\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\;\\;\nZ_\\infty = \\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 - z_\\infty.\n</math>\n\nThis allows us to derive a formula for conversion between ''k'' and <math>z_\\infty</math> given <math>\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2</math>:\n:<math>z_\\infty = \\frac{k \\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2}{1 - k}</math>\n:<math>k= \\frac{\\gamma_2 - z_\\infty}{\\gamma_1 - z_\\infty}\n= \\frac{Z_\\infty - \\gamma_1}{Z_\\infty - \\gamma_2}\n= \\frac {a - c \\gamma_1}{a - c \\gamma_2},</math>\n\nwhich reduces down to\n:<math>k = \\frac{(a + d) + \\sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{(a + d) - \\sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}.</math>\n\nThe last expression coincides with one of the (mutually reciprocal) [[eigenvalue]] ratios <math> \\lambda_1\\over \\lambda_2</math> of the matrix\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nrepresenting the transform (compare the discussion in the preceding section about the characteristic constant of a transformation). Its characteristic polynomial is equal to\n:<math>\n\\det (\\lambda I_2- \\mathfrak{H})\n=\\lambda^2-\\operatorname{tr} \\mathfrak{H}\\,\\lambda+\n\\det \\mathfrak{H}\n=\\lambda^2-(a+d)\\lambda+(ad-bc)\n</math>\nwhich has roots\n:<math> \\lambda_{i}=\\frac{(a + d) \\pm \\sqrt {(a - d)^2 + 4 b c}}{2}=\\frac{(a + d) \\pm \\sqrt {(a + d)^2 - 4(ad-b c)}}{2}=c\\gamma_i+d \\ .\n</math>\n\n==Simple  M\u00f6bius transformations and composition ==\n\nA M\u00f6bius transformation can be [[Function composition|composed]] as a sequence of simple transformations.\n\nThe following simple transformations are also M\u00f6bius transformations:\n\n<math>  f(z) = z+b\\quad (a=1,c = 0 ,d=1 ) </math>\nis a [[translation (geometry)|translation]]\n\n<math>  f(z) = az \\quad (b=0,c = 0 ,d=1 ) </math>\nis a combination of a ([[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] and a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]])\nIf <math>  |a| =1 </math> then it is a rotation, if <math>  a \\in \\mathbb{R} </math> then it is a homothety\n\n<math>f(z)= 1/z \\quad (a=0, b=1, c = 1 ,d=0 ) </math> ([[inversive geometry|inversion]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] with respect to the real axis)\n\n=== Composition of simple transformations===\n\nLet:\n\n* <math>f_1(z)= z+d/c \\quad</math> ([[translation (geometry)|translation]] by ''d''/''c'')\n* <math>f_2(z)= 1/z \\quad</math> ([[inversive geometry|inversion]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] with respect to the real axis)\n* <math>f_3(z)= \\frac{bc-ad}{c^2} z \\quad</math> ([[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] and [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]])\n* <math>f_4(z)= z+a/c \\quad</math> (translation by ''a''/''c'')\n\nThen these functions can be [[Function composition|composed]], giving\n\n:<math> f_4\\circ f_3\\circ f_2\\circ f_1 (z)= f(z) = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d} </math>\n\nThis decomposition makes many properties of the M\u00f6bius transformation obvious.\n\n== Elementary properties ==\nA M\u00f6bius transformation is equivalent to a sequence of simpler transformations.\nThe composition  makes many properties of the M\u00f6bius transformation obvious.\n\n=== Formula for the inverse transformation ===\nThe existence of the inverse M\u00f6bius transformation and its explicit formula are easily derived by the composition of the inverse functions of the simpler transformations. That is, define functions ''g''<sub>1</sub>, ''g''<sub>2</sub>, ''g''<sub>3</sub>, ''g''<sub>4</sub> such that each ''g<sub>i</sub>'' is the inverse of ''f<sub>i</sub>''. Then the composition\n: <math>g_1\\circ g_2\\circ g_3\\circ g_4 (z) = f^{-1}(z) = \\frac{dz-b}{-cz+a}</math> gives a formula for the inverse.\n\n=== Preservation of angles and generalized circles ===\nFrom this decomposition, we see that M\u00f6bius transformations carry over all non-trivial properties of [[circle inversion]]. For example, the preservation of angles is reduced to proving that circle inversion preserves angles since the other types of transformations are dilation and [[isometries]] (translation, reflection, rotation), which trivially preserve angles.\n\nFurthermore, M\u00f6bius transformations map [[generalized circle]]s to generalized circles since circle inversion has this property. A generalized circle is either a circle or a line, the latter being considered as a circle through the point at infinity. Note that a M\u00f6bius transformation does not necessarily map circles to circles and lines to lines: it can mix the two. Even if it maps a circle to another circle, it does not necessarily map the first circle's center to the second circle's center.\n\n=== Cross-ratio preservation ===\n[[Cross-ratio]]s are invariant under M\u00f6bius transformations. That is, if a M\u00f6bius transformation maps four distinct points <math>z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4</math> to four distinct points <math>w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4</math> respectively, then\n:<math>\\frac{(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)}{(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_4)} =\\frac{(w_1-w_3)(w_2-w_4)}{(w_2-w_3)(w_1-w_4)}. </math>\n\nIf one of the points <math>z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4</math> is the point at infinity, then the cross-ratio has to be defined by taking the appropriate limit; e.g. the cross-ratio of <math>z_1, z_2, z_3, \\infin</math> is\n:<math>\\frac{(z_1-z_3)}{(z_2-z_3)}.</math>\n\nThe cross ratio of four different points is real if and only if there is a line or a circle passing through them. This is another way to show that M\u00f6bius transformations preserve generalized circles.\n\n=== Conjugation ===\nTwo points ''z''<sub>1</sub> and ''z''<sub>2</sub> are '''conjugate''' with respect to a generalized circle ''C'', if, given a generalized circle ''D'' passing through ''z''<sub>1</sub> and ''z''<sub>2</sub> and cutting ''C'' in two points ''a'' and ''b'', {{nowrap|(''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>; ''a'', ''b'')}} are in [[harmonic cross-ratio]] (i.e. their cross ratio is \u22121). This property does not depend on the choice of the circle ''D''. This property is also sometimes referred to as being '''symmetric''' with respect to a line or circle.<ref>{{citation|last=Olsen|first=John|title=The Geometry of Mobius Transformations |url=http://www.johno.dk/mathematics/moebius.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{mathworld|id=SymmetricPoints|title=Symmetric Points}}</ref>\n\nTwo points ''z'', ''z''<sup>\u2217</sup> are conjugate with respect to a line, if they are [[reflection symmetry|symmetric]] with respect to the line. Two points are conjugate with respect to a circle if they are exchanged by the [[inversive geometry|inversion]] with respect to this circle.\n\nThe point ''z''<sup>\u2217</sup> conjugate to ''z'' when ''L'' is the line determined by the vector based ''e<sup>i\u03b8</sup>'' at the point ''z''<sub>0</sub> can be explicitly given as\n:<math>z^* = e^{2i\\theta} \\overline{z - z_0} + z_0.</math>\n\nThe point ''z''<sup>\u2217</sup> conjugate to ''z'' when ''C'' is the circle of radius ''r'' centered ''z''<sub>0</sub> can be explicitly given as\n:<math>z^* = \\frac{r^2}{\\overline{z - z_0}} + z_0</math>\n\nSince M\u00f6bius transformations preserve generalized circles and cross-ratios, they preserve also the conjugation.\n\n== Projective matrix representations ==\nThe natural [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of PGL(2,'''C''') on the [[complex projective line]] '''CP'''<sup>1</sup> is exactly the natural action of the M\u00f6bius group on the Riemann sphere, where the projective line '''CP'''<sup>1</sup> and the Riemann sphere are identified as follows:\n:<math>[z_1 : z_2]\\ \\thicksim [z_1/z_2,\\ 1].</math>\nHere [''z''<sub>1</sub>:''z''<sub>2</sub>] are [[homogeneous coordinates]] on '''CP'''<sup>1</sup>; the point [1:0] corresponds to the point \u221e of the Riemann sphere.\nBy using homogeneous coordinates, many concrete calculations involving M\u00f6bius transformations can be simplified, since no case distinctions dealing with \u221e are required.\n\nWith every [[invertible matrix|invertible]] complex 2-by-2 matrix\n:<math>\\mathfrak H = \\begin{pmatrix} a & c \\\\ b & d \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nwe can associate the M\u00f6bius transformation\n:<math>[z,\\ 1]\\begin{pmatrix} a & c \\\\ b & d \\end{pmatrix} \\ = \\ [az + b,\\ cz + d] \\ = \\ \\left [\\frac{a z + b}{c z + d},\\ 1\\right ] \\ = \\ f(z).</math>\nThe condition ''ad'' \u2212 ''bc'' \u2260 0 is equivalent to the condition that the [[determinant]] of above matrix be nonzero, i.e. that the matrix be invertible.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that then the [[matrix multiplication|product]] of two matrices will be associated with the composition of the two corresponding M\u00f6bius transformations. In other words, the map\n:<math>\\pi\\colon \\operatorname{GL}(2,\\mathbf C) \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf C})</math>\nfrom the [[general linear group]] GL(2,'''C''') to the M\u00f6bius group, which sends the matrix <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> to the transformation ''f'', is a [[group homomorphism]].\n\nNote that any matrix obtained by multiplying <math>\\mathfrak H</math> by a complex scalar \u03bb determines the same transformation, so a M\u00f6bius transformation determines its matrix only [[up to]] scalar multiples. In other words: the [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of {{pi}} consists of all scalar multiples of the [[identity matrix]] ''I'', and the [[first isomorphism theorem]] of group theory states that the [[quotient group]] GL(2,'''C''')&thinsp;/&thinsp;(('''C{{Hair space}}\\{{Hair space}}{0}''')''I'') is isomorphic to the M\u00f6bius group. This quotient group is known as the [[projective linear group]] and is usually denoted PGL(2,'''C''').\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}) \\cong \\operatorname{PGL}(2,\\mathbf C).</math>\nThe same identification of PGL(2,''K'') with the group of fractional linear transformations and with the group of projective linear automorphisms of the projective line holds over any field ''K'', a fact of algebraic interest, particularly for finite fields, though the case of the complex numbers has the greatest geometric interest.\n\nIf one restricts <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> to matrices of determinant one, the map {{pi}} restricts to a surjective map from the [[special linear group]] SL(2,'''C''') to the M\u00f6bius group; in the restricted setting the kernel is formed by plus and minus the identity, and the quotient group SL(2,'''C''')&thinsp;/&thinsp;{\u00b1''I''}, denoted by PSL(2,'''C'''), is therefore also isomorphic to the M\u00f6bius group:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Aut}(\\widehat{\\mathbf C}) \\cong \\operatorname{PSL}(2,\\mathbf C).</math>\nFrom this we see that the M\u00f6bius group is a 3-dimensional complex Lie group (or a 6-dimensional real Lie group). It is a [[Semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] non-[[Compact group|compact]] Lie group.\n\nNote that there are precisely two matrices with unit determinant which can be used to represent any given M\u00f6bius transformation. That is, SL(2,'''C''') is a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of PSL(2,'''C'''). Since SL(2,'''C''') is [[simply-connected]] it is the [[universal cover]] of the M\u00f6bius group. Therefore, the [[fundamental group]] of the M\u00f6bius group is '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n=== Specifying a transformation by three points ===\n\nGiven a set of three distinct points ''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>, ''z''<sub>3</sub> on the Riemann sphere and a second set of distinct points ''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ''w''<sub>3</sub>, there exists precisely one M\u00f6bius transformation ''f''(''z'')  with ''f''(''z''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i'' = 1,2,3. (In other words: the [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of the M\u00f6bius group on the Riemann sphere is ''sharply 3-transitive''.) There are several ways to determine ''f''(''z'') from the given sets of points.\n\n==== Mapping first to 0, 1, \u221e ====\nIt is easy to check that the M\u00f6bius transformation\n\n:<math>f_1(z)= \\frac {(z-z_1)(z_2-z_3)}{(z-z_3)(z_2-z_1)}</math>\n\nwith matrix\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}\nz_2 - z_3 & -z_1 (z_2 - z_3)\\\\\nz_2-z_1 & -z_3 (z_2-z_1)\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nmaps ''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>, ''z''<sub>3</sub> to 0, 1, \u221e, respectively. If one of the ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> is \u221e, then the proper formula for <math>\\mathfrak{H}_1</math> is obtained from the above one by first dividing all entries by ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> and then taking the limit ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2192 \u221e.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{H}_2</math> is similarly defined to map ''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ''w''<sub>3</sub> to 0, 1, \u221e, then the matrix <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> which maps ''z''<sub>1,2,3</sub> to ''w''<sub>1,2,3</sub> becomes\n:<math>\\mathfrak{H} = \\mathfrak{H}_2^{-1} \\mathfrak{H}_1.</math>\n\nThe stabilizer of {0, 1, \u221e} (as an unordered set) is a subgroup known as the [[anharmonic group]].\n\n==== Explicit determinant formula ====\nThe equation\n:<math>w=\\frac{az+b}{cz+d}</math>\nis equivalent to the equation of a standard [[hyperbola]]\n:<math>\\, c wz -az+dw -b=0 </math>\nin the (''z'',''w'')-plane. The problem of constructing a M\u00f6bius transformation <math> \\mathfrak{H}(z) </math> mapping a triple <math> (z_1, z_2, z_3 )</math> to another triple <math>(w_1, w_2, w_3 )</math> is thus equivalent to finding the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' of the hyperbola passing through the points <math> (z_i, w_i ) </math>. An explicit equation can be found by evaluating the [[determinant]]\n:<math>\\det \\begin{pmatrix} zw & z & w & 1 \\\\ z_1w_1 & z_1 & w_1 & 1 \\\\   z_2w_2 & z_2 & w_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3w_3 & z_3 & w_3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\nby means of a [[Laplace expansion]] along the first row. This results in the determinant formulae\n:<math>a=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 & w_1 & 1 \\\\   z_2w_2 & w_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3w_3 & w_3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\n:<math>b=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 & z_1 & w_1 \\\\   z_2w_2 & z_2 & w_2 \\\\   z_3w_3 & z_3 & w_3 \\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\n:<math>c=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1 & w_1 & 1 \\\\   z_2 & w_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3 & w_3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\, </math>\n:<math>d=\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_1w_1 & z_1 & 1 \\\\  z_2w_2 & z_2 & 1 \\\\   z_3w_3 & z_3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nfor the coefficients ''a,b,c,d'' of the representing matrix <math>\\, \\mathfrak{H} =\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\  c & d \\end{pmatrix} </math>. The constructed matrix <math> \\mathfrak{H} </math> has determinant equal to <math> (z_1-z_2) (z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_3)(w_1-w_2) (w_1-w_3)(w_2-w_3) </math> which does not vanish if the ''z<sub>i</sub>'' resp. ''w<sub>i</sub>'' are pairwise different thus the M\u00f6bius transformation is well-defined. If one of the points ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> or ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> is \u221e, then we first divide all four determinants by this variable and then take the limit as the variable approaches \u221e.\n\n== Subgroups of the M\u00f6bius group ==\nIf we require the coefficients ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' of a M\u00f6bius transformation to be real numbers with {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc'' {{=}} 1}}, we obtain a subgroup of the M\u00f6bius group denoted as [[PSL2(R)|PSL(2,'''R''')]]. This is the group of those M\u00f6bius transformations that map the [[upper half-plane]] {{nowrap|''H'' {{=}} ''x'' + i''y'' : ''y'' > 0}} to itself, and is equal to the group of all [[biholomorphic]] (or equivalently: [[bijective]], [[conformal map|conformal]] and orientation-preserving) maps {{nowrap|''H'' \u2192 ''H''}}. If a proper [[Riemannian metric|metric]] is introduced, the upper half-plane becomes a model of the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] ''H''<sup>{{Hair space}}2</sup>, the [[Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model]], and PSL(2,'''R''') is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of ''H''<sup>{{Hair space}}2</sup> in this model.\n\nThe subgroup of all M\u00f6bius transformations that map the open disk {{nowrap|''D'' {{=}} ''z'' : {{abs|''z''}} < 1}} to itself consists of all transformations of the form\n:<math>f(z) = e^{i\\phi} \\frac{z + b}{\\bar{b} z + 1}</math>\nwith <math>\\phi</math> \u2208 '''R''', ''b'' \u2208 '''C''' and |''b''| < 1. This is equal to the group of all biholomorphic (or equivalently: bijective, angle-preserving and orientation-preserving) maps {{nowrap|''D'' \u2192 ''D''}}. By introducing a suitable metric, the open disk turns into another model of the hyperbolic plane, the [[Poincar\u00e9 disk model]], and this group is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of ''H''<sup>{{Hair space}}2</sup> in this model.\n\nSince both of the above subgroups serve as isometry groups of ''H''<sup>{{Hair space}}2</sup>, they are isomorphic. A concrete isomorphism is given by [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] with the transformation\n:<math>f(z)=\\frac{z+i}{iz+1}</math>\nwhich bijectively maps the open unit disk to the upper half plane.\n\nAlternatively, consider an open disk with radius ''r'', centered at ''r''{{Hair space}}''i''. The Poincar\u00e9 disk model in this disk becomes identical to the upper-half-plane model as ''r'' approaches \u221e.\n\nA [[maximal compact subgroup]] of the M\u00f6bius group <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> is given by {{Harvard citation|T\u00f3th|2002}}{{sfn|T\u00f3th|2002|loc=Section 1.2, Rotations and M\u00f6bius Transformations, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i76mmyvDHYUC&pg=PA22 p.&nbsp;22]}}\n:<math>\\mathcal{M}_0 := \\left\\{z \\mapsto \\frac{uz - \\bar v}{vz + \\bar u} : |u|^2 + |v|^2 = 1\\right\\},</math>\nand corresponds under the isomorphism <math>\\mathcal{M} \\cong \\operatorname{PSL}(2,\\mathbf{C})</math> to the [[projective special unitary group]] PSU(2,'''C''') which is isomorphic to the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(3) of rotations in three dimensions, and can be interpreted as rotations of the Riemann sphere.

The discrete subgroups of PSL(2,'''R''') are known as [[Fuchsian group]]s; they are important in the study of [[Riemann surface]]s.\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Apollonian circles.svg|thumb|A hyperbolic transformation is shown.

The classification has both algebraic and geometric significance. Geometrically, the different types result in different transformations of the complex plane, as the figures below illustrate.\n\nThe four types can be distinguished by looking at the [[trace (matrix)|trace]] <math>\\operatorname{tr}\\,\\mathfrak{H}=a+d</math>.

Thus, all M\u00f6bius transformations of finite [[order (group theory)|order]] are elliptic transformations, namely exactly those where \u03bb is a [[root of unity]], or, equivalently, where \u03b1 is a [[Rational number|rational]] multiple of [[pi|{{pi}}]]. The simplest possibility of a fractional multiple means ''\u03b1'' = {{pi}}/2, which is also the unique case of <math>\\operatorname{tr}\\mathfrak{H} = 0</math>, is also denoted as a '''{{visible anchor|circular transform}}'''; this corresponds geometrically to rotation by 180\u00b0 about two fixed points. This class is represented in matrix form as:\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nThere are 3 representatives fixing {0, 1, \u221e}, which are the three transpositions in the symmetry group of these 3 points: <math>1/z,</math> which fixes 1 and swaps 0 with ''\u221e'' (rotation by 180\u00b0 about the points 1 and \u22121), <math>1-z</math>, which fixes ''\u221e'' and swaps 0 with 1 (rotation by 180\u00b0 about the points 1/2 and ''\u221e''), and <math>z/(z - 1)</math> which fixes 0 and swaps 1 with ''\u221e'' (rotation by 180\u00b0 about the points 0 and 2).\n\n=== Hyperbolic transforms ===\nThe transform is said to be ''hyperbolic'' if it can be represented by a matrix <math>\\mathfrak H</math> whose trace is [[real number|real]] with\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}^2\\mathfrak{H} > 4.\\,</math>\n\nA transform is hyperbolic if and only if \u03bb is real and \u03bb \u2260 \u00b11.\n\n=== Loxodromic transforms ===\nThe transform is said to be ''loxodromic'' if <math>\\operatorname{tr}^2\\mathfrak{H}</math> is not in [0,4].

The terminology is due to considering half the absolute value of the trace, |tr|/2, as the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the transformation&nbsp;\u2013 division by 2 corrects for the dimension, so the identity has eccentricity 1 (tr/''n'' is sometimes used as an alternative for the trace for this reason), and absolute value corrects for the trace only being defined up to a factor of \u00b11 due to working in PSL. Alternatively one may use half the trace ''squared'' as a proxy for the eccentricity squared, as was done above; these classifications (but not the exact eccentricity values, since squaring and absolute values are different) agree for real traces but not complex traces. The same terminology is used for the [[SL2(R)#Classification of elements|classification of elements of SL(2, '''R''')]] (the 2-fold cover), and [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Analogous classifications|analogous classifications]] are used elsewhere. Loxodromic transformations are an essentially complex phenomenon, and correspond to complex eccentricities.\n\n== Geometric interpretation of the characteristic constant ==\nThe following picture depicts (after stereographic transformation from the sphere to the plane) the two fixed points of a M\u00f6bius transformation in the non-parabolic case:\n\n[[File:Mobius Identity.jpeg]]\n\nThe characteristic constant can be expressed in terms of its [[Natural logarithm|logarithm]]:\n:<math>e^{\\rho + \\alpha i} = k. \\;</math>\nWhen expressed in this way, the real number \u03c1 becomes an expansion factor. It indicates how repulsive the fixed point \u03b3<sub>1</sub> is, and how attractive \u03b3<sub>2</sub> is. The real number \u03b1 is a rotation factor, indicating to what extent the transform rotates the plane anti-clockwise about \u03b3<sub>1</sub> and clockwise about \u03b3<sub>2</sub>.\n\n=== Elliptic transformations ===\nIf \u03c1 = 0, then the fixed points are neither attractive nor repulsive but indifferent, and the transformation is said to be ''elliptic''. These transformations tend to move all points in circles around the two fixed points. If one of the fixed points is at infinity, this is equivalent to doing an affine rotation around a point.\n\nIf we take the [[one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any elliptic M\u00f6bius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a family of circles which is nested between the two fixed points on the Riemann sphere. In general, the two fixed points can be any two distinct points.\n\nThis has an important physical interpretation.\nImagine that some observer rotates with constant angular velocity about some axis. Then we can take the two fixed points to be the North and South poles of the celestial sphere. The appearance of the night sky is now transformed continuously in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of elliptic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, \u221e, and with the number \u03b1 corresponding to the constant angular velocity of our observer.\n\nHere are some figures illustrating the effect of an elliptic M\u00f6bius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):\n\n[[File:Mobius Small Neg Elliptical.jpeg]]\n\n[[File:Mobius Large Pos Elliptical.jpeg]]\n\nThese pictures illustrate the effect of a single M\u00f6bius transformation. The one-parameter subgroup which it generates ''continuously'' moves points along the family of circular arcs suggested by the pictures.\n\n=== Hyperbolic transformations ===\n\nIf \u03b1 is zero (or a multiple of 2{{pi}}), then the transformation is said to be ''hyperbolic''. These transformations tend to move points along circular paths from one fixed point toward the other.\n\nIf we take the [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any hyperbolic M\u00f6bius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a certain family of circular arcs ''away'' from the first fixed point and ''toward'' the second fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.\n\nThis too has an important physical interpretation. Imagine that an observer accelerates (with constant magnitude of acceleration) in the direction of the North pole on his celestial sphere. Then the appearance of the night sky is transformed in exactly the manner described by the one-parameter subgroup of hyperbolic transformations sharing the fixed points 0, \u221e, with the real number \u03c1 corresponding to the magnitude of his acceleration vector. The stars seem to move along longitudes, away from the South pole toward the North pole. (The longitudes appear as circular arcs under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane.)\n\nHere are some figures illustrating the effect of a hyperbolic M\u00f6bius transformation on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane):\n\n[[File:Mobius Small Neg Hyperbolic.jpeg]]\n\n[[File:Mobius Large Pos Hyperbolic.jpeg]]\n\nThese pictures resemble the field lines of a positive and a negative electrical charge located at the fixed points, because the circular flow lines subtend a constant angle between the two fixed points.\n\n=== Loxodromic transformations ===\n\nIf both \u03c1 and \u03b1 are nonzero, then the transformation is said to be ''loxodromic''. These transformations tend to move all points in S-shaped paths from one fixed point to the other.\n\nThe word \"[[loxodrome]]\" is from the Greek: \"\u03bb\u03bf\u03be\u03bf\u03c2 (loxos), ''slanting'' + \u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (dromos), ''course''\". When [[sailing]] on a constant [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] \u2013 if you maintain a heading of (say) north-east, you will eventually wind up sailing around the [[north pole]] in a [[logarithmic spiral]]. On the [[mercator projection]] such a course is a straight line, as the north and south poles project to infinity. The angle that the loxodrome subtends relative to the lines of longitude (i.e. its slope, the \"tightness\" of the spiral) is the argument of ''k''. Of course, M\u00f6bius transformations may have their two fixed points anywhere, not just at the north and south poles. But any loxodromic transformation will be conjugate to a transform that moves all points along such loxodromes.\n\nIf we take the [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroup]] generated by any loxodromic M\u00f6bius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the ''same'' two points. All other points flow along a certain family of curves, ''away'' from the first fixed point and ''toward'' the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often around the other fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.\n\nYou can probably guess the physical interpretation in the case when the two fixed points are 0, \u221e: an observer who is both rotating (with constant angular velocity) about some axis and moving along the ''same'' axis, will see the appearance of the night sky transform according to the one-parameter subgroup of loxodromic transformations with fixed points 0, \u221e, and with \u03c1, \u03b1 determined respectively by the magnitude of the actual linear and angular velocities.\n\n=== Stereographic projection ===\nThese images show M\u00f6bius transformations [[stereographic projection|stereographically projected]] onto the [[Riemann sphere]]. Note in particular that when projected onto a sphere, the special case of a fixed point at infinity looks no different from having the fixed points in an arbitrary location.\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''One fixed point at infinity'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-elip-inf-480.png|thumb|Elliptic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-hyp-inf-480.png|thumb|Hyperbolic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-lox-inf-480.png|thumb|Loxodromic]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Fixed points diametrically opposite'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-elip-opp-480.png|thumb|Elliptic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-hyp-opp-480.png|thumb|Hyperbolic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-lox-opp-480.png|thumb|Loxodromic]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Fixed points in an arbitrary location'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-elip-arb-480.png|thumb|Elliptic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-hyp-arb-480.png|thumb|Hyperbolic]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Mob3d-lox-arb-480.png|thumb|Loxodromic]]\n|}\n\n== Iterating a transformation ==\n\nIf a transformation <math>\\mathfrak{H}</math> has fixed points \u03b3<sub>1</sub>, \u03b3<sub>2</sub>, and characteristic constant ''k'', then <math>\\mathfrak{H}' = \\mathfrak{H}^n</math> will have <math>\\gamma_1' = \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2' = \\gamma_2, k' = k^n</math>.\n\nThis can be used to [[iterate (math)|iterate]] a transformation, or to animate one by breaking it up into steps.\n\nThese images show three points (red, blue and black) continuously iterated under transformations with various characteristic constants.\n\n{| style=\"margin: auto;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Mobius23621.jpeg]] || [[File:Mobius23622.jpeg]] || [[File:Mobius23623.jpeg]] ||\n|-\n|\n|}\n\nAnd these images demonstrate what happens when you transform a circle under Hyperbolic, Elliptical, and Loxodromic transforms.

To each (''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>4</sup>, associate the [[hermitian matrix]]\n\n:<math>X=\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_0+x_1 & x_2+ix_3\\\\\nx_2-ix_3 & x_0-x_1\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe [[determinant]] of the matrix ''X'' is equal to ''Q''(''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>). The [[special linear group]] acts on the space of such matrices via\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>X\\mapsto AXA^*</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nfor each ''A'' \u2208 SL(2,'''C'''), and this action of SL(2,'''C''') preserves the determinant of ''X'' because {{nowrap|1=det ''A'' = 1}}. Since the determinant of ''X'' is identified with the quadratic form ''Q'', SL(2,'''C''') acts by Lorentz transformations. On dimensional grounds, SL(2,'''C''') covers a neighborhood of the identity of SO(1,3). Since SL(2,'''C''') is connected, it covers the entire restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3). Furthermore, since the [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of the action ({{EquationNote|1}}) is the subgroup {\u00b1''I''}, then passing to the [[quotient group]] gives the [[group isomorphism]]\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\operatorname{PSL}(2,\\mathbf{C})\\cong SO^+(1,3).</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nFocusing now attention on the case when (''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>) is null, the matrix ''X'' has zero determinant, and therefore splits as the [[outer product]] of a complex two-vector \u03be with its complex conjugate:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>X = \\xi\\bar{\\xi}^T=\\xi\\xi^*.</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nThe two-component vector \u03be is acted upon by SL(2,'''C''') in a manner compatible with ({{EquationNote|1}}). It is now clear that the kernel of the representation of SL(2,'''C''') on hermitian matrices is {\u00b1''I''}.\n\nThe action of PSL(2,'''C''') on the celestial sphere may also be described geometrically using [[stereographic projection]]. Consider first the hyperplane in '''R'''<sup>4</sup> given by ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. The celestial sphere may be identified with the sphere ''S''<sup>+</sup> of intersection of the hyperplane with the future null cone ''N''<sup>+</sup>. The stereographic projection from the north pole (1,0,0,1) of this sphere onto the plane ''x''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 takes a point with coordinates (1,''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>) with\n\n:<math>x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1</math>\n\nto the point\n\n:<math>\\left(1, \\frac{x_1}{1-x_3}, \\frac{x_2}{1-x_3},0\\right).</math>\n\nIntroducing the [[complex number|complex]] coordinate\n\n:<math>\\zeta = \\frac{x_1+ix_2}{1-x_3},</math>\n\nthe inverse stereographic projection gives the following formula for a point (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>) on ''S''<sup>+</sup>:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_1 &= \\frac{\\zeta+\\bar{\\zeta}}{\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}+1}\\\\\nx_2 &= \\frac{\\zeta-\\bar{\\zeta}}{i(\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}+1)}\\\\\nx_3 &= \\frac{\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}-1}{\\zeta\\bar{\\zeta}+1}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nThe action of SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) on the points of ''N''<sup>+</sup> does not preserve the hyperplane ''S''<sup>+</sup>, but acting on points in ''S''<sup>+</sup> and then rescaling so that the result is again in ''S''<sup>+</sup> gives an action of SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) on the sphere which goes over to an action on the complex variable \u03b6. In fact, this action is by fractional linear transformations, although this is not easily seen from this representation of the celestial sphere. Conversely, for any fractional linear transformation of \u03b6 variable goes over to a unique Lorentz transformation on ''N''<sup>+</sup>, possibly after a suitable (uniquely determined) rescaling.\n\nA more invariant description of the stereographic projection which allows the action to be more clearly seen is to consider the variable \u03b6&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z'':''w'' as a ratio of a pair of homogeneous coordinates for the complex projective line '''CP'''<sup>1</sup>. The stereographic projection goes over to a transformation from '''C'''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;{0} to ''N''<sup>+</sup> which is homogeneous of degree two with respect to real scalings\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>(z,w)\\mapsto (x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)=(z\\bar{z}+w\\bar{w}, z\\bar{z}-w\\bar{w}, z\\bar{w}+w\\bar{z}, i^{-1}(z\\bar{w}-w\\bar{z}))</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nwhich agrees with ({{EquationNote|4}}) upon restriction to scales in which <math>z\\bar{z}+w\\bar{w}=1.</math> The components of ({{EquationNote|5}}) are precisely those obtained from the outer product\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_0+x_1 & x_2+ix_3\\\\\nx_2-ix_3 & x_0-x_1\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n2\\begin{bmatrix}\nz\\\\ w\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\bar{z}&\\bar{w}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nIn summary, the action of the restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1,3) agrees with that of the M\u00f6bius group PSL(2,'''C'''). This motivates the following definition. In dimension ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;2, the '''M\u00f6bius group''' M\u00f6b(''n'') is the group of all orientation-preserving [[conformal geometry|conformal]] [[isometry|isometries]] of the round sphere ''S''<sup>''n''</sup> to itself. By realizing the conformal sphere as the space of future-pointing rays of the null cone in the Minkowski space '''R'''<sup>1,n+1</sup>, there is an isomorphism of M\u00f6b(''n'') with the restricted Lorentz group SO<sup>+</sup>(1,''n''+1) of Lorentz transformations with positive determinant, preserving the direction of time.\n\nCoxeter began instead with the equivalent quadratic form <math>Q(x_1,\\ x_2,\\ x_3 \\ x_4) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - x_4^2 .</math>\n\nHe identified the Lorentz group with transformations for which {''x'' : Q(''x'') = -1} is [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable]]. Then he interpreted the x's as [[homogeneous coordinates]]  and {''x'' : Q(''x'') = 0}, the [[null cone]], as the [[Cayley absolute]] for a hyperbolic space of points {''x'' : Q(''x'') < 0}. Next, Coxeter introduced the variables\n:<math>\\xi = \\frac {x_1}{x_4} , \\ \\eta = \\frac {x_2}{x_4}, \\ \\zeta = \\frac {x_3}{x_4} </math>\n\nso that the Lorentz-invariant quadric corresponds to the sphere <math>\\xi^2 + \\eta^2 + \\zeta^2 = 1 .</math> Coxeter notes that [[Felix Klein]] also wrote of this correspondence, applying stereographic projection from (0, 0, 1) to the complex plane <math>z = \\frac{\\xi + i \\eta}{1 - \\zeta}.</math>\nCoxeter used the fact that circles of the inversive plane represent planes of hyperbolic space, and the general homography is the product of inversions in two or four circles, corresponding to the general hyperbolic displacement which is the product of inversions in two or four planes.\n\n=== Hyperbolic space ===\nAs seen above, the M\u00f6bius group PSL(2,'''C''') acts on Minkowski space as the group of those isometries that preserve the origin, the orientation of space and the direction of time. Restricting to the points where ''Q''=1 in the positive light cone, which form a model of [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, we see that the M\u00f6bius group acts on ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup> as a group of orientation-preserving isometries. In fact, the M\u00f6bius group is equal to the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.\n\nIf we use the [[Poincar\u00e9 disk model|Poincar\u00e9 ball model]], identifying the unit ball in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> with ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, then we can think of the Riemann sphere as the \"conformal boundary\" of ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>. Every orientation-preserving isometry of ''H''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup> gives rise to a M\u00f6bius transformation on the Riemann sphere and vice versa; this is the very first observation leading to the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjectures in physics.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bilinear transform]]\n* [[Conformal geometry]]\n* [[Fuchsian group]]\n* [[Generalised circle]]\n* [[Hyperbolic geometry]]\n* [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]]\n* [[Inversion transformation]]\n* [[Kleinian group]]\n* [[Lie sphere geometry]]\n* [[Linear fractional transformation]]\n* [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)]]\n* [[Lorentz group]]\n* [[Modular group]]\n* [[Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model]]\n* [[Projective geometry]]\n* [[Projective line over a ring]]\n* [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n'''Specific'''\n{{reflist|40em}}\n'''General'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation |last=Arnold |first=Douglas N. |last2=Rogness |first2=Jonathan |year=2008 |title=M\u00f6bius Transformations Revealed |journal=Notices of the AMS |pages=1226\u20131231 |volume=55 |issue=10 |url=http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/papers/moebius.pdf }}\n* {{citation | first=Alan F.|last=Beardon | title=The Geometry of Discrete Groups | publisher=New York: Springer-Verlag | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-387-90788-8}}\n* {{citation | first=G.

He first appears in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog CD]]''. He is given orders to go back in time and change the past so that Dr. Eggman can rule the future. Sonic must race him in Stardust Speedway to free Amy Rose. He is severely wounded when he crashes and falls, but is rejuvenated by Robotnik in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II]]'', only to be defeated again in a similar style. He returns in ''[[Knuckles' Chaotix]]'', where he attempts to obtain the Chaos Rings, but he is stopped by the Chaotix. Metal Sonic notably acted as the main antagonist in ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', appearing in a new form as Neo Metal Sonic before transforming into the game's final boss, the Metal Overlord. Upon being defeated by Super Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, he reverts to his traditional appearance. He appears as the main antagonist in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)]]'', where Eggman records Sonic's abilities and uploads them to Metal Sonic, who proceeds in attempting to destroy the world before being tossed into lava by Sonic. Metal Sonic appears as a bonus playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals]]'', reprogrammed to aid Eggman Nega in his attempt to take over the world. He returns as a playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals 2]]'', under orders from Eggman to aid Shadow in stopping Eggman Nega's plans. In ''[[Sonic Free Riders]]'', Metal Sonic is a playable character and the final opponent in the game's story mode. In ''[[Sonic Generations]]'', he appears in his classic form as a rival boss, battling Classic Sonic in Stardust Speedway before ultimately being destroyed. Metal Sonic returns as a boss character in ''[[Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric]]'' and ''[[Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal]]''. He appears in the ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' episode, \"It Wasn't Me, It Was the One-Armed Hedgehog\". Metal Sonic appears as a boss in the Sonic story mode of ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''.\n\nMetal Sonic appeared as a playable character in the multiplayer mode of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]'', as well as ''[[Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing]]'', ''[[Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed]]'', and all the ''[[Mario & Sonic]]'' titles beginning with ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]''. Collecting all the emblems in ''[[Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut]]'' unlocks Metal Sonic as a bonus playable character in Sonic's stages, and purchasing both episodes of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I|Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'' unlocks bonus levels in which Metal Sonic is playable.\n\nHe possesses great strength, including a [[Raygun|laser cannon]], a [[jet engine]] and a [[force shield|force field device]] he can use to protect himself from projectiles and certain attacks.

The sequel, ''[[Sonic 2]]'', gave Sonic a fox friend named [[Tails (character)|Tails]]. ''[[Sonic CD]]'' introduced [[Amy Rose]], a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic. ''[[Sonic 3]]'' introduced [[Knuckles the Echidna]], Sonic's rival and, later, friend. All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games.\n\nThe series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years. These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like [[Shadow the Hedgehog]] and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like [[Metal Sonic]] and [[E-123 Omega]], as well as human characters like Eggman's grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]].

He first appears in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog CD]]''. He is given orders to go back in time and change the past so that Dr. Eggman can rule the future. Sonic must race him in Stardust Speedway to free Amy Rose. He is severely wounded when he crashes and falls, but is rejuvenated by Robotnik in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II]]'', only to be defeated again in a similar style. He returns in ''[[Knuckles' Chaotix]]'', where he attempts to obtain the Chaos Rings, but he is stopped by the Chaotix. Metal Sonic notably acted as the main antagonist in ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', appearing in a new form as Neo Metal Sonic before transforming into the game's final boss, the Metal Overlord. Upon being defeated by Super Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, he reverts to his traditional appearance. He appears as the main antagonist in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)]]'', where Eggman records Sonic's abilities and uploads them to Metal Sonic, who proceeds in attempting to destroy the world before being tossed into lava by Sonic. Metal Sonic appears as a bonus playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals]]'', reprogrammed to aid Eggman Nega in his attempt to take over the world. He returns as a playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals 2]]'', under orders from Eggman to aid Shadow in stopping Eggman Nega's plans. In ''[[Sonic Free Riders]]'', Metal Sonic is a playable character and the final opponent in the game's story mode. In ''[[Sonic Generations]]'', he appears in his classic form as a rival boss, battling Classic Sonic in Stardust Speedway before ultimately being destroyed. Metal Sonic returns as a boss character in ''[[Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric]]'' and ''[[Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal]]''. He appears in the ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' episode, \"It Wasn't Me, It Was the One-Armed Hedgehog\". Metal Sonic appears as a boss in the Sonic story mode of ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''.\n\nMetal Sonic appeared as a playable character in the multiplayer mode of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]'', as well as ''[[Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing]]'', ''[[Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed]]'', and all the ''[[Mario & Sonic]]'' titles beginning with ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]''. Collecting all the emblems in ''[[Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut]]'' unlocks Metal Sonic as a bonus playable character in Sonic's stages, and purchasing both episodes of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I|Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'' unlocks bonus levels in which Metal Sonic is playable.\n\nHe possesses great strength, including a [[Raygun|laser cannon]], a [[jet engine]] and a [[force shield|force field device]] he can use to protect himself from projectiles and certain attacks. He usually only communicates with a series of electronic noises. The only notable time Metal Sonic was able to talk was in ''Sonic Heroes'' in which he was voiced by [[Jun'ichi Kanemaru]] in Japanese and [[Ryan Drummond]] in English.\n\n[[GameDaily]] placed Metal Sonic 13th on their \"Top 25 Video Game Robots\" list, describing him as Dr. Robotnik's \"greatest creation\" and praising the strength of his abilities.<ref>Buffa, Chris (2009-02-06).

{"title_page": "Townshend Acts", "text_new": "{{pp-pc|small=yes}}\n[[File:CharlesTownshend.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Townshend]] spearheaded the laws, but died before their detrimental effects became apparent.]]\n{{American Revolution sidebar}}\n\nThe '''Townshend Acts''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|a\u028a|n|z|\u0259n|d}}) were a series of British acts of Parliament passed during 1767 and 1768 relating to the British colonies in America. They are named after [[Charles Townshend]], the Chancellor of the Exchequer who proposed the program. Historians vary slightly as to which acts they include under the heading \"Townshend Acts\", but five are often listed:<ref>Dickerson (''Navigation Acts'', 195\u201395) for example, writes that there were four Townshend Acts, and does not mention the New York Restraining Act, which Chaffin says was \"officially a part of the Potato Acts\" (\"Townshend Acts\", 128).</ref>\n* [[Townshend Acts#The New York Restraining Act 1767|'''The New York Restraining Act 1767''']] passed on June 5, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Revenue Act 1767|'''The Revenue Act 1767''']] passed on June 26, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Indemnity Act 1767|'''The Indemnity Act 1767''']] passed on June 29, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767|'''The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767''']] passed on June 29, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768|'''The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768''']] passed on July 6, 1768\n\nThe purposes of the acts were to:\n* raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain\n* create more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations\n* punish the [[Province of New York]] for failing to comply with the 1765 [[Quartering Acts|Quartering Act]]\n* establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 126.</ref>\n\nThe Townshend Acts were met with resistance in the colonies, which eventually resulted in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 1770. They placed an indirect tax on glass, lead, paints, paper, and tea, all of which had to be imported from Britain. This form of revenue generation was Townshend's response to the failure of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which had provided the first form of direct taxation placed upon the colonies. However, the import duties proved to be similarly controversial. Colonial indignation over the acts was expressed in [[John Dickinson]]'s ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]'' and in the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]]. There was widespread protest, and American port cities refused to import British goods, so Parliament began to partially repeal the Townshend duties.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 143.</ref> In March 1770, most of the taxes from the Townshend Acts were repealed by Parliament under [[Frederick, Lord North]]. However, the import duty on tea was retained in order to demonstrate to the colonists that Parliament held the sovereign authority to tax its colonies, in accordance with the [[Declaratory Act of 1766]]. The British government continued to tax the American colonies [[No taxation without representation|without providing representation in Parliament]]. American resentment, corrupt British officials, and abusive enforcement spurred colonial attacks on British ships, including the [[Gaspee Affair|burning of the ''Gaspee'']] in 1772. The Townshend Acts' taxation on imported tea was enforced once again by the [[Tea Act of 1773]], and this led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 in which people of Boston destroyed a shipment of taxed tea. Parliament responded with severe punishments in the [[Intolerable Acts]] of 1774. The Thirteen Colonies drilled their militia units, and war finally erupted in [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775, launching the [[American Revolution]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the British government was deep in debt. To pay a small fraction of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of [[British America]]. Previously, through the [[Trade and Navigation Acts]], Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. But with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764, Parliament sought, for the first time, to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists argued that there were constitutional issues involved.<ref>Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 206.</ref>\n\nThe Americans claimed they were not represented in Parliament, but the British government retorted that they had \"[[virtual representation]]\", a concept the Americans rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonard W. Levy|title=Seasoned Judgments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7lKq0dfs54C&pg=PA303|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=303}}</ref> This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention after Parliament's passage of the [[Stamp Act 1765]]. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the failure to raise substantial revenue.\n\nImplicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 10.</ref> Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the [[Declaratory Act]], which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 21\u201325.</ref>\n\n==The five Townshend Acts==\n\n===The New York Restraining Act 1767===\nThis was the first of the five acts, passed on June 5, 1767. It forbade the New York Assembly and the governor of New York from passing any new bills until they agreed to comply with the [[Quartering Acts#Quartering Act 1765|Quartering Act 1765]], which required them to pay for and provide housing, food and supplies for British troops in the colony. New York resisted the Quartering Act because it amounted to taxation without representation, since they had no representatives in Parliament. Further, New York and the other colonies did not believe British soldiers were any longer necessary in the colonies, since the [[French and Indian War]] had come to an end. However, New York reluctantly agreed to pay for at least some of the soldiers' needs as they understood they were going to be punished by Parliament unless they acted. The New York Restraining Act was never implemented because the New York Assembly acted in time.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/new-york-restraining-act-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Revenue Act 1767===\nThis was the second of the five acts, passed on June 26, 1767. It placed taxes on glass, lead, painters' colors, and paper. It gave customs officials broad authority to enforce the taxes and punish smugglers through the use of \"[[writs of assistance]]\", general warrants that could be used to search private property for smuggled goods. There was an angry response from colonists, who deemed the taxes a threat to their rights as British subjects. The use of writs of assistance was significantly controversial, since the right to be secure in one's private property was an established right in Britain.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/revenue-act-of-1767-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Indemnity Act 1767===\nThis act was the (joint) third act, passed on June 29, 1767, the same day as the Commissioners of Customs Act (see below). '[[Indemnity]]' means 'security or protection against a loss or other financial burden'.<ref>https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/indemnity</ref> The Indemnity Act 1767 reduced taxes on the [[British East India Company]] when they imported tea into England. This allowed them to re-export the tea to the colonies more cheaply and resell it to the colonists. At the time, all items had to be shipped to England first from wherever they were made, and then re-exported to their destination, including to the colonies.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/indemnity-act-of-1767-text.html</ref> This followed from the principle of [[mercantilism]] in England, which meant the colonies were forced to trade only with England.<ref>http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/market_to_market/pages/mercantilism_imports_and_e.htm</ref>\n\nThe [[British East India Company]] was one of England's largest companies, but was on the verge of collapse due to much cheaper smuggled Dutch tea. Part of the purpose of the entire series of Townshend Acts was to save the company from imploding. Since tea smuggling had become a common and successful practice, Parliament realized how difficult it was to enforce the taxing of tea. The Act stated that no more taxes would be placed on tea, and it made the cost of the East India Company's tea less than tea that was smuggled via [[Holland]]. It was an incentive for the colonists to purchase the East India Company tea.<ref>http://www.tea-party-boston.com/the-indemnity-act</ref>\n\n===The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767===\nThis act was passed on June 29, 1767 also. It created a new Customs Board for the North American colonies, to be headquartered in Boston with five customs commissioners. New offices were eventually opened in other ports as well. The Board was created to enforce shipping regulations and increase tax revenue. Previously, customs enforcement was handled by the Customs Board back in England. Due to the distance, enforcement was poor, taxes were avoided and smuggling was rampant. Once the new Customs Board was in operation, enforcement increased, leading to confrontation with smuggling colonists. Incidents between customs and officials, military personnel and colonists broke out across the colonies, eventually leading to the occupation of Boston by British troops. This led to the [[Boston Massacre]].<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/commissioners-of-customs-act-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768===\nThis was the last of the five acts passed. It was not passed until July 6, 1768, a full year after the other four. Lord Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after whom the Townshend Acts were named, had died suddenly in September, 1767. Because of this, some scholars do not include the Vice-Admiralty Court Act with the other Townshend Acts, but most do since it deals with the same issues. The Act was not passed by Parliament, but by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, with the approval of the King.\n\nThe Act was passed to aid the prosecution of smugglers. It gave Royal naval courts, rather than colonial courts, jurisdiction over all matters concerning customs violations and smuggling. Before the Act, customs violators could be tried in an admiralty court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, if royal prosecutors believed they would not get a favorable outcome using a local judge and jury. The Vice-Admiralty Court Act added three new royal admiralty courts in Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston to aid in more effective prosecutions. These courts were run by judges appointed by the Crown and who were awarded 5% of any fine the judge levied<ref>https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/01/vice-admiralty-courts-and-writs-of-assistance/</ref> when they found someone guilty. The decisions were made solely by the judge, without the option of trial by jury, which was considered to be a fundamental right of British subjects. In addition, the accused person had to travel to the court of jurisdiction at his own expense; if he did not appear, he was automatically considered guilty.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/vice-admiralty-court-act-of-1768-text.html</ref>\n\n==Townshend's program==\n\n===Raising revenue===\nThe first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act 1767.<ref>The Revenue Act 1767 was 7 Geo. III ch. 46; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 47; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 270n12. It is also known as the Townshend Revenue Act, the Townshend Duties Act, and the Tariff Act 1767.</ref> This act represented the [[Chatham ministry]]'s new approach to generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 143; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 9.</ref> The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or \"internal\") tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or \"external\") taxes, such as taxes on imports.<ref name=\"Reid33+\">Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 33\u201339.</ref> With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new [[duty (economics)|duties]] on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 9; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 19\u201320.</ref> These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 127.</ref>\n\nThe colonists' objection to \"internal\" taxes did not mean that they would accept \"external\" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"Reid33+\" /> \"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional\", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, \"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.\"<ref>Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 33.</ref> The Townshend Revenue Act received the [[royal assent]] on 29 June 1767.<ref name=\"Thomas31\">Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 31.</ref> There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. \"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage\", wrote historian Peter Thomas.<ref name=\"Thomas31\" />\n\nThe Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act 1767,<ref>The Indemnity Act was 7 Geo. III ch. 56; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 269n20. It is also known as the Tea Act 1767; Jensen, ''Founding'', 435.</ref> which was intended to make the tea of the [[British East India Company]] more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.<ref>Dickerson, ''Navigation Acts'', 196.</ref> The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.<ref>Labaree,''Tea Party'', 21.</ref> The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of [[writs of assistance]], or general [[search warrant]]s, which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.<ref>Reid, ''Rebellious Spirit'', 29, 135n24.</ref>\n\nThe original stated purpose of the Townshend duties was to raise a revenue to help pay the cost of maintaining an army in North America.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 22\u201323.</ref> Townshend changed the purpose of the tax plan, however, and instead decided to use the revenue to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 23\u201325.</ref> Previously, the colonial assemblies had paid these salaries, but Parliament hoped to take the \"[[power of the purse]]\"<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 260.</ref> away from the colonies. According to historian John C. Miller, \"Townshend ingeniously sought to take money from Americans by means of parliamentary taxation and to employ it against their liberties by making colonial governors and judges independent of the assemblies.\"<ref>Miller, ''Origins'', 255.</ref>\n\nSome members of Parliament objected because Townshend's plan was expected to generate only \u00a340,000 in yearly revenue, but he explained that once the precedent for taxing the colonists had been firmly established, the program could gradually be expanded until the colonies paid for themselves.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 128; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 30.</ref> According to historian Peter Thomas, Townshend's \"aims were political rather than financial\".<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 30.</ref>\n\n===American Board of Customs Commissioners===\nTo better collect the new taxes, the Commissioners of Customs Act 1767 established the American Board of Customs Commissioners, which was modeled on the [[British Board of Customs]].<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 47.</ref> The Board was created because of the difficulties the British Board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 33</ref> Five commissioners were appointed to the board, which was headquartered in Boston.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 130.</ref> The American Customs Board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the British government. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, \"The actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the Empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board.\"<ref>Dickerson, ''Navigation Acts'', 199.</ref>\n\nThe American Board of Customs Commissioners was notoriously corrupt, according to historians. Political scientist Peter Andreas argues:\n:merchants resented not only the squeeze on smuggling but also the exploits by unscrupulous customs agents that came with it. Such \"customs racketeering\" was, in the view of colonial merchants, essentially legalized piracy.<ref>Peter Andreas, ''Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America'' (2012) p 34</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]] says:\n:In the establishment of this American Board of Customs Commissioners, Americans saw the extension of England's corrupt system of officeholding to America. As Professor Dickerson has shown, the Commissioners were indeed corrupt. They engaged in extensive \"customs racketeering\" and they were involved in many of the episodes of heightened the tension between England and the colonies: it was on their request that troops were sent to Boston; The Boston Massacre took place before their headquarters; the \"Gaspee\" was operating under their orders.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edmund S. Morgan|title=The Challenge of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Y4XAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA104|year=1978|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=104\u20135}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Doug Krehbiel argues:\n:Disputes brought to the board were almost exclusively resolved in favor of the British government. Vice admiralty courts claimed to prosecute vigorously smugglers but were widely corrupt\u2014customs officials falsely accused ship owners of possessing undeclared items, thereby seizing the cargoes of entire vessels, and justices of the juryless courts were entitled to a percentage of the goods from colonial ships that they ruled unlawful. Writs of assistance and blanket search warrants to search for smuggled goods were liberally abused. John Hancock, the wealthy New England merchant, had his ship \"Liberty\" seized in 1768 on a false charge, incensing the colonists. Charges against Hancock were later dropped and his ship returned because of the fear that he would appeal to more scrupulous customs officials in Britain.<ref>Doug Krehbiel, \"British Empire and the Atlantic World,\" in Paul Finkelman, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the New American Nation'' (2005) 1:228</ref>\n\nAnother measure to enforce the trade laws was the Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HK4uAAAAIAAJ 8 Geo. III ch. 22].</ref> Although often included in discussions of the Townshend Acts, this act was initiated by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] when Townshend was not present, and was not passed until after his death.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 34\u201335.</ref> Before this act, there was just one [[vice admiralty court]] in North America, located in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. Established in 1764, this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies, and so the 1768 Vice Admiralty Court Act created four district courts, which were located at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Boston, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. One purpose of the vice admiralty courts, which did not have [[jury|juries]], was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers, since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations.\n\nTownshend also faced the problem of what to do about the [[New York Provincial Assembly]], which had refused to comply with the 1765 [[Quartering Act]] because its members saw the act's financial provisions as levying an unconstitutional tax.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 134.</ref> The New York Restraining Act,<ref>7 Geo. III ch. 59. Also known as the New York Suspending Act; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 296.</ref> which according to historian Robert Chaffin was \"officially a part of the Townshend Acts\",<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 128.</ref> suspended the power of the Assembly until it complied with the Quartering Act. The Restraining Act never went into effect because, by the time it was passed, the New York Assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the Quartering Act. The Assembly avoided conceding the right of Parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the Quartering Act when appropriating this money; they also passed a resolution stating that Parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 134\u201335.</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\nTownshend knew that his program would be controversial in the colonies, but he argued that, \"The superiority of the mother country can at no time be better exerted than now.\"<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 131.</ref> The Townshend Acts did not create an instant uproar like the Stamp Act had done two years earlier, but before long, opposition to the programme had become widespread.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 48; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 76.</ref> Townshend did not live to see this reaction, having died suddenly on September 4, 1767.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickinson Farmer Letters.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[John Dickinson|Dickinson's]] ''Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania'']]\nThe most influential colonial response to the Townshend Acts was a series of twelve essays by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] entitled \"[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]\", which began appearing in December 1767.<ref name=\"Chaffin, Townshend Acts, 132\">Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 132.</ref> Eloquently articulating ideas already widely accepted in the colonies,<ref name=\"Chaffin, Townshend Acts, 132\"/> Dickinson argued that there was no difference between \"internal\" and \"external\" taxes, and that any taxes imposed on the colonies by Parliament for the sake of raising a revenue were unconstitutional.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 50.</ref> Dickinson warned colonists not to concede to the taxes just because the rates were low, since this would set a dangerous precedent.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nDickinson sent a copy of his \"Letters\" to [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], informing Otis that \"whenever the Cause of American Freedom is to be vindicated, I look towards the Province of Massachusetts Bay\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54. Dickinson's letter to Otis was dated December 5, 1767.</ref> The [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by first sending a petition to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] asking for the repeal of the Revenue Act, and then sending a letter to the other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54.</ref> Upon receipt of the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]], other colonies also sent petitions to the king.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 84; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54\u201357.</ref> Virginia and Pennsylvania also sent petitions to Parliament, but the other colonies did not, believing that it might have been interpreted as an admission of Parliament's sovereignty over them.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 85, 111\u201312.</ref> Parliament refused to consider the petitions of Virginia and Pennsylvania.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 112.</ref>\n\nIn Great Britain, [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], was alarmed by the actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he sent a letter to the colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also sent a letter to Massachusetts Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]], instructing him to have the Massachusetts House rescind the Circular Letter. By a vote of 92 to 17, the House refused to comply, and Bernard promptly dissolved the legislature.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 81; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 56.</ref>\n\n===Boycotts===\n[[File:Houghton 42-5288 - non-importation agreement, 1767.jpg|thumb|Non-importation agreement, dated October 1767, signed by Bostonians including [[Paul Revere]]]]\nMerchants in the colonies, some of them smugglers, organized economic boycotts to put pressure on their British counterparts to work for repeal of the Townshend Acts. Boston merchants organized the first non-importation agreement, which called for merchants to suspend importation of certain British goods effective 1 January 1768. Merchants in other colonial ports, including New York City and Philadelphia, eventually joined the boycott.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 57\u201358.</ref> In Virginia, the non-importation effort was organized by [[George Washington]] and [[George Mason]]. When the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] passed a resolution stating that Parliament had no right to tax Virginians without their consent, Governor [[Lord Botetourt]] dissolved the assembly. The members met at [[Raleigh Tavern]] and adopted a boycott agreement known as the \"Association\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 59.</ref>\n\nThe non-importation movement was not as effective as promoters had hoped. British exports to the colonies declined by 38 percent in 1769, but there were many merchants who did not participate in the boycott.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 157.</ref> The boycott movement began to fail by 1770, and came to an end in 1771.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 138.</ref>\n\n===Unrest in Boston===\n[[File:Boston 1768.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Revere]]'s engraving of British troops landing in [[Boston]] in 1768|alt=A wide view of a port town with several wharves.

Commodore [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]] complied by sending the fifty-gun warship [[HMS Romney (1762)|HMS ''Romney'']], which arrived in [[Boston Harbor]] in May 1768.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 63.</ref>\n\nOn June 10, 1768, customs officials seized the ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'', a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant [[John Hancock]], on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling. Bostonians, already angry because the captain of the ''Romney'' had been [[impressment|impressing]] local sailors, began to riot. Customs officials fled to [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Castle William]] for protection. With [[John Adams]] serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a [[Vice admiralty court|vice-admiralty court]], but the charges were eventually dropped.<ref>\"Notorious Smuggler\", 236\u201346; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 63\u201365.</ref>\n\nGiven the unstable state of affairs in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed Governor Bernard to try to find evidence of [[treason]] in Boston.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 109.</ref> Parliament had determined that the [[Treason Act 1543]] was still in force, which would allow Bostonians to be transported to England to stand trial for treason. Bernard could find no one who was willing to provide reliable evidence, however, and so there were no treason trials.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 296\u201397.</ref> The possibility that American colonists might be arrested and sent to England for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 69.</ref>\n\nEven before the ''Liberty'' riot, Hillsborough had decided to send troops to Boston. On 8 June 1768, he instructed General [[Thomas Gage]], [[Commander-in-Chief, North America]], to send \"such Force as You shall think necessary to Boston\", although he conceded that this might lead to \"consequences not easily foreseen\".<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 82; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 75; Jensen, ''Founding'', 290.</ref> Hillsborough suggested that Gage might send one regiment to Boston, but the ''Liberty'' incident convinced officials that more than one regiment would be needed.<ref>Reid, ''Rebellious Spirit'', 125.</ref>\n\nPeople in Massachusetts learned in September 1768 that troops were on the way.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 92.</ref> [[Samuel Adams]] organized an emergency, extralegal [[Massachusetts Convention of Towns|convention of towns]] and passed resolutions against the imminent occupation of Boston, but on 1 October 1768, the first of four regiments of the [[British Army]] began disembarking in Boston, and the Customs Commissioners returned to town.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 76.</ref> The \"[[Journal of Occurrences]]\", an anonymously written series of newspaper articles, chronicled clashes between civilians and soldiers during the military occupation of Boston, apparently with some exaggeration.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 76\u201377.</ref> Tensions rose after [[Christopher Seider]], a Boston teenager, was killed by a customs employee on 22 February 1770.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 77\u201378.</ref> Although British soldiers were not involved in that incident, resentment against the occupation escalated in the days that followed, resulting in the killing of five civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 5 March 1770.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 78\u201379.</ref> After the incident, the troops were withdrawn to Castle William.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 81.</ref>\n\n==Partial repeal==\nOn the 5th of March 1770\u2014 the same day as the Boston Massacre although news traveled slowly at the time, and neither side of the Atlantic were aware of this coincidence\u2014[[Lord North]], the new Prime Minister, presented a motion in the House of Commons that called for partial repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act.<ref name=\"Knollenberg, Growth, 71\">Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 71.</ref> Although some in Parliament advocated a complete repeal of the act, North disagreed, arguing that the tea duty should be retained to assert \"the right of taxing the Americans\".<ref name=\"Knollenberg, Growth, 71\"/> After debate, the Repeal Act<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HK4uAAAAIAAJ 10 Geo.

In fact, the modification of the Townshend Duties Act was scarcely any change at all.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 140.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Townshend duty on tea was retained when the 1773 Tea Act was passed, which allowed the East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies.

They are named after [[Charles Townshend]], the Chancellor of the Exchequer who proposed the program. Historians vary slightly as to which acts they include under the heading \"Townshend Acts\", but five are often listed:<ref>Dickerson (''Navigation Acts'', 195\u201395) for example, writes that there were four Townshend Acts, and does not mention the New York Restraining Act, which Chaffin says was \"officially a part of the Potato Acts\" (\"Townshend Acts\", 128).</ref>\n* [[Townshend Acts#The New York Restraining Act 1767|'''The New York Restraining Act 1767''']] passed on June 5, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Revenue Act 1767|'''The Revenue Act 1767''']] passed on June 26, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Indemnity Act 1767|'''The Indemnity Act 1767''']] passed on June 29, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767|'''The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767''']] passed on June 29, 1767\n* [[Townshend Acts#The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768|'''The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768''']] passed on July 6, 1768\n\nThe purposes of the acts were to:\n* raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain\n* create more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations\n* punish the [[Province of New York]] for failing to comply with the 1765 [[Quartering Acts|Quartering Act]]\n* establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 126.</ref>\n\nThe Townshend Acts were met with resistance in the colonies, which eventually resulted in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 1770. They placed an indirect tax on glass, lead, paints, paper, and tea, all of which had to be imported from Britain. This form of revenue generation was Townshend's response to the failure of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which had provided the first form of direct taxation placed upon the colonies. However, the import duties proved to be similarly controversial. Colonial indignation over the acts was expressed in [[John Dickinson]]'s ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]'' and in the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]]. There was widespread protest, and American port cities refused to import British goods, so Parliament began to partially repeal the Townshend duties.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 143.</ref> In March 1770, most of the taxes from the Townshend Acts were repealed by Parliament under [[Frederick, Lord North]]. However, the import duty on tea was retained in order to demonstrate to the colonists that Parliament held the sovereign authority to tax its colonies, in accordance with the [[Declaratory Act of 1766]]. The British government continued to tax the American colonies [[No taxation without representation|without providing representation in Parliament]]. American resentment, corrupt British officials, and abusive enforcement spurred colonial attacks on British ships, including the [[Gaspee Affair|burning of the ''Gaspee'']] in 1772. The Townshend Acts' taxation on imported tea was enforced once again by the [[Tea Act of 1773]], and this led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 in which Bostonians destroyed a shipment of taxed tea. Parliament responded with severe punishments in the [[Intolerable Acts]] of 1774. The Thirteen Colonies drilled their militia units, and war finally erupted in [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775, launching the [[American Revolution]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the British government was deep in debt. To pay a small fraction of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of [[British America]]. Previously, through the [[Trade and Navigation Acts]], Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. But with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764, Parliament sought, for the first time, to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists argued that there were constitutional issues involved.<ref>Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 206.</ref>\n\nThe Americans claimed they were not represented in Parliament, but the British government retorted that they had \"[[virtual representation]]\", a concept the Americans rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonard W.

The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the failure to raise substantial revenue.\n\nImplicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 10.</ref> Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the [[Declaratory Act]], which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 21\u201325.</ref>\n\n==The five Townshend Acts==\n\n===The New York Restraining Act 1767===\nThis was the first of the five acts, passed on June 5, 1767. It forbade the New York Assembly and the governor of New York from passing any new bills until they agreed to comply with the [[Quartering Acts#Quartering Act 1765|Quartering Act 1765]], which required them to pay for and provide housing, food and supplies for British troops in the colony. New York resisted the Quartering Act because it amounted to taxation without representation, since they had no representatives in Parliament. Further, New York and the other colonies did not believe British soldiers were any longer necessary in the colonies, since the [[French and Indian War]] had come to an end. However, New York reluctantly agreed to pay for at least some of the soldiers' needs as they understood they were going to be punished by Parliament unless they acted. The New York Restraining Act was never implemented because the New York Assembly acted in time.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/new-york-restraining-act-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Revenue Act 1767===\nThis was the second of the five acts, passed on June 26, 1767. It placed taxes on glass, lead, painters' colors, and paper. It gave customs officials broad authority to enforce the taxes and punish smugglers through the use of \"[[writs of assistance]]\", general warrants that could be used to search private property for smuggled goods. There was an angry response from colonists, who deemed the taxes a threat to their rights as British subjects. The use of writs of assistance was significantly controversial, since the right to be secure in one's private property was an established right in Britain.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/revenue-act-of-1767-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Indemnity Act 1767===\nThis act was the (joint) third act, passed on June 29, 1767, the same day as the Commissioners of Customs Act (see below). '[[Indemnity]]' means 'security or protection against a loss or other financial burden'.<ref>https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/indemnity</ref> The Indemnity Act 1767 reduced taxes on the [[British East India Company]] when they imported tea into England. This allowed them to re-export the tea to the colonies more cheaply and resell it to the colonists. At the time, all items had to be shipped to England first from wherever they were made, and then re-exported to their destination, including to the colonies.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/indemnity-act-of-1767-text.html</ref> This followed from the principle of [[mercantilism]] in England, which meant the colonies were forced to trade only with England.<ref>http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/market_to_market/pages/mercantilism_imports_and_e.htm</ref>\n\nThe [[British East India Company]] was one of England's largest companies, but was on the verge of collapse due to much cheaper smuggled Dutch tea. Part of the purpose of the entire series of Townshend Acts was to save the company from imploding. Since tea smuggling had become a common and successful practice, Parliament realized how difficult it was to enforce the taxing of tea. The Act stated that no more taxes would be placed on tea, and it made the cost of the East India Company's tea less than tea that was smuggled via [[Holland]]. It was an incentive for the colonists to purchase the East India Company tea.<ref>http://www.tea-party-boston.com/the-indemnity-act</ref>\n\n===The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767===\nThis act was passed on June 29, 1767 also. It created a new Customs Board for the North American colonies, to be headquartered in Boston with five customs commissioners. New offices were eventually opened in other ports as well. The Board was created to enforce shipping regulations and increase tax revenue. Previously, customs enforcement was handled by the Customs Board back in England. Due to the distance, enforcement was poor, taxes were avoided and smuggling was rampant. Once the new Customs Board was in operation, enforcement increased, leading to confrontation with smuggling colonists. Incidents between customs and officials, military personnel and colonists broke out across the colonies, eventually leading to the occupation of Boston by British troops. This led to the [[Boston Massacre]].<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/commissioners-of-customs-act-text.html</ref>\n\n===The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768===\nThis was the last of the five acts passed. It was not passed until July 6, 1768, a full year after the other four. Lord Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after whom the Townshend Acts were named, had died suddenly in September, 1767. Because of this, some scholars do not include the Vice-Admiralty Court Act with the other Townshend Acts, but most do since it deals with the same issues. The Act was not passed by Parliament, but by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, with the approval of the King.\n\nThe Act was passed to aid the prosecution of smugglers. It gave Royal naval courts, rather than colonial courts, jurisdiction over all matters concerning customs violations and smuggling. Before the Act, customs violators could be tried in an admiralty court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, if royal prosecutors believed they would not get a favorable outcome using a local judge and jury. The Vice-Admiralty Court Act added three new royal admiralty courts in Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston to aid in more effective prosecutions. These courts were run by judges appointed by the Crown and who were awarded 5% of any fine the judge levied<ref>https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/01/vice-admiralty-courts-and-writs-of-assistance/</ref> when they found someone guilty. The decisions were made solely by the judge, without the option of trial by jury, which was considered to be a fundamental right of British subjects. In addition, the accused person had to travel to the court of jurisdiction at his own expense; if he did not appear, he was automatically considered guilty.<ref>http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/vice-admiralty-court-act-of-1768-text.html</ref>\n\n==Townshend's program==\n\n===Raising revenue===\nThe first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act 1767.<ref>The Revenue Act 1767 was 7 Geo. III ch. 46; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 47; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 270n12. It is also known as the Townshend Revenue Act, the Townshend Duties Act, and the Tariff Act 1767.</ref> This act represented the [[Chatham ministry]]'s new approach to generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 143; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 9.</ref> The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or \"internal\") tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or \"external\") taxes, such as taxes on imports.<ref name=\"Reid33+\">Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 33\u201339.</ref> With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new [[duty (economics)|duties]] on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 9; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 19\u201320.</ref> These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 127.</ref>\n\nThe colonists' objection to \"internal\" taxes did not mean that they would accept \"external\" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"Reid33+\" /> \"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional\", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, \"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.\"<ref>Reid, ''Authority to Tax'', 33.</ref> The Townshend Revenue Act received the [[royal assent]] on 29 June 1767.<ref name=\"Thomas31\">Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 31.</ref> There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. \"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage\", wrote historian Peter Thomas.<ref name=\"Thomas31\" />\n\nThe Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act 1767,<ref>The Indemnity Act was 7 Geo. III ch. 56; Labaree, ''Tea Party'', 269n20. It is also known as the Tea Act 1767; Jensen, ''Founding'', 435.</ref> which was intended to make the tea of the [[British East India Company]] more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.<ref>Dickerson, ''Navigation Acts'', 196.</ref> The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.<ref>Labaree,''Tea Party'', 21.</ref> The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of [[writs of assistance]], or general [[search warrant]]s, which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.<ref>Reid, ''Rebellious Spirit'', 29, 135n24.</ref>\n\nThe original stated purpose of the Townshend duties was to raise a revenue to help pay the cost of maintaining an army in North America.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 22\u201323.</ref> Townshend changed the purpose of the tax plan, however, and instead decided to use the revenue to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 23\u201325.</ref> Previously, the colonial assemblies had paid these salaries, but Parliament hoped to take the \"[[power of the purse]]\"<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 260.</ref> away from the colonies. According to historian John C. Miller, \"Townshend ingeniously sought to take money from Americans by means of parliamentary taxation and to employ it against their liberties by making colonial governors and judges independent of the assemblies.\"<ref>Miller, ''Origins'', 255.</ref>\n\nSome members of Parliament objected because Townshend's plan was expected to generate only \u00a340,000 in yearly revenue, but he explained that once the precedent for taxing the colonists had been firmly established, the program could gradually be expanded until the colonies paid for themselves.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 128; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 30.</ref> According to historian Peter Thomas, Townshend's \"aims were political rather than financial\".<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 30.</ref>\n\n===American Board of Customs Commissioners===\nTo better collect the new taxes, the Commissioners of Customs Act 1767 established the American Board of Customs Commissioners, which was modeled on the [[British Board of Customs]].<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 47.</ref> The Board was created because of the difficulties the British Board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 33</ref> Five commissioners were appointed to the board, which was headquartered in Boston.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 130.</ref> The American Customs Board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the British government. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, \"The actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the Empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board.\"<ref>Dickerson, ''Navigation Acts'', 199.</ref>\n\nThe American Board of Customs Commissioners was notoriously corrupt, according to historians. Political scientist Peter Andreas argues:\n:merchants resented not only the squeeze on smuggling but also the exploits by unscrupulous customs agents that came with it. Such \"customs racketeering\" was, in the view of colonial merchants, essentially legalized piracy.<ref>Peter Andreas, ''Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America'' (2012) p 34</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]] says:\n:In the establishment of this American Board of Customs Commissioners, Americans saw the extension of England's corrupt system of officeholding to America. As Professor Dickerson has shown, the Commissioners were indeed corrupt. They engaged in extensive \"customs racketeering\" and they were involved in many of the episodes of heightened the tension between England and the colonies: it was on their request that troops were sent to Boston; The Boston Massacre took place before their headquarters; the \"Gaspee\" was operating under their orders.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edmund S. Morgan|title=The Challenge of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Y4XAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA104|year=1978|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=104\u20135}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Doug Krehbiel argues:\n:Disputes brought to the board were almost exclusively resolved in favor of the British government. Vice admiralty courts claimed to prosecute vigorously smugglers but were widely corrupt\u2014customs officials falsely accused ship owners of possessing undeclared items, thereby seizing the cargoes of entire vessels, and justices of the juryless courts were entitled to a percentage of the goods from colonial ships that they ruled unlawful. Writs of assistance and blanket search warrants to search for smuggled goods were liberally abused. John Hancock, the wealthy New England merchant, had his ship \"Liberty\" seized in 1768 on a false charge, incensing the colonists. Charges against Hancock were later dropped and his ship returned because of the fear that he would appeal to more scrupulous customs officials in Britain.<ref>Doug Krehbiel, \"British Empire and the Atlantic World,\" in Paul Finkelman, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the New American Nation'' (2005) 1:228</ref>\n\nAnother measure to enforce the trade laws was the Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HK4uAAAAIAAJ 8 Geo. III ch. 22].</ref> Although often included in discussions of the Townshend Acts, this act was initiated by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] when Townshend was not present, and was not passed until after his death.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 34\u201335.</ref> Before this act, there was just one [[vice admiralty court]] in North America, located in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. Established in 1764, this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies, and so the 1768 Vice Admiralty Court Act created four district courts, which were located at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Boston, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. One purpose of the vice admiralty courts, which did not have [[jury|juries]], was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers, since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations.\n\nTownshend also faced the problem of what to do about the [[New York Provincial Assembly]], which had refused to comply with the 1765 [[Quartering Act]] because its members saw the act's financial provisions as levying an unconstitutional tax.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 134.</ref> The New York Restraining Act,<ref>7 Geo. III ch. 59. Also known as the New York Suspending Act; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 296.</ref> which according to historian Robert Chaffin was \"officially a part of the Townshend Acts\",<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 128.</ref> suspended the power of the Assembly until it complied with the Quartering Act. The Restraining Act never went into effect because, by the time it was passed, the New York Assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the Quartering Act. The Assembly avoided conceding the right of Parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the Quartering Act when appropriating this money; they also passed a resolution stating that Parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 134\u201335.</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\nTownshend knew that his program would be controversial in the colonies, but he argued that, \"The superiority of the mother country can at no time be better exerted than now.\"<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 131.</ref> The Townshend Acts did not create an instant uproar like the Stamp Act had done two years earlier, but before long, opposition to the programme had become widespread.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 48; Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 76.</ref> Townshend did not live to see this reaction, having died suddenly on September 4, 1767.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickinson Farmer Letters.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[John Dickinson|Dickinson's]] ''Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania'']]\nThe most influential colonial response to the Townshend Acts was a series of twelve essays by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] entitled \"[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]\", which began appearing in December 1767.<ref name=\"Chaffin, Townshend Acts, 132\">Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 132.</ref> Eloquently articulating ideas already widely accepted in the colonies,<ref name=\"Chaffin, Townshend Acts, 132\"/> Dickinson argued that there was no difference between \"internal\" and \"external\" taxes, and that any taxes imposed on the colonies by Parliament for the sake of raising a revenue were unconstitutional.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 50.</ref> Dickinson warned colonists not to concede to the taxes just because the rates were low, since this would set a dangerous precedent.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nDickinson sent a copy of his \"Letters\" to [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], informing Otis that \"whenever the Cause of American Freedom is to be vindicated, I look towards the Province of Massachusetts Bay\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54. Dickinson's letter to Otis was dated December 5, 1767.</ref> The [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by first sending a petition to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] asking for the repeal of the Revenue Act, and then sending a letter to the other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54.</ref> Upon receipt of the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]], other colonies also sent petitions to the king.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 84; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 54\u201357.</ref> Virginia and Pennsylvania also sent petitions to Parliament, but the other colonies did not, believing that it might have been interpreted as an admission of Parliament's sovereignty over them.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 85, 111\u201312.</ref> Parliament refused to consider the petitions of Virginia and Pennsylvania.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 112.</ref>\n\nIn Great Britain, [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], was alarmed by the actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he sent a letter to the colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also sent a letter to Massachusetts Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]], instructing him to have the Massachusetts House rescind the Circular Letter. By a vote of 92 to 17, the House refused to comply, and Bernard promptly dissolved the legislature.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 81; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 56.</ref>\n\n===Boycotts===\n[[File:Houghton 42-5288 - non-importation agreement, 1767.jpg|thumb|Non-importation agreement, dated October 1767, signed by Bostonians including [[Paul Revere]]]]\nMerchants in the colonies, some of them smugglers, organized economic boycotts to put pressure on their British counterparts to work for repeal of the Townshend Acts. Boston merchants organized the first non-importation agreement, which called for merchants to suspend importation of certain British goods effective 1 January 1768. Merchants in other colonial ports, including New York City and Philadelphia, eventually joined the boycott.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 57\u201358.</ref> In Virginia, the non-importation effort was organized by [[George Washington]] and [[George Mason]]. When the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] passed a resolution stating that Parliament had no right to tax Virginians without their consent, Governor [[Lord Botetourt]] dissolved the assembly. The members met at [[Raleigh Tavern]] and adopted a boycott agreement known as the \"Association\".<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 59.</ref>\n\nThe non-importation movement was not as effective as promoters had hoped. British exports to the colonies declined by 38 percent in 1769, but there were many merchants who did not participate in the boycott.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 157.</ref> The boycott movement began to fail by 1770, and came to an end in 1771.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 138.</ref>\n\n===Unrest in Boston===\n[[File:Boston 1768.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Revere]]'s engraving of British troops landing in [[Boston]] in 1768|alt=A wide view of a port town with several wharves.

Commodore [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]] complied by sending the fifty-gun warship [[HMS Romney (1762)|HMS ''Romney'']], which arrived in [[Boston Harbor]] in May 1768.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 63.</ref>\n\nOn June 10, 1768, customs officials seized the ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'', a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant [[John Hancock]], on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling. Bostonians, already angry because the captain of the ''Romney'' had been [[impressment|impressing]] local sailors, began to riot. Customs officials fled to [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Castle William]] for protection. With [[John Adams]] serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a [[Vice admiralty court|vice-admiralty court]], but the charges were eventually dropped.<ref>\"Notorious Smuggler\", 236\u201346; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 63\u201365.</ref>\n\nGiven the unstable state of affairs in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed Governor Bernard to try to find evidence of [[treason]] in Boston.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 109.</ref> Parliament had determined that the [[Treason Act 1543]] was still in force, which would allow Bostonians to be transported to England to stand trial for treason. Bernard could find no one who was willing to provide reliable evidence, however, and so there were no treason trials.<ref>Jensen, ''Founding'', 296\u201397.</ref> The possibility that American colonists might be arrested and sent to England for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 69.</ref>\n\nEven before the ''Liberty'' riot, Hillsborough had decided to send troops to Boston. On 8 June 1768, he instructed General [[Thomas Gage]], [[Commander-in-Chief, North America]], to send \"such Force as You shall think necessary to Boston\", although he conceded that this might lead to \"consequences not easily foreseen\".<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 82; Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 75; Jensen, ''Founding'', 290.</ref> Hillsborough suggested that Gage might send one regiment to Boston, but the ''Liberty'' incident convinced officials that more than one regiment would be needed.<ref>Reid, ''Rebellious Spirit'', 125.</ref>\n\nPeople in Massachusetts learned in September 1768 that troops were on the way.<ref>Thomas, ''Duties Crisis'', 92.</ref> [[Samuel Adams]] organized an emergency, extralegal [[Massachusetts Convention of Towns|convention of towns]] and passed resolutions against the imminent occupation of Boston, but on 1 October 1768, the first of four regiments of the [[British Army]] began disembarking in Boston, and the Customs Commissioners returned to town.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 76.</ref> The \"[[Journal of Occurrences]]\", an anonymously written series of newspaper articles, chronicled clashes between civilians and soldiers during the military occupation of Boston, apparently with some exaggeration.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 76\u201377.</ref> Tensions rose after [[Christopher Seider]], a Boston teenager, was killed by a customs employee on 22 February 1770.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 77\u201378.</ref> Although British soldiers were not involved in that incident, resentment against the occupation escalated in the days that followed, resulting in the killing of five civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 5 March 1770.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 78\u201379.</ref> After the incident, the troops were withdrawn to Castle William.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 81.</ref>\n\n==Partial repeal==\nOn the 5th of March 1770\u2014 the same day as the Boston Massacre although news traveled slowly at the time, and neither side of the Atlantic were aware of this coincidence\u2014[[Lord North]], the new Prime Minister, presented a motion in the House of Commons that called for partial repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act.<ref name=\"Knollenberg, Growth, 71\">Knollenberg, ''Growth'', 71.</ref> Although some in Parliament advocated a complete repeal of the act, North disagreed, arguing that the tea duty should be retained to assert \"the right of taxing the Americans\".<ref name=\"Knollenberg, Growth, 71\"/> After debate, the Repeal Act<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HK4uAAAAIAAJ 10 Geo.

The revenue-producing tea levy, the American Board of Customs and, most important, the principle of making governors and magistrates independent all remained. In fact, the modification of the Townshend Duties Act was scarcely any change at all.<ref>Chaffin, \"Townshend Acts\", 140.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Townshend duty on tea was retained when the 1773 Tea Act was passed, which allowed the East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies. The Boston Tea Party soon followed, which set the stage for the American Revolution.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Chaffin, Robert J. \"The Townshend Acts crisis, 1767\u20131770\".

The town was so named because the [[Sac (people)|Sac]] and [[Meskwaki|Fox]] Indians{{refn|group=nb|Sometimes known as the Sauk and Fox\u2014the French name \"Sac\" and the English equivalent \"Sauk\" are both correct and interchangeable. Both words were derived from the Indian word \"Asakiwaki,\" meaning \"yellow earth people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/sf_kids.htm|title=Sac and Fox Indian Fact Sheet|publisher=Native Languages of the Americas website|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref>}} were in possession of the land at the time of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The City of Sac City was incorporated 19 years later, in 1874.\n\nJudge Eugene Criss, credited with being the father of Sac City, left [[Wisconsin]] and crossed the [[Mississippi River]] in the early months of 1855 by [[covered wagon]]. He was in search of waterpower and had the desire to establish a settlement in a new and untried country. Deciding upon the [[North Raccoon River]] to begin his settlement, Judge Criss proceeded to erect the first [[log cabin]] in Sac City, establish himself in the [[hotel]] business, as well as keep a stage station and [[general store]] for nearby settlers.\n\nAs early as 1859, there was talk of building a [[railroad]] through Sac County, but the first railroad did not come through Sac City until 1879. The railroad companies refused to lay tracks through undeveloped or mildly developed areas, and Sac City did not meet the requirements. The railroad companies demanded communities be far enough advanced to provide a quick return to capital before they would construct a steam and iron highway through the area. When it came, the railroad benefited Sac City incredibly. The [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]] connected Sac City, Wall Lake, Auburn, Odebolt, Lake View, Early, and Schaller as well as the cities where crops were sold.\n\nThe first Sac County Fair was held in 1871 on {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of ground east of Sac City that had been purchased by the Sac County Agricultural Society the same year. The fair was one of the biggest events of the year and brought people in wagons and buggies from miles around to see the harness races, livestock exhibits, produce, needlework, and art goods.\n\nThe Sac City [[Chautauqua]] Association was organized in December 1904 with 120 members. The Association brought many fine programs to the community, and because transportation was still slow and laborious, many families stayed in tents on the grounds for the entire Chautauqua session, about eight or nine days. At first the meetings were held in a tent, but by 1908, the citizens of Sac City built a Chautauqua Building in which to hold their meetings, and which is now the only one left of its kind in the state of Iowa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saccity.org/pages/historic-sac-city.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129101950/http://saccity.org/pages/historic-sac-city.html |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}, Accessed 2010-02-18.</ref>\n\n===Modern-day===\nIn May 2017 lifelong Sac City resident and businessman John Criss donated [[US$]]5.7 million of his [[Estate (law)|estate]] to the city for [[beautification]] projects.

The town was so named because the [[Sac (people)|Sac]] and [[Meskwaki|Fox]] Indians{{refn|group=nb|Sometimes known as the Sauk and Fox\u2014the French name \"Sac\" and the English equivalent \"Sauk\" are both correct and interchangeable. Both words were derived from the Indian word \"Asakiwaki,\" meaning \"yellow earth people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/sf_kids.htm|title=Sac and Fox Indian Fact Sheet|publisher=Native Languages of the Americas website|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref>}} were in possession of the land at the time of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The City of Sac City was incorporated 19 years later, in 1874.\n\nJudge Eugene Criss, credited with being the father of Sac City, left [[Wisconsin]] and crossed the [[Mississippi River]] in the early months of 1855 by [[covered wagon]]. He was in search of waterpower and had the desire to establish a settlement in a new and untried country. Deciding upon the [[North Raccoon River]] to begin his settlement, Judge Criss proceeded to erect the first [[log cabin]] in Sac City, establish himself in the [[hotel]] business, as well as keep a stage station and [[general store]] for nearby settlers.\n\nAs early as 1859, there was talk of building a [[railroad]] through Sac County, but the first railroad did not come through Sac City until 1879. The railroad companies refused to lay tracks through undeveloped or mildly developed areas, and Sac City did not meet the requirements. The railroad companies demanded communities be far enough advanced to provide a quick return to capital before they would construct a steam and iron highway through the area. When it came, the railroad benefited Sac City incredibly. The [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]] connected Sac City, Wall Lake, Auburn, Odebolt, Lake View, Early, and Schaller as well as the cities where crops were sold.\n\nThe first Sac County Fair was held in 1871 on {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of ground east of Sac City that had been purchased by the Sac County Agricultural Society the same year. The fair was one of the biggest events of the year and brought people in wagons and buggies from miles around to see the harness races, livestock exhibits, produce, needlework, and art goods.\n\nThe Sac City [[Chautauqua]] Association was organized in December 1904 with 120 members. The Association brought many fine programs to the community, and because transportation was still slow and laborious, many families stayed in tents on the grounds for the entire Chautauqua session, about eight or nine days. At first the meetings were held in a tent, but by 1908, the citizens of Sac City built a Chautauqua Building in which to hold their meetings, and which is now the only one left of its kind in the state of Iowa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saccity.org/pages/historic-sac-city.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129101950/http://saccity.org/pages/historic-sac-city.html |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}, Accessed 2010-02-18.</ref>\n\n===Modern-day===\nIn May 2017 lifelong Sac City resident and businessman John Criss donated [[US$]]5.7 million of his [[Estate (law)|estate]] to the city for [[beautification]] projects.<ref name=\"John Criss\">{{cite web|author1=Kyle Munson|title=A quiet bachelor left behind $5.7 million to help save his small Iowa town.

He was baptised on 20 April at [[St German's Priory]], immediately next to Port Eliot. The [[Eliot family (South England)|Eliot family]] were an old [[Devon]] family that had settled in Cornwall.\n\nJohn Eliot was educated at [[Blundell's School]], [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]], and matriculated at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], on 4 December 1607, and, leaving the university after three years, he studied law at one of the [[Inns of Court]]. He also spent some months travelling in France, Spain and Italy, in company, for part of the time, with young [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]], afterwards 1st [[Duke of Buckingham]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Eliot, Sir John |volume=9 |page=277 |inline=1}}</ref>\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nEliot was only twenty-two when he began his parliamentary career as Member of Parliament for [[St Germans (UK Parliament constituency)|St Germans]]<ref name=ODNB /> in the \"[[Addled Parliament]]\" of 1614. In May 1618, he was knighted, and next year through the patronage of Buckingham he obtained the appointment of [[Vice-Admiral of Devon]], with large powers for the defence and control of the commerce of the county. It was not long before the characteristic energy with which he performed the duties in his office involved him in difficulties. After many attempts, in 1623, he succeeded by a clever but dangerous manoeuvre in entrapping the famous pirate [[John Nutt]], who had for years plagued the southern coast, inflicting immense damage upon English commerce. However, the pirate, having a powerful protector at court in Sir [[George Calvert]], the secretary of state, was pardoned; while the Vice-Admiral, upon charges which could not be substantiated, was flung into the [[Marshalsea]] prison, and detained there nearly four months.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nA few weeks after his release, Eliot was elected Member of Parliament for [[Newport (Cornwall) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport]]<ref name=ODNB>[[Conrad Russell]], 'Eliot, Sir John (1592\u20131632)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, October 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8630  accessed 16 December 2007]</ref> (February 1624). On 27 February, he delivered his first speech, in which he at once revealed his great powers as an orator, demanding boldly that the liberties and privileges of Parliament, repudiated by [[James I of England|James I]] in the former Parliament, should be secured. In the first Parliament of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1625, he urged the enforcement of the laws against the [[Roman Catholics]]. Meanwhile, he had continued the friend and supporter of Buckingham and greatly approved of the war with Spain.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nBuckingham's incompetence, however, and the bad faith with which both he and the King continued to treat the parliament, alienated Eliot. Distrust of his former friend quickly grew in Eliot's mind to a certainty of his criminal ambition. Returned to the parliament of 1626 as Member for St Germans and in the absence of other leaders of the opposition whom the King had secured by nominating them sheriffs, Eliot found himself the leader of the House. He immediately demanded an inquiry into the recent disaster at [[C\u00e1diz]]. On 27 March, he made an open and daring attack upon Buckingham and his administration. He was not intimidated by the King's threatening intervention on 29 March, and persuaded the House to defer the actual grant of the subsidies and to present a remonstrance to the King, declaring its right to examine the conduct of ministers. On 8 May, he was one of the managers who carried Buckingham's impeachment to the Lords and, on 10 May, he delivered the charges against him, comparing him in the course of his speech to [[Sejanus]].<ref name=EB1911/> {{wikisource|Speech on the Petition of Right|Speech of Sir John Eliot against Buckingham}}\n\nNext day, Eliot was sent to the [[Tower of London|Tower]]. When the Commons declined to proceed with business as long as Eliot and Sir [[Dudley Digges]] (who had been imprisoned with him) were in confinement, they were released, and Parliament was dissolved on 15 June. Eliot was immediately dismissed from his office of Vice-Admiral of Devon, and, in 1627, he was again imprisoned for refusing to pay a forced loan, but liberated shortly before the assembling of the Parliament of 1628, to which he was returned as Member for Cornwall. He joined in the resistance now organised to arbitrary taxation, was foremost in the promotion of the [[Petition of Right]], continued his outspoken censure of Buckingham, and after the latter's assassination in August, led the attack, in the session of 1629, on the ritualists and [[Arminianism|Arminians]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn February the great question of the right of the King to levy [[tonnage and poundage]] came up for discussion. On the King ordering an adjournment of Parliament, the speaker, Sir [[John Finch, 1st Baron Finch|John Finch]], was held down in the chair by [[Denzil Holles, Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]] and [[Benjamin Valentine]] while Eliot's resolutions against illegal taxation and innovations in religion were read to the House. In consequence, Eliot, with eight other members, was imprisoned on 4 March in the Tower. He refused to answer in his examination, relying on his [[parliamentary privilege]] and, on 29 October, was again sent to the Marshalsea. On 26 January, he appeared at the bar of the King's Bench, in front of [[Lord Chief Justice]] Sir [[Nicholas Hyde]], with Holles and Valentine, to answer a charge of conspiracy to resist the King's order, and refusing to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court (see ''R v. Eliot, Hollis and Valentine''.) He was fined \u00a32000 and ordered to be imprisoned during the King's pleasure and till he had made submission. This he steadfastly refused. While some of the prisoners appear to have had certain liberty allowed to them, Eliot's confinement in the Tower was made exceptionally severe. Charles's anger had always been directed chiefly against him, not only as his own political antagonist but also as the prosecutor and bitter enemy of Buckingham; \"an outlawed man,\" he described him, \"desperate in mind and fortune.\"<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Death and burial==\nIn the spring of 1632, he fell into a decline. In October he petitioned Charles for permission to go into the country, but leave could be obtained only at the price of submission and was finally refused.<ref name=EB1911/> He died of consumption on 27 November 1632, and was buried at St Peter's Ad Vincula Church within the Tower.\n\nWhen his son requested permission to move the body to St Germans, Charles refused, saying: \"Let Sir John Eliot be buried in the church of that parish where he died.\" The suspicious manner of Eliot's death, as the result of the King's implacability and severe treatment, had more effect, probably, than any other single incident in embittering and precipitating the dispute between King and parliament. Eliot was a great orator, inspired by enthusiasm and high ideals, which he was able to communicate to his hearers by his eloquence.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1668, the [[House of Lords]] reversed his conviction, restating the law in [[Strode's case]], affirming that the conviction \"...was an illegal judgment, and against the freedom and privilege of Parliament\".\n\n==Works==\n\nEliot languished in prison for some time, during which he wrote several works:\n*''Negotium posterorum'', an account of the parliament in 1625;\n*''The Monarchie of Man'', a political treatise;\n*''De jure majestatis, a Political Treatise of Government'', which is in large part a summary of a work by [[Henning Arnisaeus]];<ref>J.

Richard went to the [[University of Oxford]] at his father's suggestion, but did not fare well with academic life. He became embroiled at Oxford in various difficulties, which are mentioned without further detail in his father's writings. Further problems ensued when Richard failed or refused to visit his father in the Tower. As a result, Richard seems to have disappeared compared to his siblings. It is known that he went to the Low Countries under Sir Edward Howard around February 1632. Richard died before 1669 when his brothers, John and Edward, argued over the inheritance of Richard's lands in Cornwall.\n\nGeneral [[Granville Elliott]] (1713 - 1759) spent much time and effort trying to prove that Richard Eliot had married [[Catherine Killigrew]] (1618 - 1689), and had a child [[George Elliott (surgeon)|George Elliott]] born around 1636. However, documents survive that show that Richard died 'ob cael', i.e. a bachelor, and that, in 1656, Catherine was known as a spinster aged 38. It is likely, however, that George Elliott was the illegitimate son of Richard and Catherine.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n* ''Life of Sir J.

Following an adjustment in January 2019, sacrament meeting is now held for 60 minutes. The foremost purpose of sacrament meeting is the blessing and passing of the [[sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]], consecrated bread and water in remembrance of the body and blood of Christ, to the congregation. After the sacrament, the service usually consists of two or three lay sermons, called \"talks,\" prepared and delivered by members of the congregation. [[Hymn]]s, accompanied by [[piano]] or [[organ (music)|organ]], are sung throughout the service as a form of worship through music. Once a month, usually on the first Sunday, instead of prepared talks, members are invited to bear their testimonies about Jesus Christ and gospel principles. The testimonies are generally impromptu statements of personal faith. This meeting is called [[#Fast and testimony meeting|fast and testimony meeting]].\n[[File:LDS Chapel London Exhibition Road 2009.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Meetinghouse on [[Exhibition Road]], [[London, England]]]]\n\n===Sunday School===\n[[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] classes are separated into adult and youth courses. Historically, adult Sunday School courses have been grouped by topic, with new members and visitors having the option to attend an introductory class. In congregations with a diverse membership, special language classes might be organized in which the approved courses are taught in a variety of languages. When necessary, wireless headphones are made available, so the discussion can be translated into other languages.<ref>The equipment is configured so that they can transmit and receive on various frequencies so that the discussion in a single meeting can be translated into multiple languages.</ref> \n\nThe most common adult Sunday School course is Gospel Doctrine, which meets each week and consists of a teacher presenting gospel messages drawn from the scriptures, with participation from class members. An optional adult course is called [[Gospel Principles]], designed for new members and those of other faiths who are interested in learning more about the church (often referred to as \"investigators\"). Historically, other optional adult Sunday School courses were held at various times, including during the second hour of the Sunday meeting block, depending on the specific needs of each congregation. These courses included topics such as Marriage and Family Relations and Temple Preparation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/2018?lang=eng|title=Instructions for Curriculum 2018|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref> Since January 2019, the optional Sunday School classes are no longer taught during the meeting block. Each ward bishop will determine how other optional courses, including those before or after baptism, will be taught outside of the two-hour block.\n\nYouth Sunday School courses are for those who aged 12 to 18 and may be divided or combined by ages, depending on local needs, such as the number of youth. In 2013, the church instituted a new youth curriculum with uniform doctrinal themes, which allows leaders and teachers to adapt classes to the needs of youth. \n\nBeginning in January 2019, a new \"home-centered and church-supported\" program of gospel instruction was adopted using the same manual, ''Come, Follow Me'', for adult, youth, and primary instruction both at church and in the home.<ref>Riess, Jana.

Although all men and boys meet together briefly at the beginning of the session for a prayer, hymn, and announcements, they then separate into classes. The men attend [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]]s [[Quorum (Latter Day Saints)|Quorum]]. Boys are divided into priesthood quorums: [[Deacon (Latter Day Saints)|Deacons]] (ages 12\u201313), [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|Teachers]] (ages 14\u201315), and [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|Priests]] (ages 16\u201318) Quorums. Classes may be combined if class sizes are small.\n\n===Relief Society and Young Women meetings===\nAdult women attend [[Relief Society]], and girls who are 12 to 17 attend [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]]. Occasionally, the Relief Society and Young Women meet together briefly at the beginning of the session for a prayer, hymn, and announcements and then separate into classes, as the men and boys do. The Young Women are divided into multiple classes, but typically ages 12\u201313, ages 14\u201315, and ages 16\u201317 classes.\n\n===Primary===\nChildren younger than 12 attend [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]]. Through the end of 2018, Primary consisted of two time blocks of 50 and 60 minutes. Beginning in January 2019, Primary now consists of a single 50-minute block.<ref>Stack, Peggy Fletcher.

Primary classes generally consist of children born in the same calendar year. Usually, half of the Primary, such as Senior Primary, meet in separate classes, while the other half, Junior Primary, meet together in sharing and singing time, and at the end of each block, the two are reversed. Since January 2019, the 50-minute block for Primary includes singing time and instruction, with sharing time discontinued.  Individual congregations will have the option of having the entire Primary meet together for the instruction and singing time.[[File:Igreja SUD uruguaiana rs.jpg|thumb|right|Meetinghouse in Uruguaiana, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil]]\n\n===Teacher council meeting===\nIn 2016, the church announced that each ward should hold a teacher council meeting once a month during the three-hour schedule of Sunday meetings.<ref>Walch, Tad.

Wards were to hold teacher council meetings for Relief Society, Young Women and priesthood teachers during the second hour of the three-hour block and for the Sunday School teachers during the final hour of the three-hour block. Primary teachers would attend the teacher council meeting being held during the hour of the block that corresponds to when their class participates in sharing time. If necessary, participants could be divided into groups according to the needs of those they teach.\n\nSince January 2019, each ward will hold a teacher council meeting quarterly during the 50-minute class time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/general-conference/16435_000_FAQ.pdf?lang=eng|title=A New Balance between Gospel Instruction in the Home and in the Church|last=|first=|date=October 6, 2018|website=|access-date=October 15, 2018}}</ref> A ward will typically hold teacher council meeting for Relief Society, Young Women and priesthood teachers on a first or a third Sunday and for Sunday School teachers on a second or a fourth Sunday. Primary teachers may attend teacher council meeting on any Sunday as determined by the ward Primary presidency.\n\n==Fast and testimony meeting==\nThe '''fast and testimony meeting''' is a monthly [[sacrament meeting]] held on a [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]]'s [[Fast Sunday]], which is typically the first Sunday of each month. Those members who feel prompted go to the podium and share (or \"bear\") their [[testimony]] with the other members of their congregation. Members may choose to fast on this weekend for two meals and donate the money they would have spent for those meals to the church as [[fast offering]]s, which are used to operate the church's welfare program. As with all other donations, these are privately paid through donation slips or on the Internet. A ward or a family can fast in unity for a purpose, such as for an ill member or other personal or family needs.\n[[File:Jonesboro Chapel.JPG|thumb|150px|right|LDS meetinghouse in [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]], USA]]\n\nThe church definition of a testimony is \"a spiritual witness given by the Holy Ghost. The foundation of a testimony is the knowledge that Heavenly Father lives and loves His children; that Jesus Christ lives, that He is the Son of God, and that He carried out the infinite Atonement; that Joseph Smith is the prophet of God who was called to restore the gospel; that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Savior's true Church on the earth; and that the Church is led by a living prophet today. With this foundation, a testimony grows to include all principles of the gospel.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/testimony?lang=eng|title=Testimony|website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Individuals bearing testimony are directed by the feelings of their heart or by the [[Holy Ghost]] as to what to share. Members are expected to be brief so that others may have the opportunity.\n\n==General Conference==\n{{Main article|General Conference (LDS Church)}}\n[[File:Lds conference center panoramic view slc utah.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Conference Center in Salt Lake City, Utah]]\n\nTwice a year, the LDS Church holds [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], where the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church's president]] and other leaders speak. The talks, given in several sessions over several days, are carried worldwide by radio, television, satellite, and Internet broadcasts. Beginning in October 2018, the sessions consist of four general sessions, a women's session (in October each year) and a priesthood session (in April each year). The talks are translated into over 80 languages and are later made available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org and in printed church publications such as the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' and ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]''. \n\nConference talks address doctrinal topics drawn from scriptures and personal experiences, messages of faith and hope, church history, and information on the church, as it expands throughout the world.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, conference was held in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]]. With a maximum capacity of about 8,000 per session, the Tabernacle consistently filled to capacity, leaving thousands of attendees listening on loudspeakers outside or via broadcast in adjacent buildings. In 2000, the LDS Church dedicated a new 21,000-seat [[LDS Conference Center|Conference Center]], which became the home of general conference.\n\nConference satellite broadcasts may be watched live in thousands of chapels worldwide. The public is invited to attend or watch general conference either through the broadcasts, on the Internet, in the Conference Center, or other areas at Temple Square. The conference is also broadcast nationally and internationally on many satellite or cable providers through [[BYU TV|BYUtv]] and on local networks in some areas.\n\n==Worship in temples==\n{{Main|Temple (LDS Church)}}\n{{See also|Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)#Temple ordinances|l1=Ordinance (Latter Day Saints): Temple ordinances}}\n[[File:Fukuoka Japan Temple by tylermhawkins.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|[[Fukuoka Japan Temple]]]]\n\nIn the LDS Church, a temple is a building dedicated to be a \"House of the Lord,\" and they are considered by church members to be the most sacred structures on earth. Upon completion, temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time during an \"open house.\" During the open house, the church conducts tours of the temple with [[missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] and members from the local area serving as tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. After a temple is dedicated, only members in good standing are permitted entrance and so they are not meetinghouses or houses of public worship.<ref>{{ cite web |title= Of Chapels and Temples: Explaining Mormon Worship Services |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/of-chapels-and-temples-explaining-mormon-worship-services |work= Newsroom |publisher= LDS Church |date= 15 November 2007 |accessdate= 27 January 2010 }}</ref> Most LDS temples are identified by a gold-colored [[Angel Moroni]] statue, adorning the top of the tallest spire.\n\nTemples have a different purpose from meetinghouses.

In congregations with a diverse membership, special language classes might be organized in which the approved courses are taught in a variety of languages. When necessary, wireless headphones are made available, so the discussion can be translated into other languages.<ref>The equipment is configured so that they can transmit and receive on various frequencies so that the discussion in a single meeting can be translated into multiple languages.</ref> \n\nThe most common adult Sunday School course is Gospel Doctrine, which meets each week and consists of a teacher presenting gospel messages drawn from the scriptures, with participation from class members. An optional adult course is called [[Gospel Principles]], designed for new members and those of other faiths who are interested in learning more about the church (often referred to as \"investigators\"). Historically, other optional adult Sunday School courses were held at various times, including during the second hour of the Sunday meeting block, depending on the specific needs of each congregation. These courses included topics such as Marriage and Family Relations and Temple Preparation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/2018?lang=eng|title=Instructions for Curriculum 2018|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref> Since January 2019, the optional Sunday School classes are no longer taught during the meeting block. Each ward bishop will determine how other optional courses, including those before or after baptism, will be taught outside of the two-hour block.\n\nYouth Sunday School courses are for those who aged 12 to 18 and may be divided or combined by ages, depending on local needs, such as the number of youth. In 2013, the church instituted a new youth curriculum with uniform doctrinal themes, which allows leaders and teachers to adapt classes to the needs of youth. \n\nBeginning in January 2019, a new \"home-centered and church-supported\" program of gospel instruction was adopted using the same manual, ''Come, Follow Me'', for adult, youth, and primary instruction both at church and in the home.<ref>Riess, Jana.

Although all men and boys meet together briefly at the beginning of the session for a prayer, hymn, and announcements, they then separate into classes. The men attend [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]]s [[Quorum (Latter Day Saints)|Quorum]]. Boys are divided into priesthood quorums: [[Deacon (Latter Day Saints)|Deacons]] (ages 12\u201313), [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|Teachers]] (ages 14\u201315), and [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|Priests]] (ages 16\u201318) Quorums. Classes may be combined if class sizes are small.\n\n===Relief Society and Young Women meetings===\nAdult women attend [[Relief Society]], and girls who are 12 to 17 attend [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]]. Occasionally, the Relief Society and Young Women meet together briefly at the beginning of the session for a prayer, hymn, and announcements and then separate into classes, as the men and boys do. The Young Women are divided into multiple classes, but typically ages 12\u201313, ages 14\u201315, and ages 16\u201317 classes.\n\n===Primary===\nChildren younger than 12 attend [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]]. Through the end of 2018, Primary consisted of two time blocks of 50 and 60 minutes. Beginning in January 2019, Primary now consists of a single 50-minute block.<ref>Stack, Peggy Fletcher. [https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/10/06/about-new-mormon-sunday/ \"About the new Mormon Sunday meeting schedule\"], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 6 October 2018. Retrieved on 22 March 2020.</ref> Primary is generally divided into two groups: Senior Primary (ages 8\u201311) and Junior Primary (ages 4\u20137); young children from 18 months to 3 years of age may attend a nursery class. Primary classes generally consist of children born in the same calendar year. Usually, half of the Primary, such as Senior Primary, meet in separate classes, while the other half, Junior Primary, meet together in sharing and singing time, and at the end of each block, the two are reversed. Since January 2019, the 50-minute block for Primary includes singing time and instruction, with sharing time discontinued.  Individual congregations will have the option of having the entire Primary meet together for the instruction and singing time.[[File:Igreja SUD uruguaiana rs.jpg|thumb|right|Meetinghouse in Uruguaiana, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil]]\n\n===Teacher council meeting===\nIn 2016, the church announced that each ward should hold a teacher council meeting once a month during the three-hour schedule of Sunday meetings.<ref>Walch, Tad. [https://www.deseret.com/2016/5/3/20587648/lds-leaders-announce-new-teaching-manual-teacher-council-meetings \"LDS leaders announce new teaching manual, teacher council meetings\"], ''[[Deseret News]]'', 3 May 2016. Retrieved on 15 October 2018.</ref> Those attending teacher council meetings include everyone who teaches a quorum or class in the ward, along with at least one of the priesthood or auxiliary leaders responsible for those teachers. Wards were to hold teacher council meetings for Relief Society, Young Women and priesthood teachers during the second hour of the three-hour block and for the Sunday School teachers during the final hour of the three-hour block. Primary teachers would attend the teacher council meeting being held during the hour of the block that corresponds to when their class participates in sharing time. If necessary, participants could be divided into groups according to the needs of those they teach.\n\nSince January 2019, each ward will hold a teacher council meeting quarterly during the 50-minute class time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/general-conference/16435_000_FAQ.pdf?lang=eng|title=A New Balance between Gospel Instruction in the Home and in the Church|last=|first=|date=October 6, 2018|website=|access-date=October 15, 2018}}</ref> A ward will typically hold teacher council meeting for Relief Society, Young Women and priesthood teachers on a first or a third Sunday and for Sunday School teachers on a second or a fourth Sunday. Primary teachers may attend teacher council meeting on any Sunday as determined by the ward Primary presidency.\n\n==Fast and testimony meeting==\nThe '''fast and testimony meeting''' is a monthly [[sacrament meeting]] held on a [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]]'s [[Fast Sunday]], which is typically the first Sunday of each month. Those members who feel prompted go to the podium and share (or \"bear\") their [[testimony]] with the other members of their congregation. Members may choose to fast on this weekend for two meals and donate the money they would have spent for those meals to the church as [[fast offering]]s, which are used to operate the church's welfare program. As with all other donations, these are privately paid through donation slips or on the Internet. A ward or a family can fast in unity for a purpose, such as for an ill member or other personal or family needs.\n[[File:Jonesboro Chapel.JPG|thumb|150px|right|LDS meetinghouse in [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]], USA]]\n\nThe church definition of a testimony is \"a spiritual witness given by the Holy Ghost. The foundation of a testimony is the knowledge that Heavenly Father lives and loves His children; that Jesus Christ lives, that He is the Son of God, and that He carried out the infinite Atonement; that Joseph Smith is the prophet of God who was called to restore the gospel; that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Savior's true Church on the earth; and that the Church is led by a living prophet today. With this foundation, a testimony grows to include all principles of the gospel.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/testimony?lang=eng|title=Testimony|website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Individuals bearing testimony are directed by the feelings of their heart or by the [[Holy Ghost]] as to what to share. Members are expected to be brief so that others may have the opportunity.\n\n==General Conference==\n{{Main article|General Conference (LDS Church)}}\n[[File:Lds conference center panoramic view slc utah.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Conference Center in Salt Lake City, Utah]]\n\nTwice a year, the LDS Church holds [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], where the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church's president]] and other leaders speak. The talks, given in several sessions over several days, are carried worldwide by radio, television, satellite, and Internet broadcasts. Beginning in October 2018, the sessions consist of four general sessions, a women's session (in October each year) and a priesthood session (in April each year). The talks are translated into over 80 languages and are later made available on ChurchofJesusChrist.org and in printed church publications such as the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' and ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]''. \n\nConference talks address doctrinal topics drawn from scriptures and personal experiences, messages of faith and hope, church history, and information on the church, as it expands throughout the world.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, conference was held in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]]. With a maximum capacity of about 8,000 per session, the Tabernacle consistently filled to capacity, leaving thousands of attendees listening on loudspeakers outside or via broadcast in adjacent buildings. In 2000, the LDS Church dedicated a new 21,000-seat [[LDS Conference Center|Conference Center]], which became the home of general conference.\n\nConference satellite broadcasts may be watched live in thousands of chapels worldwide. The public is invited to attend or watch general conference either through the broadcasts, on the Internet, in the Conference Center, or other areas at Temple Square. The conference is also broadcast nationally and internationally on many satellite or cable providers through [[BYU TV|BYUtv]] and on local networks in some areas.\n\n==Worship in temples==\n{{Main|Temple (LDS Church)}}\n{{See also|Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)#Temple ordinances|l1=Ordinance (Latter Day Saints): Temple ordinances}}\n[[File:Fukuoka Japan Temple by tylermhawkins.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|[[Fukuoka Japan Temple]]]]\n\nIn the LDS Church, a temple is a building dedicated to be a \"House of the Lord,\" and they are considered by church members to be the most sacred structures on earth. Upon completion, temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time during an \"open house.\" During the open house, the church conducts tours of the temple with [[missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] and members from the local area serving as tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. After a temple is dedicated, only members in good standing are permitted entrance and so they are not meetinghouses or houses of public worship.<ref>{{ cite web |title= Of Chapels and Temples: Explaining Mormon Worship Services |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/of-chapels-and-temples-explaining-mormon-worship-services |work= Newsroom |publisher= LDS Church |date= 15 November 2007 |accessdate= 27 January 2010 }}</ref> Most LDS temples are identified by a gold-colored [[Angel Moroni]] statue, adorning the top of the tallest spire.\n\nTemples have a different purpose from meetinghouses.
