{"title_page": "Trochaic tetrameter", "text_new": "{{For|the quantitative meter used in Greek and Latin poetry|trochaic septenarius}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\n'''Trochaic tetrameter''' is a [[meter (poetry)|meter]] in [[poetry]]. It refers to a line of four [[trochee|trochaic]] [[foot (poetry)|feet]]. The word \"tetrameter\" simply means that the poem has four [[trochee]]s. A trochee is a long syllable, or stressed syllable, followed by a short, or unstressed, one.  Stresses on a syllable are detected by simply noting which syllable one puts stress on when saying the word.  In many cases, this is the syllable which is pronounced loudest in the word, for example, the word 'purity' will take a stress on the first syllable and an unstress on the others.\n\nBecause English tradition is so strongly iambic, some feel that trochaic meters have an awkward or unnatural feel to the ear.\n\n==Example of trochaic tetrameter==\n\nA line of trochaic tetrameter has the following rhythm:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! colspan=2 | 1st foot || colspan=2 | 2nd foot || colspan=2 | 3rd foot || colspan=2 | 4th foot\n|-\n| DUM\n| da\n| DUM\n| da\n| DUM\n| da\n| DUM\n| da\n|}\n\nUsing the [[Syllable weight#Classical poetry|classical symbols]] [[Syllable weight#Classical poetry|longum]] and [[Syllable weight#Classical poetry|breve (or brevis)]] a line of line of trochaic tetrameter can be represented as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! colspan=2 | 1st foot || colspan=2 | 2nd foot || colspan=2 | 3rd foot || colspan=2 | 4th foot\n|-\n| \u2013\n| \u23d1\n| \u2013\n| \u23d1\n| \u2013\n| \u23d1\n| \u2013\n| \u23d1\n|}\n\n==Literary examples==\nTwo of the best-known examples are [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' and the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]''.\n\nThis can be demonstrated in the following famous excerpt from \"Hiawatha's Childhood\", where the accented syllables of each trochee have been bolded:\n{{quote|<poem>'''By''' the '''shores''' of '''Git'''che '''Gu'''mee,\n'''By''' the '''shi'''ning '''Big'''-Sea-'''Wa'''ter,\n'''Stood''' the '''wig'''wam '''of''' No'''kom'''is,\n'''Daugh'''ter '''of''' the '''Moon''', No'''kom'''is.\n'''Dark''' be'''hind''' it '''rose''' the '''fo'''rest,\n'''Rose''' the '''black''' and '''gloo'''my '''pine'''-trees,\n'''Rose''' the '''firs''' with '''cones''' up'''on''' them;\n'''Bright''' be'''fore''' it '''beat''' the '''wa'''ter,\n'''Beat''' the '''clear''' and '''sun'''ny '''wa'''ter,\n'''Beat''' the '''shi'''ning '''Big'''-Sea-'''Wa'''ter.</poem>}}\n\nThe ''[[Kalevala]]'' also follows a loose trochaic tetrameter, though it also has some slight variations to the normal pattern, which cause some people to term it the \"Kalevala Metre\".  \n\nAnother clear example is [[Philip Larkin]]'s \"The Explosion\".\n\n{{quote|<poem>On the day of the explosion\nShadows pointed towards the pithead:\nIn the sun the slagheap slept.\n\nDown the lane came men in pitboots\nCoughing oath-edged talk and pipe-smoke\nShouldering off the freshened silence.\n\nOne chased after rabbits; lost them;\nCame back with a nest of lark's eggs;\nShowed them; lodged them in the grasses.\n\nSo they passed in beards and moleskins\nFathers brothers nicknames laughter\nThrough the tall gates standing open.\n\nAt noon there came a tremor; cows\nStopped chewing for a second; sun\nScarfed as in a heat-haze dimmed.\n\nThe dead go on before us they\nAre sitting in God's house in comfort\nWe shall see them face to face\u2014\n\nPlain as lettering in the chapels\nIt was said and for a second\nWives saw men of the explosion\n\nLarger than in life they managed\u2014\nGold as on a coin or walking\nSomehow from the sun towards them\n\nOne showing the eggs unbroken.</poem>}}\n\n\nTrochaic tetrameter is also employed by [[Shakespeare]] in several instances to contrast with his usual blank verse (which is in [[iambic pentameter]]). For instance, in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Shakespeare frequently writes the lines of his fairies in [[catalectic]] trochaic tetrameter, as is evidenced by Puck's lines, here:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Through the forest have I gone.\nBut Athenian found I none,\nOn whose eyes I might approve\nThis flower's force in stirring love.\nNight and silence.--Who is here?\nWeeds of Athens he doth wear:\nThis is he, my master said,\nDespised the Athenian maid;\nAnd here the maiden, sleeping sound,\nOn the dank and dirty ground.\nPretty soul! she durst not lie\nNear this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.\nChurl, upon thy eyes I throw\nAll the power this charm doth owe.\nWhen thou wakest, let love forbid\nSleep his seat on thy eyelid:\nSo awake when I am gone;\nFor I must now to Oberon.</poem>}}\n\nLater he and Oberon have a conversation entirely in catalectic trochaic tetrameter, which is unusual, since generally Shakespeare used pentameter for dialogue sequences.\n\n{{quote|<poem>OBERON\nFlower of this purple dye,\nHit with Cupid's archery,\nSink in apple of his eye.\nWhen his love he doth espy,\nLet her shine as gloriously\nAs the Venus of the sky.\nWhen thou wakest, if she be by,\nBeg of her for remedy.\n\n''Re-enter PUCK''\n\nPUCK\nCaptain of our fairy band,\nHelena is here at hand;\nAnd the youth, mistook by me,\nPleading for a lover's fee.\nShall we their fond pageant see?\nLord, what fools these mortals be!\n\nOBERON\nStand aside: the noise they make\nWill cause Demetrius to awake.\n\nPUCK\nThen will two at once woo one;\nThat must needs be sport alone;\nAnd those things do best please me\nThat befal preposterously.</poem>}}\n\nSee also Edgar disguised as Poor Tom in ''[[King Lear]]'':\n\n{{quote|<poem>EDGAR\nTom will throw his head at them: avaunt, you curs!\nBe thy mouth or black or white,\nTooth that poisons if it bite;\nMastiff greyhound, mongrel grim,\nHound or spaniel, brach or him,\nOr bobtail tyke or trundle-tail,\nTom will make him weep and wail;\nFor with throwing thus my head,\nDogs leap the hatch and all are fled.</poem>}}\n\nAnd the Three Witches in ''[[Macbeth]]'':\n\n{{quote|<poem>FIRST WITCH\nWhen shall we three meet again\nIn thunder, lightning, or in rain?\n\nSECOND WITCH\nWhen the hurlyburly's done,\nWhen the battle's lost and won.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nThat will be ere the set of sun.\n\nFIRST WITCH\nWhere the place?\n\nSECOND WITCH\nUpon the heath.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nThere to meet with Macbeth.\n\nFIRST WITCH\nI come, graymalkin!\n\nSECOND WITCH\nPaddock calls.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nAnon!\n\nALL\nFair is foul, and foul is fair:\nHover through the fog and filthy air.</poem>}}\n\nGood examples of the rhythmic scheme, albeit not in English, are found in two famous thirteenth century [[medieval Latin]] [[hymn]]s. ''[[Dies Irae]]'' (used as the [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Requiem]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]), the first two verses of which are...\n{{quote|<poem>Dies ir\u00e6! dies illa\nSolvet s\u00e6clum in favilla\nTeste David cum Sibylla!\n\nQuantus tremor est futurus,\nquando judex est venturus,\ncuncta stricte discussurus!</poem>}}\n\n...and ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' (a standalone meditation on the suffering of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Jesus Christ]]'s mother, during his [[crucifixion]]), the first two verses of which are:\n{{quote|<poem>Stabat mater dolorosa\niuxta Crucem lacrimosa,\ndum pendebat Filius.\n\nCuius animam gementem,\ncontristatam et dolentem\npertransivit gladius.</poem>}}\n\n==Kalevala meter==\n[[Baltic Finns|Balto-Finnic]] (e.g. Estonian, Finnish, Karelian) folk poetry uses a form of trochaic tetrameter that has been called the Kalevala meter. The Finnish and Estonian national epics, ''[[Kalevala]]'' and ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'', are both written in this meter. The meter is thought to have originated during the [[Finnic languages|Proto-Finnic]] period. Its main rules are as follows<ref>{{cite book | year = 1977 | others = translated and edited by [[Matti Kuusi]], [[Keith Bosley]], and Michael Branch | title = Finnish Folk Poetry: Epic: An Anthology in Finnish and English | publisher = Finnish Literature Society | isbn = 951-717-087-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/finnishfolkpoetr00kuus/page/62 62\u201364] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/finnishfolkpoetr00kuus/page/62 }}</ref> (examples are taken from the ''Kalevala''):\n\nSyllables fall into three types: strong, weak, and neutral. A long syllable (one that contains a long vowel or a diphthong, or ends in a consonant) with a main stress is metrically strong, and a short syllable with a main stress is metrically weak. All syllables without a main stress are metrically neutral. A strong syllable can only occur in the rising part of the second, third, and fourth foot of a line:\n{{quote|<poem>Veli / '''kul'''ta, / '''veik'''ko/seni (1:11)\n(\"Brother dear, little brother\"<ref>{{cite book | year = 1999 | origyear = first published 1989 | others = trans. [[Keith Bosley]] | title = The Kalevala | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-283570-X}}</ref>)</poem>}}\nA weak syllable can only occur in the falling part of these feet:\n{{quote|<poem>Miele/ni '''mi'''/nun '''te'''/kevi (1:1)\n(\"I have a mind to ...\")</poem>}}\nNeutral syllables can occur at any position. The first foot has a freer structure, allowing strong syllables in a falling position and weak syllables in a rising position:\n{{quote|<poem>Niit' '''en'''/nen i/soni / lauloi (1:37)\n(\"My father used to sing them\")\n'''ve'''sois/ta ve/tele/mi\u00e4 (1:56)\n(\"tugged from the saplings\")</poem>}}\nIt is also possible for the first foot to contain three or even four syllables.\n\nThere are two main types of line: a normal trochaic tetrameter and a broken trochaic tetrameter. In a normal tetrameter, word-stresses and foot-stresses match, and there is a [[caesura]] between the second and third feet:\n{{quote|<poem>Veli / kulta, // veikko/seni</poem>}}\nA broken tetrameter ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''murrelmas\u00e4e'') has at least one stressed syllable in a falling position. There is usually no caesura:\n{{quote|<poem>Miele/ni '''mi'''/nun '''te'''/kevi</poem>}}\nTraditional poetry in the Kalevala meter uses both types with approximately the same frequency. The alteration of normal and broken tetrameters is a characteristic difference between the Kalevala meter and other forms of trochaic tetrameter.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trochaic Tetrameter}}\n[[Category:Types of verses]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the quantitative meter used in Greek and Latin poetry|trochaic septenarius}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\n'''Trochaic tetrameter''' is a [[meter (poetry)|meter]] in [[poetry]].

In many cases, this is the syllable which is pronounced loudest in the word, for example, the word 'purity' will take a stress on the first syllable and an unstress on the others.\n\nBecause English tradition is so strongly iambic, some feel that trochaic meters have an awkward or unnatural feel to the ear.\n\n==Example of trochaic tetrameter AYE ESHAN==\n\nA line of trochaic tetrameter has the following rhythm:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! colspan=2 | 1st foot || colspan=2 | 2nd foot || colspan=2 | 3rd foot || colspan=2 | 4th foot\n|-\n| DUM\n| da\n| DUM\n| da\n| DUM\n| da\n| DUM\n| da\n|}\n\nUsing the [[Syllable weight#Classical poetry|classical symbols]] [[Syllable weight#Classical poetry|longum]] and [[Syllable weight#Classical poetry|breve (or brevis)]] a line of line of trochaic tetrameter can be represented as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! colspan=2 | 1st foot || colspan=2 | 2nd foot || colspan=2 | 3rd foot || colspan=2 | 4th foot\n|-\n| \u2013\n| \u23d1\n| \u2013\n| \u23d1\n| \u2013\n| \u23d1\n| \u2013\n| \u23d1\n|}\n\n==Literary examples==\nTwo of the best-known examples are [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' and the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]''.\n\nThis can be demonstrated in the following famous excerpt from \"Hiawatha's Childhood\", where the accented syllables of each trochee have been bolded:\nAYE ESHAN\n{{quote|<poem>'''By''' the '''shores''' of '''Git'''che '''Gu'''mee,\n'''By''' the '''shi'''ning '''Big'''-Sea-'''Wa'''ter,\n'''Stood''' the '''wig'''wam '''of''' No'''kom'''is,\n'''Daugh'''ter '''of''' the '''Moon''', No'''kom'''is.\n'''Dark''' be'''hind''' it '''rose''' the '''fo'''rest,\n'''Rose''' the '''black''' and '''gloo'''my '''pine'''-trees,\n'''Rose''' the '''firs''' with '''cones''' up'''on''' them;\n'''Bright''' be'''fore''' it '''beat''' the '''wa'''ter,\n'''Beat''' the '''clear''' and '''sun'''ny '''wa'''ter,\n'''Beat''' the '''shi'''ning '''Big'''-Sea-'''Wa'''ter.</poem>}}\n\nThe ''[[Kalevala]]'' also follows a loose trochaic tetrameter, though it also has some slight variations to the normal pattern, which cause some people to term it the \"Kalevala Metre\".  \n\nAnother clear example is [[Philip Larkin]]'s \"The Explosion\".\n\n{{quote|<poem>On the day of the explosion\nShadows pointed towards the pithead:\nIn the sun the slagheap slept.\n\nDown the lane came men in pitboots\nCoughing oath-edged talk and pipe-smoke\nShouldering off the freshened silence.\n\nOne chased after rabbits; lost them;\nCame back with a nest of lark's eggs;\nShowed them; lodged them in the grasses.\n\nSo they passed in beards and moleskins\nFathers brothers nicknames laughter\nThrough the tall gates standing open.\n\nAt noon there came a tremor; cows\nStopped chewing for a second; sun\nScarfed as in a heat-haze dimmed.\n\nThe dead go on before us they\nAre sitting in God's house in comfort\nWe shall see them face to face\u2014\n\nPlain as lettering in the chapels\nIt was said and for a second\nWives saw men of the explosion\n\nLarger than in life they managed\u2014\nGold as on a coin or walking\nSomehow from the sun towards them\n\nOne showing the eggs unbroken.</poem>}}\n\n\nTrochaic tetrameter is also employed by [[Shakespeare]] in several instances to contrast with his usual blank verse (which is in [[iambic pentameter]]). For instance, in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Shakespeare frequently writes the lines of his fairies in [[catalectic]] trochaic tetrameter, as is evidenced by Puck's lines, here:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Through the forest have I gone.\nBut Athenian found I none,\nOn whose eyes I might approve\nThis flower's force in stirring love.\nNight and silence.--Who is here?\nWeeds of Athens he doth wear:\nThis is he, my master said,\nDespised the Athenian maid;\nAnd here the maiden, sleeping sound,\nOn the dank and dirty ground.\nPretty soul! she durst not lie\nNear this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.\nChurl, upon thy eyes I throw\nAll the power this charm doth owe.\nWhen thou wakest, let love forbid\nSleep his seat on thy eyelid:\nSo awake when I am gone;\nFor I must now to Oberon.</poem>}}\n\nLater he and Oberon have a conversation entirely in catalectic trochaic tetrameter, which is unusual, since generally Shakespeare used pentameter for dialogue sequences.\n\n{{quote|<poem>OBERON\nFlower of this purple dye,\nHit with Cupid's archery,\nSink in apple of his eye.\nWhen his love he doth espy,\nLet her shine as gloriously\nAs the Venus of the sky.\nWhen thou wakest, if she be by,\nBeg of her for remedy.\n\n''Re-enter PUCK''\n\nPUCK\nCaptain of our fairy band,\nHelena is here at hand;\nAnd the youth, mistook by me,\nPleading for a lover's fee.\nShall we their fond pageant see?\nLord, what fools these mortals be!\n\nOBERON\nStand aside: the noise they make\nWill cause Demetrius to awake.\n\nPUCK\nThen will two at once woo one;\nThat must needs be sport alone;\nAnd those things do best please me\nThat befal preposterously.</poem>}}\n\nSee also Edgar disguised as Poor Tom in ''[[King Lear]]'':\n\n{{quote|<poem>EDGAR\nTom will throw his head at them: avaunt, you curs!\nBe thy mouth or black or white,\nTooth that poisons if it bite;\nMastiff greyhound, mongrel grim,\nHound or spaniel, brach or him,\nOr bobtail tyke or trundle-tail,\nTom will make him weep and wail;\nFor with throwing thus my head,\nDogs leap the hatch and all are fled.</poem>}}\n\nAnd the Three Witches in ''[[Macbeth]]'':\n\n{{quote|<poem>FIRST WITCH\nWhen shall we three meet again\nIn thunder, lightning, or in rain?\n\nSECOND WITCH\nWhen the hurlyburly's done,\nWhen the battle's lost and won.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nThat will be ere the set of sun.\n\nFIRST WITCH\nWhere the place?\n\nSECOND WITCH\nUpon the heath.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nThere to meet with Macbeth.\n\nFIRST WITCH\nI come, graymalkin!\n\nSECOND WITCH\nPaddock calls.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nAnon!\n\nALL\nFair is foul, and foul is fair:\nHover through the fog and filthy air.</poem>}}\n\nGood examples of the rhythmic scheme, albeit not in English, are found in two famous thirteenth century [[medieval Latin]] [[hymn]]s. ''[[Dies Irae]]'' (used as the [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Requiem]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]), the first two verses of which are...\n{{quote|<poem>Dies ir\u00e6! dies illa\nSolvet s\u00e6clum in favilla\nTeste David cum Sibylla!\n\nQuantus tremor est futurus,\nquando judex est venturus,\ncuncta stricte discussurus!</poem>}}\n\n...and ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' (a standalone meditation on the suffering of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Jesus Christ]]'s mother, during his [[crucifixion]]), the first two verses of which are:\n{{quote|<poem>Stabat mater dolorosa\niuxta Crucem lacrimosa,\ndum pendebat Filius.\n\nCuius animam gementem,\ncontristatam et dolentem\npertransivit gladius.</poem>}}\n\n==Kalevala meter==\n[[Baltic Finns|Balto-Finnic]] (e.g. Estonian, Finnish, Karelian) folk poetry uses a form of trochaic tetrameter that has been called the Kalevala meter. The Finnish and Estonian national epics, ''[[Kalevala]]'' and ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'', are both written in this meter. The meter is thought to have originated during the [[Finnic languages|Proto-Finnic]] period. Its main rules are as follows<ref>{{cite book | year = 1977 | others = translated and edited by [[Matti Kuusi]], [[Keith Bosley]], and Michael Branch | title = Finnish Folk Poetry: Epic: An Anthology in Finnish and English | publisher = Finnish Literature Society | isbn = 951-717-087-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/finnishfolkpoetr00kuus/page/62 62\u201364] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/finnishfolkpoetr00kuus/page/62 }}</ref> (examples are taken from the ''Kalevala''):\n\nSyllables fall into three types: strong, weak, and neutral. A long syllable (one that contains a long vowel or a diphthong, or ends in a consonant) with a main stress is metrically strong, and a short syllable with a main stress is metrically weak. All syllables without a main stress are metrically neutral. A strong syllable can only occur in the rising part of the second, third, and fourth foot of a line:\n{{quote|<poem>Veli / '''kul'''ta, / '''veik'''ko/seni (1:11)\n(\"Brother dear, little brother\"<ref>{{cite book | year = 1999 | origyear = first published 1989 | others = trans. [[Keith Bosley]] | title = The Kalevala | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-283570-X}}</ref>)</poem>}}\nA weak syllable can only occur in the falling part of these feet:\n{{quote|<poem>Miele/ni '''mi'''/nun '''te'''/kevi (1:1)\n(\"I have a mind to ...\")</poem>}}\nNeutral syllables can occur at any position. The first foot has a freer structure, allowing strong syllables in a falling position and weak syllables in a rising position:\n{{quote|<poem>Niit' '''en'''/nen i/soni / lauloi (1:37)\n(\"My father used to sing them\")\n'''ve'''sois/ta ve/tele/mi\u00e4 (1:56)\n(\"tugged from the saplings\")</poem>}}\nIt is also possible for the first foot to contain three or even four syllables.\n\nThere are two main types of line: a normal trochaic tetrameter and a broken trochaic tetrameter. In a normal tetrameter, word-stresses and foot-stresses match, and there is a [[caesura]] between the second and third feet:\n{{quote|<poem>Veli / kulta, // veikko/seni</poem>}}\nA broken tetrameter ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''murrelmas\u00e4e'') has at least one stressed syllable in a falling position. There is usually no caesura:\n{{quote|<poem>Miele/ni '''mi'''/nun '''te'''/kevi</poem>}}\nTraditional poetry in the Kalevala meter uses both types with approximately the same frequency. The alteration of normal and broken tetrameters is a characteristic difference between the Kalevala meter and other forms of trochaic tetrameter.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trochaic Tetrameter}}\n[[Category:Types of verses]]\n", "name_user": "UltHumanSp", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed vandalism", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochaic_tetrameter"}

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

The population was 4,136 as of the 2010 census. Located in the [[Middletown Valley]] that stretches between the [[Catoctin Mountain]]s on the east and [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] on the west, the town reportedly gained its name from its location midway between those ranges.\n\n==History==\nA young Lieutenant [[George Washington]], while surveying the South Mountain area, reported that the valley to the east was one of the most beautiful places he had ever seen. Later, as a Colonel in 1755, he was to accompany General Braddock on the old Indian Trail that ran through the valley on his way to Fort Cumberland.\n\nThe early German and English settlers started to arrive in the valley in the 1730s. Among them was Michael Jesserong, who paid \u00a366 for {{convert|50|acre|m2}}. He named his property Middletown and sold the first lots there in 1767, the date officially marked as that of the town\u2019s founding.\n\nThe history of Middletown is a mirror on the nation\u2019s development. Main Street spread to the west with construction of the National Pike through the town in 1806; the telegraph lines from Frederick to Hagerstown were routed through Middletown in 1854; and in 1896, car 11 of the Frederick Middletown Railway made its first run to Middletown. During the Civil War, both armies passed through the town to the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. In the aftermath of those battles, Middletown opened its churches and homes to care for the wounded.\n\nMiddletown preserves many historic structures indicative of its various periods of development and prosperity. The core of the old town, comprising the several blocks along West Main Street ([[U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Hagerstown\u2013Frederick, Maryland)|US Route 40 Alt]]) and South Church Street ([[Maryland Route 17|MD Route 17]]) contains several examples of [[Federal architecture|Federal]] and [[Greek Revival]] architecture, including the Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church (1859-1860) and Christ Reformed Church United Church of Christ (1818). With the coming of the [[Hagerstown and Frederick Railway]] in the 1890s, the town expanded to the east, where several examples of various Victorian-era styles can be seen, including [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]], [[Gothic Revival]], and later examples of [[Colonial Revival]] styles. The economic prosperity experienced in the town during the first quarter of the twentieth century led to the alteration of older commercial structures and the construction of new ones in the first few blocks of Main Street, including the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] styled Valley Savings Bank (today the Middletown Valley Bank). Many of these structures are registered in the [[Middletown Historic District (Middletown, Maryland)|Middletown Historic District]].\n\n==Geography==\nMiddletown is located at {{coord|39|26|28|N|77|32|38|W|type:city}} (39.441155, -77.543761).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|1.74|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref> [[Catoctin Creek (Maryland)|Catoctin Creek]] flows due south from approximately one mile west of town to several miles south of town.\n\nTo the east, Middletown borders [[Braddock Mountain]], named after the British general [[Edward Braddock]].

Located in the [[Middletown Valley]] that stretches between the [[Catoctin Mountain]]s on the east and [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] on the west, the town reportedly gained its name from its location midway between those ranges.\n\n==History==\nA young Lieutenant [[George Washington]], while surveying the South Mountain area, reported that the valley to the east was one of the most beautiful places he had ever seen. Later, as a Colonel in 1755, he was to accompany General Braddock on the old Indian Trail that ran through the valley on his way to Fort Cumberland.\n\nThe early German and English settlers started to arrive in the valley in the 1730s. Among them was Michael Jesserong, who paid \u00a366 for {{convert|50|acre|m2}}. He named his property Middletown and sold the first lots there in 1767, the date officially marked as that of the town\u2019s founding.\n\nThe history of Middletown is a mirror on the nation\u2019s development. Main Street spread to the west with construction of the National Pike through the town in 1806; the telegraph lines from Frederick to Hagerstown were routed through Middletown in 1854; and in 1896, car 11 of the Frederick Middletown Railway made its first run to Middletown. During the Civil War, both armies passed through the town to the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. In the aftermath of those battles, Middletown opened its churches and homes to care for the wounded.\n\nMiddletown preserves many historic structures indicative of its various periods of development and prosperity. The core of the old town, comprising the several blocks along West Main Street ([[U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Hagerstown\u2013Frederick, Maryland)|US Route 40 Alt]]) and South Church Street ([[Maryland Route 17|MD Route 17]]) contains several examples of [[Federal architecture|Federal]] and [[Greek Revival]] architecture, including the Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church (1859-1860) and Christ Reformed Church United Church of Christ (1818). With the coming of the [[Hagerstown and Frederick Railway]] in the 1890s, the town expanded to the east, where several examples of various Victorian-era styles can be seen, including [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]], [[Gothic Revival]], and later examples of [[Colonial Revival]] styles. The economic prosperity experienced in the town during the first quarter of the twentieth century led to the alteration of older commercial structures and the construction of new ones in the first few blocks of Main Street, including the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] styled Valley Savings Bank (today the Middletown Valley Bank). Many of these structures are registered in the [[Middletown Historic District (Middletown, Maryland)|Middletown Historic District]].\n\n==Geography==\nMiddletown is located at {{coord|39|26|28|N|77|32|38|W|type:city}} (39.441155, -77.543761).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|1.74|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref> [[Catoctin Creek (Maryland)|Catoctin Creek]] flows due south from approximately one mile west of town to several miles south of town.\n\nTo the east, Middletown borders [[Braddock Mountain]], named after the British general [[Edward Braddock]].

Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of [[corporate social responsibility]], published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from [[Oxfam]], the [[World Food Programme]], [[United Nations Global Compact]], the Chairman of [[BT Group]], an ex-Director of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and the UK [[Institute of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754|title=Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January\u2013February 2005)|work=Business & Human Rights|accessdate=3 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nMany of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary. After ''The Economist'' ran a critique of [[Amnesty International]] and human rights in general in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954694|title=Letters: On Amnesty International and human rights, Iraq, tax breaks 4&nbsp;April 2007|date=4 April 2007|work=The Economist|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref> Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local [[right-of-reply]] laws without compromising editorial independence.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis T.

Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of [[corporate social responsibility]], published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from [[Oxfam]], the [[World Food Programme]], [[United Nations Global Compact]], the Chairman of [[BT Group]], an ex-Director of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and the UK [[Institute of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754|title=Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January\u2013February 2005)|work=Business & Human Rights|accessdate=3 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nMany of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary. After ''The Economist'' ran a critique of [[Amnesty International]] and human rights in general in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954694|title=Letters: On Amnesty International and human rights, Iraq, tax breaks 4&nbsp;April 2007|date=4 April 2007|work=The Economist|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref> Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local [[right-of-reply]] laws without compromising editorial independence.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis T.
