He reduced mortality from [[puerperal fever]], and created the first vaccines for [[rabies]] and [[anthrax]].\n\nHis medical discoveries provided direct support for the [[germ theory of disease]] and its application in clinical medicine. He is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating [[milk]] and [[wine]] to stop bacterial contamination, a process now called [[pasteurization]].

Early in his career, his investigation of [[tartaric acid]] resulted in the first resolution of what is now called [[Chirality (chemistry)|optical isomers]]. His work led the way to the current understanding of a fundamental principle in the structure of organic compounds.\n\nHe was the director of the [[Pasteur Institute]], established in 1887, until his death, and his body was interred in a vault beneath the institute. Although Pasteur made groundbreaking experiments, his reputation became associated with various controversies.

Osler, who knew Pasteur personally. Vallery-Radot was himself a Catholic yet admits that Pasteur believed only in \"an Infinite\" and \"hoped\" for a future life. Pasteur publicly stated this himself in his Academy speech in 1822 (in V.R.). He said: \"The idea of God is a form of the idea of the Infinite whether it is called Brahma, Allah, Jehova, or Jesus.\" The biographer says that in his last days he turned to the Church but the only \"evidence\" he gives is that he liked to read the life of St. Vincent de Paul, and he admits that he did not receive the sacraments at death. Relatives put rosary beads in his hands, and the Catholic Encyclopedia claims him as a Catholic in virtue of the fact and of an anonymous and inconclusive statement about him. Wheeler says in his Dictionary of Freethinkers that in his prime Pasteur was Vice-President of the British Secular (Atheist) Union; and Wheeler was the chief Secularist writer of the time. The evidence is overwhelming. Yet the Catholic scientist Sir Bertram Windle assures his readers that \"no person who knows anything about him can doubt the sincerity of his attachment to the Catholic Church,\" and all Catholic writers use much the same scandalous language.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Louis Pasteur|year=2000|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6529-9|author=Patrice Debr\u00e9|page=176|quote=Does this mean that Pasteur was bound to a religious ideal?

He is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating [[milk]] and [[wine]] to stop bacterial contamination, a process now called [[pasteurization]].

Early in his career, his investigation of [[tartaric acid]] resulted in the first resolution of what is now called [[Chirality (chemistry)|optical isomers]]. His work led the way to the current understanding of a fundamental principle in the structure of organic compounds.\n\nHe was the director of the [[Pasteur Institute]], established in 1887, until his death, and his body was interred in a vault beneath the institute. Although Pasteur made groundbreaking experiments, his reputation became associated with various controversies.

Osler, who knew Pasteur personally. Vallery-Radot was himself a Catholic yet admits that Pasteur believed only in \"an Infinite\" and \"hoped\" for a future life. Pasteur publicly stated this himself in his Academy speech in 1822 (in V.R.). He said: \"The idea of God is a form of the idea of the Infinite whether it is called Brahma, Allah, Jehova, or Jesus.\" The biographer says that in his last days he turned to the Church but the only \"evidence\" he gives is that he liked to read the life of St. Vincent de Paul, and he admits that he did not receive the sacraments at death. Relatives put rosary beads in his hands, and the Catholic Encyclopedia claims him as a Catholic in virtue of the fact and of an anonymous and inconclusive statement about him. Wheeler says in his Dictionary of Freethinkers that in his prime Pasteur was Vice-President of the British Secular (Atheist) Union; and Wheeler was the chief Secularist writer of the time. The evidence is overwhelming. Yet the Catholic scientist Sir Bertram Windle assures his readers that \"no person who knows anything about him can doubt the sincerity of his attachment to the Catholic Church,\" and all Catholic writers use much the same scandalous language.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Louis Pasteur|year=2000|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6529-9|author=Patrice Debr\u00e9|page=176|quote=Does this mean that Pasteur was bound to a religious ideal?

Its capital and largest city is [[Lanzhou]], located in the southeast part of the province.\n\nThe seventh-largest administrative district by area at {{convert|453700|km2}}, Gansu lies between the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan]] and [[Loess Plateau|Loess]] plateaus and borders [[Mongolia]] ([[Govi-Altai Province]]), [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Ningxia]] to the north, [[Xinjiang]] and [[Qinghai]] to the west, [[Sichuan]] to the south and [[Shaanxi]] to the east. The [[Yellow River]] passes through the southern part of the province. Part of Gansu's territory is located in the [[Gobi Desert]]. The [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] mountains are located in the south of the Province.\n\nGansu has a population of 26 million, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|22nd in China]]. Its population is mostly [[Han Chinese|Han]], along with [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Dongxiangs|Dongxiang]] and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] minorities. The most common language is Mandarin. Gansu is among the poorest administrative divisions in China, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|ranking 31st]] in GDP per capita. Most of Gansu's economy is based on the [[mining]] industry and the extraction of [[minerals]], especially [[rare earth elements]]. Tourism also plays a role in Gansu's economy.\n\nThe [[State of Qin]] originated in what is now southeastern Gansu and went on to form the first known Empire in what is now [[China]]. The [[Northern Silk Road]] ran through the [[Hexi Corridor]], which passes through Gansu, resulting in it being an important strategic outpost and communications link for the Chinese empire.\n\nThe city of [[Jiayuguan City|Jiayuguan]], the second most populated city in Gansu, is known for its section of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and the [[Jiayu Pass|Jiayuguan Pass fortress complex]].\n\n==Name==\nGansu is a compound of the names of [[Ganzhou District|Ganzhou]] (now a [[district (PRC)|district]] of [[Zhangye]]) and [[Suzhou District|Suzhou]].

However, due to extreme altitude, some areas of Gansu exhibit a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dwc'') \u2013 with winter temperatures sometimes dropping to {{convert|-40|C|F}}.

Jiayuguan Pass was built in the early [[Ming dynasty]], somewhere around the year 1372. It was built near an oasis that was then on the extreme western edge of China. Jiayuguan Pass was the first pass on the west end of the great wall so it earned the name \"The First And Greatest Pass Under Heaven\".\n\nAn extra brick is said to rest on a ledge over one of the gates.  One legend holds that the official in charge asked the designer to calculate how many bricks would be used. The designer gave him the number and when the project was finished, only one brick was left. It was put on the top of the pass as a symbol of commemoration.  Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect.  The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need.  When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances.  The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request.  When the gate was finished, the single extra brick was, in fact, extra and was left on the ledge over the gate.<ref name=\"CNTOLEGEND\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnto.org/iconic/the-great-wall-in-gansu/|title=The Great Wall in Gansu|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mogao Grottoes===\n{{main|Mogao Caves}}\nThe Mogao Grottoes near [[Dunhuang]] have a collection of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] art. Originally there were a thousand grottoes, but now only 492 cave temples remain. Each temple has a large statue of a [[Buddha (general)|buddha]] or [[bodhisattva]] and paintings of religious scenes. In 336&nbsp;AD, a monk named Le Zun (Lo-tsun) came near Echoing Sand Mountain, when he had a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. He started to carve the first grotto. During the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties period]] they ran out of room on the cliff and could not build any more grottoes.\n\n===Silk Road and Dunhuang City===\n[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 156.jpg|thumb|200px|A terracotta warrior from Gansu, with traces of polychrome and gold, from the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907)]]\nThe historic [[Silk Road]] starts in [[Chang'an]] and goes to [[Constantinople]]. On the way merchants would go to Dunhuang in Gansu. In Dunhuang they would get fresh camels, food and guards for the journey around the dangerous [[Taklamakan Desert]]. Before departing Dunhuang they would pray to the Mogao Grottoes for a safe journey, if they came back alive they would thank the gods at the grottoes. Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, [[Kashgar|Kashi (Kashgar)]], was a welcome sight to the merchants. At Kashi most would trade and go back and the ones who stayed would eat fruit and trade their [[Bactrian camel]]s for [[Dromedary|single humped]] ones. After Kashi they would keep going until they reached their next destination.\n\nLocated about {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the city, the [[Crescent Lake (Dunhuang)|Crescent Lake]] or Yueyaquan is an oasis and popular spot for tourists seeking respite from the heat of the desert. Activities includes camel and 4x4 rides.\n\n===Silk Route Museum===\n{{main|Silk Route Museum}}\nThe Silk Route Museum is located in [[Jiuquan]] along the [[Silk Road]], a trading route connecting [[Rome]] to China, used by [[Marco Polo]].

The great Maitreya Buddha is more than 27 meters tall and is similar in style to the great Buddhas that once lined the cliffs of [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan]], Afghanistan. Access to the site is by boat from [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in the summer or fall.

romanization|alternately romanized]] as '''Kansu''') is a landlocked [[Provinces of China|province]] in [[Northwest China]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Lanzhou]], located in the southeast part of the province.\n\nThe seventh-largest administrative district by area at {{convert|453700|km2}}, Gansu lies between the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan]] and [[Loess Plateau|Loess]] plateaus and borders [[Mongolia]] ([[Govi-Altai Province]]), [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Ningxia]] to the north, [[Xinjiang]] and [[Qinghai]] to the west, [[Sichuan]] to the south and [[Shaanxi]] to the east. The [[Yellow River]] passes through the southern part of the province. Part of Gansu's territory is located in the [[Gobi Desert]]. The [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] mountains are located in the south of the Province.\n\nGansu has a population of 26 million, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|22nd in China]]. Its population is mostly [[Han Chinese|Han]], along with [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Dongxiangs|Dongxiang]] and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] minorities. The most common language is Mandarin. Gansu is among the poorest administrative divisions in China, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|ranking 31st]] in GDP per capita. Most of Gansu's economy is based on the [[mining]] industry and the extraction of [[minerals]], especially [[rare earth elements]]. Tourism also plays a role in Gansu's economy.\n\nThe [[State of Qin]] originated in what is now southeastern Gansu and went on to form the first known Empire in what is now [[China]]. The [[Northern Silk Road]] ran through the [[Hexi Corridor]], which passes through Gansu, resulting in it being an important strategic outpost and communications link for the Chinese empire.\n\nThe city of [[Jiayuguan City|Jiayuguan]], the second most populated city in Gansu, is known for its section of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and the [[Jiayu Pass|Jiayuguan Pass fortress complex]].\n\n==Name==\nGansu is a compound of the names of [[Ganzhou District|Ganzhou]] (now a [[district (PRC)|district]] of [[Zhangye]]) and [[Suzhou District|Suzhou]].

Jiayuguan Pass was the first pass on the west end of the great wall so it earned the name \"The First And Greatest Pass Under Heaven\".\n\nAn extra brick is said to rest on a ledge over one of the gates.  One legend holds that the official in charge asked the designer to calculate how many bricks would be used. The designer gave him the number and when the project was finished, only one brick was left. It was put on the top of the pass as a symbol of commemoration.  Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect.  The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need.  When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances.  The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request.  When the gate was finished, the single extra brick was, in fact, extra and was left on the ledge over the gate.<ref name=\"CNTOLEGEND\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnto.org/iconic/the-great-wall-in-gansu/|title=The Great Wall in Gansu|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mogao Grottoes===\n{{main|Mogao Caves}}\nThe Mogao Grottoes near [[Dunhuang]] have a collection of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] art.

Before departing Dunhuang they would pray to the Mogao Grottoes for a safe journey, if they came back alive they would thank the gods at the grottoes. Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, [[Kashgar|Kashi (Kashgar)]], was a welcome sight to the merchants. At Kashi most would trade and go back and the ones who stayed would eat fruit and trade their [[Bactrian camel]]s for [[Dromedary|single humped]] ones.

{"title_page": "Taylor rule", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Taylor Law|Taylor's law|Taylor's theorem}}\nThe Taylor rule is one kind of targeting monetary policy rule of a central bank. The Taylor rule was proposed by the American economist [[John B. Taylor]] in 1992, who is currently the George P.Shultz Senior Fellow In Economics at and the director of Standford\u2019s Introductory Economics Centre.<ref>\"Hoover Institution Senior Fellow: Biography\". Hoover Institution. Retrieved 27 October 2011.</ref> John B. Taylor was an economic adviser in the presidential administrations of Geral Ford and George H.W. Bush, and undersecretary in the U.S. Treasury.<ref>Interview with John B. Taylor, Federal Reserve Bank of MINNEAPOLIS, interview by Douglas Clement, June1, 2006</ref> \n\nThe idea of John B. Taylor to propose a central bank the technic to stabilize the economic activity by setting an interest rate.<ref>Judd, John P. and Bharat Trehan, Has the Fed Gotten Tougher on Inflation? (1995) FRBSF Weekly Letter, Number 95-13, March 31</ref>The rule defines the good monetary policy based on the free main indicator: the federal funds rate, the price level and the changes in real income.<ref>John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905</ref>\n\nThe monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has been changing throughout the 20th century. The period between 1960s - 1970s is defined by Taylor as a period of a poor monetary policy. The inflation rate was growing while the interest rate was sat at the low level not allowing to restrain the rise of prices.<ref>B. Taylor, John (January 2014). \"Causes of the Financial Crisis and the Slow Recovery: A Ten-Year Perspective\", ''Hoover Institution Economics Working Paper''.</ref>\n\nThe Taylor rule prescribes to regulate the economic activity by setting up the federal rate (overnight bank rate) based on the inflation gap between desired (targeted) inflation rate and actual inflation rate; and the output gap between the actual and natural level. The practical implication of the rule defines that a central bank implements a stabilizing monetary policy when it rises the nominal interest rate by more than an increase in inflation.<ref>Frederic S. Mishkin, Monetary Policy Strategy Lessons from the Crisis National Bureau of Economic Research Cambridge MA 02138 February 2011</ref> Other words, the rule prescribes a relatively high-interest rate in the situation when actual inflation is higher than a targeted one. The main advantage of a general targeting rule is that a central bank gains the discretion to apply all means to achieve the set target. The economic model based on backwards- and forward-looking assumptions is justified.<ref>Lars E. O. Svensson, What Is Wrong with Taylor Rules? Using Judgment in Monetary Policy through Targeting Rules (June 2003), Journal of Economic Literature</ref>\n\n==As an equation==\nAccording to Taylor's original version of the rule, the nominal interest rate should respond to\ndivergences of actual inflation rates  from ''target'' inflation rates and of actual [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) from ''potential'' GDP:\n\n:<math>i_t = \\pi_t + r_t^* + a_\\pi  ( \\pi_t - \\pi_t^* )  + a_y ( y_t - \\bar y_t ).</math>\n\nIn this equation, <math>\\,i_t\\,</math> is the target short-term [[nominal interest rate]] (e.g. the [[Federal funds rate|federal funds rate]] in the US, the [[Official bank rate|Bank of England base rate]] in the UK), <math>\\,\\pi_t\\,</math> is the rate of [[inflation]] as measured by the [[GDP deflator]], <math>\\pi^*_t</math> is the desired rate of inflation, <math>r_t^*</math> is the assumed equilibrium real interest rate, <math>\\,y_t\\,</math> is the logarithm of real [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], and <math>\\bar y_t</math> is the logarithm of [[potential output]], as determined by a linear trend.\n\nIn this equation, both <math>a_{\\pi}</math> and <math>a_y</math> should be positive (as a rough rule of thumb, Taylor's 1993 paper proposed setting <math>a_{\\pi}=a_y=0.5</math>).<ref>Athanasios Orphanides (2008). \"Taylor rules,\" ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. v. 8, pp. 2000-2004, equation (7).[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_T000215&q=taylor%20rules&topicid=&result_number=1 Abstract.]</ref>  That is, the rule \"recommends\" a relatively high interest rate (a \"tight\" monetary policy) when inflation is above its target or when output is above its [[full employment|full-employment]] level, in order to reduce inflationary pressure.  It recommends a relatively low interest rate (\"easy\" monetary policy) in the opposite situation, to stimulate output.  Sometimes monetary policy goals may conflict, as in the case of [[stagflation]], when inflation is above its target while output is below full employment.

The discourse among economists and policymakers started at the beginning of the 19th century. The first forum for debate was launched in the 1920s by the House Committee on Banking and Currency. In the hearing on the Strong bill in 1923, the conflict in the views on the monetary policy clearly appeared. Congressman Governor Strong, supported by John R. Commons and Irving Fisher, was highly concerned about the practices uses by the FED to control the price stability. In his opinion, [[the FED]] policy regarding the price level was unstable and could not guarantee long-term stability. After the death of the congressman, a political debate on changing the FED\u2019s policy was suspended. The FED was highly influenced by the New York Bank.\n\nOnly after the Great Depression hit the country, the FED policies started to be debated again. Irving Fisher compressed that \u201cthis depression was almost wholly preventable and that it would have been prevented if Governor Strong had lived, who was conducting open-market operations with a view of bringing about stability\u201d.<ref>Robert L.

Mishkin, Monetary Policy Strategy Lessons from the Crisis National Bureau of Economic Research Cambridge MA 02138 February 2011</ref>\n\nThe recession in the US in the 1960s was accompanied by relatively high-interest rate. After Bretton Woods collapse the policy-makers were focused on keeping a low-interest rate, which had a negative impact on inventory process and resulted in the Great Inflation of 1970.\n\nSince the mid-1970s monetary targets have been used in many countries to state targets for inflation. Many advanced economies, such as the US and the UK, their policy rates were broadly consistent with the Taylor rule in the period of the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d between the mid-1980s and early 2000s. The Great moderation period was characterized by the limited inflation and stability of prices. In light of the Taylor rule, many central banks started to adjust their policies. The first mover was New Zeeland, where the inflation target was introduced in 1984. The Reserve Bank of New Zeeland was reformed to prioritize the price stability, besides, it gained more independence. After that, the Bank of Canada in 1991 and by 1994 the banks of Sweden, Finland, Australia, Spain, Israel and Chile were given the mandate to target inflation.<ref>Pier Francesco Asso, George A. Kahn, and Robert Leeson, The Taylor Rule and the Practice of Central Banking (February 2010), The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</ref>\n\nHowever, since the 2000s the actual interest rate in advanced economies, especially in the US, was below the suggested by the Taylor rule. The deviation can be explained by the fact that the central banks were supposed to mitigate the outcomes of financial busts but should intervene only when there are inflation expectations.

There are a few main limitations of the Taylor rule.\n\n1) ''Technical reasons.'' For the economic models, the period of 4 months was widely used, however, the period is not accurate to track the real changes in price, and this period is too long for setting the fixed interest rate.<ref>John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905)</ref> Besides, the formulate incorporates the unobservable parameters can be easily misevaluated.<ref>Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global \u201cGreat Deviation\u201d? (September 2012)</ref> For example, the output-gap could not be precisely estimated by any bank.\n\n2) ''The inaccuracy of predictable variables'', such as the inflation and output gap that depend on the different scenarios of economic development. 3) ''Difficulty to assess the state of the economy in real-time'' 4) ''The discretionary optimization'' that leads to stabilization bias and a lack of history dependence.<ref>Lars E. O. Svensson, What Is Wrong with Taylor Rules? Using Judgment in Monetary Policy through Targeting Rules (June 2003), Journal of Economic Literature</ref>\n\n5) ''The limited number of factors in the model.'' The model does not outlook the financial parameters. Thus, in the period of the financial boost the Taylor rule might tend to underestimate the interest rate, and opposite, during the financial busts overestimate.\n\n6) ''Does not reflect the usability of other monetary policy instruments'' such as reserve funds adjustment, balance sheet policies.<ref>Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global \u201cGreat Deviation\u201d?

Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905</ref> Hence, although the Taylor rule gives the room for manoeuvre, it is encouraged to treat the Taylor rule as a policy rule that required the strict implementation of the policy based on the incoming economic parameters.\n\n==Criticisms==\n[[Athanasios Orphanides]] (2003) claims that the Taylor rule can misguide policy makers since they face [[real-time data]].

Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905</ref>\n\nThe monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has been changing throughout the 20th century. The period between 1960s - 1970s is defined by Taylor as a period of a poor monetary policy. The inflation rate was growing while the interest rate was sat at the low level not allowing to restrain the rise of prices.<ref>B. Taylor, John (January 2014). \"Causes of the Financial Crisis and the Slow Recovery: A Ten-Year Perspective\", ''Hoover Institution Economics Working Paper''.</ref>\n\nThe Taylor rule prescribes to regulate the economic activity by setting up the federal rate (overnight bank rate) based on the inflation gap between desired (targeted) inflation rate and actual inflation rate; and the output gap between the actual and natural level. The practical implication of the rule defines that a central bank implements a stabilizing monetary policy when it rises the nominal interest rate by more than an increase in inflation.<ref>Frederic S. Mishkin, Monetary Policy Strategy Lessons from the Crisis National Bureau of Economic Research Cambridge MA 02138 February 2011</ref> Other words, the rule prescribes a relatively high-interest rate in the situation when actual inflation is higher than a targeted one. The main advantage of a general targeting rule is that a central bank gains the discretion to apply all means to achieve the set target. The economic model based on backwards- and forward-looking assumptions is justified.<ref>Lars E. O. Svensson, What Is Wrong with Taylor Rules? Using Judgment in Monetary Policy through Targeting Rules (June 2003), Journal of Economic Literature</ref>\n\n==As an equation==\nAccording to Taylor's original version of the rule, the nominal interest rate should respond to\ndivergences of actual inflation rates  from ''target'' inflation rates and of actual [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) from ''potential'' GDP:\n\n:<math>i_t = \\pi_t + r_t^* + a_\\pi  ( \\pi_t - \\pi_t^* )  + a_y ( y_t - \\bar y_t ).</math>\n\nIn this equation, <math>\\,i_t\\,</math> is the target short-term [[nominal interest rate]] (e.g. the [[Federal funds rate|federal funds rate]] in the US, the [[Official bank rate|Bank of England base rate]] in the UK), <math>\\,\\pi_t\\,</math> is the rate of [[inflation]] as measured by the [[GDP deflator]], <math>\\pi^*_t</math> is the desired rate of inflation, <math>r_t^*</math> is the assumed equilibrium real interest rate, <math>\\,y_t\\,</math> is the logarithm of real [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], and <math>\\bar y_t</math> is the logarithm of [[potential output]], as determined by a linear trend.\n\nIn this equation, both <math>a_{\\pi}</math> and <math>a_y</math> should be positive (as a rough rule of thumb, Taylor's 1993 paper proposed setting <math>a_{\\pi}=a_y=0.5</math>).<ref>Athanasios Orphanides (2008). \"Taylor rules,\" ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. v. 8, pp. 2000-2004, equation (7).[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_T000215&q=taylor%20rules&topicid=&result_number=1 Abstract.]</ref>  That is, the rule \"recommends\" a relatively high interest rate (a \"tight\" monetary policy) when inflation is above its target or when output is above its [[full employment|full-employment]] level, in order to reduce inflationary pressure.  It recommends a relatively low interest rate (\"easy\" monetary policy) in the opposite situation, to stimulate output.  Sometimes monetary policy goals may conflict, as in the case of [[stagflation]], when inflation is above its target while output is below full employment. In such a situation, a Taylor rule specifies the relative weights given to reducing inflation versus increasing output.\n\n==The Taylor principle==\nBy specifying <math>a_{\\pi}>0</math>, the Taylor rule says that an increase in inflation by one percentage point should prompt the [[central bank]] to raise the [[nominal interest rate]] by more than one percentage point (specifically, by <math>1+a_{\\pi}</math>, the sum of the two coefficients on <math>\\pi_t</math> in the equation above).

There are a few main limitations of the Taylor rule.\n\n1) ''Technical reasons.'' For the economic models, the period of 4 months was widely used, however, the period is not accurate to track the real changes in price, and this period is too long for setting the fixed interest rate.<ref>John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905)</ref> Besides, the formulate incorporates the unobservable parameters can be easily misevaluated.<ref>Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global \u201cGreat Deviation\u201d? (September 2012)</ref> For example, the output-gap could not be precisely estimated by any bank.\n\n2) ''The inaccuracy of predictable variables'', such as the inflation and output gap that depend on the different scenarios of economic development. 3) ''Difficulty to assess the state of the economy in real-time'' 4) ''The discretionary optimization'' that leads to stabilization bias and a lack of history dependence.<ref>Lars E. O. Svensson, What Is Wrong with Taylor Rules? Using Judgment in Monetary Policy through Targeting Rules (June 2003), Journal of Economic Literature</ref>\n\n5) ''The limited number of factors in the model.'' The model does not outlook the financial parameters. Thus, in the period of the financial boost the Taylor rule might tend to underestimate the interest rate, and opposite, during the financial busts overestimate.\n\n6) ''Does not reflect the usability of other monetary policy instruments'' such as reserve funds adjustment, balance sheet policies.<ref>Boris Hofmann, Taylor rules and monetary policy: a global \u201cGreat Deviation\u201d? (September 2012)</ref>\n\n7) ''The relationship between the interest rate and aggregate demand is questioning'' by Kriesler and Lanoie, 2007.<ref>Emiliano Brancaccio and Giuseppe Fontana, \u2018Solvency rule\u2019 versus \u2018Taylor rule\u2019: an alternative interpretation of the relation between monetary policy and the economic crisis (August 2012 ), Cambridge Journal of Economics</ref>\n\nHowever, Taylor in his economic work highlighted that the rule should not be implicated mechanically: \u201c\u2026There will be episodes where monetary policy will need to be adjusted to deal with special factors.\u201d On another hand, the Taylor rule is opposed to the discretion approach since it aimed to overcome the limitation of the purely discretionary approach.<ref>John B. Taylor, Discretion versus policy rules in practice (1993), Standford University, y, Stanford, CA 94905</ref> Hence, although the Taylor rule gives the room for manoeuvre, it is encouraged to treat the Taylor rule as a policy rule that required the strict implementation of the policy based on the incoming economic parameters.\n\n==Criticisms==\n[[Athanasios Orphanides]] (2003) claims that the Taylor rule can misguide policy makers since they face [[real-time data]]. He shows that the Taylor rule matches the US funds rate less perfectly when accounting for these informational limitations and that an activist policy following the Taylor rule would have resulted in an inferior macroeconomic performance during the Great Inflation of the seventies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Orphanides |first=A. |year=2003 |title=The Quest for Prosperity without Inflation |journal=[[Journal of Monetary Economics]] |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=633\u2013663 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3932(03)00028-X |citeseerx=10.1.1.196.7048 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, financial manager [[Bill H. Gross|Bill Gross]] said the Taylor rule \"must now be discarded into the trash bin of history\", in light of tepid GDP growth in the years after 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/30/gross-low-rates-are-the-problem-not-the-solution.html |title=Gross: Low rates are the problem, not the solution |work=CNBC |author=Bill Gross |date=July 30, 2015 |accessdate=July 30, 2015|author-link=Bill H.
