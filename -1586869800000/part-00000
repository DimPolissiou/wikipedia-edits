Although vehicles that incorporated the basic principles of the tank (armour, firepower, and all-terrain mobility) had been projected in the decade or so before the War, it was the alarmingly heavy casualties of the start of its [[trench warfare]] that stimulated development.<ref>Williamson Murray, \"Armored Warfare: The British, French, and German Experiences,\" in {{cite book |title= Military Innovation in the Interwar Period|edition=|editor1-first= Williamson|editor1-last= Murray|editor2-first= Allan R|editor2-last= Millet |year= 1996|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= New York|isbn= 0-521-63760-0|page= 6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah4cfjAHMm0C&pg=PA381|title=Collision of Empires: Britain in Three World Wars, 1793-1945|first=A.

Although initially termed \"Landships\" by the [[Landship Committee]], production vehicles were named \"tanks\", to preserve secrecy. The term was chosen when it became known that the factory workers at William Foster referred to the first prototype as \"the tank\" because of its resemblance to a steel water tank.\n\nThe French fielded their first tanks in April 1917 and [[Comparison of World War I tanks|ultimately produced far more tanks than all other countries, combined.]]\n\nThe [[German Empire|Germans]], on the other hand, began development only in response to the appearance of Allied tanks on the battlefield. Whilst the Allies manufactured several thousand tanks during the war, Germany deployed only 20 of its own.<ref>Showalter, D.E. \"More Than Nuts And Bolts: Technology And The German Army, 1870\u20131945.\" ''Historian'' 65.1 (Fall 2002): 123\u2013143.

There were problems that caused considerable attrition rates during [[armoured warfare|combat]] deployment and transit. The heavily shelled terrain was impassable to conventional vehicles, and only highly mobile tanks such as the Mark IV and [[FT-17|FT]]s performed reasonably well. The Mark I's [[rhomboid]] shape, caterpillar tracks, and {{convert|26|ft|m|adj=on|0}} length meant that it could negotiate obstacles, especially wide trenches, that wheeled vehicles could not.\nAlong with the tank, the first [[self-propelled gun]] (the British [[Gun Carrier Mark I|Gun Carrier Mk I]]) and the first [[armoured personnel carrier]] (the British [[Mark IX tank|Mk IX]]) were constructed in World War I.\n\n==Conceptual roots of the tank==\n{{See also|History of the tank}}\n[[Image:German photo with English Tank.jpg|thumb|left|Mark 3II; tank no. 799 captured near Arras on 11 April 1917]]\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S12137, Westfront, bei Cambrai erbeuteter Panzer.jpg|thumb|A German-captured British tank in 1917]]\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P1013-313, Westfront, erbeutete englische Tanks.jpg|thumb|1917: British tanks captured by the Germans being transported by rail]]\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R28717, Frankreich, deutsche Panzerschwadron.jpg|thumb|right|[[Germany|German]] forces using captured British Mark IVs during the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]]]\n\nThe conceptual roots of the tank go back to ancient times, with siege engines which were able to provide protection for troops moving up against stone walls or other fortifications. With the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the demonstrable power of [[steam power|steam]], James Cowan presented a proposal for a Steam Powered Land Ram in 1855, towards the end of the [[Crimean War]]. Looking like a helmet on 'footed' Boydell wheels, early forerunners of the [[Pedrail wheel]], it was essentially an armoured steam tractor equipped with [[cannon]] and rotating [[scythe]]s sprouting from the sides. [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] is said to have dismissed it as 'barbaric'.\n\n[[File:Hornsby.jpg|thumb|left|Hornsby tractor]]\n[[File:Artillery tractor in France Vosges Spring 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Artillery tractors (here a [[Benjamin Holt|Holt]] tractor) were in use in the French Army in 1914-1915. Here, in the [[Vosges]], spring 1915]]\n\nFrom 1904 to 1909, David Roberts, the engineer and [[managing director]] of [[Hornsby & Sons]] of [[Grantham]], built a series of [[tractor]]s using his patented 'chain-track' which were put through their paces by the [[British Army]], a (small) section of which wanted to evaluate [[artillery tractor]]s. At one point in 1908,  Major William E. Donohue of the Mechanical Transport Committee remarked to Roberts that he should design a new machine with armour, capable of carrying its own gun. But, disheartened by years of ultimately fruitless tinkering for the Army, Roberts did not take up the idea. In later years he expressed regret at not having pursued it.<ref>The Devil's Chariots: The Birth and Secret Battles of the First Tanks. John Glanfield (Sutton Publishing, 2001) p16</ref>\n\nAn engineer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Lieutenant [[Gunther Burstyn]], inspired by [[Holt Company|Holt]] tractors, designed a tracked armoured vehicle in 1911 carrying a light gun in a rotating turret; equipped also with hinged 'arms', two in front and two at the rear, carrying wheels on the ends to assist with obstacles and trenches, it was a very forward-looking design, if rather small. The [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian government]] said it would be interested in evaluating it if Burstyn could secure commercial backing to produce a prototype. Lacking the requisite contacts, he let it drop. An approach to the German government was similarly fruitless.\n\nIn 1912, a [[South Australia]]n, [[Lancelot De Mole]], submitted a proposal to the British [[War Office]] for a \"chain-rail vehicle which could be easily steered and carry heavy loads over rough ground and trenches\". De Mole made more proposals to the War Office in 1914 and 1916, with a culminating proposal in late 1917, accompanied by a huge one-eighth scale model, yet all fell on substantially deaf ears. De Mole's proposal already had the climbing face, so typical of the later World War I British tanks, but it is unknown whether there was some connection. Inquiries to the government of [[Australia]], after the war, yielded polite responses that Mr. De Mole's ideas had unfortunately been too advanced for the time to be properly recognised at their just value. The Commission on Awards to Inventors in 1919, which adjudicated all the competing claims to the development of the tank, recognised the brilliance of De Mole's design, even considering that it was superior to the machines actually developed, but due to its narrow remit, could only make a payment of \u00a3987 to De Mole to cover his expenses. De Mole noted in 1919 that he was urged by friends before the war to approach the Germans with his design, but declined to do so for patriotic reasons. [[File:Charron Girardot Voigt 1902.jpg|thumb|French armored car: the [[Charron-Girardot-Voigt 1902]]]]\n\nBefore [[World War I]], motorized vehicles were still relatively uncommon, and their use on the battlefield was initially limited, especially of heavier vehicles. [[Armored car (military)|Armoured car]]s soon became more commonplace with most belligerents, especially in more open terrain. On August 23, 1914, the French Colonel [[Jean Baptiste Eug\u00e8ne Estienne]], later a major proponent of tanks, declared: ''Messieurs, la victoire appartiendra dans cette guerre \u00e0 celui des deux bellig\u00e9rants qui parviendra le premier \u00e0 placer un canon de 75 sur une voiture capable de se mouvoir en tout terrain'' (\"Gentlemen, the victory will belong, in this war, to the one of the two belligerents who will be the first to succeed in mounting a 75 mm gun on a vehicle capable of moving in all types of terrain\").\n\nArmored cars did indeed prove useful in open land such as in deserts, but were not very good at crossing obstacles (e.g. trenches, barriers) or in more challenging terrain. The other issue was that it was very hard to add much protection or armament.\n\nThe main limitation was the wheels, which gave a high [[ground pressure]] for the vehicle's weight. This could be solved by adding more wheels, but unless they also were driven, the effect was to reduce traction on the powered wheels. Driving extra wheels meant more drive train weight, in turn requiring a larger and heavier engine to maintain performance. Even worse, none of this extra weight was put into an improvement of armor or armament carried, and the vehicles were still incapable of crossing very rough terrain.\n\nThe adoption of [[caterpillar track]]s offered a new solution to the problem. The tracks spread the weight of the vehicles over a much greater area, which was all used for traction to move the vehicle. The limitation on armor and firepower was no longer ground pressure but the power and weight of the power-plant.\n\n[[Image:Swinton-holt-stockton-1918.jpg|thumb|left|Swinton (now [[Colonel]]) with [[Benjamin Holt]] in [[Stockton, California]], relaying gratitude to the inventor for his company's contribution to the war effort]]\n\nThe remaining issue was how to utilise and configure a vehicle.  Major [[Ernest Dunlop Swinton]] [[Royal Engineers|RE]], was the official British war correspondent serving in France in 1914. He recounts in his book ''Eyewitness'' how the idea of using caterpillar tracks to drive an armoured fighting vehicle came to him on October 19, 1914, while he was driving through northern France. In July 1914 he had received a letter from a friend, Hugh Marriott, a mining engineer, drawing his attention to a [[Holt tractor|Holt caterpillar tractor]] that Marriott had seen in Belgium. Marriott thought it might be useful for transport over difficult ground, and Swinton had passed the information on to the appropriate departments. Now Swinton suggested the idea of an armoured tracked vehicle to the military authorities, by sending a proposal to Lieutenant-Colonel [[Maurice Hankey]]. Hankey in turn tried to interest [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in the idea; when this failed he sent a memorandum in December to the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]], of which he was himself the secretary; [[Winston Churchill]] the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] was one of the members of the committee. Hankey proposed to build a gigantic steel roller, pushed by tracked tractors, to shield the advancing infantry. Churchill in turn wrote a note on January 5 to the Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]], in which he warned that the Germans might any moment introduce a comparable system. A worried Asquith now ordered Kitchener to form a committee, headed by [[General Scott-Moncrieff]], to study the feasibility of Swinton's idea; however, after trials with a Holt 75 h.p. machine the committee concluded in February 1915 that the idea was impractical.\n\n==The Landship Committee==\nWinston Churchill however decided that if the Army wouldn't take up the idea, the [[Royal Navy|Navy]] should proceed independently, even if it were to exceed the limits of his authority. He created the [[Landship Committee]] in February 1915, initially to investigate designs for a massive troop transporter. As a truer picture of front-line conditions was developed the aims of the investigation changed. A requirement was formulated for an armoured vehicle capable of 4&nbsp;mph (6&nbsp;km/h), climbing a 5 feet (1.5 m) high parapet, crossing an 8 feet (2.4 m) wide gap, and armed with machine guns and a light [[artillery]] piece. A similar proposal was working its way through the Army GHQ in France, and in June the Landships Committee was made a joint service venture between the War Office and the Admiralty. The Naval involvement in Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) design had originally come about through the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] Armoured Car Division, the only British unit fielding AFVs in 1914; surprisingly, until the end of the war most experimentation on heavy land vehicles was conducted by Royal Naval Air Service Squadron 20.\n[[Image:Tsar tank.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Tsar tank|Tsar Tank]]]]\n\nAt first, protecting heavy gun tractors with armour appeared the most promising line of development. Alternative early 'big wheel' designs on the lines of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[tsar tank]] of 1915 were soon understood to be impractical. However, adapting the existing [[Holt Company]] caterpillar designs \u2014 the only robust tracked tractors available in 1915 \u2014 into a fighting machine, as France and Germany did, was decided against. While armour and weapon systems were easy to acquire, other existing caterpillar and suspension units were too weak, existing engines were underpowered for the vehicles that the designers had in mind, and trench-crossing ability was poor because of the shortness of the [[wheelbase]]. The [[:File:Killen-Strait.jpg|Killen-Strait tractor]] with three tracks was used for the first experiments in June but was much too small to be developed further. The large [[Bramah Joseph Diplock|Pedrail monotrack]] vehicle was proposed in a number of different configurations, but non were adopted. Trials to couple two American Bullock tractors failed. There also were considerable differences of opinion between the several committee members. Col [[R.E.B. Crompton]], a veteran military engineer and electrical pioneer, drafted numerous designs with [[Lucien Legros]] for armoured troop carrying vehicles and gun-armed vehicles, to have used either Bullock tracks or variants of the Pedrail. At the same time, Lt Robert Macfie, of the RNAS, and Albert Nesfield, an [[Ealing]]-based engineer, devised a number of armoured tracked vehicles, which incorporated an angled front 'climbing face' to the tracks. The two men fell out bitterly as their plans came to nought; Macfie in particular pursued a vendetta against the other members of the Landships Committee after the war.\n\n[[File:Little Willie early design.jpg|left|thumb|Little Willie showing its rear steering wheels]]\nTo resolve the threatened dissipation of effort, it was ordered in late July that a contract was to be placed with [[William Foster & Co. Ltd]], a company having done some prewar design work on heavy tractors and known to Churchill from an earlier experiment with a trench-crossing supply vehicle, to produce a proof-of-concept vehicle with two tracks, based on a lengthened Bullock tractor chassis. Construction work began three weeks later.\n[[Image:British Mark I male tank Somme 25 September 1916.jpg|thumb|right|A Mark I tank, moving from left to right. The rhomboidal shape allowed it to climb parapets and cross trenches. Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]].]]\n\n[[William Foster & Co.|Fosters of Lincoln]] built the 14 ton \"[[Little Willie]]\", which first ran on 8 September. Powered by a 105&nbsp;hp (78&nbsp;kW) Daimler engine, the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} armoured box was initially fitted with a low Bullock caterpillar. A rotating top [[gun turret|turret]] was planned with a 40&nbsp;mm gun but abandoned due to weight problems, leaving the final vehicle unarmed and little more than a test-bed for the difficult track system. Difficulties with the commercial tracks supplied led to Tritton designing a completely new track system different from, and vastly more robust than, any other system then in use. The next design by Lieutenant [[Walter Gordon Wilson]] RNAS, a pre-war motor engineer, added a larger track frame to the hull of \"Little Willie\". In order to achieve the demanded gap clearance a rhomboidal shape was chosen&mdash;stretching the form to improve the track footprint and climbing capacity. To keep a low centre of gravity the rotating turret design was dropped in favour of [[sponson]]s on the sides of the hull fitted with naval [[6-pounder]] (57&nbsp;mm) guns. A final specification was agreed on in late September for trials in early 1916, and the resulting 30 ton \"Big Willie\" (later called \"Mother\") together with \"Little Willie\" underwent trials at [[Hatfield House#Gardens|Hatfield Park]] on 29 January and 2 February. Attendees at the second trial included [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], [[Reginald McKenna]] and other political luminaries. On 12 February an initial order for 100 \"Mother\" type vehicles was made, later expanded to 150.\n\nCrews never called tanks \"Willies\"; at first they referred to them as \"landships\", and later informally \"buses\".{{r|Littledale1918}} Although ''landship'' was a natural term coming from an Admiralty committee, it was considered too descriptive and could give away British intentions. The committee, therefore, looked for an appropriate code term for the vehicles. Factory workers assembling the vehicles had been told they were producing \"mobile water tanks\" for desert warfare in [[Mesopotamia]]. ''Water Container'' was therefore considered but rejected because the committee would inevitably be known as the WC Committee (WC meaning ''water closet'' was a common British term for a [[Flush toilet|toilet]]). The term ''tank'', as in water tank, was in December 1915 finally accepted as its official designation. From then on, the term \"tank\" was established among British and also German soldiers. While in German ''Tank'' specifically refers to the World War I type (as opposed to modern ''Panzer''), in English, Russian and other languages the name even for contemporary armored vehicles is still based on the word ''tank''.\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S34490, Tankschlacht bei Cambrai.jpg|thumb|left|A captured British tank in German hands destroying a tree]]\n\nIt is sometimes mistakenly stated that, after completion, the tanks were shipped to France in large wooden crates. For secrecy and in order to not arouse any curiosity, the crates and the tanks themselves were then each labeled with a destination in Russian, \"With Care to [[Petrograd]]\". In fact, the tanks were never shipped in crates: the inscription in Russian was applied on the hull for their transport from the factory to the first training centre at Thetford.\n\nThe first fifty had been delivered to France on 30 August. They were 'male' or 'female', depending upon whether their armament comprised two 6-pounder cannon and three [[Hotchkiss M1909 Benet-Mercie machine gun|Hotchkiss machine guns]] or four [[Vickers machine gun]]s and one Hotchkiss. It had a crew of eight, four of whom were needed to handle the steering and drive gears. The tanks were capable of, at best, 6&nbsp; km/h (4&nbsp; mph), matching the speed of marching [[infantry]] with whom they were to be integrated to aid in the destruction of enemy machine guns. In practice, their speed on the broken ground could be as little as 1&nbsp; mph.\n\nAfter the war the ''Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors'' decided that the principal inventors of the Tank were [[Sir William Tritton]], managing director of Fosters, and Major Walter Gordon Wilson.  Fosters returned to manufacturing [[Traction engines]] and steam lorries, but incorporated a small trademark outline image of a tank on the front smokebox door of their postwar road locomotives.  During WWII, Tritton and Wilson were called upon to design a [[Heavy tank]], which was known as [[TOG1]], (named for \"The Old Gang\"), but this was not a success.  However [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] City erected a full-size outline Mk 1 as a memorial to the invention of the tank in 2015, and placed it on the Tritton Road roundabout.  .\n\n==First Deployments==\n[[Image:Schneider CA1 (M16) tank.jpg|thumb|The [[Schneider CA1]], the first [[France|French]] [[tank]]]]\n\nThe first use of tanks on the battlefield was the use of British [[British Heavy Tanks of World War I#Mark I|Mark I tanks]] at the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] (part of the [[Battle of the Somme]]) on 15 September 1916, with mixed results; many broke down, but nearly a third succeeded in breaking through. Of the forty-nine tanks shipped to the Somme, only thirty-two were able to begin the first attack in which they were used and only nine made it across \"no man's land\" to the German lines. The tanks had been rushed into combat before the design was mature enough (against Churchill's and [[Ernest Dunlop Swinton|Ernest Swinton]]'s wishes)<ref>\"Sensing that tanks would only be effective if they involved an element of surprise, he pressed the government not to use them in small numbers in the Battle of the Somme. As he had put it in a memorandum in 1915, 'None should be used until all can be used at once'. Despite his objections, thirty-five (sic) tanks were used in September 1916, but to very little effect. 'My poor \"land battleships\" have been let off prematurely and on a petty scale,' he wrote.\" Havardi, J. The Greatest Briton: Essays on Winston Churchill's Life and Political Philosophy. Shepheard-Walwyn, 2010. {{ISBN|0856832650}}</ref> and the number was small but their use gave important feedback on how to design newer tanks, the soundness of the concept, and their potential to affect the course of the war. On the other hand, the French Army was critical of the British employment of small numbers of tanks at this battle. They felt the British had sacrificed the secrecy of the weapon while employing it in numbers too small to be decisive. Considering that the British attack was part of an Anglo-French offensive while the Russians were also attacking at the same time, Haig felt justified in making a maximum effort, regardless of the limitations of the tank force.\n\nThe Mark Is were capable of performing on the real battlefield of World War I, one of the most difficult battlefield terrains ever. They did have reliability problems, but when they were working they could cross trenches or craters of 9 feet (2.7 m) and drive right through barbed wire. It was still common for them to get stuck, especially in larger bomb craters, but overall the rhomboid shape allowed for extreme terrain mobility.\n\n[[Image:Splatter Mask (WWI).jpg|thumb|right|Splatter mask used by tank crews in World War One]]\n\nTank crews who had read press reports depicting the new weapon driving through buildings and trees, and crossing wide rivers, were disappointed.{{r|Littledale1918}} Most World War I tanks could travel only at about a walking pace at best. Their steel armour could stop small arms fire and fragments from high-explosive artillery shells. However they were vulnerable to a direct hit from artillery and mortar shells. The environment inside was extremely unpleasant; as ventilation was inadequate the atmosphere was heavy with poisonous [[carbon monoxide]] from the engine and firing the weapons, fuel and oil vapours from the engine and [[cordite]] fumes from the weapons. Temperatures inside could reach 50[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] (122[[Fahrenheit|\u00b0F]]). Entire crews lost consciousness inside the tanks, or collapsed when again exposed to fresh air.<ref>Macpherson WG, Herringham WP, Elliot TR, Balfour A.

Fragments were not as dangerous as fire, because of explosive fumes and the large amount of fuel aboard; smoking was prohibited inside and within 20 yards outside tanks.{{r|Littledale1918}} [[Gas masks]] were also standard issue, as they were to all soldiers at this point in the war due to the use of [[chemical warfare]]. The side armour of 8&nbsp;mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing [[K bullet]]s. There was also the danger of being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed a larger purpose-made [[Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr|anti-tank rifle]], the [[3.7 cm TAK 1918]] anti-tank gun, and also a ''Geballte Ladung'' (\"Bunched Charge\")\u2014several regular stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.\n\nEngine power was a primary limitation on the tanks; the roughly one hundred horsepower engines gave a power-to-weight ratio of 3.3&nbsp;hp/ton (2.5&nbsp;kW/ton). By the end of the 20th century, power-to-weight ratios exceeded 20&nbsp;hp/ton (15&nbsp;kW/ton).\n\nMany feel that because the British Commander [[Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] was himself a horse cavalryman, his command failed to appreciate the value of tanks. In fact, [[cavalry|horse cavalry]] doctrine in World War I was to \"follow up a breakthrough with harassing attacks in the rear\", but there were no breakthroughs on the Western Front until the tanks came along. Despite these supposed views of Haig, he made an order for 1,000 tanks shortly after the failure at the Somme and always remained firmly in favour of further production.\n\nIn 1919, Major General Sir Louis Jackson said: \"The tank was a freak. The circumstances which called it into existence were exceptional and not likely to recur. If they do, they can be dealt with by other means.\"<ref>Military Blunders, page 152</ref>\n\n==French developments==\n[[Image:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|left|Renault FT tanks being operated by the US Army in France. Light tanks with a crew of only two, these were mass-produced during World War I.]]\n\nFrance at the same time developed its own tracked AFVs, but the situation there was very different. In Britain a single committee had coordinated design, and had to overcome the initial resistance of the Army, while the major industries remained passive. Almost all production effort was thus concentrated into the Mark I and its direct successors, all very similar in shape. In France, on the other hand, there were multiple and conflicting lines of development which were badly integrated, resulting in three major and quite disparate production types. A major arms producer, Schneider, took the lead in January 1915 and tried to build a first armoured vehicle based on the ''Baby Holt'' tractor but initially the development process was slow until in July they received political, even presidential, support by combining their project with that of a mechanical wire cutter devised by engineer and politician Jean-Louis Br\u00e9ton. In December 1915, the influential Colonel Estienne made the Supreme Command very enthusiastic about the idea of creating an armoured force based on these vehicles; strong Army support for tanks was a constant during the decades that followed. Already in January and February 1916 quite substantial orders were made, at that moment with a total number of 800 much larger than the British ones.\n[[Image:St. Chamond.jpg|thumb|right|French Saint-Chamond tanks had long bodies with a lot of the vehicle projecting forward off of the short caterpillar tracks, making them more liable to get ditched in trenches.]]\n\nArmy enthusiasm and haste had its immediate drawbacks however. As a result of the involvement of inexperienced army officers ordered to devise a new tank based on the larger 75&nbsp;hp Holt chassis in a very short period of time, the first French tanks were poorly designed with respect to the need to cross trenches and did not take the sponson-mounting route of the British tanks. The first, the ''Char'' [[Schneider CA1|Schneider CA]] equipped with a short 75&nbsp;mm howitzer, had poor mobility due to a short track length combined with a hull that overhung front and rear. It was unreliable as well; a maximum of only about 130 of the 400 built were ever operational at the same time. Then industrial rivalry began to play a detrimental role: it created the heavy [[St Chamond (tank)|Char St Chamond]], a parallel development not ordered by the Army but approved by government through industrial lobby, which mounted much more impressive weaponry \u2014 its 75&nbsp;mm was the most powerful gun fielded by any operational tank up till 1941 \u2014 but also combined many of the Schneider CA's faults with an even larger overhanging body. Its innovative petro-electrical transmission, while allowing for easy steering, was insufficiently developed and led to a large number of breakdowns.\n[[Image:Renault-FT17-Saumur.0004gw9y.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Renault FT]], the first \"modern\" tank]]\nBut industrial initiative also led to swift advances. The car industry, already used to vehicle mass production and having much more experience in vehicle layout, in 1916 designed the first practical light tanks, a class largely neglected by the British. It was [[Renault]]'s excellent small tank design, the [[Renault FT|FT]], incorporating a proper climbing face for the tracks, that was the first tank to incorporate a top-mounted turret with a full 360\u00b0 traverse capability. In fact the FT was in many respects the first truly 'modern' tank having a layout that has been followed by almost all designs ever since: driver at the front; main armament in a fully rotating turret on top; engine at the rear. Previous models had been \"box tanks\", with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room, fighting compartment, ammunition stock and driver's cabin. (A very similar Peugeot prototype, with a fixed casemate mounting a short 75mm cannon, was trialled in 1918 but the idea was not pursued). The FT had the largest production run of any tank of the war, with over 3700 built, more numerous than all British tanks combined. That this would happen was at first far from certain; some in the French army lobbied for the alternative mass production of super-heavy tanks. Much design effort was put in this line of development resulting in the gigantic [[Char 2C]], the most complex and technologically advanced tank of its day. Its very complexity ensured it being produced too late to participate in World War I and in the very small number of just ten, but it was the first tank with a three-man turret; the heaviest to enter service until late in World War II and still the largest ever operational.\n\nFrench production at first lagged behind the British. After August 1916 however, British tank manufacture was temporarily halted to wait for better designs, allowing the French to overtake their allies in numbers. When the French used tanks for the first time on 16 April 1917, during the [[Nivelle Offensive]], they had four times more tanks available. But that did not last long as the offensive was a major failure; the Schneiders were badly deployed and suffered 50% losses from German long-range artillery. The Saint-Chamond tanks, first deployed on 5 May, proved to be so badly designed that they were unable to cross the first line of German trenches.\n\n==German developments==\nGermany concentrated more on the development of anti-tank weapons than on development of tanks themselves. They only developed one type of tank which saw combat in the war. The [[A7V]] ''Sturmpanzerwagen'' was designed in 1917 and was used in battle from March 1918. It was manned by a crew of 18, and had eight machine guns and a 57mm cannon. Only 20 A7Vs were produced during the war. The Germans did, however, capture Allied tanks and repurpose them for their own uses.\n\n==Battle of Cambrai==\n[[Image:Canadian troops on Arras- Cambrai road-1918.jpg|thumb|British-operated FT tank attached to Canadian troops]]\n\nThe first battle in which tanks made a great impact was the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in 1917. British Colonel [[J.F.C. Fuller]], chief of staff of the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]], was responsible for the tanks' role in the battle. They made an unprecedented breakthrough but, as ever on the Western front, the opportunity was not exploited. Ironically, it was the soon-to-be-supplanted horse cavalry that had been assigned the task of following up the motorised tank attack.<ref>A.J. Smithers, ''Cambrai: The First Great Tank Battle'' (2014)</ref>\n\nTanks became more effective as the lesson of the early tanks was absorbed. The British produced the [[Mark I tank#Mark IV|Mark IV]] in 1917. Similar to the early Marks in appearance, its construction was considered to produce a more reliable machine, the long-barrelled naval guns were shortened (the barrels of the earlier, longer guns were prone to digging in the mud when negotiating obstacles) and armour was increased just enough to defeat the standard German armour-piercing bullet.\n\nThe continued need for four men to drive the tank was solved with the [[Mark I tank#Mark V series|Mark V]] which used Wilson's epicyclic gearing in 1918. Also in 1918 the French produced the [[Renault]] [[Renault FT|FT]], the result of a co-operation between Estienne and Louis Renault. As mentioned before, it had the innovative turret position, and was operated by two men. At just 8 tons it was half the weight of the Medium A ''[[Whippet (tank)|Whippet]]'' but the version with the cannon had more firepower. It was conceived for mass production, and the FT became the most produced tank of World War I by a wide margin, with over 3,000 delivered to the French Army.  Large numbers were used by the Americans and several were also lent to the British.\n\nIn July 1918, the French used 480 tanks (mostly FTs) at the [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Battle of Soissons]], and there were even larger assaults planned for the next year. In [[Plan 1919]], the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] hoped to commit over 30,000 tanks to battle in that year.\n\n[[File:Mark-a-whippet-tank.jpg|thumb|Whippet Tank]]\n\n==Whippet==\n\nFinally, in a preview of later developments, the British developed the [[Medium Mark A Whippet|Whippet]]. This tank was specifically designed to exploit breaches in the enemy front with its relatively higher speed (around 8&nbsp;mph vs 3-4&nbsp;mph for the British heavy tanks). The Whippet was faster than most other tanks, although it carried only machine gun armament, meaning it was not suited to combat with armoured vehicles but instead with infantry. Postwar tank designs reflected this trend towards greater tactical mobility.\n\n==Villers-Bretonneux: Tank against tank==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P1013-316, Westfront, deutscher Panzer in Roye.jpg|thumb|left|German A7V tank at [[Roye, Somme|Roye]] on March 21, 1918.]]\n{{Main|Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux}}\nThe German General Staff did not have enthusiasm for the tanks, but allowed the development of anti-tank weapons. Regardless, development of a German tank was under way. The only project to be produced and fielded was the [[A7V]], although only twenty were built. The majority of the fifty or so tanks fielded by Germany were captured British vehicles. A7Vs were captured by the Allies, but they were not used, and most ended up being scrapped.\n\nThe first tank-versus-tank battles took place 24 April 1918. It was an unexpected engagement between three German A7Vs and three British Mk. IVs at Villers-Bretonneux.\n\n[[J.F.C. Fuller|Fuller]]'s [[Plan 1919]], involving massive use of tanks for an offensive, was never used because the [[blockade]] of Germany and the entry of the US brought an end to the war.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Tanks}}\n\n* [[History of tanks]]\n* [[Comparison of World War I tanks]]\n* [[Tanks of the interwar period]]\n* [[Tanks in World War II]]\n* [[Comparison of early World War II tanks]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n*Glanfield, John (2001) ''Devil's Chariots: the birth and secret battles of the first tanks''.

Although vehicles that incorporated the basic principles of the tank (armour, firepower, and all-terrain mobility) had been projected in the decade or so before the War, it was the alarmingly heavy casualties of the start of its [[trench warfare]] that stimulated development.<ref>Williamson Murray, \"Armored Warfare: The British, French, and German Experiences,\" in {{cite book |title= Military Innovation in the Interwar Period|edition=|editor1-first= Williamson|editor1-last= Murray|editor2-first= Allan R|editor2-last= Millet |year= 1996|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= New York|isbn= 0-521-63760-0|page= 6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah4cfjAHMm0C&pg=PA381|title=Collision of Empires: Britain in Three World Wars, 1793-1945|first=A.

Whilst the Allies manufactured several thousand tanks during the war, Germany deployed only 20 of its own.<ref>Showalter, D.E. \"More Than Nuts And Bolts: Technology And The German Army, 1870\u20131945.\" ''Historian'' 65.1 (Fall 2002): 123\u2013143.

There were problems that caused considerable attrition rates during [[armoured warfare|combat]] deployment and transit. The heavily shelled terrain was impassable to conventional vehicles, and only highly mobile tanks such as the Mark IV and [[FT-17|FT]]s performed reasonably well. The Mark I's [[rhomboid]] shape, caterpillar tracks, and {{convert|26|ft|m|adj=on|0}} length meant that it could negotiate obstacles, especially wide trenches, that wheeled vehicles could not.\nAlong with the tank, the first [[self-propelled gun]] (the British [[Gun Carrier Mark I|Gun Carrier Mk I]]) and the first [[armoured personnel carrier]] (the British [[Mark IX tank|Mk IX]]) were constructed in World War I.\n\n==Conceptual roots of the tank==\n{{See also|History of the tank}}\n[[Image:German photo with English Tank.jpg|thumb|left|Mark 3II; tank no. 799 captured near Arras on 11 April 1917]]\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S12137, Westfront, bei Cambrai erbeuteter Panzer.jpg|thumb|A German-captured British tank in 1917]]\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P1013-313, Westfront, erbeutete englische Tanks.jpg|thumb|1917: British tanks captured by the Germans being transported by rail]]\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R28717, Frankreich, deutsche Panzerschwadron.jpg|thumb|right|[[Germany|German]] forces using captured British Mark IVs during the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]]]\n\nThe conceptual roots of the tank go back to ancient times, with siege engines which were able to provide protection for troops moving up against stone walls or other fortifications. With the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the demonstrable power of [[steam power|steam]], James Cowan presented a proposal for a Steam Powered Land Ram in 1855, towards the end of the [[Crimean War]]. Looking like a helmet on 'footed' Boydell wheels, early forerunners of the [[Pedrail wheel]], it was essentially an armoured steam tractor equipped with [[cannon]] and rotating [[scythe]]s sprouting from the sides. [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] is said to have dismissed it as 'barbaric'.\n\n[[File:Hornsby.jpg|thumb|left|Hornsby tractor]]\n[[File:Artillery tractor in France Vosges Spring 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Artillery tractors (here a [[Benjamin Holt|Holt]] tractor) were in use in the French Army in 1914-1915. Here, in the [[Vosges]], spring 1915]]\n\nFrom 1904 to 1909, David Roberts, the engineer and [[managing director]] of [[Hornsby & Sons]] of [[Grantham]], built a series of [[tractor]]s using his patented 'chain-track' which were put through their paces by the [[British Army]], a (small) section of which wanted to evaluate [[artillery tractor]]s. At one point in 1908,  Major William E. Donohue of the Mechanical Transport Committee remarked to Roberts that he should design a new machine with armour, capable of carrying its own gun. But, disheartened by years of ultimately fruitless tinkering for the Army, Roberts did not take up the idea. In later years he expressed regret at not having pursued it.<ref>The Devil's Chariots: The Birth and Secret Battles of the First Tanks. John Glanfield (Sutton Publishing, 2001) p16</ref>\n\nAn engineer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Lieutenant [[Gunther Burstyn]], inspired by [[Holt Company|Holt]] tractors, designed a tracked armoured vehicle in 1911 carrying a light gun in a rotating turret; equipped also with hinged 'arms', two in front and two at the rear, carrying wheels on the ends to assist with obstacles and trenches, it was a very forward-looking design, if rather small. The [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian government]] said it would be interested in evaluating it if Burstyn could secure commercial backing to produce a prototype. Lacking the requisite contacts, he let it drop. An approach to the German government was similarly fruitless.\n\nIn 1912, a [[South Australia]]n, [[Lancelot De Mole]], submitted a proposal to the British [[War Office]] for a \"chain-rail vehicle which could be easily steered and carry heavy loads over rough ground and trenches\". De Mole made more proposals to the War Office in 1914 and 1916, with a culminating proposal in late 1917, accompanied by a huge one-eighth scale model, yet all fell on substantially deaf ears. De Mole's proposal already had the climbing face, so typical of the later World War I British tanks, but it is unknown whether there was some connection. Inquiries to the government of [[Australia]], after the war, yielded polite responses that Mr. De Mole's ideas had unfortunately been too advanced for the time to be properly recognised at their just value. The Commission on Awards to Inventors in 1919, which adjudicated all the competing claims to the development of the tank, recognised the brilliance of De Mole's design, even considering that it was superior to the machines actually developed, but due to its narrow remit, could only make a payment of \u00a3987 to De Mole to cover his expenses. De Mole noted in 1919 that he was urged by friends before the war to approach the Germans with his design, but declined to do so for patriotic reasons. [[File:Charron Girardot Voigt 1902.jpg|thumb|French armored car: the [[Charron-Girardot-Voigt 1902]]]]\n\nBefore [[World War I]], motorized vehicles were still relatively uncommon, and their use on the battlefield was initially limited, especially of heavier vehicles. [[Armored car (military)|Armoured car]]s soon became more commonplace with most belligerents, especially in more open terrain. On August 23, 1914, the French Colonel [[Jean Baptiste Eug\u00e8ne Estienne]], later a major proponent of tanks, declared: ''Messieurs, la victoire appartiendra dans cette guerre \u00e0 celui des deux bellig\u00e9rants qui parviendra le premier \u00e0 placer un canon de 75 sur une voiture capable de se mouvoir en tout terrain'' (\"Gentlemen, the victory will belong, in this war, to the one of the two belligerents who will be the first to succeed in mounting a 75 mm gun on a vehicle capable of moving in all types of terrain\").\n\nArmored cars did indeed prove useful in open land such as in deserts, but were not very good at crossing obstacles (e.g. trenches, barriers) or in more challenging terrain. The other issue was that it was very hard to add much protection or armament.\n\nThe main limitation was the wheels, which gave a high [[ground pressure]] for the vehicle's weight. This could be solved by adding more wheels, but unless they also were driven, the effect was to reduce traction on the powered wheels. Driving extra wheels meant more drive train weight, in turn requiring a larger and heavier engine to maintain performance. Even worse, none of this extra weight was put into an improvement of armor or armament carried, and the vehicles were still incapable of crossing very rough terrain.\n\nThe adoption of [[caterpillar track]]s offered a new solution to the problem. The tracks spread the weight of the vehicles over a much greater area, which was all used for traction to move the vehicle. The limitation on armor and firepower was no longer ground pressure but the power and weight of the power-plant.\n\n[[Image:Swinton-holt-stockton-1918.jpg|thumb|left|Swinton (now [[Colonel]]) with [[Benjamin Holt]] in [[Stockton, California]], relaying gratitude to the inventor for his company's contribution to the war effort]]\n\nThe remaining issue was how to utilise and configure a vehicle.  Major [[Ernest Dunlop Swinton]] [[Royal Engineers|RE]], was the official British war correspondent serving in France in 1914. He recounts in his book ''Eyewitness'' how the idea of using caterpillar tracks to drive an armoured fighting vehicle came to him on October 19, 1914, while he was driving through northern France. In July 1914 he had received a letter from a friend, Hugh Marriott, a mining engineer, drawing his attention to a [[Holt tractor|Holt caterpillar tractor]] that Marriott had seen in Belgium. Marriott thought it might be useful for transport over difficult ground, and Swinton had passed the information on to the appropriate departments. Now Swinton suggested the idea of an armoured tracked vehicle to the military authorities, by sending a proposal to Lieutenant-Colonel [[Maurice Hankey]]. Hankey in turn tried to interest [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in the idea; when this failed he sent a memorandum in December to the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]], of which he was himself the secretary; [[Winston Churchill]] the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] was one of the members of the committee. Hankey proposed to build a gigantic steel roller, pushed by tracked tractors, to shield the advancing infantry. Churchill in turn wrote a note on January 5 to the Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]], in which he warned that the Germans might any moment introduce a comparable system. A worried Asquith now ordered Kitchener to form a committee, headed by [[General Scott-Moncrieff]], to study the feasibility of Swinton's idea; however, after trials with a Holt 75 h.p. machine the committee concluded in February 1915 that the idea was impractical.\n\n==The Landship Committee==\nWinston Churchill however decided that if the Army wouldn't take up the idea, the [[Royal Navy|Navy]] should proceed independently, even if it were to exceed the limits of his authority. He created the [[Landship Committee]] in February 1915, initially to investigate designs for a massive troop transporter. As a truer picture of front-line conditions was developed the aims of the investigation changed. A requirement was formulated for an armoured vehicle capable of 4&nbsp;mph (6&nbsp;km/h), climbing a 5 feet (1.5 m) high parapet, crossing an 8 feet (2.4 m) wide gap, and armed with machine guns and a light [[artillery]] piece. A similar proposal was working its way through the Army GHQ in France, and in June the Landships Committee was made a joint service venture between the War Office and the Admiralty. The Naval involvement in Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) design had originally come about through the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] Armoured Car Division, the only British unit fielding AFVs in 1914; surprisingly, until the end of the war most experimentation on heavy land vehicles was conducted by Royal Naval Air Service Squadron 20.\n[[Image:Tsar tank.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Tsar tank|Tsar Tank]]]]\n\nAt first, protecting heavy gun tractors with armour appeared the most promising line of development. Alternative early 'big wheel' designs on the lines of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[tsar tank]] of 1915 were soon understood to be impractical. However, adapting the existing [[Holt Company]] caterpillar designs \u2014 the only robust tracked tractors available in 1915 \u2014 into a fighting machine, as France and Germany did, was decided against. While armour and weapon systems were easy to acquire, other existing caterpillar and suspension units were too weak, existing engines were underpowered for the vehicles that the designers had in mind, and trench-crossing ability was poor because of the shortness of the [[wheelbase]]. The [[:File:Killen-Strait.jpg|Killen-Strait tractor]] with three tracks was used for the first experiments in June but was much too small to be developed further. The large [[Bramah Joseph Diplock|Pedrail monotrack]] vehicle was proposed in a number of different configurations, but non were adopted. Trials to couple two American Bullock tractors failed. There also were considerable differences of opinion between the several committee members. Col [[R.E.B. Crompton]], a veteran military engineer and electrical pioneer, drafted numerous designs with [[Lucien Legros]] for armoured troop carrying vehicles and gun-armed vehicles, to have used either Bullock tracks or variants of the Pedrail. At the same time, Lt Robert Macfie, of the RNAS, and Albert Nesfield, an [[Ealing]]-based engineer, devised a number of armoured tracked vehicles, which incorporated an angled front 'climbing face' to the tracks. The two men fell out bitterly as their plans came to nought; Macfie in particular pursued a vendetta against the other members of the Landships Committee after the war.\n\n[[File:Little Willie early design.jpg|left|thumb|Little Willie showing its rear steering wheels]]\nTo resolve the threatened dissipation of effort, it was ordered in late July that a contract was to be placed with [[William Foster & Co. Ltd]], a company having done some prewar design work on heavy tractors and known to Churchill from an earlier experiment with a trench-crossing supply vehicle, to produce a proof-of-concept vehicle with two tracks, based on a lengthened Bullock tractor chassis. Construction work began three weeks later.\n[[Image:British Mark I male tank Somme 25 September 1916.jpg|thumb|right|A Mark I tank, moving from left to right. The rhomboidal shape allowed it to climb parapets and cross trenches. Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]].]]\n\n[[William Foster & Co.|Fosters of Lincoln]] built the 14 ton \"[[Little Willie]]\", which first ran on 8 September. Powered by a 105&nbsp;hp (78&nbsp;kW) Daimler engine, the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} armoured box was initially fitted with a low Bullock caterpillar. A rotating top [[gun turret|turret]] was planned with a 40&nbsp;mm gun but abandoned due to weight problems, leaving the final vehicle unarmed and little more than a test-bed for the difficult track system. Difficulties with the commercial tracks supplied led to Tritton designing a completely new track system different from, and vastly more robust than, any other system then in use. The next design by Lieutenant [[Walter Gordon Wilson]] RNAS, a pre-war motor engineer, added a larger track frame to the hull of \"Little Willie\". In order to achieve the demanded gap clearance a rhomboidal shape was chosen&mdash;stretching the form to improve the track footprint and climbing capacity. To keep a low centre of gravity the rotating turret design was dropped in favour of [[sponson]]s on the sides of the hull fitted with naval [[6-pounder]] (57&nbsp;mm) guns. A final specification was agreed on in late September for trials in early 1916, and the resulting 30 ton \"Big Willie\" (later called \"Mother\") together with \"Little Willie\" underwent trials at [[Hatfield House#Gardens|Hatfield Park]] on 29 January and 2 February. Attendees at the second trial included [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], [[Reginald McKenna]] and other political luminaries. On 12 February an initial order for 100 \"Mother\" type vehicles was made, later expanded to 150.\n\nCrews never called tanks \"Willies\"; at first they referred to them as \"landships\", and later informally \"buses\".{{r|Littledale1918}} Although ''landship'' was a natural term coming from an Admiralty committee, it was considered too descriptive and could give away British intentions. The committee, therefore, looked for an appropriate code term for the vehicles. Factory workers assembling the vehicles had been told they were producing \"mobile water tanks\" for desert warfare in [[Mesopotamia]]. ''Water Container'' was therefore considered but rejected because the committee would inevitably be known as the WC Committee (WC meaning ''water closet'' was a common British term for a [[Flush toilet|toilet]]). The term ''tank'', as in water tank, was in December 1915 finally accepted as its official designation. From then on, the term \"tank\" was established among British and also German soldiers. While in German ''Tank'' specifically refers to the World War I type (as opposed to modern ''Panzer''), in English, Russian and other languages the name even for contemporary armored vehicles is still based on the word ''tank''.\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S34490, Tankschlacht bei Cambrai.jpg|thumb|left|A captured British tank in German hands destroying a tree]]\n\nIt is sometimes mistakenly stated that, after completion, the tanks were shipped to France in large wooden crates. For secrecy and in order to not arouse any curiosity, the crates and the tanks themselves were then each labeled with a destination in Russian, \"With Care to [[Petrograd]]\". In fact, the tanks were never shipped in crates: the inscription in Russian was applied on the hull for their transport from the factory to the first training centre at Thetford.\n\nThe first fifty had been delivered to France on 30 August. They were 'male' or 'female', depending upon whether their armament comprised two 6-pounder cannon and three [[Hotchkiss M1909 Benet-Mercie machine gun|Hotchkiss machine guns]] or four [[Vickers machine gun]]s and one Hotchkiss. It had a crew of eight, four of whom were needed to handle the steering and drive gears. The tanks were capable of, at best, 6&nbsp; km/h (4&nbsp; mph), matching the speed of marching [[infantry]] with whom they were to be integrated to aid in the destruction of enemy machine guns. In practice, their speed on the broken ground could be as little as 1&nbsp; mph.\n\nAfter the war the ''Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors'' decided that the principal inventors of the Tank were [[Sir William Tritton]], managing director of Fosters, and Major Walter Gordon Wilson.  Fosters returned to manufacturing [[Traction engines]] and steam lorries, but incorporated a small trademark outline image of a tank on the front smokebox door of their postwar road locomotives.  During WWII, Tritton and Wilson were called upon to design a [[Heavy tank]], which was known as [[TOG1]], (named for \"The Old Gang\"), but this was not a success.  However [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] City erected a full-size outline Mk 1 as a memorial to the invention of the tank in 2015, and placed it on the Tritton Road roundabout.  .\n\n==First Deployments==\n[[Image:Schneider CA1 (M16) tank.jpg|thumb|The [[Schneider CA1]], the first [[France|French]] [[tank]]]]\n\nThe first use of tanks on the battlefield was the use of British [[British Heavy Tanks of World War I#Mark I|Mark I tanks]] at the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] (part of the [[Battle of the Somme]]) on 15 September 1916, with mixed results; many broke down, but nearly a third succeeded in breaking through. Of the forty-nine tanks shipped to the Somme, only thirty-two were able to begin the first attack in which they were used and only nine made it across \"no man's land\" to the German lines. The tanks had been rushed into combat before the design was mature enough (against Churchill's and [[Ernest Dunlop Swinton|Ernest Swinton]]'s wishes)<ref>\"Sensing that tanks would only be effective if they involved an element of surprise, he pressed the government not to use them in small numbers in the Battle of the Somme. As he had put it in a memorandum in 1915, 'None should be used until all can be used at once'. Despite his objections, thirty-five (sic) tanks were used in September 1916, but to very little effect. 'My poor \"land battleships\" have been let off prematurely and on a petty scale,' he wrote.\" Havardi, J. The Greatest Briton: Essays on Winston Churchill's Life and Political Philosophy. Shepheard-Walwyn, 2010. {{ISBN|0856832650}}</ref> and the number was small but their use gave important feedback on how to design newer tanks, the soundness of the concept, and their potential to affect the course of the war. On the other hand, the French Army was critical of the British employment of small numbers of tanks at this battle. They felt the British had sacrificed the secrecy of the weapon while employing it in numbers too small to be decisive. Considering that the British attack was part of an Anglo-French offensive while the Russians were also attacking at the same time, Haig felt justified in making a maximum effort, regardless of the limitations of the tank force.\n\nThe Mark Is were capable of performing on the real battlefield of World War I, one of the most difficult battlefield terrains ever. They did have reliability problems, but when they were working they could cross trenches or craters of 9 feet (2.7 m) and drive right through barbed wire. It was still common for them to get stuck, especially in larger bomb craters, but overall the rhomboid shape allowed for extreme terrain mobility.\n\n[[Image:Splatter Mask (WWI).jpg|thumb|right|Splatter mask used by tank crews in World War One]]\n\nTank crews who had read press reports depicting the new weapon driving through buildings and trees, and crossing wide rivers, were disappointed.{{r|Littledale1918}} Most World War I tanks could travel only at about a walking pace at best. Their steel armour could stop small arms fire and fragments from high-explosive artillery shells. However they were vulnerable to a direct hit from artillery and mortar shells. The environment inside was extremely unpleasant; as ventilation was inadequate the atmosphere was heavy with poisonous [[carbon monoxide]] from the engine and firing the weapons, fuel and oil vapours from the engine and [[cordite]] fumes from the weapons.

Fragments were not as dangerous as fire, because of explosive fumes and the large amount of fuel aboard; smoking was prohibited inside and within 20 yards outside tanks.{{r|Littledale1918}} [[Gas masks]] were also standard issue, as they were to all soldiers at this point in the war due to the use of [[chemical warfare]]. The side armour of 8&nbsp;mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing [[K bullet]]s. There was also the danger of being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed a larger purpose-made [[Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr|anti-tank rifle]], the [[3.7 cm TAK 1918]] anti-tank gun, and also a ''Geballte Ladung'' (\"Bunched Charge\")\u2014several regular stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.\n\nEngine power was a primary limitation on the tanks; the roughly one hundred horsepower engines gave a power-to-weight ratio of 3.3&nbsp;hp/ton (2.5&nbsp;kW/ton). By the end of the 20th century, power-to-weight ratios exceeded 20&nbsp;hp/ton (15&nbsp;kW/ton).\n\nMany feel that because the British Commander [[Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] was himself a horse cavalryman, his command failed to appreciate the value of tanks. In fact, [[cavalry|horse cavalry]] doctrine in World War I was to \"follow up a breakthrough with harassing attacks in the rear\", but there were no breakthroughs on the Western Front until the tanks came along. Despite these supposed views of Haig, he made an order for 1,000 tanks shortly after the failure at the Somme and always remained firmly in favour of further production.\n\nIn 1919, Major General Sir Louis Jackson said: \"The tank was a freak. The circumstances which called it into existence were exceptional and not likely to recur. If they do, they can be dealt with by other means.\"<ref>Military Blunders, page 152</ref>\n\n==French developments==\n[[Image:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|left|Renault FT tanks being operated by the US Army in France. Light tanks with a crew of only two, these were mass-produced during World War I.]]\n\nFrance at the same time developed its own tracked AFVs, but the situation there was very different. In Britain a single committee had coordinated design, and had to overcome the initial resistance of the Army, while the major industries remained passive. Almost all production effort was thus concentrated into the Mark I and its direct successors, all very similar in shape. In France, on the other hand, there were multiple and conflicting lines of development which were badly integrated, resulting in three major and quite disparate production types. A major arms producer, Schneider, took the lead in January 1915 and tried to build a first armoured vehicle based on the ''Baby Holt'' tractor but initially the development process was slow until in July they received political, even presidential, support by combining their project with that of a mechanical wire cutter devised by engineer and politician Jean-Louis Br\u00e9ton. In December 1915, the influential Colonel Estienne made the Supreme Command very enthusiastic about the idea of creating an armoured force based on these vehicles; strong Army support for tanks was a constant during the decades that followed. Already in January and February 1916 quite substantial orders were made, at that moment with a total number of 800 much larger than the British ones.\n[[Image:St. Chamond.jpg|thumb|right|French Saint-Chamond tanks had long bodies with a lot of the vehicle projecting forward off of the short caterpillar tracks, making them more liable to get ditched in trenches.]]\n\nArmy enthusiasm and haste had its immediate drawbacks however. As a result of the involvement of inexperienced army officers ordered to devise a new tank based on the larger 75&nbsp;hp Holt chassis in a very short period of time, the first French tanks were poorly designed with respect to the need to cross trenches and did not take the sponson-mounting route of the British tanks. The first, the ''Char'' [[Schneider CA1|Schneider CA]] equipped with a short 75&nbsp;mm howitzer, had poor mobility due to a short track length combined with a hull that overhung front and rear. It was unreliable as well; a maximum of only about 130 of the 400 built were ever operational at the same time. Then industrial rivalry began to play a detrimental role: it created the heavy [[St Chamond (tank)|Char St Chamond]], a parallel development not ordered by the Army but approved by government through industrial lobby, which mounted much more impressive weaponry \u2014 its 75&nbsp;mm was the most powerful gun fielded by any operational tank up till 1941 \u2014 but also combined many of the Schneider CA's faults with an even larger overhanging body. Its innovative petro-electrical transmission, while allowing for easy steering, was insufficiently developed and led to a large number of breakdowns.\n[[Image:Renault-FT17-Saumur.0004gw9y.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Renault FT]], the first \"modern\" tank]]\nBut industrial initiative also led to swift advances. The car industry, already used to vehicle mass production and having much more experience in vehicle layout, in 1916 designed the first practical light tanks, a class largely neglected by the British. It was [[Renault]]'s excellent small tank design, the [[Renault FT|FT]], incorporating a proper climbing face for the tracks, that was the first tank to incorporate a top-mounted turret with a full 360\u00b0 traverse capability. In fact the FT was in many respects the first truly 'modern' tank having a layout that has been followed by almost all designs ever since: driver at the front; main armament in a fully rotating turret on top; engine at the rear. Previous models had been \"box tanks\", with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room, fighting compartment, ammunition stock and driver's cabin. (A very similar Peugeot prototype, with a fixed casemate mounting a short 75mm cannon, was trialled in 1918 but the idea was not pursued). The FT had the largest production run of any tank of the war, with over 3700 built, more numerous than all British tanks combined. That this would happen was at first far from certain; some in the French army lobbied for the alternative mass production of super-heavy tanks. Much design effort was put in this line of development resulting in the gigantic [[Char 2C]], the most complex and technologically advanced tank of its day. Its very complexity ensured it being produced too late to participate in World War I and in the very small number of just ten, but it was the first tank with a three-man turret; the heaviest to enter service until late in World War II and still the largest ever operational.\n\nFrench production at first lagged behind the British. After August 1916 however, British tank manufacture was temporarily halted to wait for better designs, allowing the French to overtake their allies in numbers. When the French used tanks for the first time on 16 April 1917, during the [[Nivelle Offensive]], they had four times more tanks available. But that did not last long as the offensive was a major failure; the Schneiders were badly deployed and suffered 50% losses from German long-range artillery. The Saint-Chamond tanks, first deployed on 5 May, proved to be so badly designed that they were unable to cross the first line of German trenches.\n\n==German developments==\nGermany concentrated more on the development of anti-tank weapons than on development of tanks themselves. They only developed one type of tank which saw combat in the war. The [[A7V]] ''Sturmpanzerwagen'' was designed in 1917 and was used in battle from March 1918. It was manned by a crew of 18, and had eight machine guns and a 57mm cannon. Only 20 A7Vs were produced during the war. The Germans did, however, capture Allied tanks and repurpose them for their own uses.\n\n==Battle of Cambrai==\n[[Image:Canadian troops on Arras- Cambrai road-1918.jpg|thumb|British-operated FT tank attached to Canadian troops]]\n\nThe first battle in which tanks made a great impact was the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in 1917. British Colonel [[J.F.C. Fuller]], chief of staff of the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]], was responsible for the tanks' role in the battle. They made an unprecedented breakthrough but, as ever on the Western front, the opportunity was not exploited. Ironically, it was the soon-to-be-supplanted horse cavalry that had been assigned the task of following up the motorised tank attack.<ref>A.J. Smithers, ''Cambrai: The First Great Tank Battle'' (2014)</ref>\n\nTanks became more effective as the lesson of the early tanks was absorbed. The British produced the [[Mark I tank#Mark IV|Mark IV]] in 1917. Similar to the early Marks in appearance, its construction was considered to produce a more reliable machine, the long-barrelled naval guns were shortened (the barrels of the earlier, longer guns were prone to digging in the mud when negotiating obstacles) and armour was increased just enough to defeat the standard German armour-piercing bullet.\n\nThe continued need for four men to drive the tank was solved with the [[Mark I tank#Mark V series|Mark V]] which used Wilson's epicyclic gearing in 1918. Also in 1918 the French produced the [[Renault]] [[Renault FT|FT]], the result of a co-operation between Estienne and Louis Renault. As mentioned before, it had the innovative turret position, and was operated by two men. At just 8 tons it was half the weight of the Medium A ''[[Whippet (tank)|Whippet]]'' but the version with the cannon had more firepower. It was conceived for mass production, and the FT became the most produced tank of World War I by a wide margin, with over 3,000 delivered to the French Army.  Large numbers were used by the Americans and several were also lent to the British.\n\nIn July 1918, the French used 480 tanks (mostly FTs) at the [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Battle of Soissons]], and there were even larger assaults planned for the next year. In [[Plan 1919]], the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] hoped to commit over 30,000 tanks to battle in that year.\n\n[[File:Mark-a-whippet-tank.jpg|thumb|Whippet Tank]]\n\n==Whippet==\n\nFinally, in a preview of later developments, the British developed the [[Medium Mark A Whippet|Whippet]]. This tank was specifically designed to exploit breaches in the enemy front with its relatively higher speed (around 8&nbsp;mph vs 3-4&nbsp;mph for the British heavy tanks). The Whippet was faster than most other tanks, although it carried only machine gun armament, meaning it was not suited to combat with armoured vehicles but instead with infantry. Postwar tank designs reflected this trend towards greater tactical mobility.\n\n==Villers-Bretonneux: Tank against tank==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P1013-316, Westfront, deutscher Panzer in Roye.jpg|thumb|left|German A7V tank at [[Roye, Somme|Roye]] on March 21, 1918.]]\n{{Main|Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux}}\nThe German General Staff did not have enthusiasm for the tanks, but allowed the development of anti-tank weapons. Regardless, development of a German tank was under way. The only project to be produced and fielded was the [[A7V]], although only twenty were built. The majority of the fifty or so tanks fielded by Germany were captured British vehicles. A7Vs were captured by the Allies, but they were not used, and most ended up being scrapped.\n\nThe first tank-versus-tank battles took place 24 April 1918. It was an unexpected engagement between three German A7Vs and three British Mk. IVs at Villers-Bretonneux.\n\n[[J.F.C. Fuller|Fuller]]'s [[Plan 1919]], involving massive use of tanks for an offensive, was never used because the [[blockade]] of Germany and the entry of the US brought an end to the war.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Tanks}}\n\n* [[History of tanks]]\n* [[Comparison of World War I tanks]]\n* [[Tanks of the interwar period]]\n* [[Tanks in World War II]]\n* [[Comparison of early World War II tanks]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n*Glanfield, John (2001) ''Devil's Chariots: the birth and secret battles of the first tanks''.

Based on the 1980 novel ''[[The Girl in a Swing (novel)|The Girl in a Swing]]'' by [[Richard Adams]], the film is about an English antique dealer who travels to Copenhagen where he meets and falls in love with a mysterious German-born secretary, whom he marries. Knowing nothing about her family or background, he soon discovers a darker side to his new bride.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web|title=The Girl in a Swing |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097435/ |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAlan Desland (Rupert Frazer) is an English antique dealer who specializes in ceramics. A solitary man, he is a bachelor with no romantic ties. On a business trip to Copenhagen, he hires a German-born secretary, Karin Foster (Meg Tilly), to do some clerical work\u2014she is fluent in English, Danish, and German. Alan's attraction to Karin is immediate, and over the coming days, he falls deeply in love with her. Karin is an attractive, sensuous, and mysterious woman who reveals little about herself. Her actions reflect both a quiet sensitivity (crying during a classical concert) and a dispassionate coldness (breaking the neck of an injured seagull). During a conversation about Karin's unmarried friend Inge and her child, Alan makes an offhand comment that he would have trouble marrying a woman with a child\u2014the remark clearly upsets her. Before leaving Copenhagen, Karin expresses her love for Alan, who responds by proposing marriage, and Karin accepts.\n\nAlan returns to England and meets with his mother, who expresses concern that they know very little about Karin's family or background. When Karin arrives, Alan begins to notice her strange behavior\u2014frightened by the sound of children and fearful of the dark. As they prepare for their wedding, Karin states she cannot be married in a church. Karin's playful sensuality, however, overwhelms and enchants Alan. Alan and Karin soon travel to the United States on holiday and get married in a civil ceremony in Florida, where they spend their honeymoon. While swimming in a lake, Karin sees a body beneath the water, but Alan confirms it's only an old log.\n\nWhen Alan and Karin return to England, she continues to captivate him and their entire social circle, engaging in discussions of philosophy and religion. At one dinner party, she asks Alan's best friend and vicar, \"Can anything be forgiven?\" He tells her yes, if a person truly wants to be forgiven. Alan suspects there is something deep and troubling in her\u2014some dark secret or hidden guilt.\n\nOne day at an auction, Karin bids on an odd lot that contains a rare statuette of a girl in a swing. Overjoyed at the find, Alan authenticates the piece at Sotherby's which estimates its value at over \u00a3200,000. He becomes even happier when the initial impotence of his wedding night gives way to an unbridled sexuality between the two. In conversations with Alan and the vicar, Karin explores the connection between spiritual love and physical love\u2014a notion she believes is absent in Christianity but embraced by pagan cults. Soon after, Karin tells Alan she is pregnant.\n\nAlan's initial joy is offset by strange events and apparitions. He sees a green tortoise toy appear and then disappear, and he hears a child's voice on the phone\u2014something Karin also hears. Karin tells Alan she wants to receive Holy Communion. At Mass she is disturbed by the vicar's sermon on the commandment against killing, and then at the communion railing, she takes the eucharist in her hand, but does not receive it, and soon collapses. At home Alan tries to reassure her that whatever's past is past, but she says, \"Nothing is past.\" Karin continues to hear a child crying in the garden.\n\nWhen Mrs. Taswell comes to deliver letters, Alan also hears the child crying in the garden. They go to investigate and find a doll faced down in the water fountain. Alan returns to find Karin hysterical. Realizing she knows what is causing these strange events, Alan shuts all the doors and windows, and closes the drapes, but the cries continue in the garden during a violent storm. Alan sees the green tortoise toy again in the bedroom.\n\nThe next day, Karin asks Alan to take her away. Before leaving, he discovers the receipt for the green tortoise toy and realizes to his horror that she bought it for her daughter just before killing her, out of fear that Alan would reject her with a child. Realizing the damage caused by his \"careless words\" in Copenhagen, Alan cries out, \"May God have mercy.\" They drive to the beach, where she walks into the surf. She pours water over her head in a gesture of baptism, and he tells her he knows what she did. She takes her clothes off, hands him her wedding ring, and they make love on the beach. As the waves roll over them, she faints in his arms.\n\nAt the hospital, Alan watches over her, hearing her last words in German, \"I had no pity.\" The next day he is told she died during the night. The doctor confirms she had an ectopic pregnancy, and that she had previously given birth. At an inquest hearing, while giving testimony, Alan sees an apparition of Karin in a hooded cloak at the back of the courtroom. When he realizes it is just an apparition, he breaks down in tears. Haunted by his careless words, Alan understands that his \"need for a tidy life\" resulted in the tragedy. When he returns home, he hears Karin crying in the garden.<ref name=\"vhs\">{{cite video|people=Gordon Hessler (Director)|title=The Girl in the Swing |medium=VHS |publisher=Millimeter Films |location=New York |year=1989 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097435/ }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Meg Tilly]] as Karin\n* [[Rupert Frazer]] as Alan\n* [[Nicholas Le Prevost]] as The Vicar\n* [[Elspet Gray]] as Mrs. Desland\n* [[Lynsey Baxter]] as Barbara\n* [[Jean Boht]] as Mrs. Taswell\n* Hanne Borchsenius as Jytte Borgen\n* Ljuba Castot as Child in Water\n* [[Helen Cherry]] as Lady Alice\n* Mogens Dalsgaard as Concert Pianist\n* [[Su Elliot]] as Nurse\n* June Ellis as Lady at Auction\n* Patrick Godfrey as Coroner\n* [[Lorna Heilbron]] as Flick\n{{col-break}}\n* Ebbe Langberg as Per Simonsen\n* [[Preston Lockwood]] as Man at Sothebys\n* [[Leonard Maguire]] as Dr. Frazer\n* William 'Duke' Meeks as Mr. Steinberg\n* [[Michael Melia]] as Policeman 1\n* Trine Michelsen as Receptionist\n* [[Hilary Minster]] as Joe\n* Klaus Pagh as Man at La Cocotte\n* Jan Petersen as Chef at La Cocotte\n* Martin Selway as Policeman 2\n* Claire Shepherd as Angela\n* Axel Str\u00f8bye as Jarl Borgen\n* Sophie Thursfield as Deirdre\n* Ralph Wade as Auctioneer<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for The Girl in a Swing |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097435/fullcredits#cast |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received mixed reviews.

In 1909, the games for the summer of 1912 were awarded to Stockholm, but the IOC made it clear that Diem and his fellow organizers could expect to hold the 1916 games in Berlin.<ref>Findling and Pelle, ''Historical Dictionary'', pp. 28 and 43</ref> In 1912 he initiated the award of the [[German Sports Badge]], following the example of a Swedish award encountered during the [[1912 Summer Olympics|Stockholm Olympics]].\n\nDiem threw himself into preparations for the 1916 games. His principal partner in this and most of his Olympic endeavors was [[Theodor Lewald]], who was for many years chairman of the German Olympic Committee. In the summer of 1914, Diem and Lewald were planning their spectacular 1916 Olympiad when [[World War I]] erupted, and the Berlin games were subsequently cancelled. Diem enlisted in the German army and served in Belgium and France. He was wounded at Saint-Quentin, recovered, and fought at both Champagne and the Argonne.<ref>Daniels, George G., ''The Olympic Century (Vol. 6): V and VI Olympiads, Stockholm-The Inter-Allied Games'', World Sport Research and Publications, Inc., Los Angeles, 2000, p. 99</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Olympic officials penalized Germany by excluding them from the 1920 and 1924 games. Diem and Lewald, who had returned to their sports-organizing duties, lobbied successfully to win permission for a German team to compete in the 1928 games in Amsterdam.<ref>Bryant, John, \"The Stadium Hitler Hated\", ''The Times'', December 10, 1998</ref> With support from the state, Diem also founded the ''Deutsche Hochschule f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen'', a school dedicated to the study of the science of sport. He was a great admirer of American athletic programs, and in 1929 toured the US for five weeks with Lewald. During this trip he formed a friendship with [[Avery Brundage]], an American Olympic official who would play a major role in the controversy over the 1936 Olympics (and in Olympic history for decades to come).<ref>Guttmann, Alan, ''The Games Must Go On'', Columbia University Press, New York, 1984, p. 64</ref>\n\n==Olympics in Berlin==\n\nCarl Diem became the secretary of the all-German sports organization {{ill|Deutscher Reichsausschuss f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen|de|vertical-align=sup}} (DRL), the forerunner of the [[Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen]] (NSRL), the Sports Organ of the [[Third Reich]].\n\nIn April 1931,<ref>Jordi Mercader. \u201cThe Games after Sixty Six Years Wait.\u201d Olympic Review, no. 233 (March 1987).</ref> again largely due to the reputation and lobbying efforts of Diem and Lewald, Berlin was selected to host the 1936 summer games, and Diem was named Secretary General of the Organizing Committee.  He attended the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 games]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], carefully observing the host city's preparations and facilities, committed to meeting or outdoing the American accomplishment in Berlin four years later.<ref>Bryant, \"The Stadium Hitler Hated\"</ref>\n\nDr. Theodor Lewald, Diem's boss as President of the Olympic Committee and IOC Member, set up an Organizing Committee for the Olympic games, five days before the elections that resulted in Hitler being elected the new chancellor. The rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] to power in 1933 once again threatened Diem's dream of a Berlin Olympiad: Nazism did not embrace international sport, and Hitler himself had dismissed the Olympics as a project of \"[[Jew]]s and [[Freemason]]s.\"<ref>\"Prof. Carl Diem\", obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', Tuesday, December 18, 1962</ref>\n\nFive days after the swearing-in of the new Ministers, Theodor Lewald had an appointment with [[Joseph Goebbels]], the new Minister of Propaganda. Lewald, a former Under-secretary of state was well connected inside the whole administration and able to get an appointment. He convinced Goebbels that this was a once in a lifetime propaganda opportunity. Goebbels convinced Hitler, who informed Diem and Lewald that he would support the Games.  Six months later, after touring the construction sites for the sporting arenas, he told Diem that the German state would pay the bills.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nInstead of a balanced budget, which Diem had proposed in late 1932, new sporting facilities were built, the underground train extended to the stadium site. The amount of money provided by the government was about twenty times higher than the original budget. Diem used the opportunity to quadruple his own salary.<ref>[[Arnd Kr\u00fcger]], \"Germany: The Propaganda Machine\", in: Arnd Kr\u00fcger and William Murray (eds.), ''The Nazi Olympics: Sport, Politics and Appeasement in the 1930s'', Univ. of Illinois Press, Champaign, IL, 2003, pp. 17-43. {{ISBN|0-252-02815-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Socialists]] embraced the Olympic Games not only because they promised to be a unique opportunity to extol the virtues of their \"reborn\" state; as a celebration of physical prowess, the games also dovetailed neatly with the Nazi idealization of youth, fitness and athleticism. Further, according to Nazi racial theories, their own [[Aryan]] \"superiorities\" were descended from the great achievements of [[ancient Greece]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDespite the official Nazi support for the games, Diem's position as organizer was at risk, mostly because his ''Hochschule'' employed Jewish teachers and because Diem's wife, Liselott, came from a Jewish family.  He himself was classified, for these reasons, as a \"white Jew\",<ref>Guttmann, ''The Games Must Go On'', p. 64</ref> but even so, Diem managed to hold on to his job and solidify his position with his Nazi patrons. His boss Theodor Lewald, who had given up his post as President of the German Sports Body in 1933 before the Nazis could remove him, clung to the newly created position of President of the Organizing Committee. (Lewald's father was a prominent lawyer who was Jewish. Lewald had to arrange himself with [[Hans von Tschammer und Osten]], the new President of the National Olympic Committee, but even more so with Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]] (whose Ministry had been in charge of elite sport since 1914.){{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAmerican IOC Member [[Charles H. Sherrill (ambassador)|Gen. Charles Sherrill]] had a one-hour interview with [[Hitler]] in which Sherrill not only asked Hitler for an autograph, but demanded the participation of at least one token Jew on the German teams for the Winter and Summer Games \u2013 or the Games would be cancelled. Hitler strongly rejected this \"friendly\" advice, shouting that if the worst came to the worst, the Olympic games would be staged for Germans only.<ref>Arnd Kr\u00fcger, \"Germany: The Propaganda Machine\"</ref>  The Nazi establishment went out of their way to assure the world that \"non-Aryan\" participants were being allowed to compete \u2013 and kept Jewish Olympic hopefuls in national training camps.<ref>Taylor, Paul, ''Jews and the Olympic Games''</ref>\n\nThe American Olympic Association remained skeptical about the Nazis' openness to non-Aryan competitors, and a movement to boycott the Berlin games began to gather steam among U.S. Olympic officials.  Diem's old friend [[Avery Brundage]], president of the American Olympic Committee, was dispatched to appraise the facts; in Berlin, Diem convinced Brundage that Jews were not being excluded, though he likely knew otherwise.  Brundage returned to the U.S. and, defeating the boycott's supporters, helped to ensure that a full American athletic delegation would attend the games in Berlin.<ref>Guttmann, ''The Games Must Go On'', pp. 65-71</ref> With the first edition of the Nuremberg Laws (September 1935), excluding Jews from public life, \"Half-Jews\" (no more than two of the four grandparents racially of Jewish descent) were still permitted in public life but not in the civil service. That gave Lewald the opportunity to preside over the Opening Ceremony next to Hitler, and allowed [[Rudi Ball]] to play hockey in the Winter games, and [[Helene Mayer]] to fence (and win a silver medal) in the Summer Games. Jewish Germans were, however, excluded.\n\nCarl Diem held high posts in the Third Reich's sports organization even after the Olympics, becoming the leader of the Foreign Department of the National Socialist Sports Office (the aforementioned NSRL) in 1939. As such he was responsible for the management of German athletes in foreign countries, as well as for the international affairs of the NSRL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/vorschau/44407.html|title=Der \"politische Sturm\" um Carl Diem als Leiter der Sporthochschule ... - Hausarbeiten publizieren|work=hausarbeiten.de}}</ref>\n\nWith his good relations with the IOC, Diem succeeded in having the [[1940 Winter Olympics]] scheduled for [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], despite the fact that the [[1936 Winter Olympics|previous Winter Olympics]] had been held there, and that Germany had already invaded Czechoslovakia at the time the decision was made.<ref>Arnd Kr\u00fcger, \"The Nazi Olympics of 1936\", in: Kevin Young & Kevin B.

According to the \"Official Report\"{{clarify|date=August 2016}}, a Mr Haeggert, administrator of the Propaganda Minister on the Propaganda Committee of the Summer Games, invented the propaganda stunt to raise public awareness in the last weeks prior to the games, and Diem was merely told to work out the details. On the other hand, Diem himself claimed that it was his idea all along. On a visit to Greece for an Olympic conference in 1934, Diem and Lewald imagined a new symbolic pageant that would cloak the German games with the ancient Greek mantle: the transit of a lit [[Olympic flame]] from [[Greece]] to [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] by a relay of torch-bearing runners.  While the relay is sometimes believed to be an ancient tradition, it was in fact the wholly modern creation of Lewald and Diem; the ancient games included a ritual flame commemorating the theft of fire from the gods by [[Prometheus]], but not a torch relay. Diem had been organizing long distance road relays ever since 1910.\n\nOn June 30, 1936,<ref name=\"auto\"/> the first torch-flame was kindled in [[Olympia, Greece]], in the ruins of the Temple of [[Hera]], by 15 robed \"virgins,\" using a concave mirror focusing the sun's rays, all under the supervision of a \"high priestess.\"  It was carried to the [[Acropolis]] in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] for a special invocation, and then relayed along the 3,422-kilometer distance to the Olympic stadium in Berlin by an equal number of young Aryan-looking runners, each of whom took the flame a single kilometer.\n\nOn its way, the flame passed through [[Bulgaria]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]], [[Austria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]; those countries, and Greece itself, would all be under Nazi domination within ten years.<ref name=\"auto1\">Andy McSmith, \"Aryan ideals, not ancient Greece, were the inspiration behind flame tradition\", ''The Independent'', April 8, 2008</ref>  The event was filmed by Hitler's favorite director, [[Leni Riefenstahl]], and branded with the giants of German industry: the lighting-mirrors were made by the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] corporation, and the torches themselves, fueled with magnesium to prevent them from going out in bad weather, were constructed by [[Krupp]], the huge steel and munitions conglomerate that armed [[Germany]] for both world wars.<ref>Chris Bowlby, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7330949.stm The Olympic torch's shadowy past], BBC News, April 5, 2008</ref>\n\nThe final leg of the relay was completed on August 1 by [[Fritz Schilgen]], a German electrical engineer and national champion runner, who ran into the stadium and lit the Olympic cauldron to open the games.  Schilgen was not actually competing; he was selected by officials, including Riefenstahl, for the grace and aesthetic appeal of his running style.  Diem was in Hitler's party as the Fuehrer presided over the ceremony; when Hitler strode across the stadium to his official box, a five-year-old girl presented him with a bouquet of flowers.  The child was Diem's daughter, Gudrun.\n\nThe tradition of a torch relay from [[Greece]] to the host country of the Olympic games has been continued at every Olympiad since then.  Even the ritual kindling of the flame with a mirror on the grounds of the Temple of Hera remains virtually intact as the official method of starting the relay.\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn March 1945, as the Red Army was closing in on Berlin in the final weeks of the [[Second World War]], Diem staged another event in the city's Olympic stadium.  Addressing a rally of thousands of teenage [[Hitler Youth]], Diem exhorted them to defend the capital to the death, in the spirit of the ancient [[Sparta]]ns.  Some two thousand of the young men assembled there did exactly that, sacrificing themselves before Berlin finally fell in May.<ref>Guy Walters, [http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/from-Berlin-to-Beijing-july From Berlin to Beijing], in ''Standpoint Online'', July 2008</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of the war, Diem was quickly rehabilitated into the mainstream of the newly democratic [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. He was acting Director of the Berlin University Physical Education Department. When [[Bernhard Zimmermann]], who had emigrated to Scotland in 1938, declined to become the Rector of a new National Sport College in the British Zone (Cologne), Diem received the job. He returned to his career as a historian of German sport and the Olympic games.  In 1960, he published an authoritative general history of sport.  At his death in 1962 in Cologne, he was once again a respected national figure.  The Carl Diem Institute at the German Sports University was created in his honor, and run by his wife, Liselott, until 1989.  After her death in 1992, the institute was renamed the Carl and Liselott Diem Archive.<ref>details from the [http://www.culda.de/ website of the CuLDA], the Carl and Liselott Diem Archive</ref>  Diem remains the most influential historian of sports in Germany.\n\nThe full nature of Diem's relations with the Nazi apparatus is complex.  His career in national sport preceded the Nazi regime by decades, and he was appointed to organize the 1936 games years before Hitler decided to put his own indelible mark on the Berlin competition.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  But like many career professionals who chose to accept Nazi patronage, Diem's legacy was irreversibly tarnished by proximity to his masters.  His earlier writings did occasionally embrace popular ideas about racial superiority;<ref>Findling and Pelle, ''Historical Dictionary'', p. 43</ref> he clung to his prominent national positions during the Nazi period, and he took part in war propaganda, including the Berlin rally near the war's end.<ref>See the German Wikipedia entry [[:de:Carl Diem|Carl Diem]]{{Circular reference|date=April 2019}}</ref>  Richard Mandell, author of the 1971 book ''The Nazi Olympics'', was critical of Diem; in a reprint of the book, he defended his position, writing: \"Recently, some careful German researchers have uncovered documents showing that Carl Diem's complicity with the Nazis went beyond his confessed use of them to promote sport.  With his Nazi connections he settled brutally some old scores, and he stayed with the Nazis on ideological grounds long after their savagery was exposed and after their coming defeat was apparent to all.\"<ref>Mandell, ''The Nazi Olympics'', p. xvi</ref>  And yet even Mandell did not dispute that Diem was \"the greatest sports historian and most profound theorist of sport education\" of the 20th century.<ref>Mandell, ''The Nazi Olympics'', p. 85</ref>\n\nDuring Diem's final years, there was open controversy about his [[Nazism|Nazi]] connections. For example, in 1954 the [[France|French]] ministry of Education postponed a display of gymnastics before a delegation headed by Diem (then head of the Sportschule at [[Cologne]]), after students claimed that Diem had been a \"Nazi general.\"  Two days later, the students recanted, and admitted that there was no \"formal proof\" of the allegation.<ref>\"French Students' Ban On German Visitor: A Display Postponed\", ''The Times'', March 24 and March 26, 1954</ref>  In the 1990s, a public debate erupted in Germany over his legacy, and whether streets named in his honor should be renamed because of the taint of the Nazi years.<ref>[http://cgi.uni-muenster.de/exec/Rektorat/upm.php?rubrik=Alle&neu=0&monat=200502&nummer=06214 Historiker der Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster arbeitet Biographie von Carl Diem auf]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, from the University of Munster website (access restricted)</ref> In 1948, when Diem attempted to become an IOC Member (Lewald had died in 1947), the IOC rejected him.

He was wounded at Saint-Quentin, recovered, and fought at both Champagne and the Argonne.<ref>Daniels, George G., ''The Olympic Century (Vol. 6): V and VI Olympiads, Stockholm-The Inter-Allied Games'', World Sport Research and Publications, Inc., Los Angeles, 2000, p. 99</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Olympic officials penalized Germany by excluding them from the 1920 and 1924 games. Diem and Lewald, who had returned to their sports-organizing duties, lobbied successfully to win permission for a German team to compete in the 1928 games in Amsterdam.<ref>Bryant, John, \"The Stadium Hitler Hated\", ''The Times'', December 10, 1998</ref> With support from the state, Diem also founded the ''Deutsche Hochschule f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen'', a school dedicated to the study of the science of sport. He was a great admirer of American athletic programs, and in 1929 toured the US for five weeks with Lewald. During this trip he formed a friendship with [[Avery Brundage]], an American Olympic official who would play a major role in the controversy over the 1936 Olympics (and in Olympic history for decades to come).<ref>Guttmann, Alan, ''The Games Must Go On'', Columbia University Press, New York, 1984, p. 64</ref>\n\n==Olympics in Berlin==\n\nCarl Diem became the secretary of the all-German sports organization {{ill|Deutscher Reichsausschuss f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen|de|vertical-align=sup}} (DRL), the forerunner of the [[Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen]] (NSRL), the Sports Organ of the [[Third Reich]].\n\nIn April 1931,<ref>Jordi Mercader. \u201cThe Games after Sixty Six Years Wait.\u201d Olympic Review, no. 233 (March 1987).</ref> again largely due to the reputation and lobbying efforts of Diem and Lewald, Berlin was selected to host the 1936 summer games, and Diem was named Secretary General of the Organizing Committee.  He attended the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 games]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], carefully observing the host city's preparations and facilities, committed to meeting or outdoing the American accomplishment in Berlin four years later.<ref>Bryant, \"The Stadium Hitler Hated\"</ref>\n\nDr. Theodor Lewald, Diem's boss as President of the Olympic Committee and IOC Member, set up an Organizing Committee for the Olympic games, five days before the elections that resulted in Hitler being elected the new chancellor. The rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] to power in 1933 once again threatened Diem's dream of a Berlin Olympiad: Nazism did not embrace international sport, and Hitler himself had dismissed the Olympics as a project of \"[[Jew]]s and [[Freemason]]s.\"<ref>\"Prof. Carl Diem\", obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', Tuesday, December 18, 1962</ref>\n\nFive days after the swearing-in of the new Ministers, Theodor Lewald had an appointment with [[Joseph Goebbels]], the new Minister of Propaganda. Lewald, a former Under-secretary of state was well connected inside the whole administration and able to get an appointment. He convinced Goebbels that this was a once in a lifetime propaganda opportunity. Goebbels convinced Hitler, who informed Diem and Lewald that he would support the Games.  Six months later, after touring the construction sites for the sporting arenas, he told Diem that the German state would pay the bills.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nInstead of a balanced budget, which Diem had proposed in late 1932, new sporting facilities were built, the underground train extended to the stadium site. The amount of money provided by the government was about twenty times higher than the original budget. Diem used the opportunity to quadruple his own salary.<ref>[[Arnd Kr\u00fcger]], \"Germany: The Propaganda Machine\", in: Arnd Kr\u00fcger and William Murray (eds.), ''The Nazi Olympics: Sport, Politics and Appeasement in the 1930s'', Univ. of Illinois Press, Champaign, IL, 2003, pp. 17-43. {{ISBN|0-252-02815-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Socialists]] embraced the Olympic Games not only because they promised to be a unique opportunity to extol the virtues of their \"reborn\" state; as a celebration of physical prowess, the games also dovetailed neatly with the Nazi idealization of youth, fitness and athleticism. Further, according to Nazi racial theories, their own [[Aryan]] \"superiorities\" were descended from the great achievements of [[ancient Greece]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDespite the official Nazi support for the games, Diem's position as organizer was at risk, mostly because his ''Hochschule'' employed Jewish teachers and because Diem's wife, Liselott, came from a Jewish family.  He himself was classified, for these reasons, as a \"white Jew\",<ref>Guttmann, ''The Games Must Go On'', p. 64</ref> but even so, Diem managed to hold on to his job and solidify his position with his Nazi patrons. His boss Theodor Lewald, who had given up his post as President of the German Sports Body in 1933 before the Nazis could remove him, clung to the newly created position of President of the Organizing Committee. (Lewald's father was a prominent lawyer who was Jewish. Lewald had to arrange himself with [[Hans von Tschammer und Osten]], the new President of the National Olympic Committee, but even more so with Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]] (whose Ministry had been in charge of elite sport since 1914.){{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAmerican IOC Member [[Charles H. Sherrill (ambassador)|Gen. Charles Sherrill]] had a one-hour interview with [[Hitler]] in which Sherrill not only asked Hitler for an autograph, but demanded the participation of at least one token Jew on the German teams for the Winter and Summer Games \u2013 or the Games would be cancelled. Hitler strongly rejected this \"friendly\" advice, shouting that if the worst came to the worst, the Olympic games would be staged for Germans only.<ref>Arnd Kr\u00fcger, \"Germany: The Propaganda Machine\"</ref>  The Nazi establishment went out of their way to assure the world that \"non-Aryan\" participants were being allowed to compete \u2013 and kept Jewish Olympic hopefuls in national training camps.<ref>Taylor, Paul, ''Jews and the Olympic Games''</ref>\n\nThe American Olympic Association remained skeptical about the Nazis' openness to non-Aryan competitors, and a movement to boycott the Berlin games began to gather steam among U.S. Olympic officials.  Diem's old friend [[Avery Brundage]], president of the American Olympic Committee, was dispatched to appraise the facts; in Berlin, Diem convinced Brundage that Jews were not being excluded, though he likely knew otherwise.  Brundage returned to the U.S. and, defeating the boycott's supporters, helped to ensure that a full American athletic delegation would attend the games in Berlin.<ref>Guttmann, ''The Games Must Go On'', pp. 65-71</ref> With the first edition of the Nuremberg Laws (September 1935), excluding Jews from public life, \"Half-Jews\" (no more than two of the four grandparents racially of Jewish descent) were still permitted in public life but not in the civil service. That gave Lewald the opportunity to preside over the Opening Ceremony next to Hitler, and allowed [[Rudi Ball]] to play hockey in the Winter games, and [[Helene Mayer]] to fence (and win a silver medal) in the Summer Games. Jewish Germans were, however, excluded.\n\nCarl Diem held high posts in the Third Reich's sports organization even after the Olympics, becoming the leader of the Foreign Department of the National Socialist Sports Office (the aforementioned NSRL) in 1939. As such he was responsible for the management of German athletes in foreign countries, as well as for the international affairs of the NSRL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/vorschau/44407.html|title=Der \"politische Sturm\" um Carl Diem als Leiter der Sporthochschule ... - Hausarbeiten publizieren|work=hausarbeiten.de}}</ref>\n\nWith his good relations with the IOC, Diem succeeded in having the [[1940 Winter Olympics]] scheduled for [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], despite the fact that the [[1936 Winter Olympics|previous Winter Olympics]] had been held there, and that Germany had already invaded Czechoslovakia at the time the decision was made.<ref>Arnd Kr\u00fcger, \"The Nazi Olympics of 1936\", in: Kevin Young & Kevin B. Wamsley (eds.), ''Global Olympics: Historical and Sociological Studies of the Modern Games'', Elsevier, Oxford, 2005, pp. 43-58, {{ISBN|0-7623-1181-9}}.</ref> The 1940 Winter Olympics were cancelled following Germany's [[invasion of Poland]].\n\n== Torch Relay ==\nThere is a controversy as to who invented the Olympic torch relay. According to the \"Official Report\"{{clarify|date=August 2016}}, a Mr Haeggert, administrator of the Propaganda Minister on the Propaganda Committee of the Summer Games, invented the propaganda stunt to raise public awareness in the last weeks prior to the games, and Diem was merely told to work out the details. On the other hand, Diem himself claimed that it was his idea all along. On a visit to Greece for an Olympic conference in 1934, Diem and Lewald imagined a new symbolic pageant that would cloak the German games with the ancient Greek mantle: the transit of a lit [[Olympic flame]] from [[Greece]] to [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] by a relay of torch-bearing runners.  While the relay is sometimes believed to be an ancient tradition, it was in fact the wholly modern creation of Lewald and Diem; the ancient games included a ritual flame commemorating the theft of fire from the gods by [[Prometheus]], but not a torch relay. Diem had been organizing long distance road relays ever since 1910.\n\nOn June 30, 1936,<ref name=\"auto\"/> the first torch-flame was kindled in [[Olympia, Greece]], in the ruins of the Temple of [[Hera]], by 15 robed \"virgins,\" using a concave mirror focusing the sun's rays, all under the supervision of a \"high priestess.\"  It was carried to the [[Acropolis]] in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] for a special invocation, and then relayed along the 3,422-kilometer distance to the Olympic stadium in Berlin by an equal number of young Aryan-looking runners, each of whom took the flame a single kilometer.\n\nOn its way, the flame passed through [[Bulgaria]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]], [[Austria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]; those countries, and Greece itself, would all be under Nazi domination within ten years.<ref name=\"auto1\">Andy McSmith, \"Aryan ideals, not ancient Greece, were the inspiration behind flame tradition\", ''The Independent'', April 8, 2008</ref>  The event was filmed by Hitler's favorite director, [[Leni Riefenstahl]], and branded with the giants of German industry: the lighting-mirrors were made by the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] corporation, and the torches themselves, fueled with magnesium to prevent them from going out in bad weather, were constructed by [[Krupp]], the huge steel and munitions conglomerate that armed [[Germany]] for both world wars.<ref>Chris Bowlby, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7330949.stm The Olympic torch's shadowy past], BBC News, April 5, 2008</ref>\n\nThe final leg of the relay was completed on August 1 by [[Fritz Schilgen]], a German electrical engineer and national champion runner, who ran into the stadium and lit the Olympic cauldron to open the games.  Schilgen was not actually competing; he was selected by officials, including Riefenstahl, for the grace and aesthetic appeal of his running style.  Diem was in Hitler's party as the Fuehrer presided over the ceremony; when Hitler strode across the stadium to his official box, a five-year-old girl presented him with a bouquet of flowers.  The child was Diem's daughter, Gudrun.\n\nThe tradition of a torch relay from [[Greece]] to the host country of the Olympic games has been continued at every Olympiad since then.  Even the ritual kindling of the flame with a mirror on the grounds of the Temple of Hera remains virtually intact as the official method of starting the relay.\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn March 1945, as the Red Army was closing in on Berlin in the final weeks of the [[Second World War]], Diem staged another event in the city's Olympic stadium.  Addressing a rally of thousands of teenage [[Hitler Youth]], Diem exhorted them to defend the capital to the death, in the spirit of the ancient [[Sparta]]ns.  Some two thousand of the young men assembled there did exactly that, sacrificing themselves before Berlin finally fell in May.<ref>Guy Walters, [http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/from-Berlin-to-Beijing-july From Berlin to Beijing], in ''Standpoint Online'', July 2008</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of the war, Diem was quickly rehabilitated into the mainstream of the newly democratic [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. He was acting Director of the Berlin University Physical Education Department. When [[Bernhard Zimmermann]], who had emigrated to Scotland in 1938, declined to become the Rector of a new National Sport College in the British Zone (Cologne), Diem received the job. He returned to his career as a historian of German sport and the Olympic games.  In 1960, he published an authoritative general history of sport.  At his death in 1962 in Cologne, he was once again a respected national figure.  The Carl Diem Institute at the German Sports University was created in his honor, and run by his wife, Liselott, until 1989.  After her death in 1992, the institute was renamed the Carl and Liselott Diem Archive.<ref>details from the [http://www.culda.de/ website of the CuLDA], the Carl and Liselott Diem Archive</ref>  Diem remains the most influential historian of sports in Germany.\n\nThe full nature of Diem's relations with the Nazi apparatus is complex.  His career in national sport preceded the Nazi regime by decades, and he was appointed to organize the 1936 games years before Hitler decided to put his own indelible mark on the Berlin competition.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  But like many career professionals who chose to accept Nazi patronage, Diem's legacy was irreversibly tarnished by proximity to his masters.  His earlier writings did occasionally embrace popular ideas about racial superiority;<ref>Findling and Pelle, ''Historical Dictionary'', p. 43</ref> he clung to his prominent national positions during the Nazi period, and he took part in war propaganda, including the Berlin rally near the war's end.<ref>See the German Wikipedia entry [[:de:Carl Diem|Carl Diem]]{{Circular reference|date=April 2019}}</ref>  Richard Mandell, author of the 1971 book ''The Nazi Olympics'', was critical of Diem; in a reprint of the book, he defended his position, writing: \"Recently, some careful German researchers have uncovered documents showing that Carl Diem's complicity with the Nazis went beyond his confessed use of them to promote sport.  With his Nazi connections he settled brutally some old scores, and he stayed with the Nazis on ideological grounds long after their savagery was exposed and after their coming defeat was apparent to all.\"<ref>Mandell, ''The Nazi Olympics'', p. xvi</ref>  And yet even Mandell did not dispute that Diem was \"the greatest sports historian and most profound theorist of sport education\" of the 20th century.<ref>Mandell, ''The Nazi Olympics'', p. 85</ref>\n\nDuring Diem's final years, there was open controversy about his [[Nazism|Nazi]] connections. For example, in 1954 the [[France|French]] ministry of Education postponed a display of gymnastics before a delegation headed by Diem (then head of the Sportschule at [[Cologne]]), after students claimed that Diem had been a \"Nazi general.\"  Two days later, the students recanted, and admitted that there was no \"formal proof\" of the allegation.<ref>\"French Students' Ban On German Visitor: A Display Postponed\", ''The Times'', March 24 and March 26, 1954</ref>  In the 1990s, a public debate erupted in Germany over his legacy, and whether streets named in his honor should be renamed because of the taint of the Nazi years.<ref>[http://cgi.uni-muenster.de/exec/Rektorat/upm.php?rubrik=Alle&neu=0&monat=200502&nummer=06214 Historiker der Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster arbeitet Biographie von Carl Diem auf]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, from the University of Munster website (access restricted)</ref> In 1948, when Diem attempted to become an IOC Member (Lewald had died in 1947), the IOC rejected him.
