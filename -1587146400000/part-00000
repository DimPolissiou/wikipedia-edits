As well as ceding the island of [[Hong Kong]] to the United Kingdom in perpetuity, the treaty also established five treaty ports at [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]], [[Thirteen Factories|Canton]] ([[Guangzhou]]), Ningpo ([[Ningbo]]), Fuchow ([[Fuzhou]]), and Amoy ([[Xiamen]]). The following year the Chinese and British signed the [[Treaty of the Bogue]], which added provisions for [[extraterritoriality]] and [[most favoured nation]] status for the latter country. Subsequent negotiations with the Americans (1843 [[Treaty of Wanghia]]) and the French (1844 [[Treaty of Whampoa]]) led to further concessions for these nations on the same terms as the British.\n\nThe second group of treaty ports was set up following the end of the [[Second Opium War|''Arrow'' War]] in 1860 and eventually more than 80 treaty ports were established in China alone, involving many foreign powers.\n\n===Characteristics===\nForeigners all lived in prestige sections newly built for them on the edges of existing port cities. They enjoyed legal extraterritoriality, as stipulated in the unequal treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers such as in the [[concessions in China]], effectively removing them from the control of local governments.<ref>Peter Hibbard, ''The Bund Shanghai: China Faces West'' (Odyssey Illustrated Guides, 2007)</ref>\n\nWestern images of the Chinese treaty ports focus on the distinctive geography of the \u201cbund,\u201d a long narrow strip of land in a prime location on the waterfront where the businesses, offices, warehouses  and residences of all foreigners were located. [[The Bund|The Shanghai bund]] was the largest and most famous. The North Riverbank in [[Ningbo]] (nowadays known as the [[Old Bund]]), was the first in China, opening in 1844, 20 years before the Shanghai bund. A typical bund contained British, German, French, American, Japanese and other nationals.\n\nEven a modest pay scale would allow them to have numerous Chinese servants. The bund was a self-governing operation with its own shops, restaurants, recreational facilities, parks,  churches. courts, police, and local government.  The facilities were generally off-limits to the natives The British, who by far dominated foreign trade with China, normally were by far the largest presence. Businessmen and officials typically brought their own families with them and stayed for years but sent their older children back to England for education.\n\nChinese sovereignty was only nominal. Officially, the foreign powers were not allowed to station military units in the bond, but in practice, there often was a warship or two in the harbor.<ref>Robert Nield, ''China\u2019s Foreign Places: The Foreign Presence in China in the Treaty Ports'' (2015) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9888139282 Online.]</ref>\n\n=== Chinese capitulation treaties ===\nThe treaty port system in China lasted approximately one hundred years. It began with the 1841 [[Opium War]] and ended with the 1941 attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. The major powers involved were the British, the French, and the Americans, although by the end of the 19th century all the major powers were involved, including Latin American countries and the [[Congo Free State]]. It is not possible to put an exact date on the end of the treaty port era. The Russians relinquished their treaty rights in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] in 1917, and the Germans were forced to concede their treaty rights following their defeat in [[World War I]].\n\n[[Norway]] voluntarily relinquished its treaty rights in a capitulation treaty of 1931. The three main treaty powers, the British, the Americans, and the French, continued to hold their concessions and extraterritorial jurisdictions until the [[Second World War]]. This ended when the Japanese stormed into their concessions in the wake of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] at the end of 1941. They then formally relinquished their treaty rights in a new \"equal treaties\" agreement with [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Nationalist Government (China)|Nationalist Government]] in exile in [[Chungking]] in 1943.\n\nMeanwhile, the pro-Japanese puppet government in [[Nanking]] signed a capitulation treaty with the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] government in 1943. This was not recognized by [[Free French Forces|Free French]] leader [[Charles de Gaulle]]. In 1946, in order to induce the Chinese to vacate the northern half of [[French Indochina]], de Gaulle signed a capitulation treaty with [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist ([[Kuomintang]]) government.\n\nWhatever residues of the treaty port era were left in the late 1940s were ended when the communists took over China in 1949.\n\n=== Major treaty ports ===\nFor encyclopedic details on each treaty port, see Robert Nield's ''China\u2019s Foreign Places: The Foreign Presence in China in the Treaty Port Era, 1840-1943'' (2015).\n<br>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The treaty with the United States was followed by similar ones with Britain, the Netherlands, Russia and France. The ports permitted legal [[extraterritoriality]] for citizens of the treaty nations.\n\nThe system of treaty ports ended in Japan in the years 1899 as a consequence of Japan's rapid transition to a modern nation. Japan had sought treaty revision earnestly, and in 1894, signed a new treaty with Britain which revised or abrogated the previous \"unequal\" treaty.  Other countries signed similar treaties.  The new treaties came into force in July 1899.\n\n== Korean treaty ports ==\n\nFollowing the [[Ganghwa Treaty]] of 1876, the Korean kingdom of [[Joseon]] agreed to the opening of three strategic ports and the extension of legal [[extraterritoriality]] to merchants from [[Meiji Japan]]. The first port opened in this manner was [[Busan]], while [[Incheon]] and [[Wonsan]] followed shortly thereafter. These cities became important centers of mercantile activity for traders from China and Japan until Korea's colonization by Japan in 1910.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Unequal treaties]]\n* [[Concessions in China]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n* {{Catholic|wstitle=China}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Bickers, Robert, and Isabella Jackson, eds.

The treaty with the United States was followed by similar ones with Britain, the Netherlands, Russia and France. The ports permitted legal [[extraterritoriality]] for citizens of the treaty nations.\n\nThe system of treaty ports ended in Japan in the years 1899 as a consequence of Japan's rapid transition to a modern nation. Japan had sought treaty revision earnestly, and in 1894, signed a new treaty with Britain which revised or abrogated the previous \"unequal\" treaty.  Other countries signed similar treaties.  The new treaties came into force in July 1899.\n\n== Korean treaty ports ==\n\nFollowing the [[Ganghwa Treaty]] of 1876, the Korean kingdom of [[Joseon]] agreed to the opening of three strategic ports and the extension of legal [[extraterritoriality]] to merchants from [[Meiji Japan]]. The first port opened in this manner was [[Busan]], while [[Incheon]] and [[Wonsan]] followed shortly thereafter. These cities became important centers of mercantile activity for traders from China and Japan until Korea's colonization by Japan in 1910.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Unequal treaties]]\n* [[Concessions in China]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n* {{Catholic|wstitle=China}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Bickers, Robert, and Isabella Jackson, eds.

The play is notable for breaking new ground in the development of [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance drama]]: \"No earlier English comedy has anything like the intellectual content or the social relevance that it has.\"<ref>[[George Richard Hibbard|G. R. Hibbard]], quoted in: Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., ''The Predecessors of Shakespeare: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama,'' Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1973; p. 113.</ref>\n\nAlthough Nashe is known as an Elizabethan playwright, ''Summer's Last Will and Testament'' is his only extant solo-authored play; his other surviving dramatic work, ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)|Dido, Queen of Carthage]]'', is a collaboration with [[Christopher Marlowe]], in which Nashe's role was probably very minimal.\n\n==Publication==\nThe play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 28 October 1600, and was published before the end of that year in a [[book size|quarto]] printed by Simon Stafford for the bookseller [[Walter Burre]]. (Burre is best known for his publication of first editions of the plays of [[Ben Jonson]].) The 1600 quarto was the only edition of the play prior to the nineteenth century.\n\n==Date and performance==\nNo external evidence indicates the date of the authorship or first performance of the play; but the text of the work is rich in allusions and references that bear upon the question of its date. The text refers to a progress through the English countryside by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], and also to an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] and a severe drought that lowered the level of the River [[Thames]] to an unusual extreme. Scholars agree that 1592 is the one year that best matches these references.<ref>[[E. K. Chambers]], ''The Elizabethan Stage'', 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 451\u20133.</ref>\n\nThe play was not performed by professional adult actors in one of the London theatres, which in any case were closed due to the plague epidemic in 1592. References and allusions in the play suggest that the drama was staged in [[Croydon]] at [[Croydon Palace]], the manor house of the [[Archbishops of Canterbury]]; the Archbishop at the time was [[John Whitgift]]. The cast was composed at least in part of amateurs, including boys who served as pages in the Archbishop's household; the cast may have been supplemented by experienced [[boy player|boy actors]] from the established London troupes, the [[Children of Paul's]] or the [[Children of the Chapel]]. The performance occurred \"in this latter end of summer\", probably in the second half of September or the first half of October 1592.<ref>Logan and Smith, pp. 112\u201314.</ref>\n\n==Genre==\nNashe developed ''Summer's Last Will and Testament'' out of the interlude form that was popular in the royal and noble courts of sixteenth-century England; and he anticipates the [[masque]] that would evolve during the [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] and [[Literature in English#Caroline and Cromwellian literature|Caroline]] eras. The play can be seen as a bridge between the 16th-century interlude and the 17th-century masque; it features personifications of the four seasons, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and \"Ver.\"  Summer is the \"king of the world\", but now old and declining, and ready to make his will. First, all the officers and members of the kingdom are summoned to yield their accounts. The presences of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], [[satyr]]s, [[nymph]]s, hunters, reapers, maids and clowns and [[Morris dance]]rs (complete with [[hobby horse]]), give the play a strongly [[pastoral]] feeling.\n\nThe term \"summer\" in the title has a double meaning: the play is introduced and presented by the figure of [[William Sommers|Will Summer]], or Summers, the jester of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. Summers had an enduring reputation with the Elizabethan public; he would be brought back to the stage by [[Samuel Rowley]] in ''[[When You See Me You Know Me]]'' (printed 1605). The clown-figure of Summers provides a level of satire to the [[Morality play|morality-play]] style [[allegory]] of the plot.\n\nIn one view, Nashe produced his play by rewriting and expanding an earlier interlude by [[John Lyly]] that was performed in 1591.<ref>Michael R. Best, \"Nashe, Lyly, and ''Summers Last Will and Testament'',\" ''[[Philological Quarterly]]'' 48 (1969), pp. 1\u201311.</ref> In the play, Will Summers embodies a reaction to the type of overly formal drama represented by Lyly.<ref>G.

This contains the famous couplet, \"Brightness falls from the air, Queens have died young and fair.\" The lyric \"Spring, sweet spring\" has also received attention from critics and anthologists.\n\n==Modern adaptation==\nIn 1936 the English composer [[Constant Lambert]] debuted a large-scale orchestral and choral [[Summer's Last Will and Testament (Lambert)|setting of Nashe's play]], which has sometimes been judged Lambert's greatest work<ref>[[Wilfrid Mellers|Wilfrid Howard Mellers]], ''Between Old Worlds and New,'' Lewisburg, PA, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1997; p. 226.</ref> and which Lambert himself considered his best.<ref>[http://www.musicweb-international.com/SandH/conway/lambert.htm Music Web International]</ref> Lambert employed \"Adieu, farewell, earth's bliss\" as the conclusion of his musical setting.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10467 The play text online at Gutenberg.org]\n*[http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Summers_Last_Will_Testament.pdf ''Summer's Last Will and Testament''] at the [http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/index.html Oxford Authorship Site], edited by Nina Green.\n\n[[Category:English Renaissance plays]]\n[[Category:1592 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Thomas Nashe]]\n[[Category:Works by Thomas Nashe]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{about|the original play by Nashe|the choral adaptation by Lambert|Summer's Last Will and Testament (Lambert)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n\n'''''Summer's Last Will and Testament''''' is an [[English literature#Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] stage play, a comedy written by [[Thomas Nashe]].
