Each guest can be started, paused and stopped independently within its own [[virtual machine]] (VM). The user can independently configure each VM and run it under a choice of [[Shadow page tables|software-based virtualization]] or [[x86 virtualization#Hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware assisted virtualization]] if the underlying host hardware supports this. The host OS and guest OSs and applications can communicate with each other through a number of mechanisms including a common clipboard and a virtualized network facility. Guest VMs can also directly communicate with each other if configured to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_internal |title=Internal Networking |publisher=VirtualBox |date= |access-date=2013-07-31}}</ref>\n\n===Software-based virtualization===\nThe feature was dropped starting with VirtualBox 6.1. <ref name=\"6.1\" /><ref name=\"VBdownloads\" />\n\n====Version 6.0 and below====\nIn the absence of hardware-assisted virtualization, VirtualBox adopts a standard [[Shadow page tables|software-based virtualization]] approach. This mode supports 32-bit guest OSs which run in rings 0 and 3 of the Intel [[ring (computer security)|ring]] architecture.\n\n* The system reconfigures the guest OS code, which would normally run in ring 0, to execute in ring 1 on the host hardware. Because this code contains many privileged instructions which cannot run natively in ring 1, VirtualBox employs a Code Scanning and Analysis Manager (CSAM) to scan the ring 0 code recursively before its first execution to identify problematic instructions and then calls the Patch Manager (PATM) to perform ''in-situ'' patching. This replaces the instruction with a jump to a VM-safe equivalent compiled code fragment in hypervisor memory.\n* The guest user-mode code, running in ring 3, generally runs directly on the host hardware in ring 3.\n\nIn both cases, VirtualBox uses CSAM and PATM to inspect and patch the offending instructions whenever a fault occurs. VirtualBox also contains a [[Dynamic recompilation|dynamic recompiler]], based on [[QEMU]] to recompile any [[real mode]] or [[protected mode]] code entirely (e.g. BIOS code, a DOS guest, or any operating system startup).<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#idp13728752 |title=VirtualBox Manual, Section 10.4 Details about software virtualization |publisher=VirtualBox |access-date=2011-04-25}}</ref>\n\nUsing these techniques, VirtualBox can achieve a performance comparable to that of [[VMware]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dr. Diedrich |first=Oliver |url=http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/83678 |title=heise open \u2013 15.01.07 \u2013 VirtualBox |publisher=Heise.de |date=2007-01-15 |access-date=2009-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Perlow|first=Jason|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/virtualization-smackdown-2-oracle-vm-virtualbox-32-vs-vmware-workstation-71/13020|title=Virtualization Smackdown 2: Oracle VM VirtualBox 3.2 vs. VMware Workstation 7.1|publisher=ZDNET|date=2010-05-21|access-date=2010-05-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524082735/http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/virtualization-smackdown-2-oracle-vm-virtualbox-32-vs-vmware-workstation-71/13020|archivedate=2010-05-24}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware-assisted virtualization===\nVirtualBox supports both [[Intel]]'s [[Intel VT-x|VT-x]] and [[AMD]]'s [[AMD-V]] hardware-assisted virtualization. Making use of these facilities, VirtualBox can run each guest VM in its own separate address-space; the guest OS ring 0 code runs on the host at ring 0 in VMX non-root mode rather than in ring&nbsp;1. {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nStarting with version 6.1, VirtualBox only supports this method. <ref name=\"6.1\" /><ref name=\"VBdownloads\" /> Until then, VirtualBox specifically supported some guests (including 64-bit guests, SMP guests and certain proprietary OSs) only on hosts with [[hardware-assisted virtualization]]. {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Device virtualization===\n{{anchor|VirtualBox Disk Image}}\n\nThe system emulates hard disks in one of three disk image formats:\n# '''VDI''': This format is the VirtualBox-specific ''Virtual Disk Image''<ref>https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch05.html</ref> and stores data in files bearing a \".vdi\" [[filename extension]].\n# '''[[VMDK]]''': This [[open format]] is used by [[VMware]] products such as [[VMware Workstation]] and [[VMware Player]]. It stores data in one or more files bearing \".vmdk\" filename extensions. A single virtual hard disk may span several files.\n# '''[[VHD (file format)|VHD]]''': This format is used by [[Windows Virtual PC]] and [[Hyper-V]], and is the native virtual disk format of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, starting with [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]]. Data in this format are stored in a single file bearing the \".vhd\" filename extension.\n\nA VirtualBox virtual machine can, therefore, use disks previously created in VMware or Microsoft Virtual PC, as well as its own native format. VirtualBox can also connect to [[iSCSI]] targets and to raw partitions on the host, using either as virtual hard disks. VirtualBox emulates [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] (PIIX4 and ICH6 controllers), [[SCSI]], [[SATA]] (ICH8M controller) and [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]] controllers to which hard drives can be attached.\n\nVirtualBox has supported [[Open Virtualization Format]] (OVF) since version 2.2.0 (April 2009).<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-2.2 | title = VirtualBox changelog | access-date = 2010-02-18 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100205014430/http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-2.2 | archivedate = 2010-02-05}}</ref>\n\nBoth [[ISO image]]s and host-connected physical devices can be mounted as CD/DVD drives. For example, the DVD image of a Linux distribution can be downloaded and used directly by VirtualBox.\n\nBy default, VirtualBox provides graphics support through a custom virtual graphics-card that is [[VESA]] compatible. The Guest Additions for Windows, Linux, Solaris, OpenSolaris, or OS/2 guests include a special video-driver that increases video performance and includes additional features, such as automatically adjusting the guest resolution when resizing the VM window<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#id448025 |title=Chapter 4.

A special paravirtualized network adapter is also available, which improves network performance by eliminating the need to match a specific hardware interface, but requires special driver support in the guest. (Many distributions of [[Linux]] ship with this driver included.) By default, VirtualBox uses [[Network Address Translation|NAT]] through which Internet software for end-users such as [[Firefox]] or [[Secure Shell|ssh]] can operate. [[Bridging (networking)|Bridged networking]] via a host network adapter or virtual networks between guests can also be configured. Up to 36 network adapters can be attached simultaneously, but only four are configurable through the graphical interface.\n\nFor a sound card, VirtualBox virtualizes Intel HD Audio, Intel ICH AC'97 and [[SoundBlaster 16]] devices.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#settings-audio |title=Chapter 3.

The user can independently configure each VM and run it under a choice of [[Shadow page tables|software-based virtualization]] or [[x86 virtualization#Hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware assisted virtualization]] if the underlying host hardware supports this. The host OS and guest OSs and applications can communicate with each other through a number of mechanisms including a common clipboard and a virtualized network facility. Guest VMs can also directly communicate with each other if configured to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_internal |title=Internal Networking |publisher=VirtualBox |date= |access-date=2013-07-31}}</ref>\n\n===Software-based virtualization===\nThe feature was dropped starting with VirtualBox 6.1. <ref name=\"6.1\" /><ref name=\"VBdownloads\" />\n\n====Version 6.0 and below====\nIn the absence of hardware-assisted virtualization, VirtualBox adopts a standard [[Shadow page tables|software-based virtualization]] approach. This mode supports 32-bit guest OSs which run in rings 0 and 3 of the Intel [[ring (computer security)|ring]] architecture.\n\n* The system reconfigures the guest OS code, which would normally run in ring 0, to execute in ring 1 on the host hardware. Because this code contains many privileged instructions which cannot run natively in ring 1, VirtualBox employs a Code Scanning and Analysis Manager (CSAM) to scan the ring 0 code recursively before its first execution to identify problematic instructions and then calls the Patch Manager (PATM) to perform ''in-situ'' patching. This replaces the instruction with a jump to a VM-safe equivalent compiled code fragment in hypervisor memory.\n* The guest user-mode code, running in ring 3, generally runs directly on the host hardware in ring 3.\n\nIn both cases, VirtualBox uses CSAM and PATM to inspect and patch the offending instructions whenever a fault occurs. VirtualBox also contains a [[Dynamic recompilation|dynamic recompiler]], based on [[QEMU]] to recompile any [[real mode]] or [[protected mode]] code entirely (e.g. BIOS code, a DOS guest, or any operating system startup).<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#idp13728752 |title=VirtualBox Manual, Section 10.4 Details about software virtualization |publisher=VirtualBox |access-date=2011-04-25}}</ref>\n\nUsing these techniques, VirtualBox can achieve a performance comparable to that of [[VMware]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dr. Diedrich |first=Oliver |url=http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/83678 |title=heise open \u2013 15.01.07 \u2013 VirtualBox |publisher=Heise.de |date=2007-01-15 |access-date=2009-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Perlow|first=Jason|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/virtualization-smackdown-2-oracle-vm-virtualbox-32-vs-vmware-workstation-71/13020|title=Virtualization Smackdown 2: Oracle VM VirtualBox 3.2 vs. VMware Workstation 7.1|publisher=ZDNET|date=2010-05-21|access-date=2010-05-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524082735/http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/virtualization-smackdown-2-oracle-vm-virtualbox-32-vs-vmware-workstation-71/13020|archivedate=2010-05-24}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware-assisted virtualization===\nVirtualBox supports both [[Intel]]'s [[Intel VT-x|VT-x]] and [[AMD]]'s [[AMD-V]] hardware-assisted virtualization. Making use of these facilities, VirtualBox can run each guest VM in its own separate address-space; the guest OS ring 0 code runs on the host at ring 0 in VMX non-root mode rather than in ring&nbsp;1. {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nStarting with version 6.1, VirtualBox only supports this method. <ref name=\"6.1\" /><ref name=\"VBdownloads\" /> Until then, VirtualBox specifically supported some guests (including 64-bit guests, SMP guests and certain proprietary OSs) only on hosts with [[hardware-assisted virtualization]]. {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Device virtualization===\n{{anchor|VirtualBox Disk Image}}\n\nThe system emulates hard disks in one of three disk image formats:\n# '''VDI''': This format is the VirtualBox-specific ''Virtual Disk Image''<ref>https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch05.html</ref> and stores data in files bearing a \".vdi\" [[filename extension]].\n# '''[[VMDK]]''': This [[open format]] is used by [[VMware]] products such as [[VMware Workstation]] and [[VMware Player]]. It stores data in one or more files bearing \".vmdk\" filename extensions. A single virtual hard disk may span several files.\n# '''[[VHD (file format)|VHD]]''': This format is used by [[Windows Virtual PC]] and [[Hyper-V]], and is the native virtual disk format of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, starting with [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]]. Data in this format are stored in a single file bearing the \".vhd\" filename extension.\n\nA VirtualBox virtual machine can, therefore, use disks previously created in VMware or Microsoft Virtual PC, as well as its own native format. VirtualBox can also connect to [[iSCSI]] targets and to raw partitions on the host, using either as virtual hard disks. VirtualBox emulates [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] (PIIX4 and ICH6 controllers), [[SCSI]], [[SATA]] (ICH8M controller) and [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]] controllers to which hard drives can be attached.\n\nVirtualBox has supported [[Open Virtualization Format]] (OVF) since version 2.2.0 (April 2009).<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-2.2 | title = VirtualBox changelog | access-date = 2010-02-18 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100205014430/http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-2.2 | archivedate = 2010-02-05}}</ref>\n\nBoth [[ISO image]]s and host-connected physical devices can be mounted as CD/DVD drives. For example, the DVD image of a Linux distribution can be downloaded and used directly by VirtualBox.\n\nBy default, VirtualBox provides graphics support through a custom virtual graphics-card that is [[VESA]] compatible. The Guest Additions for Windows, Linux, Solaris, OpenSolaris, or OS/2 guests include a special video-driver that increases video performance and includes additional features, such as automatically adjusting the guest resolution when resizing the VM window<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#id448025 |title=Chapter 4.

A special paravirtualized network adapter is also available, which improves network performance by eliminating the need to match a specific hardware interface, but requires special driver support in the guest. (Many distributions of [[Linux]] ship with this driver included.) By default, VirtualBox uses [[Network Address Translation|NAT]] through which Internet software for end-users such as [[Firefox]] or [[Secure Shell|ssh]] can operate. [[Bridging (networking)|Bridged networking]] via a host network adapter or virtual networks between guests can also be configured. Up to 36 network adapters can be attached simultaneously, but only four are configurable through the graphical interface.\n\nFor a sound card, VirtualBox virtualizes Intel HD Audio, Intel ICH AC'97 and [[SoundBlaster 16]] devices.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#settings-audio |title=Chapter 3.

The proprietary extension pack adds a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 controllers and, if VirtualBox acts as an RDP server, it can also use USB devices on the remote RDP client as if they were connected to the host, although only if the client supports this VirtualBox-specific extension (Oracle provides clients for Solaris, Linux and [[Sun Ray]] thin clients that can do this, and have promised support for other platforms in future versions).<ref>{{cite web\n | url         = https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch07.html#usb-over-rdp\n | title       = VirtualBox 4.1.4 Manual \u2013 Chapter 7 Remote Virtual Machines\n | publisher   = Oracle\n | date        = 2011-10-03\n | access-date = 2011-11-19}}</ref>\n\n==Feature set==\n* [[X86-64|64-bit]] guests ([[X86 virtualization#Hardware assist|hardware virtualization]] support is required)\n* [[Snapshot (computer storage)#In virtualization|Snapshots]]\n* Seamless mode&nbsp;\u2013 the ability to run virtualized applications side by side with normal desktop applications\n* Shared [[Clipboard (computing)|clipboard]]\n* Shared folders\n* Special drivers and utilities to facilitate switching between systems\n* [[Command-line interface|Command line]] interaction (in addition to the GUI)\n* Public API ([[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[SOAP]], [[XPCOM]]) to control VM configuration and execution<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.sun.com/nike/entry/python_api_to_the_virtualbox | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080910134357/http://blogs.sun.com/nike/entry/python_api_to_the_virtualbox | archivedate = 2008-09-10 | title = Python API to the VirtualBox VM | access-date = 2008-09-06 | date = 2008-09-05 | publisher = Sun Microsystems}}</ref>\n* Nested [[paging]] for [[AMD-V]] and [[Intel VT]] (only for processors supporting [[Second-level address translation|SLAT]] and with SLAT enabled)\n* Limited support for [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] acceleration (including [[OpenGL]] up to (but not including) 3.0 and [[Direct3D]] 9.0c via [[Wine (software)|Wine]]'s Direct3D to OpenGL translation)\n* [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] support (up to 32 virtual CPUs per virtual machine), since version 3.0\n* Teleportation (aka [[Live Migration]])\n* 2D video output acceleration (not to be mistaken with video decoding acceleration), since version 3.1\n* [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]] has been supported since version 3.1 (Windows 7<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/7702#comment:13|title=#7702 (UEFI support for Windows guests) \u2013 Oracle VM VirtualBox|website=www.virtualbox.org|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#efi|title=Chapter 3.

This property is called [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]. It can produce a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, which is proportional to a weaker input signal and thus, it can act as an [[amplifier]]. Alternatively, the transistor can be used to turn current on or off in a circuit as an electrically controlled [[switch]], where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roland|first=James|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2qsDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=how+do+transistors+work&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjpzPbJsejoAhUKhXIEHU8oDssQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=how%20do%20transistors%20work&f=false|title=How Transistors Work|date=2016-08-01|publisher=Lerner Publications \u2122|isbn=978-1-5124-2146-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of transistors, which have slight differences in how they are used in a circuit. A ''[[bipolar transistor]]'' has terminals labeled '''base''', '''collector''', and '''emitter'''. A small current at the base terminal (that is, flowing between the base and the emitter) can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter terminals. For a ''[[field-effect transistor]]'', the terminals are labeled '''gate''', '''source''', and '''drain''', and a voltage at the gate can control a current between source and drain.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\">{{Cite book|last=Pulfrey|first=David L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9dYENs2SVUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=how+do+transistors+work&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjF86zfsejoAhWShHIEHTXKBlgQ6AEwBnoECAgQAg#v=onepage&q=how%20do%20transistors%20work&f=false|title=Understanding Modern Transistors and Diodes|date=2010-01-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48467-1|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe image represents a typical bipolar transistor in a circuit. Charge will flow between emitter and collector terminals depending on the current in the base. Because internally the base and emitter connections behave like a semiconductor diode, a voltage drop develops between base and emitter while the base current exists. The amount of this voltage depends on the material the transistor is made from, and is referred to as ''V''<sub>BE</sub>.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\n===Transistor as a switch===\n[[File:Transistor as switch.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|BJT used as an electronic switch, in grounded-emitter configuration.]]\n\nTransistors are commonly used in [[digital circuits]] as electronic switches which can be either in an \"on\" or \"off\" state, both for high-power applications such as [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] and for low-power applications such as [[logic gate]]s. Important parameters for this application include the current switched, the voltage handled, and the switching speed, characterised by the [[rise time|rise and fall times]].<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\nIn a grounded-emitter transistor circuit, such as the light-switch circuit shown, as the base voltage rises, the emitter and collector currents rise exponentially. The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter. If the voltage difference between the collector and emitter were zero (or near zero), the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance (light bulb) and the supply voltage. This is called ''saturation'' because current is flowing from collector to emitter freely. When saturated, the switch is said to be ''on''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Daniel|title=Hands-On Electronics|year=2003|isbn=978-0-511-07668-8|pages=47\u201354, 60\u201361|bibcode=2003hoe..book.....K|doi=10.2277/0521815363}}</ref>\n\nProviding sufficient base drive current is a key problem in the use of bipolar transistors as switches. The transistor provides current gain, allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. In the example light-switch circuit shown, the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor will be saturated.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\nIn a switching circuit, the idea is to simulate, as near as possible, the ideal switch having the properties of open circuit when off, short circuit when on, and an instantaneous transition between the two states. Parameters are chosen such that the \"off\" output is limited to leakage currents too small to affect connected circuitry, the resistance of the transistor in the \"on\" state is too small to affect circuitry, and the transition between the two states is fast enough not to have a detrimental effect.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\n===Transistor as an amplifier===\n[[File:NPN common emitter AC.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Amplifier circuit, common-emitter configuration with a voltage-divider bias circuit.]]\n\nThe [[common-emitter amplifier]] is designed so that a small change in voltage (''V''<sub>in</sub>) changes the small current through the base of the transistor whose current amplification combined with the properties of the circuit means that small swings in ''V''<sub>in</sub> produce large changes in ''V''<sub>out</sub>.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\nVarious configurations of single transistor amplifier are possible, with some providing current gain, some voltage gain, and some both.\n\nFrom [[mobile phone]]s to [[television]]s, vast numbers of products include amplifiers for [[sound reproduction]], [[Transmitter|radio transmission]], and [[signal processing]]. The first discrete-transistor audio amplifiers barely supplied a few hundred milliwatts, but power and audio fidelity gradually increased as better transistors became available and amplifier architecture evolved.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\nModern transistor audio amplifiers of up to a few hundred [[watt]]s are common and relatively inexpensive.\n\n==Comparison with vacuum tubes==\nBefore transistors were developed, [[vacuum tube|vacuum (electron) tubes]] (or in the UK \"thermionic valves\" or just \"valves\") were the main active components in electronic equipment.\n\n===Advantages===\nThe key advantages that have allowed transistors to replace vacuum tubes in most applications are\n* No cathode heater (which produces the characteristic orange glow of tubes), reducing power consumption, eliminating delay as tube heaters warm up, and immune from [[cathode poisoning]] and depletion.\n* Very small size and weight, reducing equipment size.\n* Large numbers of extremely small transistors can be manufactured as a single [[integrated circuit]].\n* Low operating voltages compatible with batteries of only a few cells.\n* Circuits with greater energy efficiency are usually possible. For low-power applications (for example, voltage amplification) in particular, energy consumption can be very much less than for tubes.\n* Complementary devices available, providing design flexibility including [[complementary-symmetry]] circuits, not possible with vacuum tubes.\n* Very low sensitivity to mechanical shock and vibration, providing physical ruggedness and virtually eliminating shock-induced spurious signals (for example, [[microphonics]] in audio applications).\n* Not susceptible to breakage of a glass envelope, leakage, outgassing, and other physical damage.\n\n===Limitations===\nTransistors have the following limitations:\n\n* They lack the higher [[electron mobility]] afforded by the vacuum of vacuum tubes, which is desirable for high-power, high-frequency operation&nbsp;&mdash; such as that used in over-the-air [[television|television broadcasting]].\n* Transistors and other solid-state devices are susceptible to damage from very brief electrical and thermal events, including [[electrostatic discharge]] in handling.

At first, when no gate voltage is applied, there are no inversion electrons in the channel, so the device is turned off. As gate voltage increases, the inversion electron density in the channel increases, current increases, and thus the device turns on.]]\n\nThe ''[[field-effect transistor]]'', sometimes called a ''unipolar transistor'', uses either electrons (in ''n-channel FET'') or holes (in ''p-channel FET'') for conduction. The four terminals of the FET are named ''source'', ''gate'', ''drain'', and ''body'' (''substrate''). On most FETs, the body is connected to the source inside the package, and this will be assumed for the following description.\n\nIn a FET, the drain-to-source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the ''source'' region to the ''drain'' region. The conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals, hence the current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between the gate and source. As the gate\u2013source voltage (''V''<sub>GS</sub>) is increased, the drain\u2013source current (''I''<sub>DS</sub>) increases exponentially for ''V<sub>GS</sub>'' below threshold, and then at a roughly quadratic rate (''I''<sub>DS</sub> \u221d (''V''<sub>GS</sub> \u2212 ''V''<sub>T</sub>)<sup>2</sup>) (where ''V''<sub>T</sub> is the threshold voltage at which drain current begins)<ref name=horowitz-hill>{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Horowitz|author2=Winfield Hill |title=The Art of Electronics|edition=2nd|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37095-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/artofelectronics00horo/page/115 115]|title-link=The Art of Electronics|author2-link=Winfield Hill}}</ref> in the \"[[space charge|space-charge-limited]]\" region above threshold.

C. |title=Analog design essentials|year= 2006|page=\u00a70152, p. 28|publisher=Springer|location=New York, Berlin|isbn=978-0-387-25746-4}}</ref>\n\nFor low noise at narrow [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] the higher input resistance of the FET is advantageous.\n\nFETs are divided into two families: ''junction FET'' ([[JFET]]) and ''insulated gate FET'' (IGFET). The IGFET is more commonly known as a ''metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor FET'' ([[MOSFET]]), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a [[p\u2013n diode]] with the channel which lies between the source and drain. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube [[triode]] which, similarly, forms a diode between its [[Control grid|grid]] and [[cathode]]. Also, both devices operate in the ''depletion mode'', they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage.\n\nMetal\u2013semiconductor FETs ([[MESFET]]s) are JFETs in which the [[Reverse-biased|reverse biased]] p\u2013n junction is replaced by a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]]. These, and the HEMTs (high-electron-mobility transistors, or HFETs), in which a two-dimensional electron gas with very high carrier mobility is used for charge transport, are especially suitable for use at very high frequencies (several GHz).\n\nFETs are further divided into ''depletion-mode'' and ''enhancement-mode'' types, depending on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage. For enhancement mode, the channel is off at zero bias, and a gate potential can \"enhance\" the conduction. For the depletion mode, the channel is on at zero bias, and a gate potential (of the opposite polarity) can \"deplete\" the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n-channel devices and a lower current for p-channel devices. Nearly all JFETs are depletion-mode because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices, while most IGFETs are enhancement-mode types.\n\n====Metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET)====\n{{Main|MOSFET}}\n\nThe [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET), also known as the metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon transistor (MOS transistor, or MOS),<ref name=\"computerhistory-transistor\"/> is a type of field-effect transistor that is [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] by the [[thermal oxidation|controlled oxidation]] of a [[semiconductor]], typically [[silicon]]. It has an insulated [[Metal gate|gate]], whose voltage determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]]. The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor, and the basic building block of most modern [[electronics]].<ref name=\"triumph\"/> The MOSFET accounts for 99.9% of all transistors in the world.<ref name=\"computerhistory2018\"/>\n\n===Bipolar junction transistor (BJT)===\n{{Main|Bipolar junction transistor}}\n\nBipolar transistors are so named because they conduct by using both majority and minority [[charge carriers in semiconductors|carriers]]. The bipolar junction transistor, the first type of transistor to be mass-produced, is a combination of two junction diodes, and is formed of either a thin layer of p-type semiconductor sandwiched between two n-type semiconductors (an n\u2013p\u2013n transistor), or a thin layer of n-type semiconductor sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors (a p\u2013n\u2013p transistor). This construction produces two [[p\u2013n junction]]s: a base\u2013emitter junction and a base\u2013collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region. (Two junction diodes wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor).\n\nBJTs have three terminals, corresponding to the three layers of semiconductor\u2014an ''emitter'', a ''base'', and a ''collector''. They are useful in [[amplifiers]] because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by a relatively small base current.<ref name=Streetman>{{cite book|last=Streetman|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben G. Streetman|title=Solid State Electronic Devices|year=1992|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-822023-5|pages=301\u2013305}}</ref> In an n\u2013p\u2013n transistor operating in the active region, the emitter\u2013base junction is forward biased ([[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]] recombine at the junction), and the base-collector junction is reverse biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and move away from the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased base\u2013collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. As well, as the base is lightly doped (in comparison to the emitter and collector regions), recombination rates are low, permitting more carriers to diffuse across the base region. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled.<ref name=Streetman/> Collector current is approximately \u03b2 (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.\n\nUnlike the field-effect transistor (see below), the BJT is a low-input-impedance device. Also, as the base\u2013emitter voltage (''V''<sub>BE</sub>) is increased the base\u2013emitter current and hence the collector\u2013emitter current (''I''<sub>CE</sub>) increase exponentially according to the [[diode modelling#Shockley diode model|Shockley diode model]] and the [[Ebers-Moll model]]. Because of this exponential relationship, the BJT has a higher [[transconductance]] than the FET.\n\nBipolar transistors can be made to conduct by exposure to light, because absorption of photons in the base region generates a photocurrent that acts as a base current; the collector current is approximately \u03b2 times the photocurrent. Devices designed for this purpose have a transparent window in the package and are called [[phototransistor]]s.\n\n===Usage of MOSFETs and BJTs===\nThe [[MOSFET]] is by far the most widely used transistor for both [[digital circuits]] as well as [[analog circuits]],<ref>{{cite web |title=MOSFET DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER |url=http://sites.bu.edu/engcourses/files/2016/08/mosfet-differential-amplifier.pdf |website=[[Boston University]] |accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref> accounting for 99.9% of all transistors in the world.<ref name=\"computerhistory2018\"/> The [[bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT) was previously the most commonly used transistor during the 1950s to 1960s. Even after MOSFETs became widely available in the 1970s, the BJT remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity, up until MOSFET devices (such as [[power MOSFET]]s, [[LDMOS]] and [[RF CMOS]]) replaced them for most [[power electronic]] applications in the 1980s. In [[integrated circuit]]s, the desirable properties of MOSFETs allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits in the 1970s. Discrete MOSFETs (typically power MOSFETs) can be applied in transistor applications, including analog circuits, voltage regulators, amplifiers, power transmitters and motor drivers.\n\n===Other transistor types===\n[[File:Transistor on portuguese pavement.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Transistor symbol created on [[Portuguese pavement]] in the [[University of Aveiro]].]]\n\n{{For|early bipolar transistors|Bipolar junction transistor#Bipolar transistors}}\n* [[Field-effect transistor]] (FET):\n** [[Metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET), where the gate is insulated by a shallow layer of insulator\n*** [[PMOS logic|p-type MOS]] (PMOS)\n*** [[NMOS logic|n-type MOS]] (NMOS)\n*** [[CMOS|complementary MOS]] (CMOS)\n**** [[RF CMOS]], for [[power electronics]]\n*** [[Multi-gate field-effect transistor]] (MuGFET)\n**** [[Fin field-effect transistor]] (FinFET), source/drain region shapes fins on the silicon surface\n*** [[Thin-film transistor]], used in [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] and [[OLED]] displays\n*** [[Floating-gate MOSFET]] (FGMOS), for [[non-volatile storage]]\n*** [[Power MOSFET]], for power electronics\n**** [[LDMOS|lateral diffused MOS]] (LDMOS)\n** [[Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor]] (CNFET), where the channel material is replaced by a carbon nanotube\n** [[Junction gate field-effect transistor]] (JFET), where the gate is insulated by a reverse-biased p\u2013n junction\n** [[Metal\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MESFET), similar to JFET with a Schottky junction instead of a p\u2013n junction\n*** [[High-electron-mobility transistor]] (HEMT)\n** [[Inverted-T field-effect transistor]] (ITFET)\n** [[Fast-reverse epitaxial diode field-effect transistor]] (FREDFET)\n** [[Organic field-effect transistor]] (OFET), in which the semiconductor is an organic compound\n** [[Ballistic transistor (disambiguation)]]\n** FETs used to sense environment\n*** [[Ion-sensitive field-effect transistor]] (IFSET), to measure ion concentrations in solution,\n*** [[Electrolyte\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (EOSFET), [[neurochip]],\n*** [[Deoxyribonucleic acid field-effect transistor]] (DNAFET).\n* [[Bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT):\n** [[Heterojunction bipolar transistor]], up to several hundred GHz, common in modern ultrafast and RF circuits\n** [[Schottky transistor]]\n** [[avalanche transistor]]\n** [[Darlington transistor]]s are two BJTs connected together to provide a high current gain equal to the product of the current gains of the two transistors\n** [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBTs) use a medium-power IGFET, similarly connected to a power BJT, to give a high input impedance.

For example, [[2N3055]] is a silicon n\u2013p\u2013n power transistor, 2N1301 is a p\u2013n\u2013p germanium switching transistor. A letter suffix (such as \"A\") is sometimes used to indicate a newer variant, but rarely gain groupings.\n\n===Proprietary===\nManufacturers of devices may have their own proprietary numbering system, for example [[CK722]]. Since devices are [[Second source|second-sourced]], a manufacturer's prefix (like \"MPF\" in MPF102, which originally would denote a [[Motorola]] [[FET]]) now is an unreliable indicator of who made the device. Some proprietary naming schemes adopt parts of other naming schemes, for example a PN2222A is a (possibly [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]) 2N2222A in a plastic case (but a PN108 is a plastic version of a BC108, not a 2N108, while the PN100 is unrelated to other xx100 devices).\n\nMilitary part numbers sometimes are assigned their own codes, such as the [[UK CV series|British Military CV Naming System]].\n\nManufacturers buying large numbers of similar parts may have them supplied with \"house numbers\", identifying a particular purchasing specification and not necessarily a device with a standardized registered number. For example, an HP part 1854,0053 is a (JEDEC) 2N2218 transistor<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv010.cgi?read=27258 |title=Richard Freeman's HP Part numbers Crossreference |publisher=Hpmuseum.org |accessdate=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605183505/http://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv010.cgi?read=27258 |archivedate=June 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/hp-parts/300-hpxref.pdf |title=Transistor\u2013Diode Cross Reference \u2013 H.P.

For example, two different devices may be marked \"J176\" (one the J176 low-power [[JFET]], the other the higher-powered [[MOSFET]] 2SJ176).\n\nAs older \"through-hole\" transistors are given [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mount]] packaged counterparts, they tend to be assigned many different part numbers because manufacturers have their own systems to cope with the variety in [[pinout]] arrangements and options for dual or matched n\u2013p\u2013n + p\u2013n\u2013p devices in one pack. So even when the original device (such as a 2N3904) may have been assigned by a standards authority, and well known by engineers over the years, the new versions are far from standardized in their naming.\n\n==Construction==\n\n===Semiconductor material===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px;\"\n|+Semiconductor material characteristics\n!Semiconductor <br> material\n!Junction forward <br> voltage <br> V @ 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n!Electron mobility <br> m<sup>2</sup>/(V\u00b7s) @ 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n!Hole mobility <br> m<sup>2</sup>/(V\u00b7s) @ 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n!Max.<br>junction temp.<br>\u00b0C\n|-\n!Ge\n|0.27||0.39||0.19||70 to 100\n|-\n!Si\n|0.71||0.14|| 0.05||150 to 200\n|-\n!GaAs\n|1.03||0.85||0.05||150 to 200\n|-\n!Al-Si junction\n|0.3||\u2014||\u2014||150 to 200\n|}\n\nThe first BJTs were made from [[germanium]] (Ge). [[Silicon]] (Si) types currently predominate but certain advanced microwave and high-performance versions now employ the ''compound semiconductor'' material [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and the ''semiconductor alloy'' [[silicon germanium]] (SiGe). Single element semiconductor material (Ge and Si) is described as ''elemental''.\n\nRough parameters for the most common semiconductor materials used to make transistors are given in the adjacent table. These parameters will vary with increase in temperature, electric field, impurity level, strain, and sundry other factors.\n\nThe ''junction forward voltage'' is the voltage applied to the emitter\u2013base junction of a BJT in order to make the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to \"drive\" the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change is \u22122.1 mV/\u00b0C.<ref name=Sedra>\n{{cite book |author1=Sedra, A.S. |author2=Smith, K.C. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Microelectronic circuits |year=2004 |page=397 and Figure 5.17 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=Fifth |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-514251-8}}</ref> In some circuits special compensating elements ([[sensistor]]s) must be used to compensate for such changes.\n\nThe density of mobile carriers in the channel of a MOSFET is a function of the electric field forming the channel and of various other phenomena such as the impurity level in the channel. Some impurities, called dopants, are introduced deliberately in making a MOSFET, to control the MOSFET electrical behavior.\n\nThe ''[[electron mobility]]'' and ''[[hole mobility]]'' columns show the average speed that electrons and holes diffuse through the semiconductor material with an [[electric field]] of 1 volt per meter applied across the material. In general, the higher the electron mobility the faster the transistor can operate. The table indicates that Ge is a better material than Si in this respect. However, Ge has four major shortcomings compared to silicon and gallium arsenide:\n# Its maximum temperature is limited.\n# It has relatively high [[Reverse leakage current|leakage current]].\n# It cannot withstand high voltages.\n# It is less suitable for fabricating integrated circuits.\nBecause the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar [[n\u2013p\u2013n transistor]] tends to be swifter than an equivalent [[p\u2013n\u2013p transistor]]. GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent{{When|date=May 2018}} FET development, the ''high-electron-mobility transistor'' ([[HEMT]]), has a [[heterojunction|heterostructure]] (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12&nbsp;GHz. HEMTs based on [[gallium nitride]] and [[aluminium gallium nitride]] (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.\n\n'Max. junction temperature' values represent a cross section taken from various manufacturers' data sheets. This temperature should not be exceeded or the transistor may be damaged.\n\n'Al\u2013Si junction' refers to the high-speed (aluminum\u2013silicon) metal\u2013semiconductor barrier diode, commonly known as a [[Schottky diode]]. This is included in the table because some silicon power IGFETs have a [[parasitic structure|parasitic]] reverse Schottky diode formed between the source and drain as part of the fabrication process. This diode can be a nuisance, but sometimes it is used in the circuit.\n\n===Packaging===\n{{See also|Semiconductor package|Chip carrier}}\n[[File:Transbauformen.jpg|thumb|Assorted discrete transistors]]\n[[File:Kt315b.jpg|thumb|Soviet [[KT315]]b transistors]]\n\nDiscrete transistors can be individually packaged transistors or unpackaged transistor chips (dice).\n\nTransistors come in many different [[semiconductor packages]] (see image). The two main categories are ''[[through-hole technology|through-hole]]'' (or ''leaded''), and ''surface-mount'', also known as ''surface-mount device'' ([[surface-mount technology|SMD]]). The ''ball grid array'' ([[Ball grid array|BGA]]) is the latest surface-mount package (currently only for large integrated circuits). It has solder \"balls\" on the underside in place of leads. Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power rating.\n\nTransistor packages are made of glass, metal, ceramic, or plastic. The package often dictates the power rating and frequency characteristics. Power transistors have larger packages that can be clamped to [[heat sink]]s for enhanced cooling. Additionally, most power transistors have the collector or drain physically connected to the metal enclosure. At the other extreme, some surface-mount ''microwave'' transistors are as small as grains of sand.\n\nOften a given transistor type is available in several packages. Transistor packages are mainly standardized, but the assignment of a transistor's functions to the terminals is not: other transistor types can assign other functions to the package's terminals. Even for the same transistor type the terminal assignment can vary (normally indicated by a suffix letter to the part number, q.e. BC212L and BC212K).\n\nNowadays most transistors come in a wide range of SMT packages, in comparison the list of available through-hole packages is relatively small, here is a short list of the most common through-hole transistors packages in alphabetical order:\nATV, E-line, MRT, HRT, SC-43, SC-72, TO-3, TO-18, TO-39, TO-92, TO-126, TO220, TO247, TO251, TO262, ZTX851.\n\nUnpackaged transistor chips (die) may be assembled into hybrid devices.<ref name=\"Greig\">{{cite book\n |last=Greig |first=William\n |date=2007-04-24\n |title=Integrated Circuit Packaging, Assembly and Interconnections\n |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g29xoTAyAMgC&pg=PA63&dq=hybrid+integrated+circuit#v=onepage&q=hybrid%20&f=false \n |page=63 \n |quote=A hybrid circuit is defined as an assembly containing both active semiconductor devices (packaged and unpackaged)|isbn=9780387339139\n }}</ref>  The [[IBM SLT]] module of the 1960s is one example of such a hybrid circuit module using glass passivated transistor (and diode) die.

This property is called [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]. It can produce a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, which is proportional to a weaker input signal and thus, it can act as an [[amplifier]]. Alternatively, the transistor can be used to turn current on or off in a circuit as an electrically controlled [[switch]], where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roland|first=James|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2qsDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=how+do+transistors+work&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjpzPbJsejoAhUKhXIEHU8oDssQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=how%20do%20transistors%20work&f=false|title=How Transistors Work|date=2016-08-01|publisher=Lerner Publications \u2122|isbn=978-1-5124-2146-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of transistors, which have slight differences in how they are used in a circuit. A ''[[bipolar transistor]]'' has terminals labeled '''base''', '''collector''', and '''emitter'''. A small current at the base terminal (that is, flowing between the base and the emitter) can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter terminals. For a ''[[field-effect transistor]]'', the terminals are labeled '''gate''', '''source''', and '''drain''', and a voltage at the gate can control a current between source and drain.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\">{{Cite book|last=Pulfrey|first=David L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9dYENs2SVUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=how+do+transistors+work&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjF86zfsejoAhWShHIEHTXKBlgQ6AEwBnoECAgQAg#v=onepage&q=how%20do%20transistors%20work&f=false|title=Understanding Modern Transistors and Diodes|date=2010-01-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48467-1|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe image represents a typical bipolar transistor in a circuit. Charge will flow between emitter and collector terminals depending on the current in the base. Because internally the base and emitter connections behave like a semiconductor diode, a voltage drop develops between base and emitter while the base current exists. The amount of this voltage depends on the material the transistor is made from, and is referred to as ''V''<sub>BE</sub>.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\n===Transistor as a switch===\n[[File:Transistor as switch.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|BJT used as an electronic switch, in grounded-emitter configuration.]]\n\nTransistors are commonly used in [[digital circuits]] as electronic switches which can be either in an \"on\" or \"off\" state, both for high-power applications such as [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] and for low-power applications such as [[logic gate]]s. Important parameters for this application include the current switched, the voltage handled, and the switching speed, characterised by the [[rise time|rise and fall times]].<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\nIn a grounded-emitter transistor circuit, such as the light-switch circuit shown, as the base voltage rises, the emitter and collector currents rise exponentially. The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter. If the voltage difference between the collector and emitter were zero (or near zero), the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance (light bulb) and the supply voltage. This is called ''saturation'' because current is flowing from collector to emitter freely. When saturated, the switch is said to be ''on''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Daniel|title=Hands-On Electronics|year=2003|isbn=978-0-511-07668-8|pages=47\u201354, 60\u201361|bibcode=2003hoe..book.....K|doi=10.2277/0521815363}}</ref>\n\nProviding sufficient base drive current is a key problem in the use of bipolar transistors as switches. The transistor provides current gain, allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. In the example light-switch circuit shown, the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor will be saturated.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\nIn a switching circuit, the idea is to simulate, as near as possible, the ideal switch having the properties of open circuit when off, short circuit when on, and an instantaneous transition between the two states. Parameters are chosen such that the \"off\" output is limited to leakage currents too small to affect connected circuitry, the resistance of the transistor in the \"on\" state is too small to affect circuitry, and the transition between the two states is fast enough not to have a detrimental effect.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\n===Transistor as an amplifier===\n[[File:NPN common emitter AC.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Amplifier circuit, common-emitter configuration with a voltage-divider bias circuit.]]\n\nThe [[common-emitter amplifier]] is designed so that a small change in voltage (''V''<sub>in</sub>) changes the small current through the base of the transistor whose current amplification combined with the properties of the circuit means that small swings in ''V''<sub>in</sub> produce large changes in ''V''<sub>out</sub>.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\nVarious configurations of single transistor amplifier are possible, with some providing current gain, some voltage gain, and some both.\n\nFrom [[mobile phone]]s to [[television]]s, vast numbers of products include amplifiers for [[sound reproduction]], [[Transmitter|radio transmission]], and [[signal processing]]. The first discrete-transistor audio amplifiers barely supplied a few hundred milliwatts, but power and audio fidelity gradually increased as better transistors became available and amplifier architecture evolved.<ref name=\"Pulfrey\" />\n\nModern transistor audio amplifiers of up to a few hundred [[watt]]s are common and relatively inexpensive.\n\n==Comparison with vacuum tubes==\nBefore transistors were developed, [[vacuum tube|vacuum (electron) tubes]] (or in the UK \"thermionic valves\" or just \"valves\") were the main active components in electronic equipment.\n\n===Advantages===\nThe key advantages that have allowed transistors to replace vacuum tubes in most applications are\n* No cathode heater (which produces the characteristic orange glow of tubes), reducing power consumption, eliminating delay as tube heaters warm up, and immune from [[cathode poisoning]] and depletion.\n* Very small size and weight, reducing equipment size.\n* Large numbers of extremely small transistors can be manufactured as a single [[integrated circuit]].\n* Low operating voltages compatible with batteries of only a few cells.\n* Circuits with greater energy efficiency are usually possible. For low-power applications (for example, voltage amplification) in particular, energy consumption can be very much less than for tubes.\n* Complementary devices available, providing design flexibility including [[complementary-symmetry]] circuits, not possible with vacuum tubes.\n* Very low sensitivity to mechanical shock and vibration, providing physical ruggedness and virtually eliminating shock-induced spurious signals (for example, [[microphonics]] in audio applications).\n* Not susceptible to breakage of a glass envelope, leakage, outgassing, and other physical damage.\n\n===Limitations===\nTransistors have the following limitations:\n\n* They lack the higher [[electron mobility]] afforded by the vacuum of vacuum tubes, which is desirable for high-power, high-frequency operation&nbsp;&mdash; such as that used in over-the-air [[television|television broadcasting]].\n* Transistors and other solid-state devices are susceptible to damage from very brief electrical and thermal events, including [[electrostatic discharge]] in handling.

At first, when no gate voltage is applied, there are no inversion electrons in the channel, so the device is turned off. As gate voltage increases, the inversion electron density in the channel increases, current increases, and thus the device turns on.]]\n\nThe ''[[field-effect transistor]]'', sometimes called a ''unipolar transistor'', uses either electrons (in ''n-channel FET'') or holes (in ''p-channel FET'') for conduction. The four terminals of the FET are named ''source'', ''gate'', ''drain'', and ''body'' (''substrate''). On most FETs, the body is connected to the source inside the package, and this will be assumed for the following description.\n\nIn a FET, the drain-to-source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the ''source'' region to the ''drain'' region. The conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals, hence the current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between the gate and source. As the gate\u2013source voltage (''V''<sub>GS</sub>) is increased, the drain\u2013source current (''I''<sub>DS</sub>) increases exponentially for ''V<sub>GS</sub>'' below threshold, and then at a roughly quadratic rate (''I''<sub>DS</sub> \u221d (''V''<sub>GS</sub> \u2212 ''V''<sub>T</sub>)<sup>2</sup>) (where ''V''<sub>T</sub> is the threshold voltage at which drain current begins)<ref name=horowitz-hill>{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Horowitz|author2=Winfield Hill |title=The Art of Electronics|edition=2nd|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37095-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/artofelectronics00horo/page/115 115]|title-link=The Art of Electronics|author2-link=Winfield Hill}}</ref> in the \"[[space charge|space-charge-limited]]\" region above threshold.

C. |title=Analog design essentials|year= 2006|page=\u00a70152, p. 28|publisher=Springer|location=New York, Berlin|isbn=978-0-387-25746-4}}</ref>\n\nFor low noise at narrow [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] the higher input resistance of the FET is advantageous.\n\nFETs are divided into two families: ''junction FET'' ([[JFET]]) and ''insulated gate FET'' (IGFET). The IGFET is more commonly known as a ''metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor FET'' ([[MOSFET]]), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a [[p\u2013n diode]] with the channel which lies between the source and drain. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube [[triode]] which, similarly, forms a diode between its [[Control grid|grid]] and [[cathode]]. Also, both devices operate in the ''depletion mode'', they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage.\n\nMetal\u2013semiconductor FETs ([[MESFET]]s) are JFETs in which the [[Reverse-biased|reverse biased]] p\u2013n junction is replaced by a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]]. These, and the HEMTs (high-electron-mobility transistors, or HFETs), in which a two-dimensional electron gas with very high carrier mobility is used for charge transport, are especially suitable for use at very high frequencies (several GHz).\n\nFETs are further divided into ''depletion-mode'' and ''enhancement-mode'' types, depending on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage. For enhancement mode, the channel is off at zero bias, and a gate potential can \"enhance\" the conduction. For the depletion mode, the channel is on at zero bias, and a gate potential (of the opposite polarity) can \"deplete\" the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n-channel devices and a lower current for p-channel devices. Nearly all JFETs are depletion-mode because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices, while most IGFETs are enhancement-mode types.\n\n====Metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET)====\n{{Main|MOSFET}}\n\nThe [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET), also known as the metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon transistor (MOS transistor, or MOS),<ref name=\"computerhistory-transistor\"/> is a type of field-effect transistor that is [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] by the [[thermal oxidation|controlled oxidation]] of a [[semiconductor]], typically [[silicon]]. It has an insulated [[Metal gate|gate]], whose voltage determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]]. The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor, and the basic building block of most modern [[electronics]].<ref name=\"triumph\"/> The MOSFET accounts for 99.9% of all transistors in the world.<ref name=\"computerhistory2018\"/>\n\n===Bipolar junction transistor (BJT)===\n{{Main|Bipolar junction transistor}}\n\nBipolar transistors are so named because they conduct by using both majority and minority [[charge carriers in semiconductors|carriers]]. The bipolar junction transistor, the first type of transistor to be mass-produced, is a combination of two junction diodes, and is formed of either a thin layer of p-type semiconductor sandwiched between two n-type semiconductors (an n\u2013p\u2013n transistor), or a thin layer of n-type semiconductor sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors (a p\u2013n\u2013p transistor). This construction produces two [[p\u2013n junction]]s: a base\u2013emitter junction and a base\u2013collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region. (Two junction diodes wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor).\n\nBJTs have three terminals, corresponding to the three layers of semiconductor\u2014an ''emitter'', a ''base'', and a ''collector''. They are useful in [[amplifiers]] because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by a relatively small base current.<ref name=Streetman>{{cite book|last=Streetman|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben G. Streetman|title=Solid State Electronic Devices|year=1992|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-822023-5|pages=301\u2013305}}</ref> In an n\u2013p\u2013n transistor operating in the active region, the emitter\u2013base junction is forward biased ([[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]] recombine at the junction), and the base-collector junction is reverse biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and move away from the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased base\u2013collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. As well, as the base is lightly doped (in comparison to the emitter and collector regions), recombination rates are low, permitting more carriers to diffuse across the base region. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled.<ref name=Streetman/> Collector current is approximately \u03b2 (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.\n\nUnlike the field-effect transistor (see below), the BJT is a low-input-impedance device. Also, as the base\u2013emitter voltage (''V''<sub>BE</sub>) is increased the base\u2013emitter current and hence the collector\u2013emitter current (''I''<sub>CE</sub>) increase exponentially according to the [[diode modelling#Shockley diode model|Shockley diode model]] and the [[Ebers-Moll model]]. Because of this exponential relationship, the BJT has a higher [[transconductance]] than the FET.\n\nBipolar transistors can be made to conduct by exposure to light, because absorption of photons in the base region generates a photocurrent that acts as a base current; the collector current is approximately \u03b2 times the photocurrent. Devices designed for this purpose have a transparent window in the package and are called [[phototransistor]]s.\n\n===Usage of MOSFETs and BJTs===\nThe [[MOSFET]] is by far the most widely used transistor for both [[digital circuits]] as well as [[analog circuits]],<ref>{{cite web |title=MOSFET DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER |url=http://sites.bu.edu/engcourses/files/2016/08/mosfet-differential-amplifier.pdf |website=[[Boston University]] |accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref> accounting for 99.9% of all transistors in the world.<ref name=\"computerhistory2018\"/> The [[bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT) was previously the most commonly used transistor during the 1950s to 1960s. Even after MOSFETs became widely available in the 1970s, the BJT remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity, up until MOSFET devices (such as [[power MOSFET]]s, [[LDMOS]] and [[RF CMOS]]) replaced them for most [[power electronic]] applications in the 1980s. In [[integrated circuit]]s, the desirable properties of MOSFETs allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits in the 1970s. Discrete MOSFETs (typically power MOSFETs) can be applied in transistor applications, including analog circuits, voltage regulators, amplifiers, power transmitters and motor drivers.\n\n===Other transistor types===\n[[File:Transistor on portuguese pavement.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Transistor symbol created on [[Portuguese pavement]] in the [[University of Aveiro]].]]\n\n{{For|early bipolar transistors|Bipolar junction transistor#Bipolar transistors}}\n* [[Field-effect transistor]] (FET):\n** [[Metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET), where the gate is insulated by a shallow layer of insulator\n*** [[PMOS logic|p-type MOS]] (PMOS)\n*** [[NMOS logic|n-type MOS]] (NMOS)\n*** [[CMOS|complementary MOS]] (CMOS)\n**** [[RF CMOS]], for [[power electronics]]\n*** [[Multi-gate field-effect transistor]] (MuGFET)\n**** [[Fin field-effect transistor]] (FinFET), source/drain region shapes fins on the silicon surface\n*** [[Thin-film transistor]], used in [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] and [[OLED]] displays\n*** [[Floating-gate MOSFET]] (FGMOS), for [[non-volatile storage]]\n*** [[Power MOSFET]], for power electronics\n**** [[LDMOS|lateral diffused MOS]] (LDMOS)\n** [[Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor]] (CNFET), where the channel material is replaced by a carbon nanotube\n** [[Junction gate field-effect transistor]] (JFET), where the gate is insulated by a reverse-biased p\u2013n junction\n** [[Metal\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MESFET), similar to JFET with a Schottky junction instead of a p\u2013n junction\n*** [[High-electron-mobility transistor]] (HEMT)\n** [[Inverted-T field-effect transistor]] (ITFET)\n** [[Fast-reverse epitaxial diode field-effect transistor]] (FREDFET)\n** [[Organic field-effect transistor]] (OFET), in which the semiconductor is an organic compound\n** [[Ballistic transistor (disambiguation)]]\n** FETs used to sense environment\n*** [[Ion-sensitive field-effect transistor]] (IFSET), to measure ion concentrations in solution,\n*** [[Electrolyte\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (EOSFET), [[neurochip]],\n*** [[Deoxyribonucleic acid field-effect transistor]] (DNAFET).\n* [[Bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT):\n** [[Heterojunction bipolar transistor]], up to several hundred GHz, common in modern ultrafast and RF circuits\n** [[Schottky transistor]]\n** [[avalanche transistor]]\n** [[Darlington transistor]]s are two BJTs connected together to provide a high current gain equal to the product of the current gains of the two transistors\n** [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBTs) use a medium-power IGFET, similarly connected to a power BJT, to give a high input impedance.

For example, [[2N3055]] is a silicon n\u2013p\u2013n power transistor, 2N1301 is a p\u2013n\u2013p germanium switching transistor. A letter suffix (such as \"A\") is sometimes used to indicate a newer variant, but rarely gain groupings.\n\n===Proprietary===\nManufacturers of devices may have their own proprietary numbering system, for example [[CK722]]. Since devices are [[Second source|second-sourced]], a manufacturer's prefix (like \"MPF\" in MPF102, which originally would denote a [[Motorola]] [[FET]]) now is an unreliable indicator of who made the device. Some proprietary naming schemes adopt parts of other naming schemes, for example a PN2222A is a (possibly [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]) 2N2222A in a plastic case (but a PN108 is a plastic version of a BC108, not a 2N108, while the PN100 is unrelated to other xx100 devices).\n\nMilitary part numbers sometimes are assigned their own codes, such as the [[UK CV series|British Military CV Naming System]].\n\nManufacturers buying large numbers of similar parts may have them supplied with \"house numbers\", identifying a particular purchasing specification and not necessarily a device with a standardized registered number. For example, an HP part 1854,0053 is a (JEDEC) 2N2218 transistor<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv010.cgi?read=27258 |title=Richard Freeman's HP Part numbers Crossreference |publisher=Hpmuseum.org |accessdate=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605183505/http://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv010.cgi?read=27258 |archivedate=June 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/hp-parts/300-hpxref.pdf |title=Transistor\u2013Diode Cross Reference \u2013 H.P.

For example, two different devices may be marked \"J176\" (one the J176 low-power [[JFET]], the other the higher-powered [[MOSFET]] 2SJ176).\n\nAs older \"through-hole\" transistors are given [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mount]] packaged counterparts, they tend to be assigned many different part numbers because manufacturers have their own systems to cope with the variety in [[pinout]] arrangements and options for dual or matched n\u2013p\u2013n + p\u2013n\u2013p devices in one pack. So even when the original device (such as a 2N3904) may have been assigned by a standards authority, and well known by engineers over the years, the new versions are far from standardized in their naming.\n\n==Construction==\n\n===Semiconductor material===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px;\"\n|+Semiconductor material characteristics\n!Semiconductor <br> material\n!Junction forward <br> voltage <br> V @ 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n!Electron mobility <br> m<sup>2</sup>/(V\u00b7s) @ 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n!Hole mobility <br> m<sup>2</sup>/(V\u00b7s) @ 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n!Max.<br>junction temp.<br>\u00b0C\n|-\n!Ge\n|0.27||0.39||0.19||70 to 100\n|-\n!Si\n|0.71||0.14|| 0.05||150 to 200\n|-\n!GaAs\n|1.03||0.85||0.05||150 to 200\n|-\n!Al-Si junction\n|0.3||\u2014||\u2014||150 to 200\n|}\n\nThe first BJTs were made from [[germanium]] (Ge). [[Silicon]] (Si) types currently predominate but certain advanced microwave and high-performance versions now employ the ''compound semiconductor'' material [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and the ''semiconductor alloy'' [[silicon germanium]] (SiGe). Single element semiconductor material (Ge and Si) is described as ''elemental''.\n\nRough parameters for the most common semiconductor materials used to make transistors are given in the adjacent table. These parameters will vary with increase in temperature, electric field, impurity level, strain, and sundry other factors.\n\nThe ''junction forward voltage'' is the voltage applied to the emitter\u2013base junction of a BJT in order to make the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to \"drive\" the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change is \u22122.1 mV/\u00b0C.<ref name=Sedra>\n{{cite book |author1=Sedra, A.S. |author2=Smith, K.C. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Microelectronic circuits |year=2004 |page=397 and Figure 5.17 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=Fifth |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-514251-8}}</ref> In some circuits special compensating elements ([[sensistor]]s) must be used to compensate for such changes.\n\nThe density of mobile carriers in the channel of a MOSFET is a function of the electric field forming the channel and of various other phenomena such as the impurity level in the channel. Some impurities, called dopants, are introduced deliberately in making a MOSFET, to control the MOSFET electrical behavior.\n\nThe ''[[electron mobility]]'' and ''[[hole mobility]]'' columns show the average speed that electrons and holes diffuse through the semiconductor material with an [[electric field]] of 1 volt per meter applied across the material. In general, the higher the electron mobility the faster the transistor can operate. The table indicates that Ge is a better material than Si in this respect. However, Ge has four major shortcomings compared to silicon and gallium arsenide:\n# Its maximum temperature is limited.\n# It has relatively high [[Reverse leakage current|leakage current]].\n# It cannot withstand high voltages.\n# It is less suitable for fabricating integrated circuits.\nBecause the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar [[n\u2013p\u2013n transistor]] tends to be swifter than an equivalent [[p\u2013n\u2013p transistor]]. GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent{{When|date=May 2018}} FET development, the ''high-electron-mobility transistor'' ([[HEMT]]), has a [[heterojunction|heterostructure]] (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12&nbsp;GHz. HEMTs based on [[gallium nitride]] and [[aluminium gallium nitride]] (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.\n\n'Max. junction temperature' values represent a cross section taken from various manufacturers' data sheets. This temperature should not be exceeded or the transistor may be damaged.\n\n'Al\u2013Si junction' refers to the high-speed (aluminum\u2013silicon) metal\u2013semiconductor barrier diode, commonly known as a [[Schottky diode]]. This is included in the table because some silicon power IGFETs have a [[parasitic structure|parasitic]] reverse Schottky diode formed between the source and drain as part of the fabrication process. This diode can be a nuisance, but sometimes it is used in the circuit.\n\n===Packaging===\n{{See also|Semiconductor package|Chip carrier}}\n[[File:Transbauformen.jpg|thumb|Assorted discrete transistors]]\n[[File:Kt315b.jpg|thumb|Soviet [[KT315]]b transistors]]\n\nDiscrete transistors can be individually packaged transistors or unpackaged transistor chips (dice).\n\nTransistors come in many different [[semiconductor packages]] (see image). The two main categories are ''[[through-hole technology|through-hole]]'' (or ''leaded''), and ''surface-mount'', also known as ''surface-mount device'' ([[surface-mount technology|SMD]]). The ''ball grid array'' ([[Ball grid array|BGA]]) is the latest surface-mount package (currently only for large integrated circuits). It has solder \"balls\" on the underside in place of leads. Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power rating.\n\nTransistor packages are made of glass, metal, ceramic, or plastic. The package often dictates the power rating and frequency characteristics. Power transistors have larger packages that can be clamped to [[heat sink]]s for enhanced cooling. Additionally, most power transistors have the collector or drain physically connected to the metal enclosure. At the other extreme, some surface-mount ''microwave'' transistors are as small as grains of sand.\n\nOften a given transistor type is available in several packages. Transistor packages are mainly standardized, but the assignment of a transistor's functions to the terminals is not: other transistor types can assign other functions to the package's terminals. Even for the same transistor type the terminal assignment can vary (normally indicated by a suffix letter to the part number, q.e. BC212L and BC212K).\n\nNowadays most transistors come in a wide range of SMT packages, in comparison the list of available through-hole packages is relatively small, here is a short list of the most common through-hole transistors packages in alphabetical order:\nATV, E-line, MRT, HRT, SC-43, SC-72, TO-3, TO-18, TO-39, TO-92, TO-126, TO220, TO247, TO251, TO262, ZTX851.\n\nUnpackaged transistor chips (die) may be assembled into hybrid devices.<ref name=\"Greig\">{{cite book\n |last=Greig |first=William\n |date=2007-04-24\n |title=Integrated Circuit Packaging, Assembly and Interconnections\n |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g29xoTAyAMgC&pg=PA63&dq=hybrid+integrated+circuit#v=onepage&q=hybrid%20&f=false \n |page=63 \n |quote=A hybrid circuit is defined as an assembly containing both active semiconductor devices (packaged and unpackaged)|isbn=9780387339139\n }}</ref>  The [[IBM SLT]] module of the 1960s is one example of such a hybrid circuit module using glass passivated transistor (and diode) die.

It took place on 25 October 1415 ([[Saint Crispin's Day]]) near [[Azincourt]], in northern France.{{efn|Dates in the fifteenth century are difficult to reconcile with modern calendars: see {{harvnb|Barker|2015|pp=226\u2013228}} for the way the date of the battle was established.}} England's unexpected victory against the numerically superior French army boosted English morale and prestige, crippled France, and started a new period of English dominance in the war.\n\nAfter several decades of relative peace, the English had [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|renewed their war effort]] in 1415 amid the failure of negotiations with the French. In the ensuing campaign, many soldiers died from disease, and the English numbers dwindled; they tried to withdraw to [[Pale of Calais|English-held Calais]] but found their path blocked by a considerably larger French army. Despite the disadvantage, the following battle ended in an overwhelming tactical victory for the English.\n\nKing [[Henry V of England]] led his troops into battle and participated in hand-to-hand fighting. King [[Charles VI of France]] did not command the French army himself, as he suffered from psychotic illnesses and associated mental incapacity. Instead, the French were commanded by [[Grand Constable of France|Constable]] [[Charles I of Albret|Charles d'Albret]] and various prominent French noblemen of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac party]].  This battle is notable for the use of the [[English longbow]] in very large numbers, with the English and [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages|Welsh]] archers comprising nearly 80 percent of Henry's army.\n\nAgincourt is one of England's most celebrated victories and was one of the most important English triumphs in the Hundred Years' War, along with the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356). It forms the centrepiece of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599.\n\n==Contemporary accounts==\nThe Battle of Agincourt is well documented by at least seven contemporary accounts, three from eyewitnesses. The approximate location of the battle has never been disputed, and the site remains relatively unaltered after 600 years. \n\nImmediately after the battle, Henry summoned the [[herald]]s of the two armies who had watched the battle together with principal French herald Montjoie, and they settled on the name of the battle as ''Azincourt'', after the nearest fortified place.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=86}} Two of the most frequently cited accounts come from [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources, one from [[Jean Le F\u00e8vre de Saint-Remy]] who was present at the battle, and the other from [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]. The English eyewitness account comes from the anonymous ''Gesta Henrici Quinti'', believed to have been written by a [[chaplain]] in the King's household who would have been in the [[Wagon train|baggage train]] at the battle.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=22\u201326}} A recent re-appraisal of Henry's strategy of the Agincourt campaign incorporates these three accounts and argues that war was seen as a legal [[due process]] for solving the disagreement over claims to the French throne.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Honig|first1=Jan Willem|title=Reappraising Late Medieval Strategy: The Example of the 1415 Agincourt Campaign|journal=War in History|date=2012|volume=19|issue=123|pages=123\u2013151|doi=10.1177/0968344511432975}} {{pn|date=August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n{{Main article|Hundred Years' War}}\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather [[Edward III of England]], although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on [[Aquitaine]] and other French lands (the terms of the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]]).{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=14}} He initially called a [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the ensuing negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of [[John II of France|John II]] (who had been captured at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of [[Anjou]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Normandy]], and [[Touraine]], as well as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]. Henry would marry [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]'s young daughter, and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. \n\nThe French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415, negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=67\u201369}} In December 1414, the English [[Parliament of England|parliament]] was persuaded to grant Henry a \"double subsidy\", a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French. On 19 April 1415, Henry again asked the Great Council to sanction war with France, and this time they agreed.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=107, 114}}\n\n[[File:History of the Battle of Agincourt, and of the expedition of Henry the Fifth into France in 1415; to which is added the Roll of the men at arms in the English army (1833) (14586237139).jpg|thumb|1833 reconstruction of the banners flown by the armies at Agincourt]]\nHenry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415, carried by a fleet described by Shakespeare as \"a city on the inconstant billows dancing / For so appears this fleet majestical\".

The town surrendered on 22 September, and the English army did not leave until 8 October. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English army had suffered many casualties through disease. Rather than retire directly to England for the winter, with his costly expedition resulting in the capture of only one town, Henry decided to march most of his army (roughly 9,000) through [[Normandy]] to the port of [[Calais]], the English stronghold in northern France, to demonstrate by his presence in the territory at the head of an army that his right to rule in the duchy was more than a mere abstract legal and historical claim.{{sfn|Hibbert|1971|p=67}} He also intended the manoeuvre as a deliberate provocation to battle aimed at [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne|the dauphin]], who had failed to respond to Henry's personal challenge to combat at Harfleur.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=221}}\n\nDuring the siege, the French had raised an army which assembled around [[Rouen]]. This was not strictly a [[feudal]] army, but an army paid through a system similar to that of the English. The French hoped to raise 9,000 troops, but the army was not ready in time to relieve Harfleur. \n\nAfter Henry V marched to the north, the French moved to block them along the [[Somme river|River Somme]]. They were successful for a time, forcing Henry to move south, away from Calais, to find a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]. The English finally crossed the Somme south of [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|P\u00e9ronne]], at [[B\u00e9thencourt-sur-Somme|B\u00e9thencourt]] and [[Voyennes]]{{sfn|Wylie|Waugh|1914|p=118}}{{sfn|Seward|1999|p=162}} and resumed marching north. \n\nWithout a river obstacle to defend, the French were hesitant to force a battle. They shadowed Henry's army while calling a ''semonce des nobles'',<ref>{{cite web |title= Living Dictionary of the French Language|date=25 May 2013| url=http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/mot/semonce|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214091454/http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/mot/semonce |archivedate=14 December 2013}} {{verify source|date=August 2013}}</ref> calling on local nobles to join the army. By 24 October, both armies faced each other for battle, but the French declined, hoping for the arrival of more troops. The two armies spent the night of 24 October on open ground. The next day the French initiated negotiations as a delaying tactic, but Henry ordered his army to advance and to start a battle that, given the state of his army, he would have preferred to avoid, or to fight defensively: that was how [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and the other famous longbow victories had been won. The English had very little food, had marched {{convert|260|mi}} in two and a half weeks, were suffering from sickness such as [[dysentery]], and were greatly outnumbered by well-equipped French men-at-arms. The French army blocked Henry's way to the safety of Calais, and delaying battle would only further weaken his tired army and allow more French troops to arrive.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436\u2013437}}\n\n==Setting==\n===Battlefield===\nThe precise location of the battle is not known. It may be in the narrow strip of open land formed between the woods of [[Tramecourt]] and Azincourt (close to the modern village of [[Azincourt]]). However, the lack of archaeological evidence at this traditional site has led to suggestions it was fought to the west of Azincourt.<ref>Sutherland (2015)</ref> In 2019, the historian [[Michael Livingston]] also made the case for a site  west of Azincourt, based on a review of sources and early maps.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1= Michael|year= 2019|title=Where was Agincourt Fought? |journal=Medieval Warfare |volume=IX |issue= 1|pages=20\u201333 |issn= 2211-5129|author-link=Michael Livingston|url= |doi= }}</ref>\n\n===English deployment===\n[[File:Map Agincort.svg|thumb|The battle of Agincourt]]\nEarly on the 25th, Henry [[Military deployment|deployed]] his army (approximately 1,500 [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 7,000 [[English longbow|longbowmen]]) across a {{convert|750|yd|adj=on}} part of the [[defile (geography)|defile]]. The army was divided into three battalions, with the right wing led by [[Edward, Duke of York]], the centre led by the king himself, and the left wing under the old and experienced Baron [[Thomas Camoys, Baron Camoys|Thomas Camoys]]. The archers were commanded by Sir [[Thomas Erpingham]], another elderly veteran.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=454}} It is likely that the English adopted their usual battle line of longbowmen on either flank, with men-at-arms and knights in the centre. They might also have deployed some archers in the centre of the line. The English men-at-arms in plate and mail were placed shoulder to shoulder four deep. The English and Welsh archers on the flanks drove pointed wooden [[archer's stake|stakes]], or palings, into the ground at an angle to force [[cavalry]] to veer off. This use of stakes could have been inspired by the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] of 1396, where forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] used the tactic against French cavalry.{{efn|The first known use of angled stakes to thwart a mounted charge was at the Battle of Nicopolis, an engagement between European states and Turkish forces in 1396, twenty years before Agincourt. French knights, charging uphill, were unseated from their horses, either because their mounts were injured on the stakes or because they dismounted to uproot the obstacles, and were overpowered. News of the contrivance circulated within Europe and was described in a book of tactics written in 1411 by [[Jean le Maingre|Boucicault]], Marshal of France.{{sfn|Bennett|1994|pp=7, 15\u201316}} }}\n\nThe English made their [[Sacrament of Penance|confessions]] before the battle, as was customary.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=166}} Henry, worried about the enemy launching surprise raids, and wanting his troops to remain focused, ordered all his men to spend the night before the battle in silence, on pain of having an ear cut off. He told his men that he would rather die in the coming battle than be captured and [[ransom]]ed.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=269\u2013270}}\n\nHenry made a speech emphasising the justness of his cause, and reminding his army of previous great defeats the kings of England had inflicted on the French. The [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources have him concluding the speech by telling his men that the French had boasted that they would cut off two fingers from the right hand of every archer, so that he could never draw a longbow again.

The recently ploughed land hemmed in by dense woodland favoured the English, both because of its narrowness, and because of the thick mud through which the French knights had to walk.{{sfn|Wason|2004|p=74}}{{sfn|Holmes|1996|p=48}}\n\nAccounts of the battle describe the French engaging the English men-at-arms before being rushed from the sides by the longbowmen as the [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed. The English account in the ''Gesta Henrici'' says: \"For when some of them, killed when battle was first joined, fall at the front, so great was the undisciplined violence and pressure of the mass of men behind them that the living fell on top of the dead, and others falling on top of the living were killed as well.\"{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\n\nAlthough the French initially pushed the English back, they became so closely packed that they were described as having trouble using their weapons properly. The French monk of St. Denis says: \"Their vanguard, composed of about 5,000 men, found itself at first so tightly packed that those who were in the third rank could scarcely use their swords,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=107}}.</ref> and the Burgundian sources have a similar passage.\n\nRecent heavy rain made the battle field very muddy, proving very tiring to walk through in full [[plate armour]]. The French monk of St. Denis describes the French troops as \"marching through the middle of the mud where they sank up to their knees. So they were already overcome with fatigue even before they advanced against the enemy\". The deep, soft mud particularly favoured the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armoured French knights had a hard time getting back up to fight in the m\u00eal\u00e9e. Barker states that some knights, encumbered by their armour, actually drowned in their helmets.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=303}}\n\n==Fighting==\n===Opening moves===\n[[File:Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25th October 1415.PNG|thumb|''Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25 October 1415'', painted by Sir [[John Gilbert (painter)|John Gilbert]] in the 19th century]]\nOn the morning of 25 October, the French were still waiting for additional troops to arrive. The [[Anthony, Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]] (about 2,000 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} the [[Louis II of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]] (about 600 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} and the [[John VI, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] (6,000 men, according to Monstrelet),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=416}} were all marching to join the army.\n\nFor three hours after sunrise there was no fighting. Military textbooks of the time stated: \"Everywhere and on all occasions that foot soldiers march against their enemy face to face, those who march lose and those who remain standing still and holding firm win.\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=290}} On top of this, the French were expecting thousands of men to join them if they waited. They were blocking Henry's retreat, and were perfectly happy to wait for as long as it took. There had even been a suggestion that the English would run away rather than give battle when they saw that they would be fighting so many French princes.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=291}}\n\nHenry's men were already very weary from hunger, illness and retreat. Apparently Henry believed his fleeing army would perform better on the defensive, but had to halt the retreat and somehow engage the French\nbefore a defensive battle was possible.\n{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436\u2013437}} This entailed abandoning his chosen position and pulling out, advancing, and then re-installing the long sharpened wooden stakes pointed outwards toward the enemy, which helped protect the longbowmen from cavalry charges.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=90\u201391}} (The use of stakes was an innovation for the English: during the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], for example, the archers had been instead protected by pits and other obstacles.{{sfn|Bennett|1994}})\n\nThe tightness of the terrain also seems to have restricted the planned deployment of the French forces. The French had originally drawn up a battle plan that had archers and crossbowmen in front of their men-at-arms, with a cavalry force at the rear specifically designed to \"fall upon the archers, and use their force to break them,\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=275}} but in the event, the French archers and crossbowmen were deployed ''behind'' and to the sides of the men-at-arms (where they seem to have played almost no part, except possibly for an initial volley of arrows at the start of the battle). The cavalry force, which could have devastated the English line if it had attacked while they moved their stakes, charged only ''after'' the initial volley of arrows from the English. It is unclear whether the delay occurred because the French were hoping the English would launch a frontal assault (and were surprised when the English instead started shooting from their new defensive position), or whether the French mounted knights instead did not react quickly enough to the English advance. French chroniclers agree that when the mounted charge did come, it did not contain as many men as it should have; Gilles le Bouvier states that some had wandered off to warm themselves and others were walking or feeding their horses.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=294}}\n\n===French cavalry attack===\nThe French cavalry, despite being disorganised and not at full numbers, charged towards the longbowmen, but it was a disaster, with the French knights unable to outflank the longbowmen (because of the encroaching woodland) and unable to charge through the forest of sharpened stakes that protected the archers. [[John Keegan]] argues that the longbows' main influence on the battle at this point was injuries to horses: armoured only on the head, many horses would have become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation, long-range shots used as the charge started.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=92\u201396}} The mounted charge and subsequent retreat churned up the already muddy terrain between the French and the English. Juliet Barker quotes a contemporary account by a monk of [[Saint Denis Basilica|St. Denis]] who reports how the wounded and panicking horses galloped through the advancing infantry, scattering them and trampling them down in their headlong flight from the battlefield.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=297}}\n\n===Main French assault===\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415, by Sir John Gilbert in the 19th century.]]\nThe plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 1,000 yards or so to the English lines while being under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as \"a terrifying hail of arrow shot\". A complete coat of plate was considered such good protection that shields were generally not used,{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=109}} although the Burgundian contemporary sources distinguish between Frenchmen who used shields and those who did not, and Rogers has suggested that the front elements of the French force used axes and shields.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=90}} Modern historians are divided on how effective the longbows would have been against plate armour of the time. Modern test and contemporary accounts conclude that arrows could not penetrate the better quality steel armour, which became available to knights and men-at-arms of fairly modest means by the middle of the 14th century, but could penetrate the poorer quality [[wrought iron]] armour<ref>Nicolle, D.

Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yewwhjUYEPQ</ref>. Rogers suggested that the longbow could penetrate a wrought iron breastplate at short range and penetrate the thinner armour on the limbs even at {{convert|220|yd}}. He considered a knight in the best-quality steel armour invulnerable to an arrow on the breastplate or top of the helmet, but vulnerable to shots hitting the limbs, particularly at close range.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=110\u2013113}} In any case, to protect themselves as much as possible from the arrows, the French had to lower their visors and bend their helmeted heads to avoid being shot in the face, as the eye- and air-holes in their helmets were among the weakest points in the armour. This head-lowered position restricted their breathing and their vision. Then they had to walk a few hundred yards (metres) through thick mud and a press of comrades while wearing armour weighing {{convert|50|\u2013|60|lb}}, gathering sticky clay all the way. Increasingly, they had to walk around or over fallen comrades.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=301}}\n\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 57.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from Vigiles du roi Charles VII. The battle of Azincourt 1415.]]\nThe surviving French men-at-arms reached the front of the English line and pushed it back, with the longbowmen on the flanks continuing to shoot at point-blank range. When the archers ran out of arrows, they dropped their bows and using [[hatchet]]s, [[sword]]s and the [[mallet]]s they had used to drive their stakes in, attacked the now disordered, fatigued and wounded French men-at-arms massed in front of them. The French could not cope with the thousands of lightly armoured longbowmen assailants (who were much less hindered by the mud and weight of their armour) combined with the English men-at-arms. The impact of thousands of arrows, combined with the slog in heavy armour through the mud, the heat and difficulty breathing in plate armour with the visor down<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Askew |first1=Graham N. |last2=Formenti |first2=Federico|last3= Minetti|first3=Alberto E. |year=2012 |title=Limitations imposed by wearing armour on Medieval soldiers' locomotor performance |journal=Proc.

As the [[Melee|m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed, the French second line also joined the attack, but they too were swallowed up, with the narrow terrain meaning the extra numbers could not be used effectively. Rogers suggested that the French at the back of their deep formation would have been attempting to literally add their weight to the advance, without realising that they were hindering the ability of those at the front to manoeuvre and fight by pushing them into the English formation of lancepoints. After the initial wave, the French would have had to fight over and on the bodies of those who had fallen before them. In such a \"press\" of thousands of men, Rogers suggested that many could have suffocated in their armour, as was described by several sources, and which was also known to have happened in other battles.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=95\u201398}}\n\nThe French men-at-arms were taken prisoner or killed in the thousands. The fighting lasted about three hours, but eventually the leaders of the second line were killed or captured, as those of the first line had been. The English ''Gesta Henrici'' described three great heaps of the slain around the three main English standards.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\nAccording to contemporary English accounts, Henry fought hand to hand. Upon hearing that his youngest brother [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] had been wounded in the groin, Henry took his household guard and stood over his brother, in the front rank of the fighting, until Humphrey could be dragged to safety. The king received an axe blow to the head, which knocked off a piece of the crown that formed part of his helmet.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=443}}\n\n===Attack on the English baggage train===\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt.jpg|thumb|upright|1915 depiction of Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt : The King wears on this surcoat the Royal Arms of England, quartered with the Fleur de Lys of France as a symbol of his claim to the throne of France.]]\nThe only French success was an attack on the lightly protected English baggage train, with Ysembart d'Azincourt (leading a small number of men-at-arms and [[Squire|varlets]] plus about 600 peasants) seizing some of Henry's personal treasures, including a crown.{{sfn|Curry|2006|pp=207\u2013209}} Whether this was part of a deliberate French plan or an act of local [[brigandage]] is unclear from the sources. Certainly, d'Azincourt was a local knight but he might have been chosen to lead the attack because of his local knowledge and the lack of availability of a more senior soldier.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=311}} In some accounts the attack happened towards the end of the battle, and led the English to think they were being attacked from the rear. Barker, following the ''Gesta Henrici'', believed to have been written by an English chaplain who was actually in the baggage train, concluded that the attack happened at the ''start'' of the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=311}}\n\n===Henry executes the prisoners===\nRegardless of when the baggage assault happened, at some point after the initial English victory, Henry became alarmed that the French were regrouping for another attack. The ''Gesta Henrici'' places this after the English had overcome the onslaught of the French men-at-arms and the weary English troops were eyeing the French rearguard (\"in incomparable number and still fresh\").{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}} Le F\u00e8vre and Wavrin similarly say that it was signs of the French rearguard regrouping and \"marching forward in battle order\" which made the English think they were still in danger.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=163}} A slaughter of the French prisoners ensued. It seems it was purely a decision of Henry, since the English knights found it contrary to [[chivalry]], and contrary to their interests to kill valuable hostages for whom it was commonplace to ask [[ransom]]. Henry threatened to hang whoever did not obey his orders.\n\nIn any event, Henry ordered the slaughter of what were perhaps several thousand French prisoners, sparing only the highest ranked (presumably those most likely to fetch a large ransom under the chivalric system of warfare). According to most chroniclers, Henry's fear was that the prisoners (who, in an unusual turn of events, actually outnumbered their captors) would realise their advantage in numbers, rearm themselves with the weapons strewn about the field and overwhelm the exhausted English forces. Contemporary chroniclers did not criticise him for it.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=305\u2013308}} In his study of the battle [[John Keegan]] argued that the main aim was not to actually kill the French knights but rather to terrorise them into submission and quell any possibility they might resume the fight, which would probably have caused the uncommitted French reserve forces to join the fray, as well.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=107\u2013112}} Such an event would have posed a risk to the still-outnumbered English and could have easily turned a stunning victory into a mutually destructive defeat, as the English forces were now largely intermingled with the French and would have suffered grievously from the arrows of their own longbowmen had they needed to resume shooting. Keegan also speculated that due to the relatively low number of archers actually involved in killing the French knights (roughly 200 by his estimate), together with the refusal of the English knights to assist in a duty they saw as distastefully unchivalrous, and combined with the sheer difficulty of killing such a large number of prisoners in such a short space of time, the actual number of French prisoners put to death may not have been substantial before the French reserves fled the field and Henry rescinded the order.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=112}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe French had suffered a catastrophic defeat.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} In all, around 6,000 of their fighting men lay dead on the ground.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 121, 127}}{{sfn|Curry|2005|pp=187, 192, 233, 248}}{{sfn|Sumption|2015|pp=459, 461}} The list of casualties, one historian has noted, \"read like a roll call of the military and political leaders of the past generation\".{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} Among them were 90\u2013120 great lords and [[Knight banneret|banneret]]s killed, including{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 53, 93, 168, 169}} three dukes ([[John I, Duke of Alen\u00e7on|Alen\u00e7on]], [[Edward III of Bar|Bar]] and [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Brabant]]), nine counts ([[Henry II, Count of Bl\u00e2mont|Bl\u00e2mont]], [[Charles I of Albret|Dreux]], Fauquembergue, [[Edward II, Count of Grandpr\u00e9|Grandpr\u00e9]], [[Robert of Bar, Count of Marle|Marle]], [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Nevers]], [[John VI, Count of Roucy|Roucy]], Vaucourt, [[Frederick of Lorraine, Count of Vaud\u00e9mont|Vaud\u00e9mont]]) and one viscount ([[John of Bar|Puisaye]]), also an archbishop.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=325}} Of the great royal office holders, France lost its constable (Albret), an [[admiral of France|admiral]] (the [[Jacques de Ch\u00e2tillon de Dampierre|lord of Dampierre]]), the [[Master of Crossbowmen]] ([[David de Rambures]], dead along with three sons), Master of the Royal Household (Guichard Dauphin) and ''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t'' of the marshals.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=xxii, 325, 327}} According to the heralds, 3,069 knights and squires were killed,{{efn|As reported by [[Thomas Walsingham]].{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=53}} Other sources agree closely, citing 4,000 dead in this group.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=131, 182}} Reportedly 1,500 knights died.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 93}} }} while at least 2,600 more corpses were found without coats of arms to identify them.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} Entire noble families were wiped out in the male line, and in some regions an entire generation of landed nobility was annihilated.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=460}} The [[Bailiff (France)|bailiffs]] of nine major northern towns were killed, often along with their sons, relatives and supporters. In the words of Juliet Barker, the battle \"cut a great swath through the natural leaders of French society in [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Ponthieu]], [[Normandy]], [[Picardy]].\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=326\u2013327}}\n\nEstimates of the number of prisoners vary between 700 and 2,200, amongst them the dukes of [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[John I of Bourbon|Bourbon]], the counts of [[Charles of Artois, Count of Eu|Eu]], [[Louis, Count of Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me]], [[Arthur de Richemont|Richemont]] (brother of the [[John V, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] and stepbrother of Henry V) and [[John VII of Harcourt|Harcourt]], and marshal [[Jean Le Maingre]].{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=337, 367, 368}} Record evidence identifies at least 112 Englishmen killed in the fighting,{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=324}} while [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet|Monstrelet]] reported 600 English dead.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} These included the [[Edward, 2nd Duke of York|Duke of York]], the young [[Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]] and the Welsh esquire [[Dafydd Gam|Dafydd (\"Davy\") Gam]].\n\nAlthough the victory had been militarily decisive, its impact was complex. It did not lead to further English conquests immediately as Henry's priority was to return to England, which he did on 16 November, to be received in [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in London on the 23rd.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=475, 479}} Henry returned a conquering hero, seen as blessed by God in the eyes of his subjects and European powers outside France. It established the legitimacy of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian monarchy]] and the future campaigns of Henry to pursue his \"rights and privileges\" in France.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=547\u2013549}} Other benefits to the English were longer term. Very quickly after the battle, the fragile truce between the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] and [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundian]] factions broke down. The brunt of the battle had fallen on the Armagnacs and it was they who suffered the majority of senior casualties and carried the blame for the defeat. The Burgundians seized on the opportunity and within 10 days of the battle had mustered their armies and marched on Paris.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=358}} This lack of unity in France allowed Henry eighteen months to prepare militarily and politically for a renewed campaign. When that campaign took place, it was made easier by the damage done to the political and military structures of Normandy by the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=385}}\n\n==Numbers at Agincourt==\n[[Anne Curry]] in her 2005 book ''Agincourt: A New History'', argues (based on research into the surviving administrative records) that the French army was about 12,000 strong, and the English army about 9,000, giving proportions of four to three.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=192}} By contrast, [[Juliet Barker]], in her book ''Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle'' (also published in 2005) argues the English and Welsh were outnumbered \"at least four to one and possibly as much as six to one\".{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=x}} She suggests figures of about 6,000 for the English and 36,000 for the French, based on the ''Gesta Henrici''{{'}}s figures of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms for the English, and [[Jean de Wavrin]]'s statement \"that the French were six times more numerous than the English\".{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=274}} The 2009 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' uses the figures of about 6,000 for the English and 20,000 to 30,000 for the French. The 1911 ''Britannica'' use somewhat different figures of 6,000 archers, 1,000 men-at-arms and \"a few thousands of other foot\" for the English, with the French outnumbering them by \"at least four times\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=375}}\n\nWhile not necessarily agreeing with the exact numbers Curry uses, Bertrand Schnerb, a professor of medieval history at the University of Lille, states the French probably had 12,000\u201315,000 troops.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}} Ian Mortimer, in his 2009 book ''1415: Henry V's Year of Glory'', notes how Curry \"minimises French numbers (by limiting her figures to those in the basic army and a few specific additional companies) and maximises English numbers (by assuming the numbers sent home from Harfleur were no greater than sick lists)\", but agrees that previous estimates have exaggerated the odds, and suggests that \"the most extreme imbalance which is credible is fifteen thousand French troops against 8,100 English: a ratio of about two-to-one\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=566}}\n\nHowever, Clifford J. Rogers, professor of history at the United States Military Academy at West Point, has recently argued that archival records are too incomplete to substantially change his view that the English were outnumbered about 4\u20131.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}}{{sfn|Rogers|2008a|pp=114\u2013121}} Juliet Barker also disagrees with Curry's arguments in the acknowledgements section of her 2005 book on Agincourt, saying: \"Surviving administrative records on both sides, but especially the French, are simply too incomplete to support [Curry's] assertion that nine thousand English were pitted against an army only twelve thousand strong. And if the differential really was as low as three to four then this makes a nonsense of the course of the battle as described by eyewitnesses and contemporaries.\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=xvi}}\n\nThose supporting a greater imbalance have generally put more store by contemporary (and especially eyewitness) accounts. The ''Gesta Henrici'' gives plausible figures for the English of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms, but Mortimer notes it is \"wildly inaccurate\" in stating the English were outnumbered 30\u20131, and there have also been doubts as to how much it was written as propaganda for Henry V. The proportions also seem incorrect, as from surviving records we know that Henry set out with about four times as many archers as men-at-arms, not five and a half times as many. Those who have supported the Gesta figures for the English army have generally thought that although the English army may have left Harfleur with eight or nine thousand men, it is plausible that after weeks of campaigning and disease in hostile territory they would have lost two or three thousand fighting men; however Mortimer states: \"Despite the trials of the march, Henry had lost very few men to illness or death; and we have independent testimony that no more than 160 had been captured on the way.\"{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}}\n\nAs Mortimer notes, the Burgundian numbers for the size of the French vanguard of 8,000 men-at-arms in the vanguard with 1,400 (or 2,400) men-at-arms in the wings correspond roughly with the figures of ten thousand men-at-arms recorded by the duke of Berry's herald. The Burgundians also recorded 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the \"vanguard\", which would suggest \"fourteen or fifteen thousand fighting men\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}} The Burgundians actually give the total size of the French army as an implausible 50,000,{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} and the numbers they use do not correspond closely to the odds they describe. Using very similar numbers, Jean Le Fevre states that the English were outnumbered 3\u20131, whereas Wavrin states that the English were outnumbered 6\u20131.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=157}}\n\nOne particular cause of confusion may have been the number of servants on both sides. Mortimer suggests that because there were a much higher proportion of men-at-arms on the French side, the number of non-combatants was much higher. Each man-at-arms could be expected to have a page, who would have ridden one of his spare horses. If the French army had an extra 10,000 mounted men (as opposed to only 1,500 extra for the English), then \"the English probably did see an army about three times the size of their own fighting force\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\nIt is open to debate whether these should all be counted as non-combatants; Rogers (for example) accepts that the French probably had about 10,000 men-at-arms, but explicitly includes one \"gros valet\" (an armed, armoured and mounted military servant) per French man-at-arms in his calculation of the odds.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n==Popular representations==\n[[File:Agincourtcarol.jpg|thumb|The 15th century [[Agincourt Carol]]]]\nThe battle remains an important symbol in popular culture. Some notable examples are listed below.\n===Music===\nSoon after the  victory at Agincourt, a number of popular folk songs were created about the battle, the most famous being the \"[[Agincourt Carol]]\", produced in the first half of the 15th century.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=280\u2013283}} Other ballads followed, including \"[[King Henry Fifth's Conquest of France]]\", raising the popular prominence of particular events mentioned only in passing by the original chroniclers, such as the gift of tennis balls before the campaign.{{sfn|Woolf|2003|p=323}}\n\n===Literature===\nThe most famous cultural depiction of the battle today is [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599. The play focuses on the pressures of kingship, the tensions between how a king should ''appear'' \u2013 chivalric, honest, and just \u2013 and how a king must sometimes ''act'' \u2013 [[Machiavelli]]an and ruthless.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=15}} Shakespeare illustrates these tensions by depicting Henry's decision to kill some of the French prisoners, whilst attempting to justify it and distance himself from the event. This moment of the battle is portrayed both as a break with the traditions of chivalry and as key example of the paradox of kingship.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nShakespeare's depiction of the battle also plays on the theme of modernity. He contrasts the modern, English king and his army with the medieval, chivalric, older model of the French.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=20}}\n\nShakespeare's play presented Henry as leading a truly English force into battle, playing on the importance of the link between the monarch and the common soldiers in the fight.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=16}} The original play does not, however, feature any scenes of the actual battle itself, leading critic Rose Zimbardo to characterise it as \"full of warfare, yet empty of conflict.\"{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=193}}\n\nThe play introduced the famous [[St Crispin's Day Speech]], considered one of Shakespeare's most heroic speeches, which Henry delivers movingly to his soldiers just before the battle, urging his \"band of brothers\" to stand together in the forthcoming fight.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}} Critic David Margolies describes how it \"oozes honour, military glory, love of country and self-sacrifice\", and forms one of the first instances of English literature linking solidarity and comradeship to success in battle.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}}{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=31}} Partially as a result, the battle was used as a metaphor at the beginning of the [[First World War]], when the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s attempts to stop the German advances were widely likened to it.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=183}}\n\n===Films===\nShakespeare's version of the battle of Agincourt has been turned into several minor and two major films. The latter, each titled ''Henry V'', star [[Laurence Olivier]] in [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] in [[Henry V (1989 film)|1989]]. Made just prior to the invasion of Normandy, Olivier's rendition gives the battle what Sarah Hatchuel has termed an \"exhilarating and heroic\" tone, with an artificial, cinematic look to the battle scenes.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|pp=194\u2013195}} Branagh's version gives a longer, more [[Realism (arts)|realist]] portrayal of the battle itself, drawing on both historical sources and images from the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Falkland War]]s.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=195}} \n\nIn his 2007 film adaptation, director Peter Babakitis uses digital effects to exaggerate realist features during the battle scenes, producing a more ''[[Experimental film|avant-garde]]'' interpretation of the fighting at Agincourt.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=200}} The battle also forms a central component of the 2019 Netflix film [[The King (2019 film)|''The King'']] (2019).\n\n===Mock trial===\nIn March 2010, a mock trial of Henry V for the crimes associated with the slaughter of the prisoners was held in Washington, D.C., drawing from both the historical record and Shakespeare's play. Participating as judges were Justices [[Samuel Alito]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The trial ranged widely over whether there was just cause for war and not simply the prisoner issue. Although an audience vote was \"too close to call\", Henry was unanimously found guilty by the court on the basis of \"evolving standards of civil society\".<ref name=\"mock-trial-cspan\">{{cite web | url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/221111 | title=Judgment at Agincourt | date=16 March 2010 | website=[[C-SPAN]] }} link to video</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-cd\">{{cite web | url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2010/03/18/high-court-rules-for-french-at-agincourt/ | title=High Court Rules for French at Agincourt | website=DC Theater Scene | first=Tim | last=Treanor | date=18 March 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-lawj\">{{cite web | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446381186 | title=High Court Justices, Legal Luminaries Debate Shakespeare's 'Henry V' | last=Jones | first=Andy | website=[[National Law Journal]] | date=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|AGINCOURT.hto3.jpg|1100px|Battlefield today|left}}\n\n==Azincourt today==\n[[File:Agincourt Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|Agincourt Memorial]]\n[[File:Agincourt archers memorial.jpg|thumb|A list of English archers killed at Azincourt, as recorded in the village's museum]]\nThere is a modern museum in Azincourt village dedicated to the battle.<ref>[http://illucolor.fr/7_vallees_comm/Azincourt/index.html Agincourt Museum]</ref> The museum lists the names of combatants of both sides who died in the battle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[V sign]], for more on the \"two-finger salute\" which legends claim derives from the gestures of longbowmen fighting in the English army at the battle of Agincourt.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=y}}\n* {{cite book |last=Adams |first=Michael C. |year=2002 |title=Echoes of War: A Thousand Years of Military History in Popular Culture |url = https://books.google.com/?id=dDqWvwezm0YC&printsec=frontcover |publisher=University of Kentucky Press |isbn=978-0-8131-2240-3 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Barker |date=2015 |first=Juliet |title=Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle |trans-title=''US title:'' Agincourt: Henry V and the Battle that Made England |edition=revised and updated |publisher=Abacus |place=London |origyear=2005 |isbn=978-0-349-11918-2 |url={{googlebooks|QDVTKcmqHjcC|plainurl=y}} |authorlink=Juliet Barker |ref=harv}}\n<!-- Book not cited in text* {{cite book |last=Bennett |first=M. |authorlink=Matthew Bennett (historian) |date=23 May 1991 |title=Agincourt 1415: Triumph against the odds |url= |series=Campaign |volume=9 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1-85532-132-8 |ref=harv }}-->\n* {{cite book |last=Bennett |first=M. |authorlink=Matthew Bennett (historian) |year=1994 |chapter=The Development of Battle Tactics in the Hundred Years War |chapterurl = http://concours.histegeo.org/Battle_Tactics.pdf |editor=Anne Curry |editorlink=Anne Curry |editor2=Michael L.

It took place on 25 October 1415 ([[Saint Crispin's Day]]) near [[Azincourt]], in northern France.{{efn|Dates in the fifteenth century are difficult to reconcile with modern calendars: see {{harvnb|Barker|2015|pp=226\u2013228}} for the way the date of the battle was established.}} England's unexpected victory against the numerically superior French army boosted English morale and prestige, crippled France, and started a new period of English dominance in the war.\n\nAfter several decades of relative peace, the English had [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|renewed their war effort]] in 1415 amid the failure of negotiations with the French. In the ensuing campaign, many soldiers died from disease, and the English numbers dwindled; they tried to withdraw to [[Pale of Calais|English-held Calais]] but found their path blocked by a considerably larger French army. Despite the disadvantage, the following battle ended in an overwhelming tactical victory for the English.\n\nKing [[Henry V of England]] led his troops into battle and participated in hand-to-hand fighting. King [[Charles VI of France]] did not command the French army himself, as he suffered from psychotic illnesses and associated mental incapacity. Instead, the French were commanded by [[Grand Constable of France|Constable]] [[Charles I of Albret|Charles d'Albret]] and various prominent French noblemen of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac party]].  This battle is notable for the use of the [[English longbow]] in very large numbers, with the English and [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages|Welsh]] archers comprising nearly 80 percent of Henry's army.\n\nAgincourt is one of England's most celebrated victories and was one of the most important English triumphs in the Hundred Years' War, along with the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356). It forms the centrepiece of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599.\n\n==Contemporary accounts==\nThe Battle of Agincourt is well documented by at least seven contemporary accounts, three from eyewitnesses. The approximate location of the battle has never been disputed, and the site remains relatively unaltered after 600 years. \n\nImmediately after the battle, Henry summoned the [[herald]]s of the two armies who had watched the battle together with principal French herald Montjoie, and they settled on the name of the battle as ''Azincourt'', after the nearest fortified place.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=86}} Two of the most frequently cited accounts come from [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources, one from [[Jean Le F\u00e8vre de Saint-Remy]] who was present at the battle, and the other from [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]. The English eyewitness account comes from the anonymous ''Gesta Henrici Quinti'', believed to have been written by a [[chaplain]] in the King's household who would have been in the [[Wagon train|baggage train]] at the battle.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=22\u201326}} A recent re-appraisal of Henry's strategy of the Agincourt campaign incorporates these three accounts and argues that war was seen as a legal [[due process]] for solving the disagreement over claims to the French throne.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Honig|first1=Jan Willem|title=Reappraising Late Medieval Strategy: The Example of the 1415 Agincourt Campaign|journal=War in History|date=2012|volume=19|issue=123|pages=123\u2013151|doi=10.1177/0968344511432975}} {{pn|date=August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n{{Main article|Hundred Years' War}}\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather [[Edward III of England]], although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on [[Aquitaine]] and other French lands (the terms of the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]]).{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=14}} He initially called a [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the ensuing negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of [[John II of France|John II]] (who had been captured at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of [[Anjou]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Normandy]], and [[Touraine]], as well as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]. Henry would marry [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]'s young daughter, and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. \n\nThe French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415, negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=67\u201369}} In December 1414, the English [[Parliament of England|parliament]] was persuaded to grant Henry a \"double subsidy\", a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French. On 19 April 1415, Henry again asked the Great Council to sanction war with France, and this time they agreed.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=107, 114}}\n\n[[File:History of the Battle of Agincourt, and of the expedition of Henry the Fifth into France in 1415; to which is added the Roll of the men at arms in the English army (1833) (14586237139).jpg|thumb|1833 reconstruction of the banners flown by the armies at Agincourt]]\nHenry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415, carried by a fleet described by Shakespeare as \"a city on the inconstant billows dancing / For so appears this fleet majestical\".

The town surrendered on 22 September, and the English army did not leave until 8 October. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English army had suffered many casualties through disease. Rather than retire directly to England for the winter, with his costly expedition resulting in the capture of only one town, Henry decided to march most of his army (roughly 9,000) through [[Normandy]] to the port of [[Calais]], the English stronghold in northern France, to demonstrate by his presence in the territory at the head of an army that his right to rule in the duchy was more than a mere abstract legal and historical claim.{{sfn|Hibbert|1971|p=67}} He also intended the manoeuvre as a deliberate provocation to battle aimed at [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne|the dauphin]], who had failed to respond to Henry's personal challenge to combat at Harfleur.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=221}}\n\nDuring the siege, the French had raised an army which assembled around [[Rouen]]. This was not strictly a [[feudal]] army, but an army paid through a system similar to that of the English. The French hoped to raise 9,000 troops, but the army was not ready in time to relieve Harfleur. \n\nAfter Henry V marched to the north, the French moved to block them along the [[Somme river|River Somme]]. They were successful for a time, forcing Henry to move south, away from Calais, to find a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]. The English finally crossed the Somme south of [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|P\u00e9ronne]], at [[B\u00e9thencourt-sur-Somme|B\u00e9thencourt]] and [[Voyennes]]{{sfn|Wylie|Waugh|1914|p=118}}{{sfn|Seward|1999|p=162}} and resumed marching north. \n\nWithout a river obstacle to defend, the French were hesitant to force a battle.

By 24 October, both armies faced each other for battle, but the French declined, hoping for the arrival of more troops. The two armies spent the night of 24 October on open ground. The next day the French initiated negotiations as a delaying tactic, but Henry ordered his army to advance and to start a battle that, given the state of his army, he would have preferred to avoid, or to fight defensively: that was how [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and the other famous longbow victories had been won. The English had very little food, had marched {{convert|260|mi}} in two and a half weeks, were suffering from sickness such as [[dysentery]], and were greatly outnumbered by well-equipped French men-at-arms. The French army blocked Henry's way to the safety of Calais, and delaying battle would only further weaken his tired army and allow more French troops to arrive.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436\u2013437}}\n\n==Setting==\n===Battlefield===\nThe precise location of the battle is not known. It may be in the narrow strip of open land formed between the woods of [[Tramecourt]] and Azincourt (close to the modern village of [[Azincourt]]). However, the lack of archaeological evidence at this traditional site has led to suggestions it was fought to the west of Azincourt.<ref>Sutherland (2015)</ref> In 2019, the historian [[Michael Livingston]] also made the case for a site  west of Azincourt, based on a review of sources and early maps.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1= Michael|year= 2019|title=Where was Agincourt Fought? |journal=Medieval Warfare |volume=IX |issue= 1|pages=20\u201333 |issn= 2211-5129|author-link=Michael Livingston|url= |doi= }}</ref>\n\n===English deployment===\n[[File:Map Agincort.svg|thumb|The battle of Agincourt]]\nEarly on the 25th, Henry [[Military deployment|deployed]] his army (approximately 1,500 [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 7,000 [[English longbow|longbowmen]]) across a {{convert|750|yd|adj=on}} part of the [[defile (geography)|defile]]. The army was divided into three battalions, with the right wing led by [[Edward, Duke of York]], the centre led by the king himself, and the left wing under the old and experienced Baron [[Thomas Camoys, Baron Camoys|Thomas Camoys]]. The archers were commanded by Sir [[Thomas Erpingham]], another elderly veteran.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=454}} It is likely that the English adopted their usual battle line of longbowmen on either flank, with men-at-arms and knights in the centre. They might also have deployed some archers in the centre of the line. The English men-at-arms in plate and mail were placed shoulder to shoulder four deep. The English and Welsh archers on the flanks drove pointed wooden [[archer's stake|stakes]], or palings, into the ground at an angle to force [[cavalry]] to veer off. This use of stakes could have been inspired by the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] of 1396, where forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] used the tactic against French cavalry.{{efn|The first known use of angled stakes to thwart a mounted charge was at the Battle of Nicopolis, an engagement between European states and Turkish forces in 1396, twenty years before Agincourt. French knights, charging uphill, were unseated from their horses, either because their mounts were injured on the stakes or because they dismounted to uproot the obstacles, and were overpowered. News of the contrivance circulated within Europe and was described in a book of tactics written in 1411 by [[Jean le Maingre|Boucicault]], Marshal of France.{{sfn|Bennett|1994|pp=7, 15\u201316}} }}\n\nThe English made their [[Sacrament of Penance|confessions]] before the battle, as was customary.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=166}} Henry, worried about the enemy launching surprise raids, and wanting his troops to remain focused, ordered all his men to spend the night before the battle in silence, on pain of having an ear cut off. He told his men that he would rather die in the coming battle than be captured and [[ransom]]ed.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=269\u2013270}}\n\nHenry made a speech emphasising the justness of his cause, and reminding his army of previous great defeats the kings of England had inflicted on the French. The [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources have him concluding the speech by telling his men that the French had boasted that they would cut off two fingers from the right hand of every archer, so that he could never draw a longbow again.

The recently ploughed land hemmed in by dense woodland favoured the English, both because of its narrowness, and because of the thick mud through which the French knights had to walk.{{sfn|Wason|2004|p=74}}{{sfn|Holmes|1996|p=48}}\n\nAccounts of the battle describe the French engaging the English men-at-arms before being rushed from the sides by the longbowmen as the [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed. The English account in the ''Gesta Henrici'' says: \"For when some of them, killed when battle was first joined, fall at the front, so great was the undisciplined violence and pressure of the mass of men behind them that the living fell on top of the dead, and others falling on top of the living were killed as well.\"{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\n\nAlthough the French initially pushed the English back, they became so closely packed that they were described as having trouble using their weapons properly. The French monk of St. Denis says: \"Their vanguard, composed of about 5,000 men, found itself at first so tightly packed that those who were in the third rank could scarcely use their swords,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=107}}.</ref> and the Burgundian sources have a similar passage.\n\nRecent heavy rain made the battle field very muddy, proving very tiring to walk through in full [[plate armour]]. The French monk of St. Denis describes the French troops as \"marching through the middle of the mud where they sank up to their knees. So they were already overcome with fatigue even before they advanced against the enemy\". The deep, soft mud particularly favoured the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armoured French knights had a hard time getting back up to fight in the m\u00eal\u00e9e. Barker states that some knights, encumbered by their armour, actually drowned in their helmets.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=303}}\n\n==Fighting==\n===Opening moves===\n[[File:Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25th October 1415.PNG|thumb|''Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25 October 1415'', painted by Sir [[John Gilbert (painter)|John Gilbert]] in the 19th century]]\nOn the morning of 25 October, the French were still waiting for additional troops to arrive. The [[Anthony, Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]] (about 2,000 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} the [[Louis II of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]] (about 600 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} and the [[John VI, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] (6,000 men, according to Monstrelet),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=416}} were all marching to join the army.\n\nFor three hours after sunrise there was no fighting. Military textbooks of the time stated: \"Everywhere and on all occasions that foot soldiers march against their enemy face to face, those who march lose and those who remain standing still and holding firm win.\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=290}} On top of this, the French were expecting thousands of men to join them if they waited. They were blocking Henry's retreat, and were perfectly happy to wait for as long as it took. There had even been a suggestion that the English would run away rather than give battle when they saw that they would be fighting so many French princes.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=291}}\n\nHenry's men were already very weary from hunger, illness and retreat. Apparently Henry believed his fleeing army would perform better on the defensive, but had to halt the retreat and somehow engage the French\nbefore a defensive battle was possible.\n{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436\u2013437}} This entailed abandoning his chosen position and pulling out, advancing, and then re-installing the long sharpened wooden stakes pointed outwards toward the enemy, which helped protect the longbowmen from cavalry charges.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=90\u201391}} (The use of stakes was an innovation for the English: during the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], for example, the archers had been instead protected by pits and other obstacles.{{sfn|Bennett|1994}})\n\nThe tightness of the terrain also seems to have restricted the planned deployment of the French forces. The French had originally drawn up a battle plan that had archers and crossbowmen in front of their men-at-arms, with a cavalry force at the rear specifically designed to \"fall upon the archers, and use their force to break them,\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=275}} but in the event, the French archers and crossbowmen were deployed ''behind'' and to the sides of the men-at-arms (where they seem to have played almost no part, except possibly for an initial volley of arrows at the start of the battle). The cavalry force, which could have devastated the English line if it had attacked while they moved their stakes, charged only ''after'' the initial volley of arrows from the English. It is unclear whether the delay occurred because the French were hoping the English would launch a frontal assault (and were surprised when the English instead started shooting from their new defensive position), or whether the French mounted knights instead did not react quickly enough to the English advance. French chroniclers agree that when the mounted charge did come, it did not contain as many men as it should have; Gilles le Bouvier states that some had wandered off to warm themselves and others were walking or feeding their horses.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=294}}\n\n===French cavalry attack===\nThe French cavalry, despite being disorganised and not at full numbers, charged towards the longbowmen, but it was a disaster, with the French knights unable to outflank the longbowmen (because of the encroaching woodland) and unable to charge through the forest of sharpened stakes that protected the archers. [[John Keegan]] argues that the longbows' main influence on the battle at this point was injuries to horses: armoured only on the head, many horses would have become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation, long-range shots used as the charge started.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=92\u201396}} The mounted charge and subsequent retreat churned up the already muddy terrain between the French and the English. Juliet Barker quotes a contemporary account by a monk of [[Saint Denis Basilica|St. Denis]] who reports how the wounded and panicking horses galloped through the advancing infantry, scattering them and trampling them down in their headlong flight from the battlefield.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=297}}\n\n===Main French assault===\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415, by Sir John Gilbert in the 19th century.]]\nThe plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 1,000 yards or so to the English lines while being under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as \"a terrifying hail of arrow shot\". A complete coat of plate was considered such good protection that shields were generally not used,{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=109}} although the Burgundian contemporary sources distinguish between Frenchmen who used shields and those who did not, and Rogers has suggested that the front elements of the French force used axes and shields.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=90}} Modern historians are divided on how effective the longbows would have been against plate armour of the time. Modern test and contemporary accounts conclude that arrows could not penetrate the better quality steel armour, which became available to knights and men-at-arms of fairly modest means by the middle of the 14th century, but could penetrate the poorer quality [[wrought iron]] armour<ref>Nicolle, D.

Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yewwhjUYEPQ</ref>. Rogers suggested that the longbow could penetrate a wrought iron breastplate at short range and penetrate the thinner armour on the limbs even at {{convert|220|yd}}. He considered a knight in the best-quality steel armour invulnerable to an arrow on the breastplate or top of the helmet, but vulnerable to shots hitting the limbs, particularly at close range.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=110\u2013113}} In any case, to protect themselves as much as possible from the arrows, the French had to lower their visors and bend their helmeted heads to avoid being shot in the face, as the eye- and air-holes in their helmets were among the weakest points in the armour. This head-lowered position restricted their breathing and their vision. Then they had to walk a few hundred yards (metres) through thick mud and a press of comrades while wearing armour weighing {{convert|50|\u2013|60|lb}}, gathering sticky clay all the way. Increasingly, they had to walk around or over fallen comrades.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=301}}\n\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 57.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from Vigiles du roi Charles VII. The battle of Azincourt 1415.]]\nThe surviving French men-at-arms reached the front of the English line and pushed it back, with the longbowmen on the flanks continuing to shoot at point-blank range. When the archers ran out of arrows, they dropped their bows and using [[hatchet]]s, [[sword]]s and the [[mallet]]s they had used to drive their stakes in, attacked the now disordered, fatigued and wounded French men-at-arms massed in front of them. The French could not cope with the thousands of lightly armoured longbowmen assailants (who were much less hindered by the mud and weight of their armour) combined with the English men-at-arms. The impact of thousands of arrows, combined with the slog in heavy armour through the mud, the heat and difficulty breathing in plate armour with the visor down<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Askew |first1=Graham N. |last2=Formenti |first2=Federico|last3= Minetti|first3=Alberto E. |year=2012 |title=Limitations imposed by wearing armour on Medieval soldiers' locomotor performance |journal=Proc.

As the [[Melee|m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed, the French second line also joined the attack, but they too were swallowed up, with the narrow terrain meaning the extra numbers could not be used effectively. Rogers suggested that the French at the back of their deep formation would have been attempting to literally add their weight to the advance, without realising that they were hindering the ability of those at the front to manoeuvre and fight by pushing them into the English formation of lancepoints. After the initial wave, the French would have had to fight over and on the bodies of those who had fallen before them. In such a \"press\" of thousands of men, Rogers suggested that many could have suffocated in their armour, as was described by several sources, and which was also known to have happened in other battles.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=95\u201398}}\n\nThe French men-at-arms were taken prisoner or killed in the thousands. The fighting lasted about three hours, but eventually the leaders of the second line were killed or captured, as those of the first line had been. The English ''Gesta Henrici'' described three great heaps of the slain around the three main English standards.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\nAccording to contemporary English accounts, Henry fought hand to hand. Upon hearing that his youngest brother [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] had been wounded in the groin, Henry took his household guard and stood over his brother, in the front rank of the fighting, until Humphrey could be dragged to safety. The king received an axe blow to the head, which knocked off a piece of the crown that formed part of his helmet.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=443}}\n\n===Attack on the English baggage train===\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt.jpg|thumb|upright|1915 depiction of Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt : The King wears on this surcoat the Royal Arms of England, quartered with the Fleur de Lys of France as a symbol of his claim to the throne of France.]]\nThe only French success was an attack on the lightly protected English baggage train, with Ysembart d'Azincourt (leading a small number of men-at-arms and [[Squire|varlets]] plus about 600 peasants) seizing some of Henry's personal treasures, including a crown.{{sfn|Curry|2006|pp=207\u2013209}} Whether this was part of a deliberate French plan or an act of local [[brigandage]] is unclear from the sources. Certainly, d'Azincourt was a local knight but he might have been chosen to lead the attack because of his local knowledge and the lack of availability of a more senior soldier.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=311}} In some accounts the attack happened towards the end of the battle, and led the English to think they were being attacked from the rear. Barker, following the ''Gesta Henrici'', believed to have been written by an English chaplain who was actually in the baggage train, concluded that the attack happened at the ''start'' of the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=311}}\n\n===Henry executes the prisoners===\nRegardless of when the baggage assault happened, at some point after the initial English victory, Henry became alarmed that the French were regrouping for another attack. The ''Gesta Henrici'' places this after the English had overcome the onslaught of the French men-at-arms and the weary English troops were eyeing the French rearguard (\"in incomparable number and still fresh\").{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}} Le F\u00e8vre and Wavrin similarly say that it was signs of the French rearguard regrouping and \"marching forward in battle order\" which made the English think they were still in danger.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=163}} A slaughter of the French prisoners ensued. It seems it was purely a decision of Henry, since the English knights found it contrary to [[chivalry]], and contrary to their interests to kill valuable hostages for whom it was commonplace to ask [[ransom]]. Henry threatened to hang whoever did not obey his orders.\n\nIn any event, Henry ordered the slaughter of what were perhaps several thousand French prisoners, sparing only the highest ranked (presumably those most likely to fetch a large ransom under the chivalric system of warfare). According to most chroniclers, Henry's fear was that the prisoners (who, in an unusual turn of events, actually outnumbered their captors) would realise their advantage in numbers, rearm themselves with the weapons strewn about the field and overwhelm the exhausted English forces. Contemporary chroniclers did not criticise him for it.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=305\u2013308}} In his study of the battle [[John Keegan]] argued that the main aim was not to actually kill the French knights but rather to terrorise them into submission and quell any possibility they might resume the fight, which would probably have caused the uncommitted French reserve forces to join the fray, as well.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=107\u2013112}} Such an event would have posed a risk to the still-outnumbered English and could have easily turned a stunning victory into a mutually destructive defeat, as the English forces were now largely intermingled with the French and would have suffered grievously from the arrows of their own longbowmen had they needed to resume shooting. Keegan also speculated that due to the relatively low number of archers actually involved in killing the French knights (roughly 200 by his estimate), together with the refusal of the English knights to assist in a duty they saw as distastefully unchivalrous, and combined with the sheer difficulty of killing such a large number of prisoners in such a short space of time, the actual number of French prisoners put to death may not have been substantial before the French reserves fled the field and Henry rescinded the order.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=112}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe French had suffered a catastrophic defeat.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} In all, around 6,000 of their fighting men lay dead on the ground.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 121, 127}}{{sfn|Curry|2005|pp=187, 192, 233, 248}}{{sfn|Sumption|2015|pp=459, 461}} The list of casualties, one historian has noted, \"read like a roll call of the military and political leaders of the past generation\".{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} Among them were 90\u2013120 great lords and [[Knight banneret|banneret]]s killed, including{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 53, 93, 168, 169}} three dukes ([[John I, Duke of Alen\u00e7on|Alen\u00e7on]], [[Edward III of Bar|Bar]] and [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Brabant]]), nine counts ([[Henry II, Count of Bl\u00e2mont|Bl\u00e2mont]], [[Charles I of Albret|Dreux]], Fauquembergue, [[Edward II, Count of Grandpr\u00e9|Grandpr\u00e9]], [[Robert of Bar, Count of Marle|Marle]], [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Nevers]], [[John VI, Count of Roucy|Roucy]], Vaucourt, [[Frederick of Lorraine, Count of Vaud\u00e9mont|Vaud\u00e9mont]]) and one viscount ([[John of Bar|Puisaye]]), also an archbishop.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=325}} Of the great royal office holders, France lost its constable (Albret), an [[admiral of France|admiral]] (the [[Jacques de Ch\u00e2tillon de Dampierre|lord of Dampierre]]), the [[Master of Crossbowmen]] ([[David de Rambures]], dead along with three sons), Master of the Royal Household (Guichard Dauphin) and ''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t'' of the marshals.{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=xxii, 325, 327}} According to the heralds, 3,069 knights and squires were killed,{{efn|As reported by [[Thomas Walsingham]].{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=53}} Other sources agree closely, citing 4,000 dead in this group.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=131, 182}} Reportedly 1,500 knights died.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=38, 93}} }} while at least 2,600 more corpses were found without coats of arms to identify them.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=459}} Entire noble families were wiped out in the male line, and in some regions an entire generation of landed nobility was annihilated.{{sfn|Sumption|2015|p=460}} The [[Bailiff (France)|bailiffs]] of nine major northern towns were killed, often along with their sons, relatives and supporters. In the words of Juliet Barker, the battle \"cut a great swath through the natural leaders of French society in [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Ponthieu]], [[Normandy]], [[Picardy]].\"{{sfn|Barker|2015|pp=326\u2013327}}\n\nEstimates of the number of prisoners vary between 700 and 2,200, amongst them the dukes of [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[John I of Bourbon|Bourbon]], the counts of [[Charles of Artois, Count of Eu|Eu]], [[Louis, Count of Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me]], [[Arthur de Richemont|Richemont]] (brother of the [[John V, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] and stepbrother of Henry V) and [[John VII of Harcourt|Harcourt]], and marshal [[Jean Le Maingre]].{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=337, 367, 368}} Record evidence identifies at least 112 Englishmen killed in the fighting,{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=324}} while [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet|Monstrelet]] reported 600 English dead.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} These included the [[Edward, 2nd Duke of York|Duke of York]], the young [[Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]] and the Welsh esquire [[Dafydd Gam|Dafydd (\"Davy\") Gam]].\n\nAlthough the victory had been militarily decisive, its impact was complex. It did not lead to further English conquests immediately as Henry's priority was to return to England, which he did on 16 November, to be received in [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in London on the 23rd.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=475, 479}} Henry returned a conquering hero, seen as blessed by God in the eyes of his subjects and European powers outside France. It established the legitimacy of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian monarchy]] and the future campaigns of Henry to pursue his \"rights and privileges\" in France.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=547\u2013549}} Other benefits to the English were longer term. Very quickly after the battle, the fragile truce between the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] and [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundian]] factions broke down. The brunt of the battle had fallen on the Armagnacs and it was they who suffered the majority of senior casualties and carried the blame for the defeat. The Burgundians seized on the opportunity and within 10 days of the battle had mustered their armies and marched on Paris.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=358}} This lack of unity in France allowed Henry eighteen months to prepare militarily and politically for a renewed campaign. When that campaign took place, it was made easier by the damage done to the political and military structures of Normandy by the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2015|p=385}}\n\n==Numbers at Agincourt==\n[[Anne Curry]] in her 2005 book ''Agincourt: A New History'', argues (based on research into the surviving administrative records) that the French army was about 12,000 strong, and the English army about 9,000, giving proportions of four to three.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=192}} By contrast, [[Juliet Barker]] in her book ''Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle'' (also published in 2005) argues the English and Welsh were outnumbered \"at least four to one and possibly as much as six to one\".{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=x}} She suggests figures of about 6,000 for the English and 36,000 for the French, based on the ''Gesta Henrici''{{'}}s figures of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms for the English, and [[Jean de Wavrin]]'s statement \"that the French were six times more numerous than the English\".{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=274}} The 2009 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' uses the figures of about 6,000 for the English and 20,000 to 30,000 for the French. The 1911 ''Britannica'' use somewhat different figures of 6,000 archers, 1,000 men-at-arms and \"a few thousands of other foot\" for the English, with the French outnumbering them by \"at least four times\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=375}}\n\nWhile not necessarily agreeing with the exact numbers Curry uses, Bertrand Schnerb, a professor of medieval history at the University of Lille, states the French probably had 12,000\u201315,000 troops.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}} Ian Mortimer, in his 2009 book ''1415: Henry V's Year of Glory'', notes how Curry \"minimises French numbers (by limiting her figures to those in the basic army and a few specific additional companies) and maximises English numbers (by assuming the numbers sent home from Harfleur were no greater than sick lists)\", but agrees that previous estimates have exaggerated the odds, and suggests that \"the most extreme imbalance which is credible is fifteen thousand French troops against 8,100 English: a ratio of about two-to-one\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=566}}\n\nHowever, Clifford J. Rogers, professor of history at the United States Military Academy at West Point, has recently argued that archival records are too incomplete to substantially change his view that the English were outnumbered about 4\u20131.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}}{{sfn|Rogers|2008a|pp=114\u2013121}} Juliet Barker also disagrees with Curry's arguments in the acknowledgements section of her 2005 book on Agincourt, saying: \"Surviving administrative records on both sides, but especially the French, are simply too incomplete to support [Curry's] assertion that nine thousand English were pitted against an army only twelve thousand strong. And if the differential really was as low as three to four then this makes a nonsense of the course of the battle as described by eyewitnesses and contemporaries.\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=xvi}}\n\nThose supporting a greater imbalance have generally put more store by contemporary (and especially eyewitness) accounts. The ''Gesta Henrici'' gives plausible figures for the English of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms, but Mortimer notes it is \"wildly inaccurate\" in stating the English were outnumbered 30\u20131, and there have also been doubts as to how much it was written as propaganda for Henry V. The proportions also seem incorrect, as from surviving records we know that Henry set out with about four times as many archers as men-at-arms, not five and a half times as many. Those who have supported the Gesta figures for the English army have generally thought that although the English army may have left Harfleur with eight or nine thousand men, it is plausible that after weeks of campaigning and disease in hostile territory they would have lost two or three thousand fighting men; however Mortimer states: \"Despite the trials of the march, Henry had lost very few men to illness or death; and we have independent testimony that no more than 160 had been captured on the way.\"{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}}\n\nAs Mortimer notes, the Burgundian numbers for the size of the French vanguard of 8,000 men-at-arms in the vanguard with 1,400 (or 2,400) men-at-arms in the wings correspond roughly with the figures of ten thousand men-at-arms recorded by the duke of Berry's herald. The Burgundians also recorded 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the \"vanguard\", which would suggest \"fourteen or fifteen thousand fighting men\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}} The Burgundians actually give the total size of the French army as an implausible 50,000,{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} and the numbers they use do not correspond closely to the odds they describe. Using very similar numbers, Jean Le Fevre states that the English were outnumbered 3\u20131, whereas Wavrin states that the English were outnumbered 6\u20131.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=157}}\n\nOne particular cause of confusion may have been the number of servants on both sides. Mortimer suggests that because there were a much higher proportion of men-at-arms on the French side, the number of non-combatants was much higher. Each man-at-arms could be expected to have a page, who would have ridden one of his spare horses. If the French army had an extra 10,000 mounted men (as opposed to only 1,500 extra for the English), then \"the English probably did see an army about three times the size of their own fighting force\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\nIt is open to debate whether these should all be counted as non-combatants; Rogers (for example) accepts that the French probably had about 10,000 men-at-arms, but explicitly includes one \"gros valet\" (an armed, armoured and mounted military servant) per French man-at-arms in his calculation of the odds.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n==Popular representations==\n[[File:Agincourtcarol.jpg|thumb|The 15th century [[Agincourt Carol]]]]\nThe battle remains an important symbol in popular culture. Some notable examples are listed below.\n===Music===\nSoon after the  victory at Agincourt, a number of popular folk songs were created about the battle, the most famous being the \"[[Agincourt Carol]]\", produced in the first half of the 15th century.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=280\u2013283}} Other ballads followed, including \"[[King Henry Fifth's Conquest of France]]\", raising the popular prominence of particular events mentioned only in passing by the original chroniclers, such as the gift of tennis balls before the campaign.{{sfn|Woolf|2003|p=323}}\n\n===Literature===\nThe most famous cultural depiction of the battle today is [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599. The play focuses on the pressures of kingship, the tensions between how a king should ''appear'' \u2013 chivalric, honest, and just \u2013 and how a king must sometimes ''act'' \u2013 [[Machiavelli]]an and ruthless.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=15}} Shakespeare illustrates these tensions by depicting Henry's decision to kill some of the French prisoners, whilst attempting to justify it and distance himself from the event. This moment of the battle is portrayed both as a break with the traditions of chivalry and as key example of the paradox of kingship.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nShakespeare's depiction of the battle also plays on the theme of modernity. He contrasts the modern, English king and his army with the medieval, chivalric, older model of the French.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=20}}\n\nShakespeare's play presented Henry as leading a truly English force into battle, playing on the importance of the link between the monarch and the common soldiers in the fight.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=16}} The original play does not, however, feature any scenes of the actual battle itself, leading critic Rose Zimbardo to characterise it as \"full of warfare, yet empty of conflict.\"{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=193}}\n\nThe play introduced the famous [[St Crispin's Day Speech]], considered one of Shakespeare's most heroic speeches, which Henry delivers movingly to his soldiers just before the battle, urging his \"band of brothers\" to stand together in the forthcoming fight.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}} Critic David Margolies describes how it \"oozes honour, military glory, love of country and self-sacrifice\", and forms one of the first instances of English literature linking solidarity and comradeship to success in battle.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}}{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=31}} Partially as a result, the battle was used as a metaphor at the beginning of the [[First World War]], when the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s attempts to stop the German advances were widely likened to it.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=183}}\n\n===Films===\nShakespeare's version of the battle of Agincourt has been turned into several minor and two major films. The latter, each titled ''Henry V'', star [[Laurence Olivier]] in [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] in [[Henry V (1989 film)|1989]]. Made just prior to the invasion of Normandy, Olivier's rendition gives the battle what Sarah Hatchuel has termed an \"exhilarating and heroic\" tone, with an artificial, cinematic look to the battle scenes.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|pp=194\u2013195}} Branagh's version gives a longer, more [[Realism (arts)|realist]] portrayal of the battle itself, drawing on both historical sources and images from the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Falkland War]]s.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=195}} \n\nIn his 2007 film adaptation, director Peter Babakitis uses digital effects to exaggerate realist features during the battle scenes, producing a more ''[[Experimental film|avant-garde]]'' interpretation of the fighting at Agincourt.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=200}} The battle also forms a central component of the 2019 Netflix film [[The King (2019 film)|''The King'']] (2019).\n\n===Mock trial===\nIn March 2010, a mock trial of Henry V for the crimes associated with the slaughter of the prisoners was held in Washington, D.C., drawing from both the historical record and Shakespeare's play. Participating as judges were Justices [[Samuel Alito]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The trial ranged widely over whether there was just cause for war and not simply the prisoner issue. Although an audience vote was \"too close to call\", Henry was unanimously found guilty by the court on the basis of \"evolving standards of civil society\".<ref name=\"mock-trial-cspan\">{{cite web | url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/221111 | title=Judgment at Agincourt | date=16 March 2010 | website=[[C-SPAN]] }} link to video</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-cd\">{{cite web | url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2010/03/18/high-court-rules-for-french-at-agincourt/ | title=High Court Rules for French at Agincourt | website=DC Theater Scene | first=Tim | last=Treanor | date=18 March 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-lawj\">{{cite web | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446381186 | title=High Court Justices, Legal Luminaries Debate Shakespeare's 'Henry V' | last=Jones | first=Andy | website=[[National Law Journal]] | date=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|AGINCOURT.hto3.jpg|1100px|Battlefield today|left}}\n\n==Azincourt today==\n[[File:Agincourt Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|Agincourt Memorial]]\n[[File:Agincourt archers memorial.jpg|thumb|A list of English archers killed at Azincourt, as recorded in the village's museum]]\nThere is a modern museum in Azincourt village dedicated to the battle.<ref>[http://illucolor.fr/7_vallees_comm/Azincourt/index.html Agincourt Museum]</ref> The museum lists the names of combatants of both sides who died in the battle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[V sign]], for more on the \"two-finger salute\" which legends claim derives from the gestures of longbowmen fighting in the English army at the battle of Agincourt.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=y}}\n* {{cite book |last=Adams |first=Michael C. |year=2002 |title=Echoes of War: A Thousand Years of Military History in Popular Culture |url = https://books.google.com/?id=dDqWvwezm0YC&printsec=frontcover |publisher=University of Kentucky Press |isbn=978-0-8131-2240-3 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Barker |date=2015 |first=Juliet |title=Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle |trans-title=''US title:'' Agincourt: Henry V and the Battle that Made England |edition=revised and updated |publisher=Abacus |place=London |origyear=2005 |isbn=978-0-349-11918-2 |url={{googlebooks|QDVTKcmqHjcC|plainurl=y}} |authorlink=Juliet Barker |ref=harv}}\n<!-- Book not cited in text* {{cite book |last=Bennett |first=M. |authorlink=Matthew Bennett (historian) |date=23 May 1991 |title=Agincourt 1415: Triumph against the odds |url= |series=Campaign |volume=9 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1-85532-132-8 |ref=harv }}-->\n* {{cite book |last=Bennett |first=M. |authorlink=Matthew Bennett (historian) |year=1994 |chapter=The Development of Battle Tactics in the Hundred Years War |chapterurl = http://concours.histegeo.org/Battle_Tactics.pdf |editor=Anne Curry |editorlink=Anne Curry |editor2=Michael L.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn April 6, 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission and that his brother Tom is dead, passing on Tom's rings and dog tag to Joseph. Joseph is distressed about his brother but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the [[World War I casualties|casualties]] was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/opinion/1917-movie-world-war-I.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 February 2020|first=Cathy|last=Tempelsman|accessdate=11 February 2020|title='1917' Turns a Horrific War Into an Uplifting Hero's Journey}}</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian Jeremy Banning, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned. ...

The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn April 6, 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission and that his brother Tom is dead, passing on Tom's rings and dog tag to Joseph. Joseph is distressed about his brother but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

As Polish terminology lacks an adequate equivalent for the concept of venture capital, the [[English language|English version]] is widely used, next to the terms \u201c[[Speculation|speculative capital]]\u201d, and \u201ccapital engaged in [[Risk|risky transactions]],\u201d to determine this form of financing.{{Sfn|Rosa|2016|p=133}}\n\nFirst capital [[investor]]s appeared on the Polish market as funds financed from [[Welfare|public aid]] funds, with the mission of [[Private sector development|developing the private sector]] (e.g. the Polish-American Entrepreneurship Fund, with capital of {{US$|240M|link=yes}}), or private funds (e.g. Invesco). In 1990, the investment activity was also undertaken by the Danish Fund for Central and Eastern Europe, which would support investments in Poland using [[Subsidy|government capital]]. In 1991, the Society for Social and Economic Initiatives started its activities, and in 1992 further key institutions including the Care Small Business Assistance Corporation, the Cooperation Fund, the Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture, and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, there was an increase in interest from investors. In 1992, the Polish Private Equity Fund I and II ({{US$|151M}}) began operations, and in 1994, the Poland Partners fund ({{US$|65M}}) have also appeared on the market, along with the Poland Investment Fund (with the participation of EBRD and [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]]), the Renaissance Capital, the White Eagle Industries, the Poland Growth Fund, and the National Investment Funds, created from the universal privatization program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cxo.pl/news/Fundusze-ryzyka-sporego-ryzyka,321133.html|title=Fundusze ryzyka, sporego ryzyka|last=Walig\u00f3ra|first=Leszek|date=2007-05-24|website=CXO|language=pl|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nThe first attempts of private entities with venture capital on the Polish market were made by Roman Kluska, creator of the Polish tech precursor [[CD Projekt|Optimus]], whose shares were sold to Zbigniew Jakubas and [[MBank|BRE Bank]] in April 2000 for [[Polish z\u0142oty|PLN]] 261M (today's {{Euro|60.6M}}).

The research was based on the self-report of 70 VC firms, including [[Extrapolation|extrapolated]] and [[Public data|publicly available data]].\n\n== Legal basis ==\nUntil 2016, operating in Poland as a private equity and venture capital fund that implements investment projects among enterprises in the seed or startup phase was associated with small formal and legal, or capital requirements. Most frequently, PE/VC funds were small, simple [[Limited liability company|limited liability companies]] or [[partnership]]s in which people with capital were willing to co-finance and then gain from prospective projects of young entrepreneurs. The Polish law did not provide for additional requirements for such entities over those resulting from the provisions of the commercial law.\n\nThe situation changed on June 4, 2016, when as a result of the implementation of the [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011|Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive]] into [[Law of Poland|Polish law]], greater fortifications were introduced by appointing two new financial institutions, supervised by Poland's [[Financial Supervision Authority (Poland)|Financial Supervision Authority]] ({{Lang-pl|Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego}}, KNF).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knf.gov.pl/|title=Zarz\u0105dzaj\u0105cy alternatywnymi sp\u00f3\u0142kami inwestycyjnymi|website=www.knf.gov.pl|publisher=Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kancelarierp.pl/wiadomosci/duze-zmiany-w-ustawie-o-funduszach-inwestycyjnych.html|title=Du\u017ce zmiany w ustawie o funduszach inwestycyjnych {{!}} Artyku\u0142 w KancelarieRP|date=2016-05-31|website=kancelarierp.pl|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative investment company ===\n{{See also|Alternative investment}}\nIt is a collective investment institution, legally available in Poland since 2016, other than specialized [[Open-ended fund company|open-end]] and [[Closed-end fund|closed-end investment]] funds. AICs ({{Lang-pl|alternatywna sp\u00f3\u0142ka inwestycyjna}}) may be carried out in the form of a [[limited company]] ([[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] or [[Sp\u00f3\u0142ka z ograniczon\u0105 odpowiedzialno\u015bci\u0105|limited liability company]]), and a [[limited partnership]] or limited joint-stock partnership.

However, an alternative to larger entities is establishing of own closed investment fund ({{Lang-pl|fundusz inwestycyjny zamkni\u0119ty}}), which can be created only by a selected licensed investment fund company, responsible for the quality of [[asset management]] and cooperation with third parties.\n\nCIFs have a wide range of investment opportunities (including asset placement in shares of [[Non-Public Property|non-public companies]]), which is associated with a greater limitation of participation in the fund. Due to the high investment risk, the CIF offer is addressed mainly to experienced investors\u2014financial institutions and entrepreneurs aware of [[Management by objectives|investment goals]] and risks. The amount of entry for natural persons is regulated in the act, at the level of {{Euro|40,000}}.\n\n== Characteristic of Polish VC ==\nVenture capital firms in Poland typically fall into one of three types: standard commonly defined VC firms, [[Public\u2013private partnership|public-private partnerships]], including VC firms set up with grants or other capital instruments from [[Government agency|state agencies]], and [[Family business|family office-led firms]], with [[high-net-worth individual]]s as a [[Controlling interest|majority]] [[Limited partnership|LP]].\n\n=== Market size ===\n130 venture capital funds currently operate in Poland, 40 per cent more than in 2017, and the number is still growing. The estimated total volume of all venture capital investments in Poland in 2016 was {{Euro|160.5M}}. In 2017, it dropped to {{Euro|106M}}, and in 2018 venture capital funds invested in Polish start-ups {{Euro|178M}} (0.033 percent of GDP), which is 0.847% of 2018's value of the VC market in Europe, amounting to {{Euro|21B}}.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://cyfrowa.rp.pl/biznes/33941-w-polsce-brakuje-pieniedzy-dla-duzych-startupow|title=W Polsce brakuje pieni\u0119dzy dla du\u017cych startup\u00f3w|last=Duszczyk|first=Micha\u0142|date=2019-05-07|website=Rzeczpospolita|language=pl-PL|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nAs of March 2019, the total value of the investment of the Polish VC market is already worth {{Euro|209.2M}}.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the first quarter of 2019, Polish startups carried out 21 transactions for a total amount of PLN 103.3M ({{Euro|24.3M}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ceo.com.pl/polski-rynek-vc-q1-2019-21-transakcji-z-kwota-1033-mln-zl-90168|title=Polski rynek VC Q1 2019 - 21 transakcji z kwot\u0105 103,3 mln z\u0142|last=Redakcja|date=2019-05-08|website=CEO Magazyn Polska|language=pl-PL|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nVC funds in Poland manage assets of {{Euro|2.6B}}, which gives an average of {{Euro|19.6M}} per fund. However, the funds above this amount have only 23% of funds. However, in recent years, the Polish industry has focused the most on obtaining state funds for innovation. Since 2017, 59 contracts with funds have been signed as part of the Bridge Alfa program of the National Center for Research and Development and the Polish Development Fund.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://businessinsider.com.pl/finanse/fundusze/fundusze-vc-w-polsce-raport-zlota-ksiega-startup-poland-2019/hql29wb|title=Oto najwa\u017cniejsze fakty i liczby o polskiej bran\u017cy VC z raportu fundacji Startup Poland|last=W\u0105sowski|first=Micha\u0142|date=2019-05-08|website=Business Insider|language=pl|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Polish VC industry is slowly becoming independent from state and EU funds. For the first time, there were funds that carried out the second or third round of financing, but without the participation of state funds. Still, however, 52 percent. funds available on the market comes from the state. In addition, 56 percent Polish VCs are debutantes in the industry, mostly using government support.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cooperation of Polish startups and investors ===\nVenture capital is an example of the so-called smart money, a form of investment that apart from capital also includes [[Mentorship|mentoring]] and [[Consulting firm|consulting]]. An investor paying to become a [[shareholder]] of the enterprise, supports it with his knowledge and experience, and helps it develop, which itself is sometimes much more desirable than financing itself.\n\nAccording to the Startup Poland study, aside from the help in the preparation of subsequent [[Securities offering|funding rounds]], startups most often need the investors to introduce them to industry contacts and business mentoring. However, due to the inexperience of fund managers in the most important areas for startups, the offer of Polish investors is far from expected. The funds\u2019 competences, both in terms of assistance in obtaining new investors, and opening contacts in the industry, are derivatives of a dense network of contacts and a solid reputation.\n\nA workable strategy for building smart money capital can be specialization in specific sectors. The more companies in a given industry pass through the fund's portfolio, the more experience and industry relationships the manager will be able to acquire. Investors in Poland enable startups to network with other companies in their portfolios. The average portfolio of a Polish venture investor is only 9 companies, so it's not an added value of a large scale, but very much appreciated by local startups.\n\n=== New funds ===\nIn 2018, new VC initiatives were introduced in Poland, including TDJ Pitango Ventures, a joint initiative of the Polish family enterprise TDJ and the [[Israel]]i fund Pitango; Manta Ray VC created by [[Sebastian Kulczyk]]; and Fidiasz led by Krzysztof Domarecki. Other new funds were capitalized by the [[European Investment Fund]], including Market One Capital and Innovation Nest. The third group are international funds that have not invested in the early stages, so far: the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fund Finch Capital (supported by the Polish Development Fund), which invests throughout Europe, and the [[Austria]]n fund Speedinvest. Further funds were created ready to support companies at later stages, including Inovo Venture Partners and Cogito Capital, as well as many smaller funds created with the help of the PFR.\n\nSubsequent funds of this type are just being created. In March 2019, Sunfish Partners launched its PLN 65M (\u20ac15M) venture capital fund to invest in Polish [[deep tech]] startups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunfish-partners.com/news/505/|title=Sunfish Partners Launches Fund to Invest in Polish Deep Tech Startups|last=|first=|date=|website=Sunfish Partners|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> PFR Ventures is among the Limited Partners of Sunfish Partners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.startup.pfr.pl/en/program/sunfish-partners-pfr-starter-fiz/|title=Profile \u2013 Sunfish Partners|last=|first=|date=|website=PFR Starter FIZ|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> In May 2019, the creators of the Polish pre-accelerate program ReactorX, launched the fund SMOK Ventures, with the support of American entrepreneurs and PFR Ventures (80 percent of capital).

Only less than one fifth of investments financing Polish startups took place completely with no public support. Financing in these cases usually amounted to PLN 0.5\u20131M ({{Euro|116K\u2013232K}}).\n\nAccording to the 2019 report by Startup Poland, 52% of all the venture capital available on the Polish market today, around {{Euro|1.35B}}, is capital raised from public sources, Polish state agencies or the European Investment Fund.

The Polish law did not provide for additional requirements for such entities over those resulting from the provisions of the commercial law.\n\nThe situation changed on June 4, 2016, when as a result of the implementation of the [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011|Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive]] into [[Law of Poland|Polish law]], greater fortifications were introduced by appointing two new financial institutions, supervised by Poland's [[Financial Supervision Authority (Poland)|Financial Supervision Authority]] ({{Lang-pl|Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego}}, KNF).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knf.gov.pl/|title=Zarz\u0105dzaj\u0105cy alternatywnymi sp\u00f3\u0142kami inwestycyjnymi|website=www.knf.gov.pl|publisher=Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kancelarierp.pl/wiadomosci/duze-zmiany-w-ustawie-o-funduszach-inwestycyjnych.html|title=Du\u017ce zmiany w ustawie o funduszach inwestycyjnych {{!}} Artyku\u0142 w KancelarieRP|date=2016-05-31|website=kancelarierp.pl|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative investment company ===\n{{See also|Alternative investment}}\nIt is a collective investment institution, legally available in Poland since 2016, other than specialized [[Open-ended fund company|open-end]] and [[Closed-end fund|closed-end investment]] funds. AICs ({{Lang-pl|alternatywna sp\u00f3\u0142ka inwestycyjna}}) may be carried out in the form of a [[limited company]] ([[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] or [[Sp\u00f3\u0142ka z ograniczon\u0105 odpowiedzialno\u015bci\u0105|limited liability company]]), and a [[limited partnership]] or limited joint-stock partnership. An AIC's activity requires an authorization or entry into the register kept by the KNF, which entails a number of capital, infrastructure or personal requirements. That is why it is intended for large asset managers over {{Euro|100M}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knf.gov.pl/dla_rynku/ASI/pytania_i_odpowiedzi|title=Zarz\u0105dzaj\u0105cy ASI - Pytania i odpowiedzi|website=www.knf.gov.pl|publisher=Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, due to the high costs of running a closed-end investment fund and numerous statutory regulations that restricted VC investors, AICs were exempted from [[double taxation]]. Revenues obtained from the sale of [[Share (finance)|shares]] were exempt from [[Corporate tax|corporate income tax]], with the condition that they held 10 percent of shares in the company for two years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://businessinsider.com.pl/firmy/podatki/asi-alternatywna-spolka-inwestycyjna-zwolniona-z-podatku/0gsngek|title=Koniec z dyskryminacj\u0105 podatkow\u0105 ASI.

However, an alternative to larger entities is establishing of own closed investment fund ({{Lang-pl|fundusz inwestycyjny zamkni\u0119ty}}), which can be created only by a selected licensed investment fund company, responsible for the quality of [[asset management]] and cooperation with third parties.\n\nCIFs have a wide range of investment opportunities (including asset placement in shares of [[Non-Public Property|non-public companies]]), which is associated with a greater limitation of participation in the fund. Due to the high investment risk, the CIF offer is addressed mainly to experienced investors\u2014financial institutions and entrepreneurs aware of [[Management by objectives|investment goals]] and risks. The amount of entry for natural persons is regulated in the act, at the level of {{Euro|40,000}}.\n\n== Characteristic of Polish VC ==\nVenture capital firms in Poland typically fall into one of three types: standard commonly defined VC firms, [[Public\u2013private partnership|public-private partnerships]], including VC firms set up with grants or other capital instruments from [[Government agency|state agencies]], and [[Family business|family office-led firms]], with [[high-net-worth individual]]s as a [[Controlling interest|majority]] [[Limited partnership|LP]].\n\n=== Market size ===\n130 venture capital funds currently operate in Poland, 40 per cent more than in 2017, and the number is still growing. The estimated total volume of all venture capital investments in Poland in 2016 was {{Euro|160.5M}}. In 2017, it dropped to {{Euro|106M}}, and in 2018 venture capital funds invested in Polish start-ups {{Euro|178M}} (0.033 percent of GDP), which is 0.847% of 2018's value of the VC market in Europe, amounting to {{Euro|21B}}.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://cyfrowa.rp.pl/biznes/33941-w-polsce-brakuje-pieniedzy-dla-duzych-startupow|title=W Polsce brakuje pieni\u0119dzy dla du\u017cych startup\u00f3w|last=Duszczyk|first=Micha\u0142|date=2019-05-07|website=Rzeczpospolita|language=pl-PL|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nAs of March 2019, the total value of the investment of the Polish VC market is already worth {{Euro|209.2M}}.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the first quarter of 2019, Polish startups carried out 21 transactions for a total amount of PLN 103.3M ({{Euro|24.3M}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ceo.com.pl/polski-rynek-vc-q1-2019-21-transakcji-z-kwota-1033-mln-zl-90168|title=Polski rynek VC Q1 2019 - 21 transakcji z kwot\u0105 103,3 mln z\u0142|last=Redakcja|date=2019-05-08|website=CEO Magazyn Polska|language=pl-PL|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nVC funds in Poland manage assets of {{Euro|2.6B}}, which gives an average of {{Euro|19.6M}} per fund. However, the funds above this amount have only 23% of funds. However, in recent years, the Polish industry has focused the most on obtaining state funds for innovation. Since 2017, 59 contracts with funds have been signed as part of the Bridge Alfa program of the National Center for Research and Development and the Polish Development Fund.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://businessinsider.com.pl/finanse/fundusze/fundusze-vc-w-polsce-raport-zlota-ksiega-startup-poland-2019/hql29wb|title=Oto najwa\u017cniejsze fakty i liczby o polskiej bran\u017cy VC z raportu fundacji Startup Poland|last=W\u0105sowski|first=Micha\u0142|date=2019-05-08|website=Business Insider|language=pl|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Polish VC industry is slowly becoming independent from state and EU funds. For the first time, there were funds that carried out the second or third round of financing, but without the participation of state funds. Still, however, 52 percent. funds available on the market comes from the state. In addition, 56 percent Polish VCs are debutantes in the industry, mostly using government support.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cooperation of Polish startups and investors ===\nVenture capital is an example of the so-called smart money, a form of investment that apart from capital also includes [[Mentorship|mentoring]] and [[Consulting firm|consulting]]. An investor paying to become a [[shareholder]] of the enterprise, supports it with his knowledge and experience, and helps it develop, which itself is sometimes much more desirable than financing itself.\n\nAccording to the Startup Poland study, aside from the help in the preparation of subsequent [[Securities offering|funding rounds]], startups most often need the investors to introduce them to industry contacts and business mentoring. However, due to the inexperience of fund managers in the most important areas for startups, the offer of Polish investors is far from expected. The funds\u2019 competences, both in terms of assistance in obtaining new investors, and opening contacts in the industry, are derivatives of a dense network of contacts and a solid reputation.\n\nA workable strategy for building smart money capital can be specialization in specific sectors. The more companies in a given industry pass through the fund's portfolio, the more experience and industry relationships the manager will be able to acquire. Investors in Poland enable startups to network with other companies in their portfolios. The average portfolio of a Polish venture investor is only 9 companies, so it's not an added value of a large scale, but very much appreciated by local startups.\n\n=== New funds ===\nIn 2018, new VC initiatives were introduced in Poland, including TDJ Pitango Ventures, a joint initiative of the Polish family enterprise TDJ and the [[Israel]]i fund Pitango; Manta Ray VC created by [[Sebastian Kulczyk]]; and Fidiasz led by Krzysztof Domarecki. Other new funds were capitalized by the [[European Investment Fund]], including Market One Capital and Innovation Nest. The third group are international funds that have not invested in the early stages, so far: the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fund Finch Capital (supported by the Polish Development Fund), which invests throughout Europe, and the [[Austria]]n fund Speedinvest. Further funds were created ready to support companies at later stages, including Inovo Venture Partners and Cogito Capital, as well as many smaller funds created with the help of the PFR.\n\nSubsequent funds of this type are just being created. In March 2019, Sunfish Partners launched its PLN 65M (\u20ac15M) venture capital fund to invest in Polish [[deep tech]] startups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunfish-partners.com/news/505/|title=Sunfish Partners Launches Fund to Invest in Polish Deep Tech Startups|last=|first=|date=|website=Sunfish Partners|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> PFR Ventures is among the Limited Partners of Sunfish Partners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.startup.pfr.pl/en/program/sunfish-partners-pfr-starter-fiz/|title=Profile \u2013 Sunfish Partners|last=|first=|date=|website=PFR Starter FIZ|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> In May 2019, the creators of the Polish pre-accelerate program ReactorX, launched the fund SMOK Ventures, with the support of American entrepreneurs and PFR Ventures (80 percent of capital).

Only less than one fifth of investments financing Polish startups took place completely with no public support. Financing in these cases usually amounted to PLN 0.5\u20131M ({{Euro|116K\u2013232K}}).\n\nAccording to the 2019 report by Startup Poland, 52% of all the venture capital available on the Polish market today, around {{Euro|1.35B}}, is capital raised from public sources, Polish state agencies or the European Investment Fund. And around {{Euro|1,04B}} in VC funds in Poland was invested by private Polish LPs. Non-Polish LPs have invested only around {{Euro|130M}}, while fund managers themselves typically contribute 4% of the fund size.\n\n=== The National Capital Fund ===\nThe NCF ({{Lang-pl|Krajowy Fundusz Kapita\u0142owy}}, KFK) was created by the Polish government in 2005. Until January 2017, it managed {{Euro|110M}} from the targeted subsidy of the former [[Ministry of Economy (Poland)|Ministry of Economy]], the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|EU Structural Funds]] (Operational Program \"Innovative Economy\") and until December 2017, from the Swiss-Polish Cooperation Program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kfk.org.pl/o-nas/historia|title=Historia {{!}} Krajowy Fundusz Kapita\u0142owy|website=www.kfk.org.pl|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nAs a [[fund of funds]], the NCF itself had invested in VC funds which financed the development of companies seeking capital for their innovative projects. In an open competition of offers, it had selected micro, small and medium enterprises based in Poland, with particular emphasis on entrepreneurs who conducted research and development activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kfk.org.pl/jak-inwestujemy/polityka-inwestycyjna|title=Polityka inwestycyjna {{!}} Krajowy Fundusz Kapita\u0142owy|website=www.kfk.org.pl|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> In 2017, funds from the National Capital Fund were included in 37% of rounds of transactions examined by Startup Poland. The result of NCF support is as much as half of the previous rounds over PLN 1M.\n\n=== The Polish Agency for Enterprise Development ===\nThe Agency ({{Lang-pl|Polska Agencja Rozwoju Przedsi\u0119biorczo\u015bci}}, PARP) is involved in the implementation of domestic and international projects, financed from the structural funds, the state budget, and long-term programs of the European Commission. It participates in the creation and effective implementation of state policy in the field of entrepreneurship, innovation and adaptability of personnel, seeking to transform into a key institution responsible for creating an environment that supports entrepreneurs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parp.gov.pl/index.php/component/parpabout/|title=PARP - Centrum Rozwoju M\u015aP - www.parp.gov.pl|website=www.parp.gov.pl|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>\n\nThe Agency's capital was involved in nearly a quarter of transactions concerning Polish startups. Since 2007, the Agency has invested PLN 890M ({{Euro|206.8M}}) in Polish startups. The first public VC support program launched by PARP was the financial perspective of EU funds, in which 6 VC early stage funds received a total of PLN 56.5M ({{Euro|13.1M}}) in 2007\u20132008. However, in 2008\u20132015, as part of the Operational Program \"Innovative Economy\", for a pre-incubation and recapitalization of over 1,200 startups, a total of more than PLN 830M was allocated at the earliest stages of development. PARP specializes in rounds of up to PLN 1M ({{Euro|230K}}).\n\n=== The National Center for Research and Development ===\n{{See also|National Centre for Research and Development in Poland}}\nEstablished in 2007 as an executive agency of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the Center ({{Lang-pl|Narodowe Centrum Bada\u0144 i Rozwoju}}, NCBR) supports risky investments through three major venture capital projects: BRIdge Alfa, NCBR CVC and TDJ Pitango Venture fund, through which the Center creates an ecosystem of developing high-tech ideas.

The calcium ion polarizes the sn-2 carbonyl oxygen while also coordinating with a [[catalytic]] water molecule, w5. His-48 improves the [[nucleophilicity]] of the [[catalytic]] water via a bridging second water molecule, w6.  It has been suggested that two water molecules are necessary to traverse the distance between the catalytic [[histidine]] and the [[ester]]. The [[basicity]] of His-48 is thought to be enhanced through [[hydrogen bonding]] with Asp-99.  An [[asparagine]] substitution for His-48 maintains wild-type activity, as the [[amide]] functional group on [[asparagine]] can also function to lower the pKa, or [[acid dissociation constant]], of the bridging water molecule.  The rate limiting state is characterized as the degradation of the tetrahedral intermediate composed of a calcium coordinated [[oxyanion]].  The role of calcium can also be duplicated by other relatively small cations like cobalt and nickel.<ref name=\"Berg 2640\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Berg OG, Gelb MH, Tsai MD, Jain MK | title = Interfacial enzymology: the secreted phospholipase A(2)-paradigm | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 101 | issue = 9 | pages = 2613\u201354 | date = Sep 2001 | pmid = 11749391 | doi = 10.1021/cr990139w | quote = See page 2640 }}</ref> Before becoming active in digestion, the proform of PLA2 is activated by Trypsin.\n{|\n| [[Image:PLA2 picture.png|thumb|300px|Close-up rendering of PLA2 active site with [[phosphate]] [[enzyme inhibitor]].

In the absence of strict regulation of PLA2 activity, a disproportionate amount of proinflammatory mediators are produced. The resulting induced [[oxidative stress]] and neuroinflammation is analogous to neurological diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[epilepsy]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[ischemia]]. [[Lysophospholipid]]s  are another class of molecules released from the membrane that are upstream predecessors of [[platelet activating factor]]s (PAF).  Abnormal levels of potent PAF are also associated with neurological damage.  An optimal [[enzyme inhibitor]] would specifically target PLA2 activity on neural cell membranes already under [[oxidative stress]] and potent [[inflammation]].

They are faithful recreations that adapt the games' original premises and [[level design]]s for the SNES with updated graphics and music. As in the original games, the player controls the Italian plumber [[Mario]] and his brother [[Luigi]] through themed worlds, collecting [[power-up]]s, avoiding obstacles, and finding secret areas. Changes include the addition of [[parallax scrolling]] and modified [[game physics]], while some [[Software bug|glitches]] are fixed.\n\nAfter the completion of ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' (1992), Mario creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] suggested that Nintendo develop a SNES ''Mario'' compilation. [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development]] handled the development of ''Super Mario All-Stars''. As the [[16-bit]] SNES was more powerful than the [[8-bit]] NES, the developers were able to [[remaster]] the games in the transition across platforms. They based the updated designs on those from ''[[Super Mario World]]'' (1990) and strove to retain the feel of the original NES ''Mario'' titles. Nintendo released ''Super Mario All-Stars'' worldwide in late 1993 and rereleased it in 1994 with ''Super Mario World'' included as an additional title. The compilation was rereleased again, with special packaging, a 32-page art booklet, and a soundtrack CD, in 2010 for the [[Wii]] to commemorate the 25th anniversary of ''Super Mario Bros.''\n\nThe SNES version received critical acclaim and is one of the bestselling ''Super Mario'' titles, with 10.55&nbsp;million copies sold by 2015. Reviewers lauded ''Super Mario All-Stars'' as a must-have representing the SNES at its finest. They praised the effort that went into remastering the compilation's games and appreciated the updated graphics and music but criticized its lack of innovation. Critics also disagreed as to which game was best. The Wii rerelease sold 2.24&nbsp;million copies by 2011 but received mixed reviews. Critics were disappointed Nintendo did not add new games or features and were unfulfilled by the art booklet and soundtrack CD. Though they thought the compilation itself was of high quality, critics recommended buying the games individually on the Wii's [[Virtual Console]] instead.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2|Super Mario Bros. 3}}\n[[File:SuperMarioAllStarsSMB1Comparison.png|thumb|left|alt=Top: the NES version of ''Super Mario Bros.'', depicting an area of World 1-1.

It contains [[Video game remake|remakes]] of [[Nintendo]]'s four ''[[Super Mario]]'' titles released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and its [[Family Computer Disk System]] add-on\u2014''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985), ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'' (1986), ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (1988), and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' (1988). They are faithful recreations that adapt the games' original premises and [[level design]]s for the SNES with updated graphics and music. As in the original games, the player controls the Italian plumber [[Mario]] and his brother [[Luigi]] through themed worlds, collecting [[power-up]]s, avoiding obstacles, and finding secret areas. Changes include the addition of [[parallax scrolling]] and modified [[game physics]], while some [[Software bug|glitches]] are fixed.\n\nAfter the completion of ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' (1992), Mario creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] suggested that Nintendo develop a SNES ''Mario'' compilation. [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development]] handled the development of ''Super Mario All-Stars''. As the [[16-bit]] SNES was more powerful than the [[8-bit]] NES, the developers were able to [[remaster]] the games in the transition across platforms. They based the updated designs on those from ''[[Super Mario World]]'' (1990) and strove to retain the feel of the original NES ''Mario'' titles. Nintendo released ''Super Mario All-Stars'' worldwide in late 1993 and rereleased it in 1994 with ''Super Mario World'' included as an additional title. The compilation was rereleased again, with special packaging, a 32-page art booklet, and a soundtrack CD, in 2010 for the [[Wii]] to commemorate the 25th anniversary of ''Super Mario Bros.''\n\nThe SNES version received critical acclaim and is one of the bestselling ''Super Mario'' titles, with 10.55&nbsp;million copies sold by 2015. Reviewers lauded ''Super Mario All-Stars'' as a must-have representing the SNES at its finest. They praised the effort that went into remastering the compilation's games and appreciated the updated graphics and music but criticized its lack of innovation. Critics also disagreed as to which game was best. The Wii rerelease sold 2.24&nbsp;million copies by 2011 but received mixed reviews. Critics were disappointed Nintendo did not add new games or features and were unfulfilled by the art booklet and soundtrack CD. Though they thought the compilation itself was of high quality, critics recommended buying the games individually on the Wii's [[Virtual Console]] instead.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2|Super Mario Bros. 3}}\n[[File:SuperMarioAllStarsSMB1Comparison.png|thumb|left|alt=Top: the NES version of ''Super Mario Bros.'', depicting an area of World 1-1.

They expressed surprise the developers did not take advantage of the extra space Wii discs offer to add more games or use the ''Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World'' version.<ref name=\"NLife: WiiRev\" /><ref name=\"G4: Rev\" /><ref name=\"GRadar+\" /><ref name=\"IGNRev\" /><ref name=\"Guardian\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]'' compared the ''25th Anniversary Edition'' unfavorably to the [[GoldenEye 007 (2010 video game)|Wii remaster]] of the [[Nintendo 64]] game ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' (1997) released earlier that year. The writer argued that while ''GoldenEye'' offered new graphics, levels, and reasons to play, ''Super Mario All-Stars'' was just the same compilation released on the SNES in 1993.<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> ''[[The A.V.

Club'' said the level design documents were \"obscured by pictures, and schematics written in Japanese with no translation\".<ref name=\"AVClub\" /> Meanwhile, ''[[IGN]]'' opined the booklet failed to demonstrate Mario's importance, missing information about the Game Boy installments and ''Yoshi's Island'', as well as appearances in other Nintendo games.<ref name=\"IGNRev\" /> Others found the booklet interesting;<ref name=\"GRadar+\" /><ref name=\"NWR: 25thRev\" /><ref name=\"Guardian\" /> ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' stated that for ''Mario'' fans Miyamoto's original outline \"alone is worth $30\".<ref name=\"GRadar+\" />\n\nThe soundtrack CD received criticism and was viewed as a missed opportunity.<ref name=\"NLife: WiiRev\" /><ref name=\"IGNRev\" /><ref name=\"AVClub\" /> Reviewers were disappointed it contained only ten pieces of actual music and that half of it was dedicated to sound effects.<ref name=\"NLife: WiiRev\" /><ref name=\"IGNRev\" /><ref name=\"AVClub\" /> For instance, ''Nintendo Life'' said a CD can hold up to 74 minutes of audio and noted \"the one bundled with this collection doesn't even fill half of that potential running time\".<ref name=\"NLife: WiiRev\" /> Similarly, ''IGN'' said ten pieces were not enough, noting ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' (2007) had over 20 unique tracks but the CD included just one of them.<ref name=\"IGNRev\" /> Conversely, ''The Guardian'' said the CD would make players happy and ''GamesRadar+'' thought it was rare for Nintendo to release game soundtracks outside Japan.<ref name=\"GRadar+\" /><ref name=\"Guardian\" /> ''GamesRadar+'' added the CD helped make the compilation seem important, and that it represented the first time Nintendo officially released the ''Super Mario Bros.'' \"[[Super Mario Bros. theme|Ground Theme]]\".<ref name=\"GRadar+\" />\n\n''Nintendo Life'' wrote there was no reason for Nintendo not to add more to the compilation, suggesting it would not have taken much effort to add interviews, advertisements, and other behind-the-scenes content.<ref name=\"NLife: WiiRev\" /> Despite the general disappointment, critics thought the compilation's games remained of high quality.<ref name=\"NLife: WiiRev\" /><ref name=\"G4: Rev\" /><ref name=\"IGNRev\" /><ref name=\"Guardian\" /><ref name=\"AVClub\" /> Some admitted to preferring the NES originals,<ref

purchased the compilation.<ref name=\"NLife: WiiRev\" /><ref name=\"AVClub\" /> ''GamesRadar+'', ''IGN'', and ''Official Nintendo Magazine'' noted this was a cheaper way to experience them.<ref name=\"GRadar+\" /><ref name=\"IGNRev\" /><ref name=\"ONM: Review\" /> As ''Nintendo World Report'' wrote, \"in the end, the value of [''Super Mario All-Stars''] lies in whether you want to invest
