She won the inofficial national youth championships, Colgate Cup, in three different levels, as a 12-, 14-, and 16-year old.\n\nIn 1981, only 15 years of age, she sensationally won the Swedish International Amateur Stroke-Play Championship, one of three major amateur tournaments in Sweden at the time, at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping Golf Club, with a record aggregate of 282 and a 9-stroke margin. She bettered her personal 72-hole best with 30 strokes and beat the whole Swedish amateur national team, of which some did not even had heard of Neumann before the tournament. At the time of her triumph, she wasn't even qualified for the Swedish national junior team, which, the same summer, won the European Lady Junior's Team Championship.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.http://www.e-magin.se/paper/tnvx7xpn/paper |title=J\u00f6sse Lotta, vilken skr\u00e4ll |language=Swedish |magazine=Svensk Golf |date=July 1981 |pages=25\u201327, 64}}</ref>\n\nThe year after, she successfully defended her stroke-play title and,16 years old, was a member of the national team at the [[Espirito Santo Trophy]] in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1983, she finished second in Orange Bowl International Junior Championship in [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[Florida]]. In 1984, she was the Swedish Match Play champion, member of the winning Swedish team at the European Lady Junior's Team Championship at Campo de Golf El Saler, [[Valencia]], [[Spain]], and medalist at the 36-hole qualifying competition in the [[European Ladies' Team Championship|European Ladies Team Championship]], in [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], [[Belgium]].

She won four times in [[Japan]] and the 1995 [[Holden Women's Australian Open|Women's Australian Open]]. Her victory in the 1994 [[Women's British Open|Women\u2019s British Open]] made her the fifth player to win both British and U.S. Open titles, joining [[Laura Davies]], [[Jane Geddes]], [[Betsy King]] and [[Patty Sheehan]]. This accomplishment was later also achieved by [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Pak Se-ri]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Inbee Park]] and [[Ariya Jutanugarn]].

Shortly after the Strontium 90 gig, Sting approached Summers to join the band. He agreed, on the condition the band remain a trio, with him replacing Padovani. Restrained by loyalty, Copeland and Sting resisted the idea, and the Police carried on as a four-piece version but they only performed live twice: on 25 July 1977 at the [[KOKO (music venue)|Music Machine]] in London and on 5 August at the [[Mont de Marsan]] Punk Festival. Shortly after these two gigs (and an aborted recording session with ex-[[Velvet Underground]] member [[John Cale]] as producer on 10 August), Summers delivered an ultimatum to the band and Padovani was dismissed. The effect of Summers' arrival was instant with Copeland stating: \"One by one, Sting's songs had started coming in, and when Andy joined, it opened up new numbers of Sting's we could do, so the material started to get a lot more interesting and Sting started to take a lot more interest in the group.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\"/>\n\nThe Police's [[power trio]] line-up of Copeland, Sting, and Summers performed for the first time on 18 August 1977 at Rebecca's club in the English city of [[Birmingham]] in the West Midlands.<ref>Christopher Sandford (2007). \"Sting: Back on the Beat\". p. 53.

In late 1977 and early 1978, Sting and Summers recorded and performed as part of an ensemble led by German experimental composer [[Eberhard Schoener]]; Copeland also joined for a time.

Retrieved 5 December 2011</ref> After the [[Ghost in the Machine Tour]] concluded in 1982, the group took a sabbatical and each member pursued outside projects. By this time, Sting was becoming a major star, and he established a career beyond the Police by branching out into acting. Back in 1979, he had made a well-received debut as the \"Ace Face\" in ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'', the film version of [[The Who]]'s [[rock opera]], followed by a role as a mechanic in love with [[Eddie Cochran]]'s music in [[Chris Petit]]'s ''[[Radio On]]''. In 1982, Sting furthered his acting career by co-starring in the [[Richard Loncraine]] film ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]''. He also had a minor solo hit in the United Kingdom with the movie's theme song, a cover of the 1929 hit \"[[Spread a Little Happiness]]\" (which appeared on the [[Brimstone & Treacle (soundtrack)|''Brimstone & Treacle'' soundtrack]], along with three new Police tracks, \"How Stupid Mr Bates\", \"A Kind of Loving\", and \"I Burn for You\"). Over 1981 and 1982, Summers recorded his first album with [[Robert Fripp]], ''[[I Advance Masked]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Stewart Copeland composed the musical score for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[Rumble Fish#Soundtrack|Rumble Fish]]''. The single \"[[Don't Box Me In]] (theme From ''Rumble Fish'')\", a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter [[Stan Ridgway]] (of the band [[Wall of Voodoo]]) received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. Also in 1983, Sting filmed his first big-budget movie role playing [[Feyd-Rautha]] in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''. As Sting's fame rose, his relationship with Stewart Copeland deteriorated. Their increasingly strained partnership was further stretched by the pressures of worldwide publicity and fame, conflicting egos, and their financial success. Meanwhile, both Sting's and Summers' marriages failed.\n\n===1983: ''Synchronicity'' and \"The Biggest Band in the World\"===\n{{Quote box|width=29%|align=right|quote=\"MTV has paved the way for a host of invaders from abroad.

Shortly after the Strontium 90 gig, Sting approached Summers to join the band. He agreed, on the condition the band remain a trio, with him replacing Padovani. Restrained by loyalty, Copeland and Sting resisted the idea, and the Police carried on as a four-piece version but they only performed live twice: on 25 July 1977 at the [[KOKO (music venue)|Music Machine]] in London and on 5 August at the [[Mont de Marsan]] Punk Festival. Shortly after these two gigs (and an aborted recording session with ex-[[Velvet Underground]] member [[John Cale]] as producer on 10 August), Summers delivered an ultimatum to the band and Padovani was dismissed. The effect of Summers' arrival was instant with Copeland stating: \"One by one, Sting's songs had started coming in, and when Andy joined, it opened up new numbers of Sting's we could do, so the material started to get a lot more interesting and Sting started to take a lot more interest in the group.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\"/>\n\nThe Police's [[power trio]] line-up of Copeland, Sting, and Summers performed for the first time on 18 August 1977 at Rebecca's club in the English city of [[Birmingham]] in the West Midlands.<ref>Christopher Sandford (2007). \"Sting: Back on the Beat\". p. 53.

In late 1977 and early 1978, Sting and Summers recorded and performed as part of an ensemble led by German experimental composer [[Eberhard Schoener]]; Copeland also joined for a time.

Also in 1983, Sting filmed his first big-budget movie role playing [[Feyd-Rautha]] in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''. As Sting's fame rose, his relationship with Stewart Copeland deteriorated.

However, a few events did bring the Police back together, albeit briefly.

A short team that controls the game, high pressure and a lot of movement with and without the ball. I want the player that has the ball to always have three or four solutions and two teammates close by to help. The difficulty in football is, often to do things simply but to control the base, pass and get free. I don't like the numbers of the field because they trick you. You can be super offensive with a 5\u20133\u20132 and defensive in a 4\u20133\u20133. Depending on the quality of the guys. I had a game a while ago where the two full-backs ended up playing as the 9 and 10. But that doesn't mean I don't like people like Samuel and Chiellini, born defenders. Could it be a 2\u20137\u20132? No, the goalkeeper counts as one of the midfield seven. For me, the attacker is the first defender and the goalkeeper is the first attacker.

The French [[French ship Rivoli (1810)|''Rivoli'']], named for [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] [[Battle of Rivoli|victory]] 15 years earlier, had been recently completed at [[Venice]]. The French naval authorities intended her to bolster French forces in the Adriatic, following a succession of defeats in the preceding year.\n\nTo prevent this ship challenging British dominance in the theatre, the [[Royal Navy]] ordered a ship of the line from the [[Mediterranean]] fleet to intercept and capture ''Rivoli'' on her maiden voyage. Captain [[John Talbot (Royal Navy officer)|John Talbot]] of [[HMS Victorious (1808)|HMS ''Victorious'']] arrived off Venice in mid-February and blockaded the port. When ''Rivoli'' attempted to escape under cover of fog, Talbot chased her and forced her to surrender in a five-hour battle, ''Rivoli'' losing over half her crew wounded or dead.\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814}}\nThe [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 had resulted in a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] withdrawal from the Adriatic and the French takeover of the strategic island fortress of [[Corfu]]. The [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] with the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1809 had further solidified French influence in the area by formalising their control of the [[Illyrian Provinces]] on the Eastern shore.<ref name=\"RG153\">Gardiner, p. 153</ref> To protect these gains, the French and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italian]] governments had instigated a shipbuilding program in [[Venice]] and other Italian ports in an effort to rebuild their [[Mediterranean]] fleet and challenge British hegemony. These efforts were hampered by the poverty of the Italian government and the difficulty that the [[French Navy]] had in manning and equipping their ships.<ref name=\"WJ44\"/> As a result, the first ship of the line built in the Adriatic under this program was not launched until 1810 and not completed until early 1812.<ref name=\"WJ44\">James, p. 44</ref>\n\n[[File:Rivoli-IMG 6928-with camels.jpg|thumb|left|[[French ship Rivoli (1810)|''Rivoli'']], fitted with the camels that allowed her to cross the shallow banks before Venice harbour.]]\nBy the time this ship, [[French ship Rivoli (1810)|''Rivoli'']], was launched, the Royal Navy had achieved dominance over the French in the Adriatic Sea.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> Not only had the regional commander [[Bernard Dubourdieu]] been killed and his squadron destroyed at the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]] in March 1811, but French efforts to supply their scattered garrisons were proving increasingly risky.<ref name=\"RG174\">Gardiner, p. 174</ref> This was demonstrated by the destruction of a well-armed convoy from [[Corfu]] to [[Trieste]] at the [[Action of 29 November 1811]].<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardiner, p. 178</ref> ''Rivoli's'' launch was therefore seen by the French Navy as an opportunity to reverse these defeats, as the new [[ship of the line]] outgunned the British frigates that operated within the Adriatic and would be able to operate in the Adriatic without the threat of attack by the frigate squadron based on [[Vis (island)|Lissa]].<ref name=\"RG179\"/>\n\nThe Royal Navy was aware of the threat that ''Rivoli'' posed to their hegemony and were warned in advance by spies in Venice of the progress of the ship\u2019s construction.<ref name=\"RG179\">Gardiner, p. 179</ref> As ''Rivoli'' neared completion, [[HMS Victorious (1808)|HMS ''Victorious'']] was dispatched from the Mediterranean Fleet to intercept her should she leave port. ''Victorious'' was commanded by [[John Talbot (Royal Navy officer)|John Talbot]], a successful and popular officer who had distinguished himself with the capture of the French frigate [[HMS Milan (1805)|''Ville de Milan'']] in 1805 and his service in the [[Dardanelles Operation]] of 1807.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Talbot was accompanied by the 18-gun [[brig]] [[HMS Weazel (1805)|HMS ''Weazel'']] under Commander John William Andrew.<ref name=\"WJ64\"/>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Victorious & Rivoli.jpg|thumb|The explosion of [[French brig Mercure (1806)|''Mercure'']] in ''HMS 'Victorious' Taking the 'Rivoli', 22 February 1812'' , [[Thomas Luny]], [[National Maritime Museum]]]]\n''Rivoli'' departed Venice on 21 February 1812 under the command of Commodore [[Jean-Baptiste Barr\u00e9]], accompanied by five smaller escort ships, the 16-gun [[brigs]] ''[[French brig Mercure (1806)|Mercurio]]'' and ''[[French brig I\u00e9na (1810)|Eridano]]'', of the navy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], the 8-gun brig ''Mamelouck'' and two small gunboats, strung out in an improvised line of battle. Barr\u00e9 hoped to make use of a heavy sea [[fog]] that had descended, to break out from Venice and elude pursuit. ''Victorious'' had held off from the land during the fog and by the time Talbot was able to observe Venice harbour at 14:30, his opponent had escaped. Searching for Barr\u00e9, who was sailing to [[Pula]], Talbot spotted one of the French brigs at 15:00 and gave chase.<ref name=\"WJ64\"/>\n\nThe French [[Head start (positioning)|head-start]] had enabled ''Rivoli'' to gain a substantial distance on the British ship, and so it was not until 02:30 on 22 February that Talbot was able to close with her quarry and its escort.<ref name=\"WJ64\"/> Not wishing to be held up by the escort ships protecting ''Rivoli'', Talbot ordered ''Weasel'' ahead to engage them while ''Victorious'' fought Barr\u00e9's flagship directly.

The French [[French ship Rivoli (1810)|''Rivoli'']], named for [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] [[Battle of Rivoli|victory]] 15 years earlier, had been recently completed at [[Venice]]. The French naval authorities intended her to bolster French forces in the Adriatic, following a succession of defeats in the preceding year.\n\nTo prevent this ship challenging British dominance in the theatre, the [[Royal Navy]] ordered a ship of the line from the [[Mediterranean]] fleet to intercept and capture ''Rivoli'' on her maiden voyage. Captain [[John Talbot (Royal Navy officer)|John Talbot]] of [[HMS Victorious (1808)|HMS ''Victorious'']] arrived off Venice in mid-February and blockaded the port. When ''Rivoli'' attempted to escape under cover of fog, Talbot chased her and forced her to surrender in a five-hour battle, ''Rivoli'' losing over half her crew wounded or dead.\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814}}\nThe [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 had resulted in a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] withdrawal from the Adriatic and the French takeover of the strategic island fortress of [[Corfu]]. The [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] with the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1809 had further solidified French influence in the area by formalising their control of the [[Illyrian Provinces]] on the Eastern shore.<ref name=\"RG153\">Gardiner, p. 153</ref> To protect these gains, the French and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italian]] governments had instigated a shipbuilding program in [[Venice]] and other Italian ports in an effort to rebuild their [[Mediterranean]] fleet and challenge British hegemony. These efforts were hampered by the poverty of the Italian government and the difficulty that the [[French Navy]] had in manning and equipping their ships.<ref name=\"WJ44\"/> As a result, the first ship of the line built in the Adriatic under this program was not launched until 1810 and not completed until early 1812.<ref name=\"WJ44\">James, p. 44</ref>\n\n[[File:Rivoli-IMG 6928-with camels.jpg|thumb|left|[[French ship Rivoli (1810)|''Rivoli'']], fitted with the camels that allowed her to cross the shallow banks before Venice harbour.]]\nBy the time this ship, [[French ship Rivoli (1810)|''Rivoli'']], was launched, the Royal Navy had achieved dominance over the French in the Adriatic Sea.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> Not only had the regional commander [[Bernard Dubourdieu]] been killed and his squadron destroyed at the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]] in March 1811, but French efforts to supply their scattered garrisons were proving increasingly risky.<ref name=\"RG174\">Gardiner, p. 174</ref> This was demonstrated by the destruction of a well-armed convoy from [[Corfu]] to [[Trieste]] at the [[Action of 29 November 1811]].<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardiner, p. 178</ref> ''Rivoli's'' launch was therefore seen by the French Navy as an opportunity to reverse these defeats, as the new [[ship of the line]] outgunned the British frigates that operated within the Adriatic and would be able to operate in the Adriatic without the threat of attack by the frigate squadron based on [[Vis (island)|Lissa]].<ref name=\"RG179\"/>\n\nThe Royal Navy was aware of the threat that ''Rivoli'' posed to their hegemony and were warned in advance by spies in Venice of the progress of the ship\u2019s construction.<ref name=\"RG179\">Gardiner, p. 179</ref> As ''Rivoli'' neared completion, [[HMS Victorious (1808)|HMS ''Victorious'']] was dispatched from the Mediterranean Fleet to intercept her should she leave port. ''Victorious'' was commanded by [[John Talbot (Royal Navy officer)|John Talbot]], a successful and popular officer who had distinguished himself with the capture of the French frigate [[HMS Milan (1805)|''Ville de Milan'']] in 1805 and his service in the [[Dardanelles Operation]] of 1807.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Talbot was accompanied by the 18-gun [[brig]] [[HMS Weazel (1805)|HMS ''Weazel'']] under Commander John William Andrew.<ref name=\"WJ64\"/>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Victorious & Rivoli.jpg|thumb|The explosion of [[French brig Mercure (1806)|''Mercure'']] in ''HMS 'Victorious' Taking the 'Rivoli', 22 February 1812'' , [[Thomas Luny]], [[National Maritime Museum]]]]\n''Rivoli'' departed Venice on 21 February 1812 under the command of Commodore [[Jean-Baptiste Barr\u00e9]], accompanied by five smaller escort ships, the 16-gun [[brigs]] ''[[French brig Mercure (1806)|Mercurio]]'' and ''[[French brig I\u00e9na (1810)|Eridano]]'', of the navy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], the 8-gun brig ''Mamelouck'' and two small gunboats, strung out in an improvised line of battle. Barr\u00e9 hoped to make use of a heavy sea [[fog]] that had descended, to break out from Venice and elude pursuit. ''Victorious'' had held off from the land during the fog and by the time Talbot was able to observe Venice harbour at 14:30, his opponent had escaped. Searching for Barr\u00e9, who was sailing to [[Pula]], Talbot spotted one of the French brigs at 15:00 and gave chase.<ref name=\"WJ64\"/>\n\nThe French [[Head start (positioning)|head-start]] had enabled ''Rivoli'' to gain a substantial distance on the British ship, and so it was not until 02:30 on 22 February that Talbot was able to close with her quarry and its escort.<ref name=\"WJ64\"/> Not wishing to be held up by the escort ships protecting ''Rivoli'', Talbot ordered ''Weasel'' ahead to engage them while ''Victorious'' fought Barr\u00e9's flagship directly. At 04:15,  ''Weasel'' overhauled the rearmost French brig ''Mercure'' and opened fire from close range, ''Mercure'' replying in kind.<ref name=\"WJ64\">James, p. 64</ref> ''I\u00e9na'' also engaged ''Weasel'' but the greater distance between these ships allowed Commander Andrew to focus his attack on ''Mercure'', which fought hard for twenty minutes before being destroyed in a catastrophic explosion, probably caused by a fire in the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]].<ref name=\"RG179\"/> ''Weasel'' immediately launched her boats to rescue any survivors, but only three were saved.<ref name=\"RG179\"/>\n\nFollowing the explosion aboard ''Mercure'', ''I\u00e9na'' and the other French brigs scattered, briefly pursued by ''Weasel'', who chased ''I\u00e9na'' and ''Mamelouck'' but was unable to bring them to a decisive action.
