It is mostly used in applications that require measuring substances that would have a relatively neutral pH (near 7). A common use is for measuring the presence of [[carbonic acid]] in a liquid. It is typically sold in solid form as the [[sodium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of the acid indicator.\n\n==Structure and properties==\n<div style=\"clear:left; float:right;>\n{{pH_indicator template|indicator_name=Bromothymol blue |low_pH=6.0|high_pH=7.6|low_pH_color=yellow|high_pH_color=blue|high_pH_text=white}}<br/>\n{{pH_indicator template|indicator_name=Bromothymol blue|low_pH=<0|high_pH=6.0|low_pH_color=magenta|high_pH_color=yellow|low_pH_text=black}}<br>\n{{cn|reason=can't find any source that backs the yellow-to-red transition up|date=April 2019}}\n</div>\nBromothymol blue acts as a weak acid in a solution. It can thus be in protonated or deprotonated form, appearing yellow or blue, respectively. It is bright aquamarine by itself, and greenish-blue in a neutral solution. The deprotonation of the neutral form results in a highly [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] structure, accounting for the difference in color.

HUCM is located at the Howard University Health Sciences Center in [[Washington, D.C.]], and was founded in 1868 in response to the city's growing population. With more than 4,000 living alumni, the College has produced a sizeable share of the African-American physicians practicing in this country.\n\nThe mission of the College of Medicine includes improving health care through training programs and initiatives, discovering knowledge through research and supporting the education and training of postgraduate physicians, other healthcare providers and graduate students in biomedical sciences. Many College of Medicine students gain professional experience at [[Howard University Hospital]], the primary teaching hospital for the school.\n\n==History==\nFounders of Howard University appreciated the urgent need for medical education in the District of Columbia after the Civil War.

The charter approving incorporation of Howard University specified that a department would be devoted to medicine.

The building housed the medical and pharmacy program (and later the dental program), as well as the Freedmen\u2019s Hospital. In 1927, a new facility was constructed on W Street.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\nThe College of Medicine\u2019s first alumni association was formed in 1871 by the five graduates of that year (William Bennit, James Bowen, George Brooks, Danforth Nichols and Joseph Sladen).

D.]] degrees.  These are [[anatomy]], [[genetics]] & [[human genetics]], [[microbiology]], [[biochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and [[physiology]] & [[biophysics]].\n\nThe largest training program in the College of Medicine is their 4-year [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] program.  HUCM is known for producing physicians who provide healthcare to under-served communities throughout the [[United States]].  A major emphasis of HUCM is preparing physicians for under-served communities.  Much of the experience these medical students gain with under-served communities is at [[Howard University Hospital]], the primary teaching hospital for HUCM, but students also gain experience with other demographics by working at other hospitals in the DC Metropolitan Area including [[Washington Hospital Center]], [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]] and [[Inova Fairfax Hospital]]. [[Howard University Hospital]]'s surrounding community is under-served and is promoted as an excellent teaching environment for HUCM's students.\n\nThe Howard University Health Sciences Simulation Center opened a major state-of-the-art virtual medical training facility to advance the education of medical students and healthcare professionals. The simulation center, a 6,000-square-foot facility, is a simulated hospital environment that promotes improved communication skills between healthcare workers and their patients.<ref>{{cite web|title=Simulation Center|url=http://www.howard.edu/newsroom/releases/2014/20140121State-of-the-ArtMedicalSimulationCentertoOpenatHowardUniversity.html|website=howard.edu|accessdate=24 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517202717/http://www.howard.edu/newsroom/releases/2014/20140121State-of-the-ArtMedicalSimulationCentertoOpenatHowardUniversity.html|archive-date=17 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHoward University's College of Medicine is served by the Louis Stokes Health Sciences Library, named in honor of [[Louis Stokes]], the first African American congressman elected from the state of Ohio.
