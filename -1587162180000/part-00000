The book begins with the group of cats known as [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]] rebuilding its camp with the help of its old friends [[List of Warriors characters#Stormfur|Stormfur]] and [[List of Warriors characters#Brook|Brook]] following a badger attack in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]''. As the book progresses, [[List of Warriors characters#Brambleclaw|BrambleClaw]] and [[List of Warriors characters#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]] overcome a previous conflict and fall in love again, but Brambleclaw continues to visit the spirit of his evil father [[List of Warriors characters#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]] in his dreams. Brambleclaw manages to convince ThunderClan leader [[List of Warriors characters#Firestar|Firestar]] to choose a new deputy to replace the long missing Graystripe and is surprised when he is chosen. Brambleclaw's half-brother [[List of Warriors characters#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]] attempts to kill Firestar in order that Brambleclaw might become leader of ThunderClan, but Brambleclaw saves Firestar and kills Hawkfrost, fulfilling the prophecy \"Before there is peace, blood will spill blood and the lake will run red\".\n\nThe book was first released on December 26, 2006, in the US as a hardcover. It then was released as a paperback, [[e-book]], and [[audiobook]]. The book was the third in the series to be released in audiobook format. The audiobook was read by Nanette Savard, whose performance was praised by ''[[AudioFile (magazine)|AudioFile]]''. ''Sunset'' received mixed to positive reviews from reviewers.\n\n==Plot summary==\nAfter dead badgers attack destroys much of ThunderClan's camp, Brook Where Small Fish Swim (Brook) and Stormfur, old friends of ThunderClan, help to rebuild the camp. The battle is not without its consequences, as both the medicine cat Cinderpelt and the warrior Sootfur die. The battle rekindles Squirrelflight's love for Brambleclaw (following a conflict between the two during the previous book), leading her to have an argument a few days after with [[List of Warriors characters#Ashfur|Ashfur]], whom she had moved to following her separation from Brambleclaw.\n\nAll of the Clans are grieving for the death of [[List of Warriors characters#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]]. [[List of Warriors characters#Leafpool|Leafpool]] finds herself struggling between grief and betrayal, for she has not seen Cinderpelt in the ranks of [[List of Warriors characters#StarClan|StarClan]]. During a visit to the Moonpool, where medicine cats share dreams with StarClan each month, former medicine cat [[List of Warriors characters#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]] goes to Leafpool in a dream and shows her that Cinderpelt is reborn in the form of [[List of Warriors characters#Cinderkit|Cinderkit]], one of [[List of Warriors characters#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]]'s four kits whom Cinderpelt died protecting.\n\nAfter months of waiting and with persuasion from Brambleclaw, Stormfur, the new medicine cat Leafpool and his own mate [[List of Warriors characters#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], Firestar, leader of ThunderClan, finally declares that his friend and deputy Graystripe is not going to return after being abducted by humans in ''Dawn''. When a dream from StarClan, the spirits of the cats' ancestors, tells Leafpool that Brambleclaw should be the new deputy, Firestar agrees and appoints Brambleclaw as the new deputy. The decision is met with objection, because Brambleclaw had never mentored an apprentice, a requirement for becoming deputy. The matter is cleared when Firestar declares that Brambleclaw will mentor [[List of Warriors characters#Berrykit|Berrykit]] when the kit turns six months of age and mentions Leafpool's dream from StarClan to his warriors.\n\nTigerstar, an evil cat who is dead, continues to visit his sons (through different mothers) Hawkfrost and Brambleclaw in their dreams and when Brambleclaw becomes deputy, Tigerstar reveals his plan for Brambleclaw to take over ThunderClan and WindClan and for Hawkfrost to take over RiverClan and ShadowClan. Brambleclaw firmly rejects this idea, but agrees to make up a plan with Hawkfrost when they are awake.\n\nDuring the meeting, Brambleclaw hears a cat struggling in pain. He finds Firestar caught in a fox trap (wire snare) and Hawkfrost urges Brambleclaw to kill the ThunderClan leader so that Brambleclaw can become the new leader. After struggling with his desires, Brambleclaw refuses to kill Firestar and frees him from the trap. Hawkfrost attacks Brambleclaw, but Brambleclaw kills Hawkfrost with the trap's sharp stick by stabbing his neck. Before he dies, Hawkfrost claims to Brambleclaw that a ThunderClan warrior helped him with his plan and that their fight is not over.\n\nThe prophecy \"Before there is peace, blood will spill blood, and the lake will run red\", given to Leafpool in an earlier book, is fulfilled; since Brambleclaw and Hawkfrost are half-brothers, they share the same blood and are kin, and as he stumbles down to the lake, blood pours from Hawkfrost's neck, making the lake run red.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n''Sunset'' was released as a hardcover in the US and UK on December 12, 2006.<ref name=\"Hardcover\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-New-Prophecy-6-Sunset-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060827694|title= Sunset (Warriors: The New Prophecy Series #6) Hardcover|publisher=harpercollins.com|accessdate=May 30, 2010}}</ref> The paperback version was released about a year later on September 25, 2007.<ref name=\"Paperback\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-New-Prophecy-6-Sunset-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060827717|title= Sunset (Warriors: The New Prophecy Series #6) Paperyeetback|publisher=harpercollins.com|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref> ''Sunset'' has also been released in CD audiobook and e-book format.<ref name=\"audiobook\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-New-Prophecy-6-Sunset/?isbn=9780061214974|title= Sunset (Warriors: The New Prophecy Series #6) Audiobook|publisher=harpercollins.com|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref> The audiobook was read by Nanette Savard, whose performance was praised by a reviewer for ''AudioFile'', who stated: \"Nanette Savard brings out the youth of the cats who are struggling to help their clan survive and to protect each other from outside danger\".<ref name=\"audiobook review\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0061214973/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books/?isbn=9780061214974| title= Sunset (Warriors: The New Prophecy Series #6) Editorial Reviews|publisher=amazon.com|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref>\nThe book was also re-released in the UK on September 29, 2011, with new cover art.\n\n==Critical reaction==\n''Sunset'' managed to boost the ''Warriors'' series into second position on ''The New York Times Bestseller List'' in the children's series section.<ref name=\"Kill Erin Hunter\">HarperCollins Authortracker email, Erin Hunter. Feb. 8, 2007</ref> It also received praise from reviewers for [[Barnes & Noble]], who said the book had an \"addictive bite\". A reviewer from ''[[Children's Literature (journal)|Children's Literature]]'' compared the novel to a soap opera, with conflict after conflict.

The book begins with the group of cats known as [[List of Warriors characters#ThunderClan|ThunderClan]] rebuilding its camp with the help of its old friends [[List of Warriors characters#Stormfur|Stormfur]] and [[List of Warriors characters#Brook|Brook]] following a badger attack in ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]''. As the book progresses, [[List of Warriors characters#Brambleclaw|BrambleClaw]] and [[List of Warriors characters#Squirrelflight|Squirrelflight]] overcome a previous conflict and fall in love again, but Brambleclaw continues to visit the spirit of his evil father [[List of Warriors characters#Tigerstar|Tigerstar]] in his dreams. Brambleclaw manages to convince ThunderClan leader [[List of Warriors characters#Firestar|Firestar]] to choose a new deputy to replace the long missing Graystripe and is surprised when he is chosen. Brambleclaw's half-brother [[List of Warriors characters#Hawkfrost|Hawkfrost]] attempts to kill Firestar in order that Brambleclaw might become leader of ThunderClan, but Brambleclaw saves Firestar and kills Hawkfrost, fulfilling the prophecy \"Before there is peace, blood will spill blood and the lake will run red\".\n\nThe book was first released on December 26, 2006, in the US as a hardcover. It then was released as a paperback, [[e-book]], and [[audiobook]]. The book was the third in the series to be released in audiobook format. The audiobook was read by Nanette Savard, whose performance was praised by ''[[AudioFile (magazine)|AudioFile]]''. ''Sunset'' received mixed to positive reviews from reviewers.\n\n==Plot summary==\nAfter dead badgers attack destroys much of ThunderClan's camp, Brook Where Small Fish Swim (Brook) and Stormfur, old friends of ThunderClan, help to rebuild the camp. The battle is not without its consequences, as both the medicine cat Cinderpelt and the warrior Sootfur die. The battle rekindles Squirrelflight's love for Brambleclaw (following a conflict between the two during the previous book), leading her to have an argument a few days after with [[List of Warriors characters#Ashfur|Ashfur]], whom she had moved to following her separation from Brambleclaw.\n\nAll of the Clans are grieving for the death of [[List of Warriors characters#Cinderpelt|Cinderpelt]]. [[List of Warriors characters#Leafpool|Leafpool]] finds herself struggling between grief and betrayal, for she has not seen Cinderpelt in the ranks of [[List of Warriors characters#StarClan|StarClan]]. During a visit to the Moonpool, where medicine cats share dreams with StarClan each month, former medicine cat [[List of Warriors characters#Spottedleaf|Spottedleaf]] goes to Leafpool in a dream and shows her that Cinderpelt is reborn in the form of [[List of Warriors characters#Cinderkit|Cinderkit]], one of [[List of Warriors characters#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]]'s four kits whom Cinderpelt died protecting.\n\nAfter months of waiting and with persuasion from Brambleclaw, Stormfur, the new medicine cat Leafpool and his own mate [[List of Warriors characters#Sandstorm|Sandstorm]], Firestar, leader of ThunderClan, finally declares that his friend and deputy Graystripe is not going to return after being abducted by humans in ''Dawn''. When a dream from StarClan, the spirits of the cats' ancestors, tells Leafpool that Brambleclaw should be the new deputy, Firestar agrees and appoints Brambleclaw as the new deputy. The decision is met with objection, because Brambleclaw had never mentored an apprentice, a requirement for becoming deputy. The matter is cleared when Firestar declares that Brambleclaw will mentor [[List of Warriors characters#Berrykit|Berrykit]] when the kit turns six months of age and mentions Leafpool's dream from StarClan to his warriors.\n\nTigerstar, an evil cat who is dead, continues to visit his sons (through different mothers) Hawkfrost and Brambleclaw in their dreams and when Brambleclaw becomes deputy, Tigerstar reveals his plan for Brambleclaw to take over ThunderClan and WindClan and for Hawkfrost to take over RiverClan and ShadowClan. Brambleclaw firmly rejects this idea, but agrees to make up a plan with Hawkfrost when they are awake.\n\nDuring the meeting, Brambleclaw hears a cat struggling in pain. He finds Firestar caught in a fox trap (wire snare) and Hawkfrost urges Brambleclaw to kill the ThunderClan leader so that Brambleclaw can become the new leader. After struggling with his desires, Brambleclaw refuses to kill Firestar and frees him from the trap. Hawkfrost attacks Brambleclaw, but Brambleclaw kills Hawkfrost with the trap's sharp stick by stabbing his neck. Before he dies, Hawkfrost claims to Brambleclaw that a ThunderClan warrior helped him with his plan and that their fight is not over.\n\nThe prophecy \"Before there is peace, blood will spill blood, and the lake will run red\", given to Leafpool in an earlier book, is fulfilled; since Brambleclaw and Hawkfrost are half-brothers, they share the same blood and are kin, and as he stumbles down to the lake, blood pours from Hawkfrost's neck, making the lake run red.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n''Sunset'' was released as a hardcover in the US and UK on December 12, 2006.<ref name=\"Hardcover\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-New-Prophecy-6-Sunset-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060827694|title= Sunset (Warriors: The New Prophecy Series #6) Hardcover|publisher=harpercollins.com|accessdate=May 30, 2010}}</ref> The paperback version was released about a year later on September 25, 2007.<ref name=\"Paperback\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-New-Prophecy-6-Sunset-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060827717|title= Sunset (Warriors: The New Prophecy Series #6) Paperback|publisher=harpercollins.com|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref> ''Sunset'' has also been released in CD audiobook and e-book format.<ref name=\"audiobook\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-New-Prophecy-6-Sunset/?isbn=9780061214974|title= Sunset (Warriors: The New Prophecy Series #6) Audiobook|publisher=harpercollins.com|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref> The audiobook was read by Nanette Savard, whose performance was praised by a reviewer for ''AudioFile'', who stated: \"Nanette Savard brings out the youth of the cats who are struggling to help their clan survive and to protect each other from outside danger\".<ref name=\"audiobook review\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0061214973/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books/?isbn=9780061214974| title= Sunset (Warriors: The New Prophecy Series #6) Editorial Reviews|publisher=amazon.com|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref>\nThe book was also re-released in the UK on September 29, 2011, with new cover art.\n\n==Critical reaction==\n''Sunset'' managed to boost the ''Warriors'' series into second position on ''The New York Times Bestseller List'' in the children's series section.<ref name=\"Kill Erin Hunter\">HarperCollins Authortracker email, Erin Hunter.
