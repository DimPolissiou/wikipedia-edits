The soldiers met a young lady who came from a river carrying a jar of water and a clay stove.  The soldiers unwittingly in Spanish language and in authoritative tone, to conceal the fact that they were lost, asked the local maiden the name of the place they were in. The lady, who speaks only her native language, naturally thought she was being interrogated about what she was carrying and nervously uttered \"''kalan-banga''\", meaning \"clay stove\" (kalan) and \"water jar\" (banga).<ref name=profile>{{cite web |title=City profile |url=http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/City-Profile/ |work=About the City |publisher=Official Website of the City of Calamba |accessdate=November 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603144106/http://calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/City-Profile/ |archive-date=June 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Because the Spaniards could not pronounce it properly, the town has been called Calamba supposedly since then. This legend is immortalized with a large concrete water jar erected in the city plaza with the names of the city's barangays written on its surface. It is now known as ''[[Calamba Claypot|Calambanga]]'' and is considered the \"World's Biggest Claypot\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Calamba City's Giant Claypot|url=http://goingaroundasia.com/index.php/2011/03/calamba-citys-giant-claypot/|publisher=Going Around Asia|accessdate=March 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223202047/http://goingaroundasia.com/index.php/2011/03/calamba-citys-giant-claypot/|archive-date=December 23, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This same jar is also found in the city's seal. The plaza was proposed by Dr. Agapito Alzona, then the town councilor to utilize the waste area where the old town market relocated from. The resolution was approved by the then town mayor Roman Lazaro and was completed in 1939.\n\n==History==\nThe oldest part of Calamba is believed to be Barangay Sucol where its first settlers remained. With the arrival of Spaniards, the whole area was converted into a hacienda, then a part of Tabuco (present-day [[Cabuyao]]). Calamba became an independent ''pueblo'' on August 28, 1742, and formed into the town of Calamba in 1770. In 1813, Calamba was placed in the hands of \"''encargados''\" by the Dominican Brothers, who divided into portions and sold the haciendas to the natives during the American regime.<ref name=profile/><ref name=\"pol-his\">{{cite web |title=Political History |url=http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/Government/Political-History/ |work=City Government |publisher=Official Website of the City of Calamba |accessdate=November 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023001341/http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/Government/Political-History/ |archive-date=October 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Matang Tubig Cave.jpg|thumb|A Matang Tubig Cave, American soldiers hiding at the cave during Japanese-American, World War II since 1932]]\nDuring the Japanese occupation in [[World War II]], the city was the theater of a massacre during which the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] killed at least 2,000 civilians.<ref>Jintaro Ishida,'' The Remains of War'', 2001, p.238, citing the Barangay Real Memorial.</ref> The [[St. John the Baptist Parish Church (Calamba)|St. John the Baptist Church]], established in 1859, was burned by the Japanese during World War II. It was reconstructed by Fr. Eliseo Dimaculangan. It was the christening site of [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]. The original baptismal font has been preserved and refurbished.\n\n===Cityhood===\nAfter a process of more than seven years, Calamba became the second component city of the Laguna by virtue of Republic Act No. 9024, \"''An Act Converting the Municipality of Calamba, Province of Laguna into a Component City to be known as the City of Calamba''.\" R.A. 9024 was signed into law by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on March 5, 2001, at the [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) then set the [[plebiscite]] for Calamba's cityhood on April 21, 2001 where 15,056 residents participated. 3,413 or 22.67% voted \"''No''\" while the remaining 77.33% voted \"''Yes\"'' to Calamba's conversion into a component city.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Events leading to Cityhood====\nAs early as 1994, the town's Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 1994 requesting the [[Senate of the Philippines]] through its president and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] through its speaker to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba's conversion into a city. It was only after two years that another resolution, Resolution No. 115 was passed requesting then [[Jun Chipeco, Jr.|Congressman Joaquin M. Chipeco]] Jr, to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba's cityhood and requesting the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for their comments and recommendations regarding the matter. Another two years passed before House Bill No. 986 and Senate bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 were filed in the House of Representatives by Congressman Chipeco and Senate of the Philippines by Senators [[Franklin M. Drilon]] and [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a III]], respectively.\n\nIt was only in the year 2000 that the motion for Calamba's cityhood was fast tracked. Then Mayor Severino J. Lajara requested favorable endorsement of House Bill No. 986 from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan on January 3, 2000. The Sangguniang Bayan also endorsed House Bill No. 986 and Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and also requested favorable endorsement from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan in the same month. A month passed and Mayor Lajara sent a follow-up letter to then Vice Governor [[Teresita S. Lazaro|Teresita \"Ningning\" Lazaro]] on updates regarding the matter.\n\nOn March 8, the House Committee on Local Government approved House Bill No. 986 on 2nd reading at a hearing held at Hotel Rembrandt, Quezon City. The same House Committee conducted a public hearing on House Bill No. 986 at the Calamba Elementary School (Central II) gymnasium on March 23, approving the House Bill in principle. House Bill 986 was deliberated in April by the House of Representatives in plenary session and approved as House Bill No. 10661, which was then filed with the Senate of the Philippines in June.\n\nThe year 2001 came and brought about approval on 2nd reading of Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and House Bill No. 10661 in a hearing held on February 5 at the Ambrocio Padilla Hall, Senate of the Philippines. Three days later, February 8, Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and House Bill No. 10661 was deliberated in Plenary Session and was approved as Republic Act No. 9024.<ref name=\":0\">Cityhood of Calamba http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/Cityhood-of-Calamba/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208132408/http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/Cityhood-of-Calamba/ |date=December 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Designation a regional center===\nThe city was declared the regional center of the [[Calabarzon]] region by then President [[Gloria Arroyo]] by virtue of Executive Order No. 246, dated October 28, 2003.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gov.ph/2003/10/28/executive-order-no-246-s-2003/| title=Executive Order No. 246, s. 2003|publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCalamba lies on the northern slopes of [[Mount Makiling]], a dormant volcano.

[[Laguna de Bay]] the country's largest lake, forms the city's northeast border. The provincial capital, [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], is located {{convert|37|km|sp=us}} by road to the east.\n\nCalamba covers a total land area of {{convert|14950|ha}}, making it is the second-largest city in Laguna province in terms of land area after [[San Pablo, Laguna|San Pablo]].\n\n===Land uses===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Classification<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/City-Profile/|title =City Profile|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140603144106/http://calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/City-Profile/|archive-date =June 3, 2014|url-status =dead}}</ref>\n!Land Area (hectares)\n|-\n| Urban Redevelopment Zone || 2,080\n|-\n| Growth Management Zone 1 || 4,199\n|-\n| Growth Management Zone 2 || 2,460\n|-\n| Upland Conservation Zone || 3,401.22\n|-\n| Forest Buffer Zone || 333\n|-\n| Makiling Forest Reservation Zone || 579.78\n|-\n| Agricultural Development Zone || 1,427\n|-\n| Shoreland Area || \u2013\n|-\n| '''Total Land Area''' || '''14,480'''\n|-\n| Urban Expansion Area || 8,562.7 ha\n|}\n\n==Barangays==\n{{Main|Calamba Poblacion}}\nCalamba City is politically subdivided into 54 barangays, the smallest administrative unit in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/Government/Barangay-Names/|title =Barangay Names|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140513000039/http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/Government/Barangay-Names/|archive-date =May 13, 2014|url-status =dead|df =mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#FFF895|\u2021|border=darkgray}} {{font|Urbanized Barangay|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#BFF5FF|\u00b1|border=darkgray}} {{font|Independent Barangay|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Poblacion|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Industrial & Component Barangay|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Common Barangay|size=90%}}\n}}{{verify inline|date=May 2019}} <!-- NOTE: Is this even a thing?

He wanted to capitalize on the city's historical heritage as the birthplace of unofficial Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Thus, the Buhayani Festival was born.\n\nThe term '''\"BUHAYANI\"''' was coined by joining two Filipino words, ''\"buhay\"'' meaning life or the state of being alive and lively and ''\"bayani\"'' or hero. The festival's tagline '''\"Buhay ng Bayani, Buh\u00e1y na Bayani\"''' literally translates to '''\"Life of the Hero\"'''pertaining to the life of our famous kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal and '''\"Living Hero\"'''which refers to the common man who has the capacity and potential to become everyday heroes in their own small ways.\n\n\"We want everyone who revere our kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal to come to Calamba and join us in honouring him on his birthday and in celebrating the modern Rizal in us. We want to make our National Hero modern and relevant in today\u2019s challenging times and we want to celebrate the spirit of heroism that lives in each Filipino, not just in us Calambe\u00f1os,\" Mayor Chipeco was quoted saying.\n\nDi\ufb00erent activities were lined up for this year's Buhayani Festival\u2014Kuwentong Bayani for selected Grade 5 students, Talinong Rizal Quiz Bee, Buhayani Football Cup, Independence Day Job Fair, SayawIndak Street Dancing Competition, Marching Band Competition, Baile de Gala, Hawig Rizal (Rizal Look-a-Like), Buhayani Eye Care Mission and a whole lot more.

A special wreath-laying ceremony shall also commence at the Museo ni Rizal sa Calamba after a simultaneous floral o\ufb00ering at \ufb01ve di\ufb00erent Rizal monuments around the city.\n\n\"Jose Rizal is not just the pride of Calamba, he is the pride of the entire country as he was the Greatest Malay to have lived. His works, teachings and ideals have inspired and will continue to inspire us as we strive to live up to his ideals of nationalism and love of country. In the Buhayani Festival, we celebrate an ideal and an advocacy that through this festival, we can rekindle the \ufb01re of patriotism and heroism in the hearts of every Filipino. Come to Calamba \u2013 retrace history\u2019s footsteps, rediscover the richness and uniqueness of our heritage, \ufb01re up our Filipino pride and be inspired to share and spread what you have experienced and be part of the force that will bring about a renewed love of country in every Filipino,\" Mayor Chipeco challenged.\n\n== Tourism ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:CalambaCityjf2751 08.JPG|A Calamba City Hall\nFile:Calamba Church.jpg|A Saint John Baptist (Calamba Church)\nFile:401Calamba, Laguna Town Proper Landmarks 09.jpg|Calamba Claypot\nFile:The wake park at Nuvali in Laguna.jpg|Republ1c Wakepark Canlubang\nFile:Rizal Monument in Calamba, Laguna.jpg|A Rizal Monument in Plaza Calamba\nFile:Rizal Shrine Outdoor (Calamba, Laguna).jpg|Rizal Shrine\n</gallery>\n\nCalamba is the location of [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s birthplace, [[Rizal Shrine (Calamba)|Rizal Shrine]], found in the ''poblacion'' (city proper), and [[St. John the Baptist Parish Church (Calamba)|St. John the Baptish Parish Church]], the location of Rizal's baptism.

The soldiers met a young lady who came from a river carrying a jar of water and a clay stove.  The soldiers unwittingly in Spanish language and in authoritative tone, to conceal the fact that they were lost, asked the local maiden the name of the place they were in. The lady, who speaks only her native language, naturally thought she was being interrogated about what she was carrying and nervously uttered \"''kalan-banga''\", meaning \"clay stove\" (kalan) and \"water jar\" (banga).<ref name=profile>{{cite web |title=City profile |url=http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/City-Profile/ |work=About the City |publisher=Official Website of the City of Calamba |accessdate=November 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603144106/http://calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/City-Profile/ |archive-date=June 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Because the Spaniards could not pronounce it properly, the town has been called Calamba supposedly since then. This legend is immortalized with a large concrete water jar erected in the city plaza with the names of the city's barangays written on its surface. It is now known as ''[[Calamba Claypot|Calambanga]]'' and is considered the \"World's Biggest Claypot\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Calamba City's Giant Claypot|url=http://goingaroundasia.com/index.php/2011/03/calamba-citys-giant-claypot/|publisher=Going Around Asia|accessdate=March 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223202047/http://goingaroundasia.com/index.php/2011/03/calamba-citys-giant-claypot/|archive-date=December 23, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This same jar is also found in the city's seal. The plaza was proposed by Dr. Agapito Alzona, then the town councilor to utilize the waste area where the old town market relocated from. The resolution was approved by the then town mayor Roman Lazaro and was completed in 1939.\n\n==History==\nThe oldest part of Calamba is believed to be Barangay Sucol where its first settlers remained. With the arrival of Spaniards, the whole area was converted into a hacienda, then a part of Tabuco (present-day [[Cabuyao]]). Calamba became an independent ''pueblo'' on August 28, 1742, and formed into the town of Calamba in 1770. In 1813, Calamba was placed in the hands of \"''encargados''\" by the Dominican Brothers, who divided into portions and sold the haciendas to the natives during the American regime.<ref name=profile/><ref name=\"pol-his\">{{cite web |title=Political History |url=http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/Government/Political-History/ |work=City Government |publisher=Official Website of the City of Calamba |accessdate=November 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023001341/http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/Government/Political-History/ |archive-date=October 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Matang Tubig Cave.jpg|thumb|A Matang Tubig Cave, American soldiers hiding at the cave during Japanese-American, World War II since 1932]]\nDuring the Japanese occupation in [[World War II]], the city was the theater of a massacre during which the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] killed at least 2,000 civilians.<ref>Jintaro Ishida,'' The Remains of War'', 2001, p.238, citing the Barangay Real Memorial.</ref> The [[St. John the Baptist Parish Church (Calamba)|St. John the Baptist Church]], established in 1859, was burned by the Japanese during World War II. It was reconstructed by Fr. Eliseo Dimaculangan. It was the christening site of [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]. The original baptismal font has been preserved and refurbished.\n\n===Cityhood===\nAfter a process of more than seven years, Calamba became the second component city of the Laguna by virtue of Republic Act No. 9024, \"''An Act Converting the Municipality of Calamba, Province of Laguna into a Component City to be known as the City of Calamba''.\" R.A. 9024 was signed into law by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on March 5, 2001, at the [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) then set the [[plebiscite]] for Calamba's cityhood on April 21, 2001 where 15,056 residents participated. 3,413 or 22.67% voted \"''No''\" while the remaining 77.33% voted \"''Yes\"'' to Calamba's conversion into a component city.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Events leading to Cityhood====\nAs early as 1994, the town's Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 1994 requesting the [[Senate of the Philippines]] through its president and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] through its speaker to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba's conversion into a city. It was only after two years that another resolution, Resolution No. 115 was passed requesting then [[Jun Chipeco, Jr.|Congressman Joaquin M. Chipeco]] Jr, to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba's cityhood and requesting the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for their comments and recommendations regarding the matter. Another two years passed before House Bill No. 986 and Senate bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 were filed in the House of Representatives by Congressman Chipeco and Senate of the Philippines by Senators [[Franklin M. Drilon]] and [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a III]], respectively.\n\nIt was only in the year 2000 that the motion for Calamba's cityhood was fast tracked. Then Mayor Severino J. Lajara requested favorable endorsement of House Bill No. 986 from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan on January 3, 2000. The Sangguniang Bayan also endorsed House Bill No. 986 and Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and also requested favorable endorsement from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan in the same month. A month passed and Mayor Lajara sent a follow-up letter to then Vice Governor [[Teresita S. Lazaro|Teresita \"Ningning\" Lazaro]] on updates regarding the matter.\n\nOn March 8, the House Committee on Local Government approved House Bill No. 986 on 2nd reading at a hearing held at Hotel Rembrandt, Quezon City. The same House Committee conducted a public hearing on House Bill No. 986 at the Calamba Elementary School (Central II) gymnasium on March 23, approving the House Bill in principle. House Bill 986 was deliberated in April by the House of Representatives in plenary session and approved as House Bill No. 10661, which was then filed with the Senate of the Philippines in June.\n\nThe year 2001 came and brought about approval on 2nd reading of Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and House Bill No. 10661 in a hearing held on February 5 at the Ambrocio Padilla Hall, Senate of the Philippines. Three days later, February 8, Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and House Bill No. 10661 was deliberated in Plenary Session and was approved as Republic Act No. 9024.<ref name=\":0\">Cityhood of Calamba http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/Cityhood-of-Calamba/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208132408/http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/Cityhood-of-Calamba/ |date=December 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Designation a regional center===\nThe city was declared the regional center of the [[Calabarzon]] region by then President [[Gloria Arroyo]] by virtue of Executive Order No. 246, dated October 28, 2003.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gov.ph/2003/10/28/executive-order-no-246-s-2003/| title=Executive Order No. 246, s. 2003|publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCalamba lies on the northern slopes of [[Mount Makiling]], a dormant volcano. The southern terminus of the [[South Luzon Expressway]] is in Calamba and this geographic position makes the city a gateway to the southern provinces of Luzon.

The abstract represents the influence of Dr. Jose Rizal and the Banga in the history of the City of Calamba.\n* '''Numbers''' \u2013 the engraved \"1742\"  mentions the year when Calamba was founded and seceded from the town of Cabuyao, while \"2001\" was identified as the year of Calamba's cityhood.\n* '''Objects''' \u2013 the mountain in the background and the water current at the bottom part relate to land and water resources of the city pertain to the vast natural resources of [[Mount Makiling]] and the aquatic benefits of Laguna de Bay. The water beneath Mt. Makiling shows that Calamba City touches a body of water notably [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country, and that's why Calamba City is also known as the \"City by the Lake\". The silhouette image of rice field on the left and the industrial buildings on the right symbolizing Calamba City's rapid modernization, urbanization, and industrialization.

He wanted to capitalize on the city's historical heritage as the birthplace of unofficial Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Thus, the Buhayani Festival was born.\n\nThe term '''\"BUHAYANI\"''' was coined by joining two Filipino words, ''\"buhay\"'' meaning life or the state of being alive and lively and ''\"bayani\"'' or hero. The festival's tagline '''\"Buhay ng Bayani, Buh\u00e1y na Bayani\"''' literally translates to '''\"Life of the Hero\"'''pertaining to the life of our famous kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal and '''\"Living Hero\"'''which refers to the common man who has the capacity and potential to become everyday heroes in their own small ways.\n\n\"We want everyone who revere our kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal to come to Calamba and join us in honouring him on his birthday and in celebrating the modern Rizal in us. We want to make our National Hero modern and relevant in today\u2019s challenging times and we want to celebrate the spirit of heroism that lives in each Filipino, not just in us Calambe\u00f1os,\" Mayor Chipeco was quoted saying.\n\nDi\ufb00erent activities were lined up for this year's Buhayani Festival\u2014Kuwentong Bayani for selected Grade 5 students, Talinong Rizal Quiz Bee, Buhayani Football Cup, Independence Day Job Fair, SayawIndak Street Dancing Competition, Marching Band Competition, Baile de Gala, Hawig Rizal (Rizal Look-a-Like), Buhayani Eye Care Mission and a whole lot more.

A special wreath-laying ceremony shall also commence at the Museo ni Rizal sa Calamba after a simultaneous floral o\ufb00ering at \ufb01ve di\ufb00erent Rizal monuments around the city.\n\n\"Jose Rizal is not just the pride of Calamba, he is the pride of the entire country as he was the Greatest Malay to have lived. His works, teachings and ideals have inspired and will continue to inspire us as we strive to live up to his ideals of nationalism and love of country. In the Buhayani Festival, we celebrate an ideal and an advocacy that through this festival, we can rekindle the \ufb01re of patriotism and heroism in the hearts of every Filipino. Come to Calamba \u2013 retrace history\u2019s footsteps, rediscover the richness and uniqueness of our heritage, \ufb01re up our Filipino pride and be inspired to share and spread what you have experienced and be part of the force that will bring about a renewed love of country in every Filipino,\" Mayor Chipeco challenged.\n\n== Tourism ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:CalambaCityjf2751 08.JPG|A Calamba City Hall\nFile:Calamba Church.jpg|A Saint John Baptist (Calamba Church)\nFile:401Calamba, Laguna Town Proper Landmarks 09.jpg|Calamba Claypot\nFile:The wake park at Nuvali in Laguna.jpg|Republ1c Wakepark Canlubang\nFile:Rizal Monument in Calamba, Laguna.jpg|A Rizal Monument in Plaza Calamba\nFile:Rizal Shrine Outdoor (Calamba, Laguna).jpg|Rizal Shrine\n</gallery>\n\nCalamba is the location of [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s birthplace, [[Rizal Shrine (Calamba)|Rizal Shrine]], found in the ''poblacion'' (city proper), and [[St. John the Baptist Parish Church (Calamba)|St. John the Baptish Parish Church]], the location of Rizal's baptism.

Many [[physics]] and [[engineering]] problems need to be solved.\n\nNevertheless, [[negative refractive materials]] have led to the development of [[metamaterial antennas]] and [[Metamaterial antennas#Metamaterial microwave lens|metamaterial microwave lens]]es for [[Metamaterial antennas|miniature wireless system antennas]] which are more efficient than their conventional counterparts. Also, metamaterial antennas are now commercially available. Meanwhile, [[subwavelength]] focusing with the [[superlens]] is also a part of present-day metamaterials research.<ref name=smith-works/>\n\n==Early wave studies==\n[[File:Onde electromagnetique.svg|thumb|300px|[[Electromagnetic wave]]s are formed by the vibrations of [[electric field]]s and [[magnetic field]]s. These fields are [[perpendicular]] to one another in the direction the wave is traveling. Once formed, this energy travels at the [[speed of light]] until further interaction with matter.

For example, waves in a pond do not carry the water molecules from place to place; rather the wave's energy travels through the water, leaving the water molecules in place. Additionally, charged particles, such as [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s create electromagnetic fields when they move, and these fields transport the type of energy known as electromagnetic radiation, or light. A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and vice versa\u2014the two are linked. These changing fields form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.<ref name=anatomyof/>\n\nThe \"''history of metamaterials''\" can have a variety starting points depending on the properties of interest. Related early [[wave|wave studies]] started in 1904 and progressed through more than half of the first part of the twentieth century. This early research included the relationship of the [[phase velocity]] to [[group velocity]] and the relationship of the [[wave vector]] and [[Pointing vector]].<ref name=klar-1/><ref name=Brodina/><ref name=PenSmi/>\n\nIn 1904 the possibility of negative [[phase velocity]] accompanied by an [[Antiparallel (mathematics)|anti-parallel]]  group velocity were noted by [[Horace Lamb]] (book: ''Hydrodynamics'') and [[Arthur Schuster]] (Book: ''Intro to Optics'').<ref name=slyusarmeta>Slyusar V.I. Metamaterials on antenna solutions.// 7th International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques ICATT\u201909, Lviv, Ukraine, October 6\u20139, 2009.  pp. 19\u201324 [http://www.slyusar.kiev.ua/019_024_ICATT_2009.pdf]</ref> However both thought practical achievement of these phenomena were not possible. In 1945 [[Leonid Mandelstam]] (also \"Mandel'shtam\") studied the anti-parallel phase and group advance in more detail.<ref name=slyusarmeta/> He is also noted for examining the electromagnetic characteristics of materials demonstrating negative refraction, as well as the first [[left-handed material]] concept.  <!--in his \"lecture notes [17, 18] pointed out that waves would refract negatively at an interface boundary between a regular and a backward-wave\nmedium\".<ref> [http://www.compumag.org/jsite/images/stories/newsletter/ICS-07-14-3-Igor.pdf The Anatomy of Negative Refraction]</ref>---> These studies included negative group velocity. He reported that such phenomena occurs in a [[crystal lattice]]. This may be considered significant because the metamaterial is a man made crystal lattice (structure).<ref name=klar-1>{{cite journal\n|doi= 10.1109/JSTQE.2006.880597\n|url= ftp://kim.ece.buap.mx/pub/profesor/academ07/BOOK/2/metamat7.pdf\n|title= Negative-Index Metamaterials: Going Optical\n|year= 2006\n|last1= Klar\n|first1= Thomas A.\n|last2= Kildishev\n|first2= Alexander V.\n|last3= Drachev\n|first3= Vladimir P.\n|last4= Shalaev\n|first4= Vladimir M.\n|journal= IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics\n|volume= 12\n|issue= 6\n|page= 1106\n|arxiv= physics/0605228\n|bibcode= 2006IJSTQ..12.1106K\n}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=Brodina>\n{{cite journal\n|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2005.04.068\n|arxiv=cond-mat/0503648\n|year=2005\n|title=Solitons and decoherence in left-handed metamaterials\n|last1=Marklund\n|first1=Mattias\n|last2=Shukla\n|first2=Padma K.\n|last3=Stenflo\n|first3=Lennart\n|last4=Brodin\n|first4=Gert\n|journal=Physics Letters A\n|volume=341\n|issue=1\u20134\n|pages=231\u2013234\n|bibcode = 2005PhLA..341..231M }}\n(PDF is self-published version.)</ref><ref name=early>Early wave studies\n*[1] H.

It was not until the 1990s that materials and computing power became available to artificially produce the necessary structures. Veselago also predicted a number of [[physics|electromagnetic phenomena]] that would be reversed including the [[refractive index]]. In addition, he is credited with coining the term \"left handed material\" for the present day metamaterial because of the anti-parallel behavior of the [[wave vector]] and other [[electromagnetic field]]s. Moreover, he noted that the material he was studying was a double negative material, as certain metamaterials are named today, because of the ability to simultaneously produce negative values for two important parameters, e.g. permittivity and permeability.  In 1968, his paper was translated and published in English.<ref name=PenSmi>He is often credited with inventing the modern day electromagnetic metamaterials as a result of his seminal 1967/68 report. \n{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1784272 |url=http://www.lehigh.edu/IMI/winterschool_lectures/Physics%20today%202004.pdf |title=Reversing Light with Negative Refraction |year=2004 |last1=Pendry |first1=John B. |last2=Smith |first2=David R. |journal=Physics Today |volume=57 |issue=6 |page=37 |bibcode=2004PhT....57f..37P |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607114622/http://www.lehigh.edu/IMI/winterschool_lectures/Physics%20today%202004.pdf |archivedate=June 7, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=Veselago1/> He was nominated later for a Nobel prize.\n\nLater still, developments in [[nanofabrication]] and [[subwavelength imaging]] techniques are now  taking this work into optical [[wavelength]]s.<ref name=shavoptic>Shalaev, V.M. \"Optical negative-index metamaterials,\" [[Nature Photonics]] Vol. 1, 41\u201348 (2007) {{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2006.49|title=Optical negative-index metamaterials|year=2007|last1=Shalaev|first1=Vladimir M.|journal=Nature Photonics|volume=1|issue=1|page=41|bibcode = 2007NaPho...1...41S }} Novel materials and engineered structures</ref>\n\n==Early electromagnetic media==\n[[File:Bose's demnstrated apparatus.gif|thumb|325px|Jagadish Chandra Bose|Bose's apparatus demonstrated at the [[Royal Institution]] in 1897.

This has long been known. For example, adding [[lead]] changes the color or hardness of [[glass]]. However, at the end of the 20th century this description was expanded by [[John Pendry]],  a [[physicist]] from [[Imperial College]] in [[London]].<ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/>  In the 1990s he was consulting for a British company, ''Marconi Materials Technology'', as a [[condensed matter physics]] expert. The company manufactured a [[stealth technology]] made of a radiation-absorbing [[carbon]] that was for [[naval vessel]]s. However, the company did not understand the [[physics]] of the material. The company asked Pendry if he could understand how the material worked.<ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/>\n\nPendry discovered that the [[Physical property|radiation absorption]] property did not come from the [[molecular]] or [[chemical structure]] of the material, i.e. the carbon per se. This property came from the long and thin, physical shape of the [[carbon fiber]]s. He realized rather than conventionally altering a material through its chemistry, as lead does with glass, the behavior of a material can be altered by changing a material's internal structure on a very fine scale. The very fine scale was less than the [[wavelength]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation]] that is applied. The theory applies across the electromagnetic spectrum that is in use by today's technologies. The radiations of interest are from radio waves, and microwaves, through infrared to the visible wavelengths.<ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmth.ph.ic.ac.uk/photonics/Newphotonics/pdf/lfplslet.pdf|journal=Phys.

The material would not be intrinsically magnetic, nor inherently susceptible to being magnetized. [[Copper wire]] is such a non-magnetic material. He envisioned fabricating a non-magnetic composite material, which could mimic the movements of electrons orbiting atoms. However, the structures are fabricated on a scale that is magnitudes larger than the atom, yet smaller than the radiated wavelength.\n\nHe envisioned and [[hypothesize]]d miniature loops of copper wire set in a [[fiberglass]] substrate could mimic the action of electrons but on a larger scale. Furthermore, this [[composite material]] could act like a slab of [[iron]].  In addition, he  deduced that a current run through the loops of wire results in a [[magnetic permeability|magnetic response]].<ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10>{{Cite magazine |last=Hapgood |first=Fred |last2=Grant |first2=Andrew |title=Metamaterial Revolution: The New Science of Making Anything Disappear |magazine=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |date=April 2009 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/apr/10-metamaterial-revolution-new-science-making-anything-disappear |access-date=2010-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331151639/http://discovermagazine.com/2009/apr/10-metamaterial-revolution-new-science-making-anything-disappear |archive-date=2019-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThis metamaterial idea resulted in variations. Cutting the loops results in a magnetic resonator, which acts like a switch. The switch, in turn, would allow Pendry to determine or alter the magnetic properties of the material simply by choice. At the time, Pendry didn't realize the significance of the two materials he had engineered. By combining the electrical properties of Marconi's radar-absorbing material with his new man-made magnetic material he had unwittingly placed in his hands a new way to manipulate electromagnetic radiation.  In 1999, Pendry published his new conception of artificially produced magnetic materials in a notable physics journal.

At that time he proposed that a reversal of [[Snell's law]], an [[Superlens|extraordinary lens]], and other exceptional phenomena  can occur within the [[laws of physics]]. This theory lay dormant for a few decades. There were no materials available in nature, or otherwise, that could physically realize Veselago's analysis.<ref name=smith-works/><ref name=Veselago1>\n{{cite journal\n|last=[[Veselago]]\n|first=V.G.\n|title=The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of [permittivity] and [permeability]\n|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi\n|year=1968\n|volume=10\n|issue=4\n|pages=509\u201314\n|doi=10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699\n|bibcode = 1968SvPhU..10..509V }}</ref><ref name=Newjournalphys-7-213>\n{{cite journal\n|last=Ward\n|first=David W. |author2=Nelson, Keith A. |author3=Webb, Kevin J.\n|title=On the physical origins of the negative index of refraction\n|journal=New Journal of Physics \n|year=2005|volume=7|issue=213|page=213|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/7/1/213|arxiv = physics/0409083 |bibcode = 2005NJPh....7..213W }}</ref>  Not until thirty-three years later did the properties of this material, a [[metamaterial]],  became a subdiscipline of [[physicist|physics]] and [[engineering]].\n\nHowever, there were certain observations, demonstrations, and implementations that closely preceded this work. [[Permittivity]] of metals, with values that could be stretched from the positive to the negative domain, had been studied extensively. In other words, negative permittivity was a known phenomenon by the time the first metamaterial was produced.  Contemporaries of Kock were involved in this type of research. The concentrated effort was led by the US government for researching interactions between the [[ionosphere]] and the re-entry of NASA space vehicles.\n\nIn the 1990s, Pendry et al. developed sequentially repeating  thin wire structures, analogous to [[crystal structures]]. These extended the range of material permittivity. However, a more revolutionary structure developed by Pendry et al. was a structure that could control magnetic interactions ([[magnetic permeability|permeability]]) of the radiated light, albeit only at microwave frequencies. This sequentially repeating, [[Split-ring resonator|split ring]] structure, extended material magnetic parameters into the negative. This lattice or periodic,  \"magnetic\" structure was constructed from non-magnetic components.\n\nHence, in electromagnetic domain, a negative value for permittivity and permeability occurring simultaneously was a requirement to produce the first metamaterials. These were beginning steps for proof of principle regarding Veselago's original 1967 proposal.\n\nIn 2000, a team of [[UCSD]] researchers produced and demonstrated metamaterials, which exhibited unusual [[Physics|physical properties]] that were never before produced in [[nature]]. These materials obey the [[laws of physics]], but behave differently from normal materials. In essence these ''negative index metamaterials'' were noted for having the ability to reverse many of the [[physical properties]] that govern the behavior of  ordinary optical materials. One of those unusual properties is the capability to reverse, for the first time, the [[Snell's law|Snell's law of refraction]]. Until this May 2000 demonstration by the UCSD team, the material was unavailable. Advances during the 1990s in fabrication and computation capabilities allowed these first [[metamaterial]]s to be constructed. Thus, testing the \"new\" metamaterial began for the effects described by [[Victor Veselago]] 30 years earlier, but only at first in the [[Microwave|microwave frequency]] domain. Reversal of [[group velocity]] was explicitly announced in the related published paper.<ref group=note>{{cite journal |url=http://people.ee.duke.edu/~drsmith/pubs_smith_group/Smith_PRL_84_4184_(2000).pdf |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.4184 |title=Composite Medium with Simultaneously Negative Permeability and Permittivity |first5=S. |last5=Schultz |first4=S. |last4=Nemat-Nasser |first3=D. |last3=Vier |first2=Willie |year=2000 |last2=Padilla |last1=Smith |first1=D.R. |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=84 |pages=4184\u201387 |pmid=10990641 |issue=18 |bibcode=2000PhRvL..84.4184S |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618194347/http://people.ee.duke.edu/~drsmith/pubs_smith_group/Smith_PRL_84_4184_(2000).pdf |archivedate=June 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n<ref name=UCSD-press-release>\n{{cite web|author=McDonald, Kim|title=UCSD Physicists Develop a New Class of Composite Material with 'Reverse' Physical Properties Never Before Seen|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/mccomposite.htm|publisher=UCSD Science and Engineering|date=2000-03-21|accessdate=2010-12-17}}</ref><ref name=Nsf1>\n\n{{cite web |author=Program contact: Carmen Huber|title=Physicist Produce Left Handed Composite Material|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2000/pr0009/pr0009.txt|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|date=2000-03-21|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref><ref name=smith-works>Summary of milestones in metamaterial research.

The super lens is a practical realization of this theory. It is a working lens that can capture images below the diffraction limit even though limitations occur due to the inefficiencies of conventional  materials.

Around 1999, Leonhardt began work on how to build a cloaking device with a few other colleagues. Leonhardt stated that at the time invisibility was not considered fashionable. He then wrote a theoretical study entitled \"''Optical Conformal Mapping''\". The first sentence sums up the objective: \"An invisibility device should guide light around an object as if nothing were there.\"<ref name=Vol-176-SciNews-cloak/>\n\nIn 2005, he sent the paper to three notable [[scientific journals]], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], [[Nature Physics]], and [[Science (journal)|Science]]. Each journal, in turn, rejected the paper. In 2006, [[Physical Review Letters]] rejected the paper for publication, as well. However, according to the PRL assessment, one of the anonymous reviewers noted that (he or she ) had been to two meetings in the previous months with [[John Pendry]]'s group, who were also working on a cloaking device. From the meetings, the reviewer also became aware of a patent that Pendry and his colleagues were supposed to file. Leonhardt was at the time unaware of the Pendry group's work. Because of the Pendry meetings, Leonhardt's work was not really considered new physics by the reviewer and, therefore, did not merit publication in Physical Review Letters.<ref name=Vol-176-SciNews-cloak/>\n\nLater in 2006,  ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (the journal) reversed its decision and contacted Leonhardt to publish his paper because it had just received a theoretical study  from Pendry's team entitled \"''Controlling Electromagnetic Fields''\". ''Science'' considered both papers strikingly similar and published them both in the same issue of [[Science (journal)|Science Express]] on May 25, 2006. The published papers touched off research efforts by a dozen groups to build cloaking devices at locations around the globe, which would test out the mathematics of both papers.<ref name=Vol-176-SciNews-cloak>\n{{Cite news\n| last =Petit\n| first =Charles\n| title =Invisibility Uncloaked\n| newspaper =[[Science News]] and reprinted on Scott.net\n| pages = 18.

This has long been known. For example, adding [[lead]] changes the color or hardness of [[glass]]. However, at the end of the 20th century this description was expanded by [[John Pendry]],  a [[physicist]] from [[Imperial College]] in [[London]].<ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/>  In the 1990s he was consulting for a British company, ''Marconi Materials Technology'', as a [[condensed matter physics]] expert. The company manufactured a [[stealth technology]] made of a radiation-absorbing [[carbon]] that was for [[naval vessel]]s. However, the company did not understand the [[physics]] of the material. The company asked Pendry if he could understand how the material worked.<ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/>\n\nPendry discovered that the [[Physical property|radiation absorption]] property did not come from the [[molecular]] or [[chemical structure]] of the material, i.e. the carbon per se. This property came from the long and thin, physical shape of the [[carbon fiber]]s. He realized rather than conventionally altering a material through its chemistry, as lead does with glass, the behavior of a material can be altered by changing a material's internal structure on a very fine scale. The very fine scale was less than the [[wavelength]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation]] that is applied. The theory applies across the electromagnetic spectrum that is in use by today's technologies. The radiations of interest are from radio waves, and microwaves, through infrared to the visible wavelengths.<ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmth.ph.ic.ac.uk/photonics/Newphotonics/pdf/lfplslet.pdf|journal=Phys.

Hence, the Greek word \"meta\" was attached, and these are called [[metamaterials]].<ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10/>\n\nAfter successfully deducing and realizing the carbon fiber structure, Pendry further proposed that he try to change the [[magnetic properties]] of a non-magnetic material, also by altering its physical structure. The material would not be intrinsically magnetic, nor inherently susceptible to being magnetized. [[Copper wire]] is such a non-magnetic material. He envisioned fabricating a non-magnetic composite material, which could mimic the movements of electrons orbiting atoms. However, the structures are fabricated on a scale that is magnitudes larger than the atom, yet smaller than the radiated wavelength.\n\nHe envisioned and [[hypothesize]]d miniature loops of copper wire set in a [[fiberglass]] substrate could mimic the action of electrons but on a larger scale. Furthermore, this [[composite material]] could act like a slab of [[iron]].  In addition, he  deduced that a current run through the loops of wire results in a [[magnetic permeability|magnetic response]].<ref name=Discover-mag-2009-03-10>{{Cite magazine |last=Hapgood |first=Fred |last2=Grant |first2=Andrew |title=Metamaterial Revolution: The New Science of Making Anything Disappear |magazine=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |date=April 2009 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/apr/10-metamaterial-revolution-new-science-making-anything-disappear |access-date=2010-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331151639/http://discovermagazine.com/2009/apr/10-metamaterial-revolution-new-science-making-anything-disappear |archive-date=2019-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThis metamaterial idea resulted in variations. Cutting the loops results in a magnetic resonator, which acts like a switch. The switch, in turn, would allow Pendry to determine or alter the magnetic properties of the material simply by choice. At the time, Pendry didn't realize the significance of the two materials he had engineered. By combining the electrical properties of Marconi's radar-absorbing material with his new man-made magnetic material he had unwittingly placed in his hands a new way to manipulate electromagnetic radiation.  In 1999, Pendry published his new conception of artificially produced magnetic materials in a notable physics journal.

[[Permittivity]] of metals, with values that could be stretched from the positive to the negative domain, had been studied extensively. In other words, negative permittivity was a known phenomenon by the time the first metamaterial was produced.  Contemporaries of Kock were involved in this type of research. The concentrated effort was led by the US government for researching interactions between the [[ionosphere]] and the re-entry of NASA space vehicles.\n\nIn the 1990s, Pendry et al. developed sequentially repeating  thin wire structures, analogous to [[crystal structures]]. These extended the range of material permittivity. However, a more revolutionary structure developed by Pendry et al. was a structure that could control magnetic interactions ([[magnetic permeability|permeability]]) of the radiated light, albeit only at microwave frequencies. This sequentially repeating, [[Split-ring resonator|split ring]] structure, extended material magnetic parameters into the negative. This lattice or periodic,  \"magnetic\" structure was constructed from non-magnetic components.\n\nHence, in electromagnetic domain, a negative value for permittivity and permeability occurring simultaneously was a requirement to produce the first metamaterials. These were beginning steps for proof of principle regarding Veselago's original 1967 proposal.\n\nIn 2000, a team of [[UCSD]] researchers produced and demonstrated metamaterials, which exhibited unusual [[Physics|physical properties]] that were never before produced in [[nature]]. These materials obey the [[laws of physics]], but behave differently from normal materials. In essence these ''negative index metamaterials'' were noted for having the ability to reverse many of the [[physical properties]] that govern the behavior of  ordinary optical materials. One of those unusual properties is the capability to reverse, for the first time, the [[Snell's law|Snell's law of refraction]]. Until this May 2000 demonstration by the UCSD team, the material was unavailable. Advances during the 1990s in fabrication and computation capabilities allowed these first [[metamaterial]]s to be constructed. Thus, testing the \"new\" metamaterial began for the effects described by [[Victor Veselago]] 30 years earlier, but only at first in the [[Microwave|microwave frequency]] domain. Reversal of [[group velocity]] was explicitly announced in the related published paper.<ref group=note>{{cite journal |url=http://people.ee.duke.edu/~drsmith/pubs_smith_group/Smith_PRL_84_4184_(2000).pdf |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.4184 |title=Composite Medium with Simultaneously Negative Permeability and Permittivity |first5=S. |last5=Schultz |first4=S. |last4=Nemat-Nasser |first3=D. |last3=Vier |first2=Willie |year=2000 |last2=Padilla |last1=Smith |first1=D.R. |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=84 |pages=4184\u201387 |pmid=10990641 |issue=18 |bibcode=2000PhRvL..84.4184S |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618194347/http://people.ee.duke.edu/~drsmith/pubs_smith_group/Smith_PRL_84_4184_(2000).pdf |archivedate=June 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n<ref name=UCSD-press-release>\n{{cite web|author=McDonald, Kim|title=UCSD Physicists Develop a New Class of Composite Material with 'Reverse' Physical Properties Never Before Seen|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/mccomposite.htm|publisher=UCSD Science and Engineering|date=2000-03-21|accessdate=2010-12-17}}</ref><ref name=Nsf1>\n\n{{cite web |author=Program contact: Carmen Huber|title=Physicist Produce Left Handed Composite Material|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2000/pr0009/pr0009.txt|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|date=2000-03-21|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref><ref name=smith-works>Summary of milestones in metamaterial research.

Around 1999, Leonhardt began work on how to build a cloaking device with a few other colleagues. Leonhardt stated that at the time invisibility was not considered fashionable. He then wrote a theoretical study entitled \"''Optical Conformal Mapping''\". The first sentence sums up the objective: \"An invisibility device should guide light around an object as if nothing were there.\"<ref name=Vol-176-SciNews-cloak/>\n\nIn 2005, he sent the paper to three notable [[scientific journals]], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], [[Nature Physics]], and [[Science (journal)|Science]]. Each journal, in turn, rejected the paper. In 2006, [[Physical Review Letters]] rejected the paper for publication, as well. However, according to the PRL assessment, one of the anonymous reviewers noted that (he or she ) had been to two meetings in the previous months with [[John Pendry]]'s group, who were also working on a cloaking device. From the meetings, the reviewer also became aware of a patent that Pendry and his colleagues were supposed to file. Leonhardt was at the time unaware of the Pendry group's work. Because of the Pendry meetings, Leonhardt's work was not really considered new physics by the reviewer and, therefore, did not merit publication in Physical Review Letters.<ref name=Vol-176-SciNews-cloak/>\n\nLater in 2006,  ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (the journal) reversed its decision and contacted Leonhardt to publish his paper because it had just received a theoretical study  from Pendry's team entitled \"''Controlling Electromagnetic Fields''\". ''Science'' considered both papers strikingly similar and published them both in the same issue of [[Science (journal)|Science Express]] on May 25, 2006.
