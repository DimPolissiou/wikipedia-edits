Williams, Jr., a member of Phi Beta Kappa and head of the mining department at [[Lehigh University]], formulated the idea of an honor society for those studying technical subjects.  Irving Andrew Heikes, the [[valedictorian]] of his class at Lehigh, was initiated as the first student member of Tau Beta Pi on June 15, 1885.<ref name=\"TBPi History\"/> A statue on Lehigh's campus commemorates this event.\n\nIn 1892, a second chapter was established at [[Michigan State University]]. Since then, the association has grown to 248 collegiate chapters across the [[United States]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. Tau Beta Pi was a founding member of the [[Association of College Honor Societies]].<ref name=\"ACHS History\">{{cite web | title = Historical Information | publisher = Association of College Honor Societies | date = 1983| url = http://www.achsnatl.org/moore.asp | accessdate = 2009-01-01}}</ref> The national headquarters of Tau Beta Pi is located in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] on the campus of the [[University of Tennessee]].<ref name=\"TBPi History\"/>\n\nAlthough Tau Beta Pi never discriminated on the basis of race or religion, Tau Beta Pi did make its start as a male-only society. Female engineering students were scholastically eligible for Tau Beta Pi as early as 1902; however, those women were not granted membership. Starting in 1936, TBP awarded a ''women's badge'' to exceptional female engineering students, and a total of 619 women's badges were awarded until 1969. In 1969, Tau Beta Pi began granting women full membership in the society.<ref name=\"TBPi Membership\">{{cite web | title = Tau Beta Pi Information Book, Membership| publisher = Tau Beta Pi Association | date = 2009 | url = https://www.tbp.org/about/informationBook.cfm | accessdate = 2009-01-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, the [[Sigma Tau]] fraternity merged with Tau Beta Pi. Sigma Tau was an honor society for engineering much like Tau Beta Pi and was founded at the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1904. At the time of the merger, Sigma Tau consisted of 34 collegiate chapters and a total membership of 45,000.  The basis of the merger of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Tau was the conviction that a single, strong honor society would better serve the engineering profession.<ref name=\"TBPi History\"/>\n\n== Insignia ==\nThe colors of Tau Beta Pi are [[seal brown]] and white, which are the school colors of Lehigh. The official badge, called the Bent, is a watch key in the shape of the [[Bent (structural)|bent]] of a [[trestle]] (see picture). The trestle is the load-bearing part of the bridge, representing Tau Beta Pi's principle of Integrity and Excellence In Engineering.  Originally, the keys could be used to wind watches. However, because watches have since been fabricated with their own winding mechanisms, modern keys do not have this ability. The symbols on the Bent are an ancient form of [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]]. The quarterly magazine of Tau Beta Pi is also titled ''The Bent''.<ref name=\"TBPi History\"/>\n[[File:Tau Beta Pi plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque recognizing the [[Georgia Tech]] chapter of Tau Beta Pi]]\n\n==Chapters==\nAs of 2020, there are 256 Tau Beta Pi Collegiate Chapters; 250 are currently active, 6 are inactive.<ref>https://www.tbp.org/off/chapterList.cfm</ref>\n{{main|List of Tau Beta Pi chapters}}\n\n== Membership ==\nThere is now only one \"class\" of members in Tau Beta Pi, the former classifications of Member with Distinction, Honorary Member, and Associate Member having been discontinued.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = Tau Beta Pi Membership\n| publisher = The Tau Beta Pi Association, Inc.\n| url = http://www.tbp.org/about/InfoBook/membership.cfm\n| accessdate = January 18, 2015\n}}</ref>  Election to membership in the association is accomplished only by vote of a collegiate chapter, and members' chapter designations are always those of the chapters which elected them.  Members' class numerals are those of the years in which they received the engineering degrees on which their eligibility was based, although members with no engineering degree are designated by the year in which they were initiated. Candidates eligible for consideration for election to membership by a collegiate chapter fall into five general categories:\n\n# Undergraduate students. \n# Graduate students. \n# Alumni of the chapter's institution who were eligible as students.\n# Alumni of other institutions who were eligible as students.\n# Engineers of high attainment in the profession, regardless of college attended, scholastic record, or educational background.\n\n=== Undergraduate eligibility requirements ===\nUndergraduate students whose scholarship places them in the top eighth of their engineering class in their next-to-last year or in the top fifth of their engineering class in their last college year are eligible for membership consideration. These scholastically eligible students are further considered on the basis of personal integrity, breadth of interest both inside and outside engineering, adaptability, and unselfish activity. At least 50% of a student's coursework must have been completed by the time of their invitation to the society.\n \nPrior to the fall of 1941, Tau Beta Pi's scholastic requirements were that eligible candidates stand in the top eighth of the junior class, but in the top quarter of the senior class. The classes graduating in 1942 were thus the first to be considered under the higher requirements.\n \nSome chapters set a scholastic-grade deadline below which candidates are not considered, such deadline being higher than that required as a minimum by the Constitution.\n \nElections and initiations are normally held twice a year, in the fall and winter or spring terms of the chapter's institution.\n \nStudent electees who are financially unable to meet the initiation-fee obligation may make delayed payment arrangements with their chapters, may borrow from the association's loan fund, or may accept election but postpone initiation for up to five years.\n \nUntil 1969 membership in Tau Beta Pi was limited to men, although qualified women were offered an award called the Women's Badge. From its authorization in 1936 until its elimination by the admission of women to membership, 619 Women's Badges were awarded by 98 chapters. Those women have now been offered membership by their chapters after Tau Beta Pi initiated its first female members in 1969.\n\n=== Graduate eligibility requirements ===\nEngineering graduate students whose scholarship places them in the top fifth of their graduate class or whose high-quality work is attested to by a faculty member may be elected to membership.\n \nEngineering alumni of a chapter's institution or of another recognized institution whose scholastic record placed them in the top fifth of their class may be elected to membership. Such candidates are usually recommended to the chapter by a member who knows them.\n \nIn all cases the requisite scholastic attainment makes candidates eligible for membership consideration. They are further considered on the basis of the association's exemplary character requirement.\n \n=== Eminent engineer eligibility requirements ===\nPersons who have achieved eminence in engineering may be elected to membership without regard to collegiate records. If they graduated from a recognized engineering college, they must have been engaged in engineering for at least 10 years; if not, they must have practiced engineering for at least 15 years. Such candidates are usually recommended by members who know them. The required degree of eminent achievement is left to the chapters' discretion; and candidates are further considered on the basis of exemplary character.\n\n=== Membership verification ===\nTau Beta Pi membership catalogs were published in 1898, 1911, 1916, 1926, 1932, and 1939. The 1946 Convention authorized discontinuance of them because of the excessive cost and limited usefulness.  Today, membership can be verified online.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = Tau Beta Pi Member Lookup\n| url = http://www.tbp.org/memb/MemberLookup.cfm\n| publisher = The Tau Beta Pi Association, Inc.\n| accessdate = January 18, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Membership benefits ===\nTau Beta Pi members gain access to a variety of benefits for life after initiation, including access to applying for $2000 scholarships for rising seniors (about 50% acceptance rate) and $10,000 fellowships for graduate students (about 10% acceptance rate), a private LinkedIn group of alumni, the opportunity to attend the annual national convention (with sponsored travel for voting delegates) and participate in a Tau Beta Pi-only recruiting fair, and graduation stoles and cords for members in good standing during their graduation. Members also receive automatic entry-level advancement of US Gov applicants to GS-7* 4 and member-only lifetime discounts from companies like Geico, Dell, SIRVA Home, PPI for FE/EIT and PE exams, and hotels around the world.\n\n== Major activities ==\nTau Beta Pi has an active fellowship and scholarship program supported by alumni members and other supporters.<ref name=\"TBPi Programs\">{{cite web | title = Tau Beta Pi Information Book, National Programs & Awards | publisher = Tau Beta Pi Association | date = 2009 | url = http://www.tbp.org/pages/About/InformationBook/Programs.cfm | accessdate = 2009-01-01 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072235/http://www.tbp.org/pages/About/InformationBook/Programs.cfm | archivedate = 2008-07-25 }}</ref> Some of the results of these programs are:<ref name=\"ACHS TBPi\"/>\n* 869 students have been given stipends exceeding $4,555,000 since 1929.\n* 1,768 students have borrowed more than $830,000 from the educational loan program since 1932.\n* 479 students have received scholarship awards of $958,000 since 1998.\n\n=== MindSET program ===\nOne initiative provided by Tau Beta Pi is the ''MindSET'' (Math, Science, Engineering, Technology) [[K-12]] program.

In 1969, Tau Beta Pi began granting women full membership in the society.<ref name=\"TBPi Membership\">{{cite web | title = Tau Beta Pi Information Book, Membership| publisher = Tau Beta Pi Association | date = 2009 | url = https://www.tbp.org/about/informationBook.cfm | accessdate = 2009-01-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, the [[Sigma Tau]] fraternity merged with Tau Beta Pi. Sigma Tau was an honor society for engineering much like Tau Beta Pi and was founded at the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1904. At the time of the merger, Sigma Tau consisted of 34 collegiate chapters and a total membership of 45,000.  The basis of the merger of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Tau was the conviction that a single, strong honor society would better serve the engineering profession.<ref name=\"TBPi History\"/>\n\n== Insignia ==\nThe colors of Tau Beta Pi are [[seal brown]] and white, which are the school colors of Lehigh. The official badge, called the Bent, is a watch key in the shape of the [[Bent (structural)|bent]] of a [[trestle]] (see picture). The trestle is the load-bearing part of the bridge, representing Tau Beta Pi's principle of Integrity and Excellence In Engineering.  Originally, the keys could be used to wind watches. However, because watches have since been fabricated with their own winding mechanisms, modern keys do not. The symbols on the Bent are an ancient form of [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]]. The quarterly magazine of Tau Beta Pi is also titled ''The Bent''.<ref name=\"TBPi History\"/>\n[[File:Tau Beta Pi plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque recognizing the [[Georgia Tech]] chapter of Tau Beta Pi]]\n\n==Chapters==\nAs of 2020, there are 256 Tau Beta Pi Collegiate Chapters; 250 are currently active, 6 are inactive.<ref>https://www.tbp.org/off/chapterList.cfm</ref>\n{{main|List of Tau Beta Pi chapters}}\n\n== Membership ==\nThere is now only one \"class\" of members in Tau Beta Pi, the former classifications of Member with Distinction, Honorary Member, and Associate Member having been discontinued.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = Tau Beta Pi Membership\n| publisher = The Tau Beta Pi Association, Inc.\n| url = http://www.tbp.org/about/InfoBook/membership.cfm\n| accessdate = January 18, 2015\n}}</ref>  Election to membership in the association is accomplished only by vote of a collegiate chapter, and members' chapter designations are always those of the chapters which elected them.  Members' class numerals are those of the years in which they received the engineering degrees on which their eligibility was based, although members with no engineering degree are designated by the year in which they were initiated. Candidates eligible for consideration for election to membership by a collegiate chapter fall into five general categories:\n\n# Undergraduate students. \n# Graduate students. \n# Alumni of the chapter's institution who were eligible as students.\n# Alumni of other institutions who were eligible as students.\n# Engineers of high attainment in the profession, regardless of college attended, scholastic record, or educational background.\n\n=== Undergraduate eligibility requirements ===\nUndergraduate students whose scholarship places them in the top eighth of their engineering class in their next-to-last year or in the top fifth of their engineering class in their last college year are eligible for membership consideration. These scholastically eligible students are further considered on the basis of personal integrity, breadth of interest both inside and outside engineering, adaptability, and unselfish activity. At least 50% of a student's coursework must have been completed by the time of their invitation to the society.\n \nPrior to the fall of 1941, Tau Beta Pi's scholastic requirements were that eligible candidates stand in the top eighth of the junior class, but in the top quarter of the senior class. The classes graduating in 1942 were thus the first to be considered under the higher requirements.\n \nSome chapters set a scholastic-grade deadline below which candidates are not considered, such deadline being higher than that required as a minimum by the Constitution.\n \nElections and initiations are normally held twice a year, in the fall and winter or spring terms of the chapter's institution.\n \nStudent electees who are financially unable to meet the initiation-fee obligation may make delayed payment arrangements with their chapters, may borrow from the association's loan fund, or may accept election but postpone initiation for up to five years.\n \nUntil 1969 membership in Tau Beta Pi was limited to men, although qualified women were offered an award called the Women's Badge. From its authorization in 1936 until its elimination by the admission of women to membership, 619 Women's Badges were awarded by 98 chapters. Those women have now been offered membership by their chapters after Tau Beta Pi initiated its first female members in 1969.\n\n=== Graduate eligibility requirements ===\nEngineering graduate students whose scholarship places them in the top fifth of their graduate class or whose high-quality work is attested to by a faculty member may be elected to membership.\n \nEngineering alumni of a chapter's institution or of another recognized institution whose scholastic record placed them in the top fifth of their class may be elected to membership. Such candidates are usually recommended to the chapter by a member who knows them.\n \nIn all cases the requisite scholastic attainment makes candidates eligible for membership consideration. They are further considered on the basis of the association's exemplary character requirement.\n \n=== Eminent engineer eligibility requirements ===\nPersons who have achieved eminence in engineering may be elected to membership without regard to collegiate records. If they graduated from a recognized engineering college, they must have been engaged in engineering for at least 10 years; if not, they must have practiced engineering for at least 15 years. Such candidates are usually recommended by members who know them. The required degree of eminent achievement is left to the chapters' discretion; and candidates are further considered on the basis of exemplary character.\n\n=== Membership verification ===\nTau Beta Pi membership catalogs were published in 1898, 1911, 1916, 1926, 1932, and 1939. The 1946 Convention authorized discontinuance of them because of the excessive cost and limited usefulness.  Today, membership can be verified online.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = Tau Beta Pi Member Lookup\n| url = http://www.tbp.org/memb/MemberLookup.cfm\n| publisher = The Tau Beta Pi Association, Inc.\n| accessdate = January 18, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Membership benefits ===\nTau Beta Pi members gain access to a variety of benefits for life after initiation, including access to applying for $2000 scholarships for rising seniors (about 50% acceptance rate) and $10,000 fellowships for graduate students (about 10% acceptance rate), a private LinkedIn group of alumni, the opportunity to attend the annual national convention (with sponsored travel for voting delegates) and participate in a Tau Beta Pi-only recruiting fair, and graduation stoles and cords for members in good standing during their graduation. Members also receive automatic entry-level advancement of US Gov applicants to GS-7* 4 and member-only lifetime discounts from companies like Geico, Dell, SIRVA Home, PPI for FE/EIT and PE exams, and hotels around the world.\n\n== Major activities ==\nTau Beta Pi has an active fellowship and scholarship program supported by alumni members and other supporters.<ref name=\"TBPi Programs\">{{cite web | title = Tau Beta Pi Information Book, National Programs & Awards | publisher = Tau Beta Pi Association | date = 2009 | url = http://www.tbp.org/pages/About/InformationBook/Programs.cfm | accessdate = 2009-01-01 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072235/http://www.tbp.org/pages/About/InformationBook/Programs.cfm | archivedate = 2008-07-25 }}</ref> Some of the results of these programs are:<ref name=\"ACHS TBPi\"/>\n* 869 students have been given stipends exceeding $4,555,000 since 1929.\n* 1,768 students have borrowed more than $830,000 from the educational loan program since 1932.\n* 479 students have received scholarship awards of $958,000 since 1998.\n\n=== MindSET program ===\nOne initiative provided by Tau Beta Pi is the ''MindSET'' (Math, Science, Engineering, Technology) [[K-12]] program. This program is designed to foster interest in engineering among elementary, middle, and high school students with classroom and hands-on activities.

He is associated with the [[School of Paris]] and [[Tachisme]], an [[Abstract art|abstract painting]] movement that began during the 1940s.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Moscow]]. After 1905, the family moved to [[St. Petersburg]], the capital in 1909. In 1918, he moved to [[Kiev]] where he painted his first paintings. During the [[Russian Civil War]] he fought in the [[White Army]]. After an injury he moved to [[Constantinople]] and in 1921, he went to [[Paris]]. Recalling his arrival in the French capital, Lanskoy said: \"Literally in the first night I started to paint and I haven\u2019t stopped since.\" In Paris, he met [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Jean-Michel Coulon]] and later [[Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl]].\n\nLanskoy spent a lot of time at museums and was influenced by [[James Ensor]]\u2019s and [[Vincent van Gogh]]\u2019s use of color. In 1923, he participated in his first group exhibitions of Russian painters at the La Licorne Gallery in Paris. [[Wilhelm Uhde]] discovered Lanskoy\u2019s paintings at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in 1924 and became a collector of his works in the years that followed. In 1925, Lanskoy had a solo exhibition and his works were acquired by museums and important private collectors. After 1937, his paintings began a transition towards [[Abstract art|abstraction]] and he studied both [[Paul Klee]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. He was a wonderful painter.\n\nAfter 1942, he painted only abstract works. The interaction of form and color became the major theme running through his oeuvre: \"Even though every brushstroke represents for itself a transformed reality, it receives its true meaning in the context of surrounding shades of color.\" In 1944, Lanskoy exhibited at the Jeanne Bucher Gallery in Paris where he met Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl. In 1948, he showed at the Louis Carr\u00e9 Gallery and in 1951 at the Galerie Jacques Dubourg. The Tooth and Sons Gallery showed his work in 1953 and The Loeb Gallery in [[New York City]] followed in 1959. In 1962, he began to work on a large project of original prints and [[collage]]s to accompany [[Nikolai Gogol]]\u2019s novel ''Diary of a Madman.'' He worked for fourteen years until his death on this project resulting in 150 collages and 80 [[lithograph]]s. In 1966 he had an exhibition at the Muse\u00e9 Galli\u00e9ra, Paris. The Neue Galerie in [[Z\u00fcrich]] held an exhibition in 1969. Lanskoy died on 24 August 1976 in Paris. The Aras Gallery collected the extensive ''Diary of a Madman'' series of prints and staged a major posthumous [[exhibition]] in 1989.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/lanskoy_andre.html Artwork by museum, Artcylopedia]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lanskoy, Andrej}}\n[[Category:20th-century Russian painters]]\n[[Category:Russian male painters]]\n[[Category:20th-century French painters]]\n[[Category:French male painters]]\n[[Category:Modern artists]]\n[[Category:Modern painters]]\n[[Category:Burials at Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]]\n[[Category:1902 births]]\n[[Category:1976 deaths]]\n[[Category:School of Paris]]\n[[Category:Art Informel and Tachisme painters]]\n[[Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to France]]\n[[Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Turkey]]\n[[Category:White Russian emigrants to Turkey]]\n[[Category:White Russian emigrants to France]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox artist\n| honorific_prefix = \n| name             = Andr\u00e9 Lanskoy\n| honorific_suffix = \n| image            = Lanskoy-Andr\u00e9-tombe.jpg\n| image_size       = \n| alt              = \n| caption          = \n| native_name      = \n| native_name_lang = \n| birth_name       = <!-- only use if different than name -->\n| birth_date       = {{Birth date|1902|03|13}}\n| birth_place      = Moscow\n| death_date       = {{Death date and age|1976|08|24|1902|03|13}} \n| death_place      = Paris\n| resting_place    = \n| resting_place_coordinates = <!-- {{Coord|LAT|LONG|type:landmark|display=inline}} -->\n| nationality      = Russian\n| residence        = France\n| education        = \n| alma_mater       = \n| known_for        = Painter and printmaker\n| notable_works    = \n| style            = Abstract\n| movement         = Tachisme \n| spouse           = \n| partner          = \n| awards           = <!-- {{awd|award|year|title|role|name}} (optional) -->\n| elected          = \n| patrons          = \n| memorials        = \n| website          = <!-- {{URL|Example.com}} -->\n| module           = \n}}\n\n{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}\n'''Andr\u00e9 Lanskoy''' (31 March 1902 &ndash; 24 August 1976) was a Russian painter and printmaker who worked in France.

In 1119, on the death of [[Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VII]], the House of Flanders ceased to rule in Flanders. But in 1191, the House of Flanders recovered the title of Count of Flanders with [[Baldwin VIII, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VIII]] (Baldwin V of Hainaut). The dynasty established the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]]. It also ruled briefly the County of Namur (1188-1212). The House of Flanders became extinct in 1280 with the death of [[Margaret II, Countess of Flanders|Margaret II]].\n\nA cadet branch, the House of Boulogne, ruled over the [[County of Boulogne]]. Members of this house joined the [[First Crusade]], established the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and produced its first kings.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{Tree list}}\n*[[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin I, Count of Flanders|Baldwin I Iron Arm]], [[Count of Flanders]] (\u2020 879)\n** {{Tree list/final branch}} [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II the Bald]], Count of Flanders (\u2020 918)\n***[[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders|Arnulf I the Great]], Count of Flanders (\u2020 965)\n**** Elftrude, born circa 932, married in 964 to [[File:Blason_ville_fr_Guines_(PDC).png|15px]] Siegfried, Count of Gu\u00eenes (\u2020 965)\n**** Hildegarde (934 \u2020 990), married in 943 to [[File:Counts of Holland Arms.svg|15px]] [[Dirk II, Count of Holland]] (930 \u2020 988)\n**** Egbert (937 \u2020 953)\n**** Liutgarde (938 \u2020 964), married in 950 to Wichmann IV, Count of Hamaland and Ghent.\n**** {{Tree list/final branch}}  [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin III, Count of Flanders|Baldwin III]], Count of Flanders (\u2020 962)\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}}  [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Arnulf II, Count of Flanders|Arnulf II]], Count of Flanders (\u2020 988)\n****** Mathilda (\u2020 995 or before)\n****** {{Tree list/final branch}}  [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders|Baldwin IV the Bearded]] (v.980 \u2020 1035), Count of Flanders (\u2020 1035)\n******* [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders|Baldwin V ''of Lille'']], Count of Flanders (\u2020 1067)\n******** [[File:Blason Flandre ancien.svg|15px]] [[File:Blason fr Hainaut ancien.svg|15px]] [[Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VI the Good]], (1030 -
