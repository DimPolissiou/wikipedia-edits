It features a number of hits such as \"[[Chiquitita]]\", \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\" and \"[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]\" and showed the group embrace [[disco]] music, which was at its peak at the time. The album topped the charts in a number of countries and was one of the top five-selling albums in the UK for that year.\n\nIt was the first ABBA album to be mainly recorded at [[Polar Studios]] in Stockholm, and the only ABBA album to include a studio recording made outside Sweden: the instrumental backing track for the title track was partly recorded at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami.\n\n''Voulez-Vous'' was first released on CD in 1984. The album has been digitally remastered and reissued four times; first in 1997, then in 2001 and in 2005 as part of ''[[The Complete Studio Recordings (ABBA album)|The Complete Studio Recordings]]'' box set, and yet again in 2010 for the ''Voulez-Vous Deluxe Edition''.\n\n==Background==\nIn early 1978, ABBA were at the peak of their success and having just completed promotion for their [[ABBA: The Album|latest album]] and [[ABBA: The Movie|theatrical film]] release, thoughts were turned to the next album, which was planned to be released in time for Christmas. Sessions however proved to be difficult and after starting on 13 March 1978 with the ultimately unreleased track \"Dr Claus von Hamlet\", a number of compositions were demoed and rejected. Indeed, after six months, only two songs that would end up on the finished album (\"[[The King Has Lost His Crown]]\" and \"[[Lovers (Live a Little Longer)]]\") were completed.<ref name=\"Carlpart1\">{{cite web|first= Carl Magnus |last= Palm |authorlink= Carl Magnus Palm |title= Liner notes, part 1 |date= 6 May 2011 |accessdate= 14 February 2017 |url= http://www.carlmagnuspalm.com/abba/studio-albums/voulez-vous-deluxe-edition/liner-notes-part-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time the group opened their own recording studio, [[Polar Studios]] in Stockholm, which were among the most advanced in the world at the time and would be where ABBA would work from here on. Two songs recorded at this time were \"Lovelight\" and \"[[Dream World (ABBA song)|Dream World]]\". However, neither song would appear on the ''Voulez-Vous'' album (\"Lovelight\" would be used as the B-side to the single \"Chiquitita\", while \"Dream World\" would remain unreleased until 1994; both songs are now featured as bonus tracks on re-issues of the ''Voulez-Vous'' album). Other tracks started but subsequently scrapped included \"Crying Over You\", \"Free as a Bumble Bee\", \"Rubber Ball Man\" and \"Just a Notion\".\n\nBy September 1978, ABBA had been silent in the charts for some months, and so a song from the recording sessions, \"[[Summer Night City]]\", was released as a single. Never happy with the finished song, members Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus regretted the release and lamented the fact that it peaked lower than previous singles in the charts, not being released at all in the US. They considered the UK to be their most important market, and there it had ended a run of No. 1 hits by stalling at No. 5 - their smallest hit for three years. A full-length version was however still planned for the upcoming album, but ultimately never used. By this time, tensions were growing within the group due to the low productivity of the period, as member Agnetha Faltskog commented; \"I can tell from the look in Bj\u00f6rn's eyes when he gets home how the day's work has been. Many times the boys have been working for ten hours without coming up with one single note\". Andersson talked to a reporter at the time saying; \"The prospects are not good. It\u2019s worse than ever...We have no idea when we\u2019ll be finished\".<ref name=\"Carlpart1\"/> It became obvious that the album wouldn't be completed by the end of the year and the deadline was extended into 1979. In late 1978, further indication of internal struggles became widely known when it was announced that married couple Ulvaeus and Faltskog were to divorce. Rather than spelling the end for the group however, this freed up a lot of the tensions between the two and in late 1978, work suddenly took off apace for the album.\n\nIn October, two tracks were completed: \"[[Angeleyes]]\" and \"[[If It Wasn't for the Nights]]\". Although seen as an archetype ABBA track, the former of these was deemed dated by Andersson, labelling it \"back to the sixties\". The second track however featured an all-out contemporary vibe, being quite disco-orientated and considered the strongest song that had been recorded for the album. It was intended to be not only the next single but also the song that ABBA would perform at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] in January 1979. This plan was changed however when an even-better song came along in December. With the original title of  \"In the Arms of Rosalita\", \"[[Chiquitita]]\" was the song the band performed. Although rather more [[schlager]] in style, Andersson considered it the best of their new songs, despite the feeling that it was very out of style with the rest of the acts performing that night. \"It was pretty strange, but we felt it was the best song we had and that's why we chose it, however wrong it may have been\", he said.<ref name=\"Carlpart1\"/> In early 1979, \"Chiquitita\" became one of ABBA's biggest hits around the world, reaching No. 1 in many countries, although just being clipped by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s \"[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]\" in the UK at No. 2.<ref>{{cite web|title= Official Singles Chart Top 75: 04 February 1979 \u2013 10 February 1979 |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate= 14 February 2017 |url= http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19790204/7501/}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of January, Andersson and Ulvaeus left Sweden and rented an apartment in the Bahamas where they felt they could get some inspiration by listening to American music and experiencing a whole different vibe to the rather conservative Stockholm. Two songs emerged from this time; \"[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]\" and \"[[Kisses of Fire]]\". Excited by the former, they went to [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami to record the backing track with the disco band [[Foxy (band)|Foxy]] \u2014 the only time they recorded a song outside Sweden.<ref name=\"Carlpart1\"/> Upon returning to Sweden to finish the songs, another track, \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\", was recorded - a song that was to be the next single, and also the only mainstream release to feature Ulvaeus on lead vocals. The single would not become as big a hit worldwide as \"Chiquitita\", but was the most successful release from the album in the US.\n\nBy the end of March, the final two tracks were finished; \"[[As Good as New]]\" and \"[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]\" (the latter featuring a local children's choir).<ref name=\"Carlpart2\">{{cite web|first= Carl Magnus |last= Palm |authorlink= Carl Magnus Palm |title= Liner notes, part 2 |date= 6 May 2011 |accessdate= 14 February 2017 |url= http://www.carlmagnuspalm.com/abba/studio-albums/voulez-vous-deluxe-edition/liner-notes-part-1}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of April the album, titled ''Voulez-Vous'', was finally ready for release and to emphasize the shift towards a disco sound, the album cover shot was taken at Alexandra's night club in Stockholm.<ref name=\"Carlpart2\"/> Released on 23 April 1979, ''Voulez-Vous'' topped the charts all over Europe (including the UK, where it entered the charts at No. 1 and remained there for a month),<ref name=\"UK\"/> and was a Top 10 success in countries including Canada,<ref name=\"CAN\"/> New Zealand<ref name=\"NZ\"/> and Australia.<ref name=\"AUS\"/> In the US, ''Voulez-Vous'' became ABBA's third album to reach the top 20 (peaking at No. 19).<ref name=\"US\"/>\n\nIn the following months, ABBA released a number of other singles from the album. The title track was released as a double A-side with \"Angeleyes\", while \"I Have a Dream\" was belatedly released in December 1979 following their recent world tour.

It features a number of hits such as \"[[Chiquitita]]\", \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\" and \"[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]\" and showed the group embrace [[disco]] music, which was at its peak at the time. The album topped the charts in a number of countries and was one of the top five-selling albums in the UK for that year.\n\nIt was the first ABBA album to be mainly recorded at [[Polar Studios]] in Stockholm, and the only ABBA album to include a studio recording made outside Sweden: the instrumental backing track for the title track was partly recorded at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami.\n\n''Voulez-Vous'' was first released on CD in 1984. The album has been digitally remastered and reissued four times; first in 1997, then in 2001 and in 2005 as part of ''[[The Complete Studio Recordings (ABBA album)|The Complete Studio Recordings]]'' box set, and yet again in 2010 for the ''Voulez-Vous Deluxe Edition''.\n\n==Background==\nIn early 1978, ABBA were at the peak of their success and having just completed promotion for their [[ABBA: The Album|latest album]] and [[ABBA: The Movie|theatrical film]] release, thoughts were turned to the next album, which was planned to be released in time for Christmas. Sessions however proved to be difficult and after starting on 13 March 1978 with the ultimately unreleased track \"Dr Claus von Hamlet\", a number of compositions were demoed and rejected. Indeed, after six months, only two songs that would end up on the finished album (\"[[The King Has Lost His Crown]]\" and \"[[Lovers (Live a Little Longer)]]\") were completed.<ref name=\"Carlpart1\">{{cite web|first= Carl Magnus |last= Palm |authorlink= Carl Magnus Palm |title= Liner notes, part 1 |date= 6 May 2011 |accessdate= 14 February 2017 |url= http://www.carlmagnuspalm.com/abba/studio-albums/voulez-vous-deluxe-edition/liner-notes-part-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time the group opened their own recording studio, [[Polar Studios]] in Stockholm, which were among the most advanced in the world at the time and would be where ABBA would work from here on. Two songs recorded at this time were \"Lovelight\" and \"[[Dream World (ABBA song)|Dream World]]\". However, neither song would appear on the ''Voulez-Vous'' album (\"Lovelight\" would be used as the B-side to the single \"Chiquitita\", while \"Dream World\" would remain unreleased until 1994; both songs are now featured as bonus tracks on re-issues of the ''Voulez-Vous'' album). Other tracks started but subsequently scrapped included \"Crying Over You\", \"Free as a Bumble Bee\", \"Rubber Ball Man\" and \"Just a Notion\".\n\nBy September 1978, ABBA had been silent in the charts for some months, and so a song from the recording sessions, \"[[Summer Night City]]\", was released as a single. Never happy with the finished song, members Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus regretted the release and lamented the fact that it peaked lower than previous singles in the charts, not being released at all in the US. They considered the UK to be their most important market, and there it had ended a run of No. 1 hits by stalling at No. 5 - their smallest hit for three years. A full-length version was however still planned for the upcoming album, but ultimately never used. By this time, tensions were growing within the group due to the low productivity of the period, as member Agnetha Faltskog commented; \"I can tell from the look in Bj\u00f6rn's eyes when he gets home how the day's work has been. Many times the boys have been working for ten hours without coming up with one single note\". Andersson talked to a reporter at the time saying; \"The prospects are not good. It\u2019s worse than ever...We have no idea when we\u2019ll be finished\".<ref name=\"Carlpart1\"/> It became obvious that the album wouldn't be completed by the end of the year and the deadline was extended into 1979. In late 1978, further indication of internal struggles became widely known when it was announced that married couple Ulvaeus and Faltskog were to divorce. Rather than spelling the end for the group however, this freed up a lot of the tensions between the two and in late 1978, work suddenly took off apace for the album.\n\nIn October, two tracks were completed: \"[[Angeleyes]]\" and \"[[If It Wasn't for the Nights]]\". Although seen as an archetype ABBA track, the former of these was deemed dated by Andersson, labelling it \"back to the sixties\". The second track however featured an all-out contemporary vibe, being quite disco-orientated and considered the strongest song that had been recorded for the album. It was intended to be not only the next single but also the song that ABBA would perform at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] in January 1979. This plan was changed however when an even-better song came along in December. With the original title of  \"In the Arms of Rosalita\", \"[[Chiquitita]]\" was the song the band performed. Although rather more [[schlager]] in style, Andersson considered it the best of their new songs, despite the feeling that it was very out of style with the rest of the acts performing that night. \"It was pretty strange, but we felt it was the best song we had and that's why we chose it, however wrong it may have been\", he said.<ref name=\"Carlpart1\"/> In early 1979, \"Chiquitita\" became one of ABBA's biggest hits around the world, reaching No. 1 in many countries, although just being clipped by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s \"[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]\" in the UK at No. 2.<ref>{{cite web|title= Official Singles Chart Top 75: 04 February 1979 \u2013 10 February 1979 |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate= 14 February 2017 |url= http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19790204/7501/}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of January, Andersson and Ulvaeus left Sweden and rented an apartment in the Bahamas where they felt they could get some inspiration by listening to American music and experiencing a whole different vibe to the rather conservative Stockholm. Two songs emerged from this time; \"[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]\" and \"[[Kisses of Fire]]\". Excited by the former, they went to [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami to record the backing track with the disco band [[Foxy (band)|Foxy]] \u2014 the only time they recorded a song outside Sweden.<ref name=\"Carlpart1\"/> Upon returning to Sweden to finish the songs, another track, \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\", was recorded - a song that was to be the next single, and also the only mainstream release to feature Ulvaeus on lead vocals. The single would not become as big a hit worldwide as \"Chiquitita\", but was the most successful release from the album in the US.\n\nBy the end of March, the final two tracks were finished; \"[[As Good as New]]\" and \"[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]\" (the latter featuring a local children's choir).<ref name=\"Carlpart2\">{{cite web|first= Carl Magnus |last= Palm |authorlink= Carl Magnus Palm |title= Liner notes, part 2 |date= 6 May 2011 |accessdate= 14 February 2017 |url= http://www.carlmagnuspalm.com/abba/studio-albums/voulez-vous-deluxe-edition/liner-notes-part-1}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of April the album, titled ''Voulez-Vous'', was finally ready for release and to emphasize the shift towards a disco sound, the album cover shot was taken at Alexandra's night club in Stockholm.<ref name=\"Carlpart2\"/> Released on 23 April 1979, ''Voulez-Vous'' topped the charts all over Europe (including the UK, where it entered the charts at No. 1 and remained there for a month),<ref name=\"UK\"/> and was a Top 10 success in countries including Canada,<ref name=\"CAN\"/> New Zealand<ref name=\"NZ\"/> and Australia.<ref name=\"AUS\"/> In the US, ''Voulez-Vous'' became ABBA's third album to reach the top 20 (peaking at No. 19).<ref name=\"US\"/>\n\nIn the following months, ABBA released a number of other singles from the album. The title track was released as a double A-side with \"Angeleyes\", while \"I Have a Dream\" was belatedly released in December 1979 following their recent world tour. A track recorded in August 1979 (four months after the release of the album), \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\", was released as a single in October and was later included as a bonus track on CD versions of ''Voulez-Vous''.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline     = Side one\n| all_writing  = [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]]<ref>{{cite web|title= Voulez-Vous |publisher= Abbasite.com.

Her father, Dr. Fernandez (Frank Russell), is a physician and also a general who leads an insurrection against General Mendoza ([[Alfred Hickman]]), the military governor of the surrounding territory. The doctor and his forces are defeated, and he dies in battle. The victorious Mendoza now resents Zora for her past indifference to his romantic advances and suspects she may try to oppose his authority as well. The governor is concerned too about Zora's reputation as a sorceress, most notably for her abilities to cast spells and concoct miraculous potions. In reality, her father, as a medical doctor, had taught her [[hypnosis]] and how to treat various illnesses. Those abilities, however, are viewed by most of the residents in her village as [[supernatural]] and forms of [[witchcraft]].<ref>This plot summary is composed from a compilation of plot and scene descriptions of ''The Witch'' included in reports and reviews published in a variety of trade publications and newpapers between August 1915 and March 1916.</ref>\n\nTo isolate the \"witch\", Governor Mendoza forces Zora to leave her village and then issues a proclamation warning citizens that any women who associate with her will be imprisoned for life; men who do so will be immediately hung.

The couple are arrested and tried, but Zora saves Riques from hanging by assuming all the blame and lying that she had captured his heart by casting a spell on him, one that he could not resist. Zora is then convicted, sentenced to death for witchcraft, and carried away by a mob to be burned at the stake. Zora is about to be executed when Dolores's nurse rushes in to inform the governor that his daughter is in a deep sleep at his palace, cannot be awakened, and only Zora can save her. When offered her freedom in exchange for releasing Dolores from her [[coma]]-like condition, Zora agrees and awakens the governor's daughter. Mendoza then banishes the witch forever from the region.<ref>Plot summaries and reviews of the film in trade publications and newspapers in 1915 and 1916 include descriptions of two dramatically different endings to the production. The version more often given is that Zora in the final scenes is released by officials but permanently \"cast out\" from her village and the region. Some other news and trade publications, however, such as ''[[The Baltimore Sun|The Sun]]'' in Baltimore and the New York-based trade journals ''The Moving Picture World'' and ''[[Motion Picture News]]'', state in their reviews that she is burned at the stake at the film's conclusion.</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n\n[[File:Film_still_of_actresses_Nance_O'Neil_(left)_and_Jane_Miller_in_\"The_Witch\"_(1916).jpeg|thumb|210px|right|Still of O'Neil (left) in scene in which her character Zora hypnotized Dolores, the military governor's daughter (Jane Miller)]]\n\n*[[Nance O'Neil]] as Zora Fernandez\n*[[Alfred Hickman]]\tas General Mendoza\n*Frank Russell as General Fernandez\n*[[Macey Harlam]] as Pedro\n*Ada Neville as Isha\n*Jane Miller as Dolores Mendoza\n*Sadie Gross as dancer\n*[[Stuart Holmes]], undetermined role\n*Harry Kendall, undetermined role \n*Victor Benoit, undetermined role\n*Robert Payne, undetermined role<ref>\"Feature Programs: Fox\", identifications of principal cast, ''Motography'', March 4, 1916, p. 551.

Then, on his return to Fort Lee, Turner supervised the construction on Fox studio's [[backlot]] a set with full-size replicas of the Mexican buildings he had documented.

Impressed by the sheer scale of the production, ''The Arizona Republican'' remarked that Powell \"spared no time or expense\" in developing his project, noting that \"Villages were built, forests were blown up with dynamite, great battle scenes were put on...and months were consumed in rehearsals and filming the various scenes.\"<ref name=\"AZR\"/>\n\n==Release and promotion==\n\n[[File:Ad_for_1916_film_The_Witch.jpeg|thumb|140px|right|Advertisement in ''The Moving Picture World'', March 1916]]\n\nFox Film Corporation heavily promoted ''The Witch'' in trade publications during the last quarter of 1915 and into the following year. After the film was finally released in late February 1916, varying descriptions in the media about the film's ending suggest that Powell created two different conclusions for his production and, at least initially, distributed two versions of ''The Witch'', possibly anticipating that some communities would object to the more sensational final scenes and bar their screening. The Baltimore newspaper ''The Sun'' recounts one version a week after the film's release:{{quote|...At the last instant the Governor stays the burning of Zora at the stake and promises Zora her freedom if she will bring Dolores from her [[Catalepsy|cataleptic]] state.

Her father, Dr. Fernandez (Frank Russell), is a physician and also a general who leads an insurrection against General Mendoza ([[Alfred Hickman]]), the military governor of the surrounding territory. The doctor and his forces are defeated, and he dies in battle. The victorious Mendoza now resents Zora for her past indifference to his romantic advances and suspects she may try to oppose his authority as well. The governor is concerned too about Zora's reputation as a sorceress, most notably for her abilities to cast spells and concoct miraculous potions. In reality, her father, as a medical doctor, had taught her [[hypnosis]] and how to treat various illnesses. Those abilities, however, are viewed by most of the residents in her village as [[supernatural]] and forms of [[witchcraft]].<ref>This plot summary is composed from a compilation of plot and scene descriptions of ''The Witch'' included in reports and reviews published in a variety of trade publications and newpapers between August 1915 and March 1916.</ref>\n\nTo isolate the \"witch\", Governor Mendoza forces Zora to leave her village and then issues a proclamation warning citizens that any women who associate with her will be imprisoned for life; men who do so will be immediately hung.

Zora is then convicted, sentenced to death for witchcraft, and carried away by a mob to be burned at the stake. Zora is about to be executed when Dolores's nurse rushes in to inform the governor that his daughter is in a deep sleep at his palace, cannot be awakened, and only Zora can save her.

Then, on his return to Fort Lee, Turner supervised the construction on Fox studio's [[backlot]] a set with full-size replicas of the Mexican buildings he had documented.

Impressed by the sheer scale of the production, ''The Arizona Republican'' remarked that Powell \"spared no time or expense\" in developing his project, noting that \"Villages were built, forests were blown up with dynamite, great battle scenes were put on...and months were consumed in rehearsals and filming the various scenes.\"<ref name=\"AZR\"/>\n\n==Release and promotion==\n\n[[File:Ad_for_1916_film_The_Witch.jpeg|thumb|140px|right|Advertisement in ''The Moving Picture World'', March 1916]]\n\nFox Film Corporation heavily promoted ''The Witch'' in trade publications during the last quarter of 1915 and into the following year. After the film was finally released in late February 1916, varying descriptions in the media about the film's ending suggest that Powell created two different conclusions for his production and, at least initially, distributed two versions of ''The Witch'', possibly anticipating that some communities would object to the more sensational final scenes and bar their screening.
