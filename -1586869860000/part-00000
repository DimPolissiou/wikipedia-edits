In the early days of the channel, each video focused on a specific number, but the channel has since expanded its scope, featuring videos on more advanced mathematical concepts such as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. The videos are produced by [[Brady Haran]], a former [[BBC]] video journalist and creator of [[Periodic Videos]], Sixty Symbols, and several other YouTube channels. Videos on the channel feature several university professors, math communicators, and famous mathematicians.\n\nIn 2018, Haran released a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] audio [[podcast]] titled ''The Numberphile Podcast''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bradyharanblog.com/blog/the-numberphile-podcast|title=The Numberphile Podcast|website=Brady Haran|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref>\n\n==YouTube channel==\nThe ''Numberphile'' YouTube channel was started on September 15, 2011. Most videos consist of Haran interviewing an expert on a number, [[mathematical theorem]], or other mathematical concept. The expert usually draws out their explanation on a large piece of [[Kraft paper|brown paper]] and attempts to make the concepts understandable to the average, non-mathematician viewer.

The territory was expanded substantially in 1941, after the German [[Operation Barbarossa|Invasion of the Soviet Union]], to include the new [[District of Galicia]].<ref name=\"Diemut2003\"/>\n\nThe basis for the formation of the General Government was the \"Annexation Decree on the Administration of the Occupied Polish Territories\". Announced by Hitler on October 8, 1939, it claimed that the Polish government had totally collapsed. This rationale was utilized by the [[German Supreme Court]] to reassign the identity of all Polish nationals as [[statelessness|stateless subjects]], with the exception of the [[German diaspora|ethnic Germans]] of interwar Poland\u2014who, disregarding international law, were named the only rightful citizens of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Diemut2003\">{{cite book |title=\"Non-Germans\" Under the Third Reich: The Nazi Judicial and Administrative System in Germany and Occupied Eastern Europe with Special Regard to Occupied Poland, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=JHU Press |work=With contribution from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |year=2003 |author=Diemut Majer |pages=236\u2013246 |isbn=0801864933 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_BCNrHG9K8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22Point%20of%20Departure%3A%20Statelessness%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe General Government was run by Germany as a separate administrative unit for logistical purposes.

This area extended from the 1939 eastern border of Germany proper and of [[East Prussia]] up to the [[Bug River]] where the German armies had halted their advance and linked up with the Soviet [[Red Army]] in accordance with their secret pact against Poland.\n\nThe [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] signed on 23 August 1939 had promised the vast territory between the Vistula and Bug rivers to the Soviet \"sphere of influence\" in divided Poland, while the two powers would have jointly ruled Warsaw. To settle the deviation from the original agreement, the German and Soviet representatives met again on September 28 to delineate a permanent border between the two countries. Under [[German\u2013Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation|this revised version]] of the pact the territory concerned was exchanged for the inclusion in the Soviet sphere of [[Lithuania]], which had originally fallen within the ambit of Germany. With the new agreement the entire central part of Poland, including the core ethnic area of the Poles, came under exclusively German control.\n\n[[File:Mapa 2 paktu Ribbentrop-Mo\u0142otow.gif|thumb|German-Soviet border drawn-out in the aftermath of the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland]], signed in Moscow by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] during the Second [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] known as the [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|Frontier Treaty]] of September 28, 1939]]\n\nHitler decreed the direct annexation to the [[German Reich]] of [[Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany|large parts]] of the occupied Polish territory in the western half of the German zone, in order to increase the Reich's [[Lebensraum]].<ref>''\"Erla\u00df des F\u00fchrers und Reichskanzlers \u00fcber die Gliederung und Verwaltung der Ostgebiete\"''</ref> Germany organized most of these areas as two new [[Reichsgau]]e: [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|Danzig-West Prussia]] and [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]]. The remaining three regions, the so-called areas of Zichenau, Eastern [[Upper Silesia]] and the [[Suwa\u0142ki]] triangle, became attached to adjacent [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]] of Germany. Draconian measures were introduced by both RKF and HTO,{{Ref|a-RKF|[a]}} to facilitate the immediate [[Germanization]] of the annexed territory, typically resulting in [[Forced resettlement|mass expulsions]], especially in the Warthegau. The remaining parts of the former Poland were to become a German ''{{lang|de|Nebenland}}'' ([[March (territory)|March]], borderland) as a frontier post of German rule in the east. A F\u00fchrer's decree of October 12, 1939 established the General Government; the decree came into force on October 26, 1939.<ref name=\"Diemut2003\"/>\n\n[[Hans Frank]] was appointed as the [[Governor-General]] of the General Government. German authorities made a sharp contrast between the new Reich territory and a supposedly occupied [[rump state]] that could serve as a bargaining chip with the Western powers. The Germans established a closed border between the two German zones to heighten the difficulty of cross-frontier communication between the different segments of the Polish population.\n\nThe official name chosen for the new entity was the ''{{lang|de|Generalgouvernement f\u00fcr die besetzten polnischen Gebiete}}'' (General Government for the Occupied Polish Territories), then changed to the ''Generalgouvernement'' (General Government) by Frank's decree of July 31, 1940. However, this name did not imply anything about the actual nature of the administration. The German authorities never regarded these Polish lands (apart from the short period of [[German military administration in occupied Poland|military administration]] during the actual [[invasion of Poland]]) as an [[Military occupation|occupied territory]].<ref name=\"Majer265\">Majer (2003), p. 265.</ref> The Nazis considered the Polish state to have effectively ceased to exist with its defeat in the September campaign.\n\nOverall, 4&nbsp;million of the 1939 population of the General Government area had lost their lives by the time the Soviet armed forces entered the area in late 1944. If the Polish underground killed a German, 50\u2013100 Poles were executed by German police as a punishment and as a warning to other Poles.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206246.pdf Generalgouvernement] Shoah Resource Center</ref> Most of the Jews, perhaps as many as two million, had also been rounded up and murdered.  Germans destroyed Warsaw after the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. As the Soviets advanced through Poland in late 1944 the General Government collapsed. American troops captured [[Hans Frank]], who had governed the region, in May 1945; he became one of the defendants at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. During his trial he resumed his childhood practice of Catholicism and expressed repentance. Frank surrendered forty volumes of his diaries to the Tribunal; much evidence against him and others was gathered from them. He was found guilty of [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. On October 1, 1946, he was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]]. The sentence was carried out on October 16.\n\n==German intentions regarding the region==\n{{Further|Generalplan Ost|Lebensraum|Wehrbauer}}\n\nThe destruction of Warsaw and construction of a new German town was [[Pabst Plan|planned]] before the war and during the occupation. Later the plans were included into the Generalplan Ost. \nIn March 1941 Hans Frank informed his subordinates that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had made the decision to \"turn this region into a purely German area within 15\u201320 years\". He explained: \"Where 12&nbsp;million [[Poles]] now live, is to be populated by 4 to 5&nbsp;million [[Germans]].

One called for the deportation of about 20&nbsp;million Poles to western [[Siberia]], and the Germanisation of 4 to 5&nbsp;million; although deportation in reality meant many Poles were to be put to death, a small number would be \"Germanized\", and [[Kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany|young Poles of desirable qualities would be kidnapped and raised in Germany]].<ref>[https://archive.is/20120527021449/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm Hitler's plans for Eastern Europe]</ref> In the General Government, all [[secondary education]] was abolished and all Polish cultural institutions closed.\n\nIn 1943, the government selected the [[Zamojskie]] area for further Germanization on account of its fertile black soil, and German colonial settlements were planned.

Most of the Polish population was expelled by the Nazi occupation authorities with documented brutality. Himmler intended the city of [[Lublin]] to have a German population of 20% to 25% by the beginning of 1944, and of 30% to 40% by the following year, at which time Lublin was to be declared a German city and given a German mayor.<ref>Rich, Norman (1974).

Germany had [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|already annexed]] large parts of western pre-war Poland (8 October 1939) before the establishment of the General Government (26 October 1939), and the remaining region was also intended{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be directly incorporated into the German Reich at some future date. The Nazi leadership discussed numerous initiatives with this aim.\n\nThe earliest such proposal (October/November 1939) called for the establishment of a separate ''Reichsgau [[Beskids|Beskidenland]]'' which would encompass several southern sections of the Polish territories conquered in 1939 (around 18,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), stretching from the area to the west of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to the [[San (river)|San river]] in the east.<ref>Burleigh, Michael (1988).

For the entire period of the General Government's existence there was only one General-Governor: Dr. Hans Frank. The [[NSDAP]] structure in General Gouvernment was ''Arbeitsbereich Generalgouvernement'' led by Frank.\n\nThe Office was headed by Chief of the Government ({{lang-de|Regierung|translation=government}}), also known as the State Secretary ({{lang-de|Staatssekret\u00e4r}}) (or Deputy Governor) [[Josef B\u00fchler]].

It was not a Polish [[puppet government]], as there were no Polish representatives above the local administration.\n\nThe government seat of the General Government was located in Krak\u00f3w (German: ''{{lang|de|Krakau}}''; {{lang-en|Cracow}}) rather than in [[Warsaw]] for security reasons. The official state language was German, although Polish continued in use by local government. Useful institutions of the old Polish state were retained for ease of administration. The Polish police, with no high-ranking Polish officers (they were arrested or demoted), was reorganised as the [[Blue Police]] and became subordinated to the [[Ordnungspolizei]]. The Polish educational system was similarly retained, but most higher institutions were closed. The Polish local administration was kept, subordinated to new German bosses. The Polish fiscal system, including the [[z\u0142oty]] currency, remained in use but with revenues going to the German state. A new bank was created; it issued new banknotes.\n\nThe Germans sought to play [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] and Poles off against each other. Within ethnic Ukrainian areas annexed by Germany, beginning in October 1939, Ukrainian Committees were established{{by whom|date=April 2019}} with the purpose of representing the Ukrainian community to the German authorities and assisting the approximately 30,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled from Soviet-controlled territories. These committees also undertook cultural and economic activities that had been banned by the previous Polish government. Schools, choirs, reading societies and theaters were opened, and twenty Ukrainian churches that had been closed by the Polish government reopened. A Ukrainian publishing house was set up in Cracow, which \u2013 despite having to struggle with German censors and paper shortages \u2013 succeeded in publishing school textbooks, classics of [[Ukrainian literature]], and the works of dissident Ukrainian writers from the Soviet Union. By March 1941, there were 808 Ukrainian educational societies with 46,000 members. Ukrainian organizations within the General Government were able to negotiate the release of 85,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war from the German-Polish conflict (although they were unable to help Soviet POWs of Ukrainian ethnicity).<ref>Myroslav Yurkevich.

After the [[Operation Barbarossa]] against the Soviets in June 1941, East [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (part of Poland, annected by [[Ukrainian SSR]] on the basis of the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]]), was incorporated into the General Government and became its fifth district: [[District of Galicia|''Distrikt Galizien'']]. The new German administrative units were much larger than those organized by the Polish government, reflecting the German lack of sufficient administrative personnel to staff smaller units.<ref>Rich (1974), p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe five districts were further sub-divided into urban counties (''Stadtkreise'') and rural counties (''Kreishauptmannschaften''). Following a decree on September 15, 1941, the names of most of the major cities (and their respective counties) were renamed based on historical German data or given germanified versions of their Polish and Soviet names if none existed. At times the previous names remained the same as well (i.e. Radom).

This decree was to go into effect on 1 April 1943 and was nominally accepted by Heinrich Himmler, but [[Martin Bormann]] opposed the move, as he simply wanted to see the region turned into ''Reichsgaue'' (Germany proper).

A year later the population increased to 12.1 million. In December 1940, 83.3% of the population were Poles, 11.2% Jews, 4.4% Ukrainians and Belarusians, 0.9% Germans, and 0.2% others.<ref>W\u0142odzimierz Bonusiak. ''Polska podczas II wojny \u015bwiatowej'' (Poland during II World War). Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Rzeszowskiego. 2003. p.68.</ref> About 860,000 Poles and Jews were resettled into the General Government after they have been expelled from the territories 'annexed' by Nazi Germany. Offsetting this was the German genocidal campaign of liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia and other elements considered likely to resist. From 1941 disease and hunger also began to reduce the population.\n\nPoles were also deported in large numbers to work as forced labor in Germany: eventually about a million were deported, of whom many died in Germany. In 1940 the population was segregated into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, public transportation and restricted restaurants.

If the prices were set too high in cities there was a concern that workers would not be able to afford the food and protest the prices. Due to the price inflation which was occurring in the Generalgouvernement, many places relied on the [[Barter|barter system]] (exchanging goods for other goods instead of money). \"Introducing rationing in September 1940, [[Marshal Petain]] insisted that \u2018everyone must assume their share of common hardship.\u2019\"<ref name=\":1\" /> There was clearly food instability not only in the ghettos, but also in cities, which caused everyone to be conscious about food rationing, and caused conditions for Jewish people to worsen. While workers in Norway and France protested the new rationing of food, Germany and the UK, where the citizens supported war efforts were more supportive of the rationing therefore it was more effective.

Outside of the ghettos, the black market existed because rations were not high enough for the citizens to remain healthy. In the ghettos of eastern Europe in August 1941 the Jewish population recognized that if they were forced to remain in these ghettos they would eventually die of hunger. Many people that were in ghettos made trades with the outside world in order to stay alive.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe|last=Mazower|first=Mark|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2008|isbn=9780713996814|location=London, UK|pages=279}}</ref> Jewish people were forced to reside in ghettos, where the economy was isolated and there were large food shortages, which caused them to be seen as a source for cheap labor; many were given food that was purchased on the Aryan side of the wall in exchange for their labor. The isolation of the people forced into ghettos caused there to be a disconnect between the buyer and seller, which added in another player: the black market middleman. The black market middleman would make a profit by creating connections between sellers and buyers. While supply and demand was [[Inelastic supply|inelastic]] in these ghettos, the selling of this food on the blackmarket was extremely competitive, and beyond the reach of most Jews in ghettos.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Polish Society Under German Occupation: The Generalgouvernment: 1939-1944|last=Gross|first=Jan Tomasz|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1979|isbn=0691093814|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Resistance==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n{{Main|Polish resistance movement in World War II}}\nResistance to the German occupation began almost at once, although there is little terrain in Poland suitable for [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla operations]]. Several small army troops supported by volunteers fought till Spring 1940, e.g. under major [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]], after which they ceased due to German executions of civilians as reprisals.\n\n[[File:Flaga PPP.svg|thumb|200px|Flag of the [[Armia Krajowa]]]]\n\nThe main resistance force was the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] (in Polish: ''Armia Krajowa'' or ''AK''), loyal to the [[Polish government in exile]] in London. It was formed mainly of the surviving remnants of the pre-War [[Polish Army]], together with many volunteers. Other forces existed side-by-side, such as the communist [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]] ''(Armia Ludowa'' or AL) parallel to the PPR, organised and controlled by the Soviet Union. The AK was estimated between 200,000 and 600,000 men, while the AL was estimated between 14,000 and 60,000.\n\n1942-1943 German repressions caused [[Zamo\u015b\u0107 uprising]].\n\n[[File:German announcement General Government Poland 1941.jpg|thumb|250px| German announcement of the execution of 9 Polish peasants for unfurnished contingents (quotas).

The AK, led by [[Tadeusz B\u00f3r-Komorowski]], launched the [[Warsaw Rising]] on August 1 in response both to their government and to Soviet and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] promises of help. However Soviet help was never forthcoming, despite the Soviet army being only 18 miles (30&nbsp;km) away, and Soviet denial of their airbases to British and American planes prevented any effective resupply or air support of the insurgents by the Western allies. They used distant Italian bases in their [[Warsaw airlift]] instead. After 63 days of fighting the leaders of the rising agreed a conditional surrender with the [[Wehrmacht]]. The 15,000 remaining Home Army soldiers were granted POW status (prior to the agreement, captured rebels were shot), and the remaining civilian population of 180,000 expelled.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Poland during World War II|Secret Teaching Organization}}\n\nAll universities in GG were disbanded, many Krak\u00f3w professors imprisoned during the ''[[Sonderaktion Krakau]]''.\n\n==Culture of Poland==\n\nGermans plundered Polish museums.

This area extended from the 1939 eastern border of Germany proper and of [[East Prussia]] up to the [[Bug River]] where the German armies had halted their advance and linked up with the Soviet [[Red Army]] in accordance with their secret pact against Poland.\n\nThe [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] signed on 23 August 1939 had promised the vast territory between the Vistula and Bug rivers to the Soviet \"sphere of influence\" in divided Poland, while the two powers would have jointly ruled Warsaw. To settle the deviation from the original agreement, the German and Soviet representatives met again on September 28 to delineate a permanent border between the two countries. Under [[German\u2013Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation|this revised version]] of the pact the territory concerned was exchanged for the inclusion in the Soviet sphere of [[Lithuania]], which had originally fallen within the ambit of Germany. With the new agreement the entire central part of Poland, including the core ethnic area of the Poles, came under exclusively German control.\n\n[[File:Mapa 2 paktu Ribbentrop-Mo\u0142otow.gif|thumb|German-Soviet border drawn-out in the aftermath of the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland]], signed in Moscow by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] during the Second [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] known as the [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|Frontier Treaty]] of September 28, 1939]]\n\nHitler decreed the direct annexation to the [[German Reich]] of [[Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany|large parts]] of the occupied Polish territory in the western half of the German zone, in order to increase the Reich's [[Lebensraum]].<ref>''\"Erla\u00df des F\u00fchrers und Reichskanzlers \u00fcber die Gliederung und Verwaltung der Ostgebiete\"''</ref> Germany organized most of these areas as two new [[Reichsgau]]e: [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|Danzig-West Prussia]] and [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]]. The remaining three regions, the so-called areas of Zichenau, Eastern [[Upper Silesia]] and the [[Suwa\u0142ki]] triangle, became attached to adjacent [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]] of Germany. Draconian measures were introduced by both RKF and HTO,{{Ref|a-RKF|[a]}} to facilitate the immediate [[Germanization]] of the annexed territory, typically resulting in [[Forced resettlement|mass expulsions]], especially in the Warthegau. The remaining parts of the former Poland were to become a German ''{{lang|de|Nebenland}}'' ([[March (territory)|March]], borderland) as a frontier post of German rule in the east. A F\u00fchrer's decree of October 12, 1939 established the General Government; the decree came into force on October 26, 1939.<ref name=\"Diemut2003\"/>\n\n[[Hans Frank]] was appointed as the [[Governor-General]] of the General Government. German authorities made a sharp contrast between the new Reich territory and a supposedly occupied [[rump state]] that could serve as a bargaining chip with the Western powers. The Germans established a closed border between the two German zones to heighten the difficulty of cross-frontier communication between the different segments of the Polish population.\n\nThe official name chosen for the new entity was the ''{{lang|de|Generalgouvernement f\u00fcr die besetzten polnischen Gebiete}}'' (General Government for the Occupied Polish Territories), then changed to the ''Generalgouvernement'' (General Government) by Frank's decree of July 31, 1940. However, this name did not imply anything about the actual nature of the administration. The German authorities never regarded these Polish lands (apart from the short period of [[German military administration in occupied Poland|military administration]] during the actual [[invasion of Poland]]) as an [[Military occupation|occupied territory]].<ref name=\"Majer265\">Majer (2003), p. 265.</ref> The Nazis considered the Polish state to have effectively ceased to exist with its defeat in the September campaign.\n\nOverall, 4&nbsp;million of the 1939 population of the General Government area had lost their lives by the time the Soviet armed forces entered the area in late 1944. If the Polish underground killed a German, 50\u2013100 Poles were executed by German police as a punishment and as a warning to other Poles.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206246.pdf Generalgouvernement] Shoah Resource Center</ref> Most of the Jews, perhaps as many as two million, had also been rounded up and murdered.  Germans destroyed Warsaw after the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. As the Soviets advanced through Poland in late 1944 the General Government collapsed. American troops captured [[Hans Frank]], who had governed the region, in May 1945; he became one of the defendants at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. During his trial he resumed his childhood practice of Catholicism and expressed repentance. Frank surrendered forty volumes of his diaries to the Tribunal; much evidence against him and others was gathered from them. He was found guilty of [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. On October 1, 1946, he was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]].

Most of the Polish population was expelled by the Nazi occupation authorities with documented brutality. Himmler intended the city of [[Lublin]] to have a German population of 20% to 25% by the beginning of 1944, and of 30% to 40% by the following year, at which time Lublin was to be declared a German city and given a German mayor.<ref>Rich, Norman (1974).

The Nazi leadership discussed numerous initiatives with this aim.\n\nThe earliest such proposal (October/November 1939) called for the establishment of a separate ''Reichsgau [[Beskids|Beskidenland]]'' which would encompass several southern sections of the Polish territories conquered in 1939 (around 18,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), stretching from the area to the west of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to the [[San (river)|San river]] in the east.<ref>Burleigh, Michael (1988).

The official state language was German, although Polish continued in use by local government. Useful institutions of the old Polish state were retained for ease of administration. The Polish police, with no high-ranking Polish officers (they were arrested or demoted), was reorganised as the [[Blue Police]] and became subordinated to the [[Ordnungspolizei]]. The Polish educational system was similarly retained, but most higher institutions were closed. The Polish local administration was kept, subordinated to new German bosses. The Polish fiscal system, including the [[z\u0142oty]] currency, remained in use but with revenues going to the German state. A new bank was created; it issued new banknotes.\n\nThe Germans sought to play [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] and Poles off against each other.

These committees also undertook cultural and economic activities that had been banned by the previous Polish government. Schools, choirs, reading societies and theaters were opened, and twenty Ukrainian churches that had been closed by the Polish government reopened. A Ukrainian publishing house was set up in Cracow, which \u2013 despite having to struggle with German censors and paper shortages \u2013 succeeded in publishing school textbooks, classics of [[Ukrainian literature]], and the works of dissident Ukrainian writers from the Soviet Union. By March 1941, there were 808 Ukrainian educational societies with 46,000 members.

From 1941 disease and hunger also began to reduce the population.\n\nPoles were also deported in large numbers to work as forced labor in Germany: eventually about a million were deported, of whom many died in Germany.

Although before the war, Poland exported mass quantities of food, in 1940 the Generalgouvernement was unable to supply enough food for the country, nonetheless export food supplies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Polish Society Under German Occupation: The Generalgouvernment: 1939-1944|last=Gross|first=Jan Tomasz|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1979|isbn=0691093814|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=92}}</ref> In December 1939, the Polish and Jewish reception committees, as well as the native local officials, all within the Generalgouvernement, were responsible for providing food and shelter to the Poles and Jews that evacuated.

During the deportations, people were forced to reside on the trains for days until a place was found for them to stay. Between the cold and lack of food, masses of deportees died due to transport deaths caused by malnutrition, cold, and moreover unlivable transportation conditions.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe prices for food outside of ghettos and concentration camps had to be set at a reasonable price in order for them to align with the black market; setting prices at a reasonable rate would ensure that farmers did not sell their crops illegally. If the prices were set too high in cities there was a concern that workers would not be able to afford the food and protest the prices. Due to the price inflation which was occurring in the Generalgouvernement, many places relied on the [[Barter|barter system]] (exchanging goods for other goods instead of money). \"Introducing rationing in September 1940, [[Marshal Petain]] insisted that \u2018everyone must assume their share of common hardship.\u2019\"<ref name=\":1\" /> There was clearly food instability not only in the ghettos, but also in cities, which caused everyone to be conscious about food rationing, and caused conditions for Jewish people to worsen. While workers in Norway and France protested the new rationing of food, Germany and the UK, where the citizens supported war efforts were more supportive of the rationing therefore it was more effective. Cases, where a country was being occupied, caused the citizens to be more hesitant about the rationing of food and it was overall not as effective.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe|last=Mazower|first=Mark|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2008|isbn=9780713996814|location=London, UK|pages=277\u2013279}}</ref> In December, 1941 it was recognized by the Generalgouvernement that starving the Jewish people to death was an inexpensive and expedient solution.

Outside of the ghettos, the black market existed because rations were not high enough for the citizens to remain healthy. In the ghettos of eastern Europe in August 1941 the Jewish population recognized that if they were forced to remain in these ghettos they would eventually die of hunger. Many people that were in ghettos made trades with the outside world in order to stay alive.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe|last=Mazower|first=Mark|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2008|isbn=9780713996814|location=London, UK|pages=279}}</ref> Jewish people were forced to reside in ghettos, where the economy was isolated and there were large food shortages, which caused them to be seen as a source for cheap labor; many were given food that was purchased on the Aryan side of the wall in exchange for their labor. The isolation of the people forced into ghettos caused there to be a disconnect between the buyer and seller, which added in another player: the black market middleman. The black market middleman would make a profit by creating connections between sellers and buyers. While supply and demand was [[Inelastic supply|inelastic]] in these ghettos, the selling of this food on the blackmarket was extremely competitive, and beyond the reach of most Jews in ghettos.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Polish Society Under German Occupation: The Generalgouvernment: 1939-1944|last=Gross|first=Jan Tomasz|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1979|isbn=0691093814|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Resistance==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n{{Main|Polish resistance movement in World War II}}\nResistance to the German occupation began almost at once, although there is little terrain in Poland suitable for [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla operations]].

It was formed mainly of the surviving remnants of the pre-War [[Polish Army]], together with many volunteers. Other forces existed side-by-side, such as the communist [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]] ''(Armia Ludowa'' or AL) parallel to the PPR, organised and controlled by the Soviet Union. The AK was estimated between 200,000 and 600,000 men, while the AL was estimated between 14,000 and 60,000.\n\n1942-1943 German repressions caused [[Zamo\u015b\u0107 uprising]].\n\n[[File:German announcement General Government Poland 1941.jpg|thumb|250px| German announcement of the execution of 9 Polish peasants for unfurnished contingents (quotas).

The AK, led by [[Tadeusz B\u00f3r-Komorowski]], launched the [[Warsaw Rising]] on August 1 in response both to their government and to Soviet and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] promises of help. However Soviet help was never forthcoming, despite the Soviet army being only 18 miles (30&nbsp;km) away, and Soviet denial of their airbases to British and American planes prevented any effective resupply or air support of the insurgents by the Western allies. They used distant Italian bases in their [[Warsaw airlift]] instead. After 63 days of fighting the leaders of the rising agreed a conditional surrender with the [[Wehrmacht]]. The 15,000 remaining Home Army soldiers were granted POW status (prior to the agreement, captured rebels were shot), and the remaining civilian population of 180,000 expelled.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Poland during World War II|Secret Teaching Organization}}\n\nAll universities in GG were disbanded, many Krak\u00f3w professors imprisoned during the ''[[Sonderaktion Krakau]]''.\n\n==Culture of Poland==\n\nGermans plundered Polish museums.
