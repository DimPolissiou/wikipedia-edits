In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of {{convert|30.53|km2|sp=us}} along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\n[[File:Wuhan 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Wuhan in 1864]]\n[[File:Hankow Bund c. 1900.jpg|thumb|Foreign concessions along the Hankow Bund c. 1900.]]\nIn 1889, [[Zhang Zhidong]] was transferred from [[Viceroy of Liangguang]] ([[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces) to [[Viceroy of Huguang]] ([[Hunan]] and [[Hubei]] provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a ''zhen'' and a ''xie'' (both ''zhen'' and ''xie'' are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\n\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the [[Hanyang Arsenal]] was founded in 1891 by [[Qing]] official [[Zhang Zhidong]], who diverted funds from the [[Nanyang Fleet]] in [[Guangdong]] to build the arsenal.

From June to September 1954, the [[1954 Yangtze River floods|Yangtze River Floods]] were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\n\nBefore construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan. \n\nThe project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway]] with the [[Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway]] into the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway]], making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862}}}}) in name and in fact.\n\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Li Rui wen ji.|last=1917-|first=Li, Rui|last2=1917-|first2=\u674e\u9510|date=2007|publisher=Xianggang she hui ke xue jiao yu chu ban you xian gong si|isbn=9789889958114|location=[Xianggang]|pages=|oclc=688480117}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the [[Wuhan Incident]] (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Thomas W.

In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away.

Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts.

During the [[Second Opium War]] (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the [[Treaties of Tianjin]] and the [[Convention of Peking]], which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei.

He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education.

Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the ''Zhongshan'' has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban [[Jiangxia District]], which opened on September 26, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newscontent.cctv.com/news.jsp?fileId=117667|title=HOME-CCTVPLUS|website=newscontent.cctv.com}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAs a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/12/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-1/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218210230/http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/12/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-1/ |archive-date=February 18, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city.<ref name=\"Fenby, Jonathan page 447\">Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York: Carroll & Graf, 2004 page 447.</ref> For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city.

From June to September 1954, the [[1954 Yangtze River floods|Yangtze River Floods]] were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\n\nBefore construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan. \n\nThe project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway]] with the [[Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway]] into the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway]], making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862}}}}) in name and in fact.\n\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Li Rui wen ji.|last=1917-|first=Li, Rui|last2=1917-|first2=\u674e\u9510|date=2007|publisher=Xianggang she hui ke xue jiao yu chu ban you xian gong si|isbn=9789889958114|location=[Xianggang]|pages=|oclc=688480117}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the [[Wuhan Incident]] (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Thomas W.

The [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also called the First Bridge, was built over the [[Yangtze]] in 1957, carrying a railroad directly across the river between hills known as Snake Hill and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to [[train ferry|barge]] railcars across. Including its approaches, it is {{convert|5,511|ft|m}} long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four-lane roadway above.

In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin, and the general a porpoise.<ref name=turvy>{{cite book|author=Samuel Turvy|title=Witness to Extinction: How we Failed to Save the Yangtze River Dolphin|chapter=The Goddess of the Yangtze|pages=[https://archive.org/details/witnesstoextinct0000turv/page/3 3\u20134]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-954947-4|id={{ASIN|0199549486|country=uk}}|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/witnesstoextinct0000turv/page/3}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Asia|China}}\n* [[Historical capitals of China]]\n* [[List of cities in the People's Republic of China by population]]\n* [[List of current and former capitals of subnational entities of China]]\n\n==References==\n<!--infobox refs-->\n{{Reflist\n|refs=\n<!--For \u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862 nickname -->\n<ref name=\"Readmeok Sina\">{{cite web|url=http://www.readmeok.com/2012-5/21_11860.html|script-title=zh:\u56fe\u6587\uff1a\"\u9ec4\u91d1\u5341\u5b57\u67b6\"\u5199\u5c31\u7b2c\u4e00\u7b14|publisher=Sina|date=30 March 2009|accessdate=21 February 2018|quote={{lang|zh-hans|\u6b66\u6c49\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u5c31\u662f\"\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862\"\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u592e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e2d\u90e8\u5d1b\u8d77\u6218\u7565\u4e2d\u88ab\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\"\u5168\u56fd\u6027\u7efc\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8f93\u67a2\u7ebd\"\u3002}}|url-status=live|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113420/http://www.readmeok.com/2012-5/21_11860.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"City government \u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wh.gov.cn/theme/include/htm/whgl/frame04.htm |script-title=zh:\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862|website=The government of Wuhan|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121127235821/http://www.wh.gov.cn/theme/include/htm/whgl/frame04.htm|archive-date=27 November 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n<!--For Chicago nickname -->\n<ref name=\"timemagazine\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848985,00.html |title=Foreign News: On To Chicago |work=Time |accessdate=November 20, 2011 |date=June 13, 1938 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105114835/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848985,00.html |archive-date=January 5, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Chicago is all over the place\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-13/news/ct-talk-nato-chicago-0513-20120513_1_violent-crime-chicago-connection-south-america-s-chicago |title=Chicago is all over the place |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |author=Jacob, Mark |date=May 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511215253/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-13/news/ct-talk-nato-chicago-0513-20120513_1_violent-crime-chicago-connection-south-america-s-chicago |archive-date=May 11, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"\u6c34\u91ce\u5e78\u5409 Mizuno Kokichi 2014 3\">{{cite book |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e2d\u90e8\u4e8b\u60c5\uff1a\u6c49\u53e3 |trans-title=Central China: Hankou |publisher=Wuhan Press |author={{Nihongo2|\u6c34\u91ce\u5e78\u5409}} (Mizuno Kokichi) |year=2014 |pages=3 |isbn=9787543084612}}</ref>\n<!--For divisions -->\n<ref name=\"history2\">{{cite web|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u5e02\u5386\u53f2\u6cbf\u9769|url=http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/hb/15225_2.html|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=10 February 2018|language=zh-hans|publisher=www.XZQH.org|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210120959/http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/hb/15225_2.html|archive-date=February 10, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"xingzhengquhua\">{{cite web|script-title=zh:\u884c\u653f\u5efa\u7f6e|url=http://www.wh.gov.cn/2018wh/zjwh_5785/whgk/201808/t20180824_223224.html|date=8 January 2018|accessdate=17 October 2018|language=zh-hans|publisher=Wuhan Municipal People's Government |title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017082522/http://www.wh.gov.cn/2018wh/zjwh_5785/whgk/201808/t20180824_223224.html|archive-date=October 17, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation |surname=de Crespigny|given=Rafe|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/gos_index.html|title=Generals of the South: The foundation and early history of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu|publisher=Australian National University|place=Canberra|year=1990}}.

In a 1959 journal article, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|I propose that a prisoner condemned to death by due process of law be allowed to submit, by his own free choice, to medical experimentation under complete anaesthesia (at the time appointed for administering the penalty) as a form of execution in lieu of conventional methods prescribed by law.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kevorkian |first=Jack |title=Capital Punishment or Capital Gain |journal=The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science |date=May\u2013June 1959 |volume=50 |issue=1| pages=50\u201351}}</ref>}}\n\nSenior doctors at the University of Michigan, Kevorkian's employer, opposed his proposal and Kevorkian chose to leave the University rather than stop advocating his ideas. Ultimately, he gained little support for his plan. He returned to the idea of using death row inmates for medical purposes after the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' re-instituted the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. He advocated harvesting the organs from inmates after the death penalty was carried out for transplant into sick patients, but failed to gain the cooperation of prison officials.<ref name=betzold>{{cite news|last=Betzold |first=Michael |title=1993: Excerpt from 'Appointment with Doctor Death' |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525033 |accessdate=April 29, 2012 |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=September 19, 1993 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108061240/http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525033 |archivedate=November 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs a [[Pathology|pathologist]] at Pontiac General Hospital, Kevorkian experimented with transfusing blood from the recently deceased into live patients. He drew blood from corpses recently brought into the hospital and transferred it successfully into the bodies of hospital staff members. Kevorkian thought that the U.S. military might be interested in using this technique to help wounded soldiers during a battle, but the Pentagon was not interested.<ref name=betzold/>\n\nIn the 1980s, Kevorkian wrote a series of articles for the German journal ''Medicine and Law'' that laid out his thinking on the ethics of [[euthanasia]].<ref name=\"Frontline_chronology\"/><ref name=\"Lessenberry1994\">{{cite web|title=Death becomes him|author=Lessenberry, Jack |date=July 1994 |work=Vanity Fair |via=PBS.org |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/vanityfair.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030806015344/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/vanityfair.html |archivedate=August 6, 2003 |accessdate=July 11, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Kevorkian started advertising in [[Detroit]] newspapers as a physician consultant for \"death counseling\".

The report further asserted that Kevorkian's counseling was too brief (with at least 19 patients dying less than 24 hours after first meeting Kevorkian) and lacked a psychiatric exam in at least 19 cases, 5 of which involved people with histories of depression, though Kevorkian was sometimes alerted that the patient was unhappy for reasons other than their medical condition. (In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's \"mental state is ... of paramount importance.\"<ref name=\"DFP1\">Cheyfitz, Kirk (March 3, 1997).

''[[Detroit Free Press]]''.

Rebecca Badger, a patient of Kevorkian's and a mentally troubled drug abuser, had been mistakenly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The report also stated that Janet Adkins, Kevorkian's first euthanasia patient, had been chosen without Kevorkian ever speaking to her, only with her husband, and that when Kevorkian first met Adkins two days before her assisted suicide he \"made no real effort to discover whether Ms. Adkins wished to end her life,\" as the Michigan Court of Appeals put it in a 1995 ruling upholding an order against Kevorkian's activity.<ref name=\"DFP1\"/> According to ''[[The Economist]]'': \"Studies of those who sought out Dr. Kevorkian, however, suggest that though many had a worsening illness ... it was not usually terminal.

After Youk provided his fully [[informed consent]] (a sometimes complex legal determination made in this case by editorial consensus) on September 17, 1998, Kevorkian himself administered Thomas Youk a lethal injection. This was highly significant, as all of his earlier clients had reportedly completed the process themselves. During the videotape, Kevorkian dared the authorities to try to convict him or stop him from carrying out mercy killings. Youk's family described the lethal injection as humane, not murder.\n\nOn March 26, 1999, Kevorkian was charged with second-degree [[murder]] and the delivery of a [[controlled substance]] (administering the lethal injection to Thomas Youk).<ref name=\"Frontline_chronology\">{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/chronology.html |title=The Kevorian Verdict: A Chronology| series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]| work=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| date=May 1996| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref> Because Kevorkian's [[medical license|license to practice medicine]] had been revoked eight years previously, he was not legally allowed to possess the controlled substance.

In a 1959 journal article, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|I propose that a prisoner condemned to death by due process of law be allowed to submit, by his own free choice, to medical experimentation under complete anaesthesia (at the time appointed for administering the penalty) as a form of execution in lieu of conventional methods prescribed by law.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kevorkian |first=Jack |title=Capital Punishment or Capital Gain |journal=The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science |date=May\u2013June 1959 |volume=50 |issue=1| pages=50\u201351}}</ref>}}\n\nSenior doctors at the University of Michigan, Kevorkian's employer, opposed his proposal and Kevorkian chose to leave the University rather than stop advocating his ideas. Ultimately, he gained little support for his plan. He returned to the idea of using death row inmates for medical purposes after the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' re-instituted the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. He advocated harvesting the organs from inmates after the death penalty was carried out for transplant into sick patients, but failed to gain the cooperation of prison officials.<ref name=betzold>{{cite news|last=Betzold |first=Michael |title=1993: Excerpt from 'Appointment with Doctor Death' |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525033 |accessdate=April 29, 2012 |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=September 19, 1993 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108061240/http://www.freep.com/article/20070527/NEWS05/70525033 |archivedate=November 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs a [[Pathology|pathologist]] at Pontiac General Hospital, Kevorkian experimented with transfusing blood from the recently deceased into live patients. He drew blood from corpses recently brought into the hospital and transferred it successfully into the bodies of hospital staff members. Kevorkian thought that the U.S. military might be interested in using this technique to help wounded soldiers during a battle, but the Pentagon was not interested.<ref name=betzold/>\n\nIn the 1980s, Kevorkian wrote a series of articles for the German journal ''Medicine and Law'' that laid out his thinking on the ethics of [[euthanasia]].<ref name=\"Frontline_chronology\"/><ref name=\"Lessenberry1994\">{{cite web|title=Death becomes him|author=Lessenberry, Jack |date=July 1994 |work=Vanity Fair |via=PBS.org |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/vanityfair.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030806015344/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/aboutk/vanityfair.html |archivedate=August 6, 2003 |accessdate=July 11, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Kevorkian started advertising in [[Detroit]] newspapers as a physician consultant for \"death counseling\".

Kevorkian allegedly assisted only by attaching the individual to a [[euthanasia device]] that he had devised and constructed. The individual then pushed a button which released the drugs or chemicals that would end his or her own life. Two deaths were assisted by means of a device which delivered the euthanizing drugs [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]].

The report further asserted that Kevorkian's counseling was too brief (with at least 19 patients dying less than 24 hours after first meeting Kevorkian) and lacked a psychiatric exam in at least 19 cases, 5 of which involved people with histories of depression, though Kevorkian was sometimes alerted that the patient was unhappy for reasons other than their medical condition. (In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's \"mental state is ... of paramount importance.\"<ref name=\"DFP1\">Cheyfitz, Kirk (March 3, 1997).

Rebecca Badger, a patient of Kevorkian's and a mentally troubled drug abuser, had been mistakenly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The report also stated that Janet Adkins, Kevorkian's first euthanasia patient, had been chosen without Kevorkian ever speaking to her, only with her husband, and that when Kevorkian first met Adkins two days before her assisted suicide he \"made no real effort to discover whether Ms. Adkins wished to end her life,\" as the Michigan Court of Appeals put it in a 1995 ruling upholding an order against Kevorkian's activity.<ref name=\"DFP1\"/> According to ''[[The Economist]]'': \"Studies of those who sought out Dr. Kevorkian, however, suggest that though many had a worsening illness ... it was not usually terminal.

After Youk provided his fully [[informed consent]] (a sometimes complex legal determination made in this case by editorial consensus) on September 17, 1998, Kevorkian himself administered Thomas Youk a lethal injection. This was highly significant, as all of his earlier clients had reportedly completed the process themselves. During the videotape, Kevorkian dared the authorities to try to convict him or stop him from carrying out mercy killings. Youk's family described the lethal injection as humane, not murder.\n\nOn March 26, 1999, Kevorkian was charged with second-degree [[murder]] and the delivery of a [[controlled substance]] (administering the lethal injection to Thomas Youk).<ref name=\"Frontline_chronology\">{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/chronology.html |title=The Kevorian Verdict: A Chronology| series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]| network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| date=May 1996| accessdate=February 13, 2012}}</ref> Because Kevorkian's [[medical license|license to practice medicine]] had been revoked eight years previously, he was not legally allowed to possess the controlled substance.

The new construction of Inholland on Zeeburgereiland is the result of the fact that the location in Diemen has reached the end of its lifespan. But also because the municipality of Amsterdam has indicated that it would like to see Hogeschool Inholland operate in and from the city. The relocation gives the university of applied sciences a recognizable position in the city of Amsterdam and a good profile in the city and region. The study programs from Amsterdam and Diemen will soon come together at one location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inholland.nl/nieuws/nieuwbouw-amsterdam-bestemmingsplan-sluisbuurt-vastgesteld/|title=Nieuwbouw Amsterdam: bestemmingsplan Sluisbuurt vastgesteld|website=Nieuwbouw Amsterdam: bestemmingsplan Sluisbuurt vastgesteld|language=nl|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n== Organization and activities ==\nWorking in the pattern of applied sciences, Inholland University of Applied Sciences has several in-house learning companies where students conduct projects within a particular industry, often on behalf of a company, institution or governmental agency. For example, NEWb and Rookie Entertainment are student-run companies for our music and media students. Here they learn how to produce a radio or TV show, do market research, create a promotional campaign or organise an event. In Delft, Inholland Composites offers Aeronautical Engineering students an opportunity to gain practical and theoretical knowledge on advanced composite materials.\n\n[[Bachelor's degree]]s at Inholland University of Applied Sciences demand three or four years of full-time study and require 240 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits. One [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS]] credit represents 28 hours of full-time study and the study/workload for one academic year accounts for 60 credits.The Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders ([[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders|NVAO]]) approves study programs offered by [[Dutch universities]]. All international bachelor's programs offered by Inholland University of Applied Sciences are recognised by [[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders|NVAO]].\n\n'''Internships'''\n\nDuring their studies, all Inholland students are required to do at least one internship (one semester in the third academic year). Internships, or\u00a0 work placements, can be done in the Netherlands or abroad, and the choice upon the company is generally done by students themselves, but supervised and approved by the university. Specific requirements may vary according to the study programme.\n\nDuring the internship students are supervised by one university lecturer or coach, and one company employee.\n\nThese internships are useful for building a professional network and gaining work experience directly on the field.

For Inholland, international mobility is a tool in order to reach that goal. Currently Inholland is actively part of the Erasmus and exchange program.  This allows students to obtain credits at Inholland that count towards their degree at their home institution. It is an excellent way to experience a different education system and to broaden students\u2019 international outlook.\n\nWith approximately 190 partner universities in Europe, and few others overseas (Australia, China, South Korea, Argentina, just to name a few), Inholland\u2019s students are given the opportunity of studying abroad for one semester in the third year, by maintaining the same tuition fees that in The Netherlands.\n\nAlternatively, students can choose to stay at Inholland and take part in one of many academic minors offered by each study programme.\n\nEach year more than 300 students and 60 teachers take part in the exchanges, and at the same time, Inholland\u2019s locations welcome over 200 students from partner universities around the world.\n\nPartner universities differ based on faculty and course.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{in lang|en}} [https://www.inholland.nl/inhollandcom/ Official website]\n\n{{Dutch Vocational Universities}}\n\n{{coord missing|Netherlands}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Vocational universities in the Netherlands]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Dutch university with eight campuses}}\n{{Infobox university\n| name = Inholland University of Applied Sciences\n| native_name = Hogeschool Inholland\n| image = Short logo.png\n| caption = \n| motto = Leren = durven\n| mottoeng = Learning = being courageous\n| established = 1 September 2002 - mergers of higher vocational education institutions in the provinces of North and South Holland\n| type = University of Applied Sciences\n| chairperson = Jet de Ranitz\n| students = 37,000; 6000 international students\n| city = [[The Hague]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Haarlem]], [[Alkmaar]], [[Delft]], [[Diemen]], [[Dordrecht]], [[Rotterdam]]\n| province = [[South Holland]]\n| country = [[Netherlands]]\n| campus = Multiple campuses\n| colours = {{color box|#E10075}} [[Magenta]]\n| website = {{URL|https://www.inholland.nl/}}\n| logo = [[File:Inholland University black.png|thumb|Inholland University black]]\n}}\n[[File:Hogeschool-inholland-delft.jpg|thumb|Inholland Delft Campus]]\n'''Inholland University of Applied Sciences''' ({{Lang-nl|Hogeschool Inholland}}; {{Lang-fr|Universit\u00e9 des sciences appliqu\u00e9es d'Inholland}}; {{Lang-de|Hochschule Inholland}}) is a [[university]] of applied sciences with its campuses located in 8 different cities<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inholland.nl/locaties/|title=Locaties - Hogeschool Inholland - Hbo-opleidingen|website=www.inholland.nl|language=nl|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> placed throughout the western [[Netherlands]] with an education campus in every main city of the [[Randstad]] \u2013 the country's economic, political and cultural hub.

The new construction of Inholland on Zeeburgereiland is the result of the fact that the location in Diemen has reached the end of its lifespan. But also because the municipality of Amsterdam has indicated that it would like to see Hogeschool Inholland operate in and from the city. The relocation gives the university of applied sciences a recognizable position in the city of Amsterdam and a good profile in the city and region. The study programs from Amsterdam and Diemen will soon come together at one location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inholland.nl/nieuws/nieuwbouw-amsterdam-bestemmingsplan-sluisbuurt-vastgesteld/|title=Nieuwbouw Amsterdam: bestemmingsplan Sluisbuurt vastgesteld|website=Nieuwbouw Amsterdam: bestemmingsplan Sluisbuurt vastgesteld|language=nl|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n== Organization and activities ==\nWorking in the pattern of applied sciences, Inholland University of Applied Sciences has several in-house learning companies where students conduct projects within a particular industry, often on behalf of a company, institution or governmental agency. For example, NEWb and Rookie Entertainment are student-run companies for our music and media students. Here they learn how to produce a radio or TV show, do market research, create a promotional campaign or organise an event. In Delft, Inholland Composites offers Aeronautical Engineering students an opportunity to gain practical and theoretical knowledge on advanced composite materials.\n\n[[Bachelor's degree]]s at Inholland University of Applied Sciences demand three or four years of full-time study and require 240 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits. One [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS]] credit represents 28 hours of full-time study and the study/workload for one academic year accounts for 60 credits.The Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders ([[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders|NVAO]]) approves study programs offered by [[Dutch universities]]. All international bachelor's programs offered by Inholland University of Applied Sciences are recognised by [[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders|NVAO]].\n\n'''Internships'''\n\nDuring their studies, all Inholland students are required to do at least one internship (one semester in the third academic year). Internships, or\u00a0 work placements, can be done in the Netherlands or abroad, and the choice upon the company is generally done by students themselves, but supervised and approved by the university. Specific requirements may vary according to the study programme.\n\nDuring the internship students are supervised by one university lecturer or coach, and one company employee.\n\nThese internships are useful for building a professional network and gaining work experience directly on the field. Inholland is committed to protect its students during the work placements experience by monitoring its development and quality in rapport to the study career.\n\n== Faculties ==\nThe [[degree programs]] of Inholland University of Applied Sciences are divided into faculties.
