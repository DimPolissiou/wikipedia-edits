The heroes of the epic are the brothers Alha and Udal retainers of the Rajput status with exceptional valour,  whose cause is the protection of Mahoba and defense of its honour. Called the \"Mahabarata of the Kaliyuga\", Alha both parallels and inverts the themes and the structures of the classical religious epic.\n\nThe (Alha) cycle consists of fifty-two episodes in which the heroes confront enemies of Mahoba or the resistant fathers of prospective brides.

Beshear signed an executive order as governor to completely restore the voting rights of those convicted of non-violent [[felonies]], as the law preventing them to vote is widely seen as an unfair tactic to suppress the African American vote, as 4 percent of African American adults in Kentucky are convicted non-violent felons. The executive order restored voting rights to over 100,000 people in Kentucky.<ref name=felons />\n\n===Economic policy===\nBeshear states that he wants to bring more advanced manufacturing jobs to Kentucky to offset job loses due to the decline of coal. In addition, Beshear wants to increase the number of health care jobs in the state. Beshear opposes the anti-union [[right-to-work law]] signed by his predecessor, [[Matt Bevin]].<ref name=swearin>{{cite web|title=Andy Beshear Swearing In|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtgPjZdZ2OU|publisher=WLKY News Louisville|access-date=December 10, 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nBeshear supports a major pay raise for all teachers in Kentucky, who earn one of the lowest salaries of any teachers in the country.<ref name=swearin />\n\n===Environment===\nBeshear accepts the [[scientific consensus on climate change|scientific consensus]] that climate change and climate change are real and caused by humans.

Beshear criticized his predecessor, [[Matt Bevin]], for trying to roll back the state's medicaid expansion (which ultimately failed). As Attorney General and Governor, Beshear repeatedly expressed support for the [[Affordable Care Act]] (known as Obamacare), and criticized a Texas judge for ruling it as unconstitutional.<ref name=issues />\n\n===Infrastructure===\nBeshear supports the project to replace the structurally deficient [[Brent Spence Bridge]], which carries Interstates [[Interstate 71 in Kentucky|71]] and [[Interstate 75 in Kentucky|75]] over the [[Ohio River]] between [[Covington, KY]] and [[Cincinnati, OH]]. The project has long been delayed, and the bridge is considered to be the most critical transportation link in the state of Kentucky. Beshear has expressed willingness to work with [[Ohio]] governor [[Mike DeWine]], a Republican, to start the project. Beshear hopes to fund the bridge through conventional means and not tolling, however, he is unsure if the state has the funds to do that.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kentucky governor candidates face off in final debate|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX-ouG5QL7o&t=1287s|publisher=WLKY News Louisville|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBeshear has also expressed support for the construction of the [[Interstate 69 Ohio River Bridge]] between [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and [[Evansville, Indiana]].

{"title_page": "Comorbidity", "text_new": "{{short description|Presence of more than one medical condition in a patient}}\nIn [[medicine]], '''comorbidity''' is the presence of one or more additional conditions [[wikt:co-occur#Verb|co-occurring]] with (that is, [[wikt:concomitant#Adjective|concomitant]] or [[wikt:concurrent#Adjective|concurrent]] with) a primary condition; in the [[count noun|countable]] sense of the term, a '''comorbidity''' (plural '''comorbidities''') is each additional condition. The additional condition may also be a [[emotional and behavioral disorders|behavioral]] or [[mental disorder]].\n\n== In medicine ==\n\nIn medicine, comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest.\n\nThe term can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related medical condition. The latter [[word sense|sense]] of the term causes some [[semantic field|overlap]] with the concept of [[complication (medicine)|complications]]. For example, in longstanding [[diabetes mellitus]], the extent to which [[coronary artery disease]] is an independent comorbidity versus a [[complications of diabetes mellitus|diabetic complication]] is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true of [[intercurrent disease in pregnancy|intercurrent diseases in pregnancy]]. In other examples, the true independence or relation is not ascertainable because [[syndrome]]s and [[genetic association|associations]] are often identified long before [[pathogenesis|pathogenetic]] commonalities are confirmed (and, in some examples, before they are even [[hypothesis|hypothesized]]). In psychiatric diagnoses it has been argued in part that this \"'use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking', [and] this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided.\"<ref name=\"pmid_15738496\">{{Citation |last=Maj |first=M |year=2005 |title='Psychiatric comorbidity': an artefact of current diagnostic systems? |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=186 |issue=3 |pages=182\u2013184 |pmid=15738496 |doi=10.1192/bjp.186.3.182 |postscript=.}}</ref> However, in many medical examples, such as comorbid diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, it makes little difference which word is used, as long as the medical complexity is duly recognized and addressed.\n\nMany tests attempt to standardize the \"weight\" or value of comorbid conditions, whether they are secondary or tertiary illnesses. Each test attempts to consolidate each individual comorbid condition into a single, predictive variable that measures mortality or other outcomes. Researchers have validated such tests because of their predictive value, but no one test is as yet recognized as a  standard.\n\nThe term \"comorbid\" has three definitions:\n# to indicate a medical condition existing simultaneously but independently with another condition in a patient (this is the older and more \"correct\" definition)\n# to indicate a medical condition in a patient that causes, is caused by, or is otherwise related to another condition in the same patient (this is a newer, nonstandard definition and less well-accepted).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1370/afm.983 |title=Defining Comorbidity: Implications for Understanding Health and Health Services |year=2009 |last1=Valderas |first1=Jose M. |last2=Starfield |first2=Barbara |last3=Sibbald |first3=Bonnie |last4=Salisbury |first4=Chris |last5=Roland |first5=Martin |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=357\u201363 |pmid=19597174 |pmc=2713155}}</ref>\n# to indicate two or more medical conditions existing simultaneously regardless of their causal relationship.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Comorbidity and multimorbidity in medicine today: challenges and opportunities for bringing separated branches of medicine closer to each other |vauthors=Jakovljevi\u0107 M, Ostoji\u0107 L | journal=Psychiatr Danub. |date=June 2013 | issue=25 Suppl 1 | pages=18\u201328 | pmid=23806971 | volume=25 Suppl 1}}</ref>\n\n=== Charlson index ===\n\nThe Charlson comorbidity index<ref name=\"CharlsonMary\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(87)90171-8 |title=A new method of classifying prognostic comorbidity in longitudinal studies: Development and validation |year=1987 |last1=Charlson |first1=Mary E. |last2=Pompei |first2=Peter |last3=Ales |first3=Kathy L. |last4=MacKenzie |first4=C.

Many variations of the Charlson comorbidity index have been presented, including the Charlson/Deyo, Charlson/Romano, Charlson/Manitoba, and Charlson/D'Hoores comorbidity indices.\n\nClinical conditions and associated scores are as follows:\n*1 each: Myocardial infarct, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, connective tissue disease, ulcer, chronic liver disease, diabetes.\n*2 each: Hemiplegia, moderate or severe kidney disease, diabetes with end organ damage, tumor, leukemia, lymphoma.\n*3 each: Moderate or severe liver disease.\n*6 each: Malignant tumor, metastasis, AIDS.\n\nFor a physician, this score is helpful in deciding how aggressively to treat a condition. For example, a patient may have cancer with comorbid heart disease and diabetes. These comorbidities may be so severe that the costs and risks of cancer treatment would outweigh its short-term benefit.\n\nSince patients often do not know how severe their conditions are, nurses were originally supposed to review a patient's chart and determine whether a particular condition was present in order to calculate the index. Subsequent studies have adapted the comorbidity index into a questionnaire for patients.\n\nThe Charlson index, especially the Charlson/Deyo, followed by the Elixhauser have been most commonly referred by the comparative studies of comorbidity and multimorbidity measures.<ref name=ComorbidReview>{{cite journal|last=Sharabiani|first=Mansour|author2=Aylin, Paul |author3=Bottle, Alex |title=Systematic review of comorbidity indices for administrative data|journal=Medical Care|date=December 2012|volume=50|issue=12|pages=1109\u201318|doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e31825f64d0|pmid=22929993}}</ref>\n\n===Comorbidity\u2013polypharmacy score (CPS)===\nThe comorbidity\u2013polypharmacy score (CPS) is a simple measure that consists of the sum of all known comorbid conditions and all associated medications.

The Elixhauser comorbidity measure developed a list of 30 comorbidities relying on the ICD-9-CM coding manual. The comorbidities were not simplified as an index because each comorbidity affected outcomes (length of hospital stay, hospital changes, and mortality) differently among different patients groups. The comorbidities identified by the Elixhauser comorbidity measure are significantly associated with in-hospital mortality and include both acute and chronic conditions. van Walraven et al. have derived and validated an Elixhauser comorbidity index that summarizes disease burden and can discriminate for in-hospital mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e31819432e5 |title=A Modification of the Elixhauser Comorbidity Measures into a Point System for Hospital Death Using Administrative Data |year=2009 |last1=Van Walraven |first1=Carl |last2=Austin |first2=Peter C. |last3=Jennings |first3=Alison |last4=Quan |first4=Hude |last5=Forster |first5=Alan J. |journal=Medical Care |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=626\u201333 |pmid=19433995|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f37738854b6a80f22d305cc789a6df95d1f9b7ad |format=Submitted manuscript }}\n</ref> In addition, a systematic review and comparative analysis shows that among various comorbidities indices, Elixhauser index is a better predictor of the risk especially beyond 30 days of hospitalisation.<ref name=\"ComorbidReview\"/>\n\n=== Diagnosis-related group ===\n\nPatients who are more seriously ill tend to require more hospital resources than patients who are less seriously ill, even though they are admitted to the hospital for the same reason. Recognizing this, the [[diagnosis-related group]] (DRG) manually splits certain DRGs based on the presence of secondary diagnoses for specific complications or comorbidities (CC).  The same applies to Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) in the UK.\n\n== Mental health ==\n\nIn [[psychiatry]], psychology, and mental health counseling, comorbidity refers to the presence of more than one diagnosis occurring in an individual at the same time. However, in psychiatric classification, comorbidity does not necessarily imply the presence of multiple diseases, but instead can reflect our current inability to supply a single diagnosis that accounts for all symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000086093 |title=Mutually Exclusive versus Co-Occurring Diagnostic Categories: The Challenge of Diagnostic Comorbidity |year=2005 |last1=First |first1=Michael B. |journal=Psychopathology |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=206\u201310 |pmid=16145276}}</ref> On the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] Axis I, [[major depressive disorder]] is a very common comorbid disorder.  The Axis II [[personality disorder]]s are often criticized because their comorbidity rates are excessively high, approaching 60% in some cases, indicating to critics the possibility that these categories of mental illness are too imprecisely distinguished to be usefully valid for diagnostic purposes and, thus, for deciding how treatment resources should be allocated.\n\nThe term 'comorbidity' was introduced in medicine by Feinstein (1970) to describe cases in which a 'distinct additional clinical entity' occurred before or during treatment for the 'index disease', the original or primary diagnosis. Since the terms were coined, meta studies have shown that criteria used to determine the index disease were flawed and subjective, and moreover, trying to identify an index disease as the cause of the others can be counterproductive to understanding and treating interdependent conditions. In response, 'multimorbidity' was introduced to describe concurrent conditions without relativity to or implied dependency on another disease, so that the complex interactions to emerge naturally under analysis of the system as a whole.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhee |first1=Soo Hyun |last2=Hewitt |first2=John K. |last3=Lessem |first3=Jeffrey M. |last4=Stallings |first4=Michael C. |last5=Corley |first5=Robin P. |last6=Neale |first6=Michael C. |title=The Validity of the Neale and Kendler Model-Fitting Approach in Examining the Etiology of Comorbidity |journal=Behavior Genetics |date=May 2004 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=251\u2013265 |doi=10.1023/B:BEGE.0000017871.87431.2a |pmid=14990866 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the term 'comorbidity' has recently become very fashionable in psychiatry, its use to indicate the concomitance of two or more psychiatric diagnoses is said to be incorrect because in most cases it is unclear whether the concomitant diagnoses actually reflect the presence of distinct clinical entities or refer to multiple manifestations of a single clinical entity. It has been argued that because \"'the use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking', this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided\".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.186.3.182 |title='Psychiatric comorbidity': An artifact of current diagnostic systems? |year=2005 |last1=Maj |first1=Mario |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=186 |issue=3 |pages=182\u20134 |pmid=15738496}}</ref> \n\nDue to its artifactual nature, psychiatric comorbidity has been considered as a Kuhnian anomaly leading the DSM to a scientific crisis<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/ppp.0.0211 |title=The Role of Comorbidity in the Crisis of the Current Psychiatric Classification System |year=2009 |last1=Massimiliano Aragona |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, & Psychology |volume=16 |pages=1\u201311}}</ref> and a comprehensive review on the matter considers comorbidity as an epistemological challenge to modern psychiatry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jakovljevi\u0107 |first1=Miro |last2=Crn\u010devi\u0107 |first2=\u017deljka |title=Comorbidity as an epistemological challenge to modern psychiatry |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A12-07.htm |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |date=June 2012 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201313}}</ref>\n\n== Inception of the term ==\nMany centuries ago the doctors propagated the viability of a complex approach in the diagnosis of disease and the treatment of the patient, however modern medicine, which boasts a wide range of diagnostic methods and variety of therapeutic procedures, stresses specification. This brought up a question: How to wholly evaluate the state of a patient who suffers from a number of diseases simultaneously, where to start from and which disease(s) require(s) primary and subsequent treatment? For many years this question stood out unanswered, until 1970, when a renowned American doctor epidemiologist and researcher, [[Alvan Feinstein|A.R. Feinstein]], who had greatly influenced the methods of clinical diagnosis and particularly methods used in the field of clinical epidemiology, came out with the term of \"comorbidity\". The appearance of comorbidity was demonstrated by Feinstein using the example of patients physically suffering from rheumatic fever, discovering the worst state of the patients, who simultaneously suffered from multiple diseases. In due course of time after its discovery, comorbidity was distinguished as a separate scientific-research discipline in many branches of medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(70)90054-8 |pmid=26309916 |title=The pre-therapeutic classification of co-morbidity in chronic disease |year=1970 |last1=Feinstein |first1=Alvan R. |journal=Journal of Chronic Diseases |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=455\u201368}}</ref>\n\n=== Evolution of the term ===\nPresently there is no agreed-upon terminology of comorbidity. Some authors bring forward different meanings of comorbidity and multi-morbidity, defining the former, as the presence of a number of diseases in a patient, connected to each other through proven pathogenetic mechanisms and the latter, as the presence of a number of diseases in a patient, not having any connection to each other through any of the proven till date pathogenetic mechanisms.<ref>\u041b\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041b. \u0411. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c // [http://old.consilium-medicum.com/media/consilium/05_12/993.shtml \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0443\u043c \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043c, 2005, \u2116 12]</ref> Others affirm that multi-morbidity is the combination of a number of chronic or acute diseases and clinical symptoms in a person and do not stress the similarities or differences in their pathogenesis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenfield |first1=Sheldon |last2=Apolone |first2=Giovanni |last3=McNeil |first3=Barbara J. |authorlink3=Barbara Joyce McNeil|last4=Cleary |first4=Paul D. |title=The Importance of Co-Existent Disease in the Occurrence of Postoperative Complications and One-Year Recovery in Patients Undergoing Total Hip Replacement: Comorbidity and Outcomes after Hip Replacement |journal=Medical Care |year=1993 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=141\u201354 |pmid=8433577 |jstor=3765891 |doi=10.1097/00005650-199302000-00005}}</ref> However the principle clarification of the term was given by H.

In most of the carried-out, randomized, clinical researches the authors study patients with single refined pathology, making comorbidity an exclusive criterion. This is why it is hard to relate researches, directed towards the evaluation of the combination of ones or the other separate disorders, to works regarding the sole research of comorbidity. The absence of a single scientific approach to the evaluation of comorbidity leads to omissions in clinical practice.

Primary is the disease, which becomes the cause of seeking medical help or the reason for the patient's death. If the patient has several primary diseases it is important to first of all understand the combined primary diseases (rival or concomitant).\n* Rival diseases: These are the concurrent nosological forms in a patient, interdependent in etiologies and pathogenesis, but equally sharing the criterion of a primary disease (for example, transmural myocardial infarction and massive thromboembolism of pulmonary artery, caused by phlebemphraxis of lower limbs). For practicing pathologist rival are two or more diseases, exhibited in a single patient, each of which by itself or through its complications could cause the patient's death.\n* Polypathia: Diseases with different etiologies and pathogenesis, each of which separately could not cause death, but, concurring during development and reciprocally exacerbating each other, they cause the patient's death (for example, osteoporotic fracture of the surgical neck of the femur and hypostatic pneumonia).\n* Background disease: This helps in the occurrence of or adverse development of the primary disease increases its dangers and helps in the development of complications. This disease as well as the primary one requires immediate treatment (for example, type 2 diabetes).\n* Complications: Nosologies having pathogenetic relation to the primary disease, supporting the adverse progression of the disorder, causing acute worsening of the patient's conditions (are a part of the complicated comorbidity). In a number of cases the complications of the primary disease and related to it etiological and pathogenetic factors, are indicated as conjugated disease. In this case they must be identified as the cause of comorbidity. Complications are listed in a descending order of prognostic or disabling significance.\n* Associating diseases: Nosological units not connected etiologically and pathogenetically with the primary disease (Listed in the order of significance).\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThere is no doubt in the significance of comorbidity, but how is it evaluated (measure) it in a given patient?\n\n=== Clinical example ===\nPatient S., 73 years, called an ambulance because of a sudden pressing pain in the chest. It was known from the case history that the patient suffered from CHD for many years. Such chest pains were experienced by her earlier as well, but they always disappeared after a few minutes of sublingual administration of organic nitrates. This time taking three tablets of nitroglycerine did not kill the pain. It was also known from the case history that the patient had twice suffered during the last ten years from myocardial infarction, as well as from Acute Cerebrovascular Event with sinistral hemiplegia more than 15 years ago. Apart from that the patient suffers from hypertension, type 2 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy, hysteromyoma, cholelithiasis, osteoporosis and varicose pedi-vein disease. It also came to knowledge that the patient regularly takes a number of antihypertensive drugs, urinatives and oral antihyperglycemic remedies, as well as statins, antiplatelet and nootropics. In the past the patient had undergone cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis more than 20 years ago, as well as the extraction of crystalline tumor due to cataract of the right eye 4 years ago. The patient was admitted to cardiac intensive care unit at a general hospital diagnosed for acute transmural myocardial infarction. During the check-up moderate azotemia, mild erythronormoblastic anemia, proteinuria and lowering of left vascular ejection fraction were also identified.\n\n=== Methods of evaluation ===\nThere are currently several generally accepted methods of evaluating (measuring) comorbidity:<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(02)00585-1 |title=How to measure comorbiditya critical review of available methods |year=2003 |last1=Degroot |first1=V |last2=Beckerman |first2=H |last3=Lankhorst |first3=G |last4=Bouter |first4=L |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=221\u20139 |pmid=12725876 |url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/2902143/267402.pdf }}</ref>\n\n# Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS): Developed in 1968 by B. S. Linn, it became a revolutionary discovery, because it gave the practicing doctors a chance to calculate the number and severity of chronic illnesses in the structure of the comorbid state of their patients. The proper use of CIRS means separate cumulative evaluation of each of the biological systems: \"0\" The selected system corresponds to the absence of disorders, \"1\": Slight (mild) abnormalities or previously suffered disorders, \"2\": Illness requiring the prescription of medicinal therapy, \"3\": Disease, which caused disability and \"4\": Acute organ insufficiency requiring emergency therapy. The CIRS system evaluates comorbidity in cumulative score, which can be from 0 to 56.

In this system of comorbidity evaluation all the present (in a patient) diseases and their complications, depending on the level of their damaging effect on body organs, are classified as mild, moderate and severe. In this case the conclusion about cumulative comorbidity is drawn on the basis of the most decompensated biological system. This index gives cumulative, but less detailed as compared to CIRS, assessment of the condition of each of the biological systems: \"0\": Absence of disease, \"1\": Mild course of the disease, \"2\": Moderate disease, \"3\": Severe disease. The Kaplan\u2013Feinstein Index evaluates comorbidity by cumulative score, which can vary from 0 to 36. Apart from that the notable deficiency of this method of evaluating comorbidity is the excessive generalization of diseases (nosologies) and the absence of a large number of illnesses in the scale, which, probably, should be noted in the \"miscellaneous\" column, which undermines (decreases) this method's objectivity and productivity of this method.

E. Charlson in 1987. This index is based on a point scoring system (from 0 to 40) for the presence of specific associated diseases and is used for prognosis of lethality. For its calculation the points are accumulated, according to associated diseases, as well as the addition of a single point for each 10 years of age for patients of ages above forty years (in 50 years 1 point, 60 years 2 points etc.). The distinguishing feature and undisputed advantage of the Charlson Index is the capability of evaluating the patient's age and determination of the patient's mortality rate, which in the absence of comorbidity is 12%, at 1\u20132 points it is 26%; at 3\u20134 points it is 52% and with the accumulation of more than 5 points it is 85%. Regretfully this method has some deficiencies: Evaluating comorbidity severity of many diseases is not considered, as well as the absence of many important for prognosis disorders. Apart from that it is doubtful that possible prognosis for a patient suffering from bronchial asthma and chronic leukemia is comparable to the prognosis for the patient ailing from myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction.<ref name=\"CharlsonMary\" /> ''In this case comorbidity of patient S, 73 years of age according to this method, is equivalent to mild state (9 out of 40 points)''.\n# Modified Charlson Index: R.

Greenfield to evaluate comorbidity in patients with malignant neoplasms, later it also became useful for other categories of patients. This method helps in calculating the duration of a patient's stay at a hospital and the risks of repeated admittance of the same at a hospital after going through surgical procedures. For the evaluation of comorbidity the ICED index suggests to evaluate the patient's condition separately as per two different components: Physiological functional characteristics. The first component comprises 19 associated disorders, each of which is assessed on a 4-point scale, where \"0\" indicates the absence of disease and \"3\" indicates the disease's severe form. The second component evaluates the effect of associated diseases on the physical condition of the patient. It assesses 11 physical functions using a 3-point scale, where \"0\" means normal functionality and \"2\" means the impossibility of functionality.\n# Geriatric Index of Comorbidity (GIC): Developed in 2002<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ageing/31.4.277 |title=Geriatric Index of Comorbidity: Validation and comparison with other measures of comorbidity |year=2002 |last1=Rozzini |first1=R. |journal=Age and Ageing |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=277\u201385 |pmid=12147566 |last2=Frisoni |first2=GB |last3=Ferrucci |first3=L |last4=Barbisoni |first4=P |last5=Sabatini |first5=T |last6=Ranieri |first6=P |last7=Guralnik |first7=JM |last8=Trabucchi |first8=M}}</ref>\n# Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI): Developed in 2005.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.10.018 |title=The development of a comorbidity index with physical function as the outcome |year=2005 |last1=Groll |first1=D |last2=To |first2=T |last3=Bombardier |first3=C |last4=Wright |first4=J |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=595\u2013602 |pmid=15878473}}</ref>\n# Total Illness Burden Index (TIBI): Developed in 2007.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cncr.22615 |title=Assessment of prognosis with the total illness burden index for prostate cancer |year=2007 |last1=Litwin |first1=Mark S. |last2=Greenfield |first2=Sheldon |last3=Elkin |first3=Eric P. |last4=Lubeck |first4=Deborah P. |last5=Broering |first5=Jeanette M. |last6=Kaplan |first6=Sherrie H. |journal=Cancer |volume=109 |issue=9 |pages=1777\u201383 |pmid=17354226}}</ref>\nAnalyzing the comorbid state of patient S, 73 years of age, using the most used international comorbidity assessment scales, a doctor would come across totally different evaluation. The uncertainty of these results would somewhat complicate the doctors judgment about the factual level of severity of the patient's condition and would complicate the process of prescribing rational medicinal therapy for the identified disorders. Such problems are faced by doctors on everyday basis, despite all their knowledge about medical science. The main hurdle in the way of inducting comorbidity evaluation systems in broad based diagnostic-therapeutic process is their inconsistency and narrow focus. Despite the variety of methods of evaluation of comorbidity, the absence of a singular generally accepted method, devoid of the deficiencies of the available methods of its evaluation, causes disturbance. The absence of a unified instrument, developed on the basis of colossal international experience, as well as the methodology of its use does not allow comorbidity to become doctor \"friendly\". At the same time due to the inconsistency in approach to the analysis of comorbid state and absence of components of comorbidity in medical university courses, the practitioner is unclear about its prognostic effect, which makes the generally available systems of associated pathology evaluation unreasoned and therefore un-needed as well.\n\n== Treatment of comorbid patient ==\nThe effect of comorbid pathologies on clinical implications, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of many diseases is polyhedral and patient-specific. The interrelation of the disease, age and drug pathomorphism greatly affect the clinical presentation and progress of the primary nosology, character and severity of the complications, worsens the patient's life quality and limit or make difficult the remedial-diagnostic process. Comorbidity affects life prognosis and increases the chances of fatality. The presence of comorbid disorders increases bed days, disability, hinders rehabilitation, increases the number of complications after surgical procedures, and increases the chances of decline in aged people.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(88)90074-5 |title=Financial risk, hospital cost, and complications and comorbidities in medical non-complications and comorbidity-stratified diagnosis-related groups |year=1988 |last1=Mu\u00f1oz |first1=Eric |last2=Rosner |first2=Fred |last3=Friedman |first3=Richard |last4=Sterman |first4=Harris |last5=Goldstein |first5=Jonathan |last6=Wise |first6=Leslie |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=933\u20139 |pmid=3129939}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of comorbidity must be taken into account when selecting the algorithm of diagnosis and treatment plans for any given disease. It is important to enquire comorbid patients about the level of functional disorders and anatomic status of all the identified nosological forms (diseases). Whenever a new, as well as mildly notable symptom appears, it is necessary to conduct a deep examination to uncover its causes. It is also necessary to be remembered that comorbidity leads to polypragmasy (polypharmacy), i.e. simultaneous prescription of a large number of medicines, which renders impossible the control over the effectiveness of the therapy, increases monetary expenses and therefore reduces compliance. At the same time, polypragmasy, especially in aged patients, renders possible the sudden development of local and systematic, unwanted medicinal side-effects. These side-effects are not always considered by the doctors, because they are considered as the appearance of comorbidity and as a result become the reason for the prescription of even more drugs, sealing-in the vicious circle. Simultaneous treatment of multiple disorders requires strict consideration of compatibility of drugs and detailed adherence of rules of rational drug therapy, based on E. M. Tareev's principles, which state: \"Each non-indicated drug is contraindicated\"{{cite quote|date=February 2013}} and B. E.

Many variations of the Charlson comorbidity index have been presented, including the Charlson/Deyo, Charlson/Romano, Charlson/Manitoba, and Charlson/D'Hoores comorbidity indices.\n\nClinical conditions and associated scores are as follows:\n*1 each: Myocardial infarct, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, connective tissue disease, ulcer, chronic liver disease, diabetes.\n*2 each: Hemiplegia, moderate or severe kidney disease, diabetes with end organ damage, tumor, leukemia, lymphoma.\n*3 each: Moderate or severe liver disease.\n*6 each: Malignant tumor, metastasis, AIDS.\n\nFor a physician, this score is helpful in deciding how aggressively to treat a condition. For example, a patient may have cancer with comorbid heart disease and diabetes. These comorbidities may be so severe that the costs and risks of cancer treatment would outweigh its short-term benefit.\n\nSince patients often do not know how severe their conditions are, nurses were originally supposed to review a patient's chart and determine whether a particular condition was present in order to calculate the index.

Since the terms were coined, meta studies have shown that criteria used to determine the index disease were flawed and subjective, and moreover, trying to identify an index disease as the cause of the others can be counterproductive to understanding and treating interdependent conditions.

For many years this question stood out unanswered, until 1970, when a renowned American doctor epidemiologist and researcher, [[Alvan Feinstein|A.R. Feinstein]], who had greatly influenced the methods of clinical diagnosis and particularly methods used in the field of clinical epidemiology, came out with the term of \"comorbidity\". The appearance of comorbidity was demonstrated by Feinstein using the example of patients physically suffering from rheumatic fever, discovering the worst state of the patients, who simultaneously suffered from multiple diseases.

Some authors bring forward different meanings of comorbidity and multi-morbidity, defining the former, as the presence of a number of diseases in a patient, connected to each other through proven pathogenetic mechanisms and the latter, as the presence of a number of diseases in a patient, not having any connection to each other through any of the proven till date pathogenetic mechanisms.<ref>\u041b\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041b. \u0411. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c // [http://old.consilium-medicum.com/media/consilium/05_12/993.shtml \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0443\u043c \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043c, 2005, \u2116 12]</ref> Others affirm that multi-morbidity is the combination of a number of chronic or acute diseases and clinical symptoms in a person and do not stress the similarities or differences in their pathogenesis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenfield |first1=Sheldon |last2=Apolone |first2=Giovanni |last3=McNeil |first3=Barbara J. |authorlink3=Barbara Joyce McNeil|last4=Cleary |first4=Paul D. |title=The Importance of Co-Existent Disease in the Occurrence of Postoperative Complications and One-Year Recovery in Patients Undergoing Total Hip Replacement: Comorbidity and Outcomes after Hip Replacement |journal=Medical Care |year=1993 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=141\u201354 |pmid=8433577 |jstor=3765891 |doi=10.1097/00005650-199302000-00005}}</ref> However the principle clarification of the term was given by H.

In most of the carried-out, randomized, clinical researches the authors study patients with single refined pathology, making comorbidity an exclusive criterion. This is why it is hard to relate researches, directed towards the evaluation of the combination of ones or the other separate disorders, to works regarding the sole research of comorbidity.

Primary is the disease, which becomes the cause of seeking medical help or the reason for the patient's death. If the patient has several primary diseases it is important to first of all understand the combined primary diseases (rival or concomitant).\n* Rival diseases: These are the concurrent nosological forms in a patient, interdependent in etiologies and pathogenesis, but equally sharing the criterion of a primary disease (for example, transmural myocardial infarction and massive thromboembolism of pulmonary artery, caused by phlebemphraxis of lower limbs). For practicing pathologist rival are two or more diseases, exhibited in a single patient, each of which by itself or through its complications could cause the patient's death.\n* Polypathia: Diseases with different etiologies and pathogenesis, each of which separately could not cause death, but, concurring during development and reciprocally exacerbating each other, they cause the patient's death (for example, osteoporotic fracture of the surgical neck of the femur and hypostatic pneumonia).\n* Background disease: This helps in the occurrence of or adverse development of the primary disease increases its dangers and helps in the development of complications. This disease as well as the primary one requires immediate treatment (for example, type 2 diabetes).\n* Complications: Nosologies having pathogenetic relation to the primary disease, supporting the adverse progression of the disorder, causing acute worsening of the patient's conditions (are a part of the complicated comorbidity). In a number of cases the complications of the primary disease and related to it etiological and pathogenetic factors, are indicated as conjugated disease. In this case they must be identified as the cause of comorbidity. Complications are listed in a descending order of prognostic or disabling significance.\n* Associating diseases: Nosological units not connected etiologically and pathogenetically with the primary disease (Listed in the order of significance).\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThere is no doubt in the significance of comorbidity, but how to evaluate (measure) it in a given patient?\n\n=== Clinical example ===\nPatient S., 73 years, called an ambulance because of a sudden pressing pain in the chest. It was known from the case history that the patient suffered from CHD for many years. Such chest pains were experienced by her earlier as well, but they always disappeared after a few minutes of sublingual administration of organic nitrates. This time taking three tablets of nitroglycerine did not kill the pain. It was also known from the case history that the patient had twice suffered during the last ten years from myocardial infarction, as well as from Acute Cerebrovascular Event with sinistral hemiplegia more than 15 years ago. Apart from that the patient suffers from hypertension, type 2 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy, hysteromyoma, cholelithiasis, osteoporosis and varicose pedi-vein disease. It also came to knowledge that the patient regularly takes a number of antihypertensive drugs, urinatives and oral antihyperglycemic remedies, as well as statins, antiplatelet and nootropics. In the past the patient had undergone cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis more than 20 years ago, as well as the extraction of crystalline tumor due to cataract of the right eye 4 years ago. The patient was admitted to cardiac intensive care unit at a general hospital diagnosed for acute transmural myocardial infarction. During the check-up moderate azotemia, mild erythronormoblastic anemia, proteinuria and lowering of left vascular ejection fraction were also identified.\n\n=== Methods of evaluation ===\nThere are currently several generally accepted methods of evaluating (measuring) comorbidity:<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(02)00585-1 |title=How to measure comorbiditya critical review of available methods |year=2003 |last1=Degroot |first1=V |last2=Beckerman |first2=H |last3=Lankhorst |first3=G |last4=Bouter |first4=L |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=221\u20139 |pmid=12725876 |url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/2902143/267402.pdf }}</ref>\n\n# Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS): Developed in 1968 by B. S. Linn, it became a revolutionary discovery, because it gave the practicing doctors a chance to calculate the number and severity of chronic illnesses in the structure of the comorbid state of their patients. The proper use of CIRS means separate cumulative evaluation of each of the biological systems: \"0\" The selected system corresponds to the absence of disorders, \"1\": Slight (mild) abnormalities or previously suffered disorders, \"2\": Illness requiring the prescription of medicinal therapy, \"3\": Disease, which caused disability and \"4\": Acute organ insufficiency requiring emergency therapy. The CIRS system evaluates comorbidity in cumulative score, which can be from 0 to 56. As per its developers, the maximum score is not compatible with the patient's life.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=5646906 |year=1968 |last1=Linn |first1=Bernard S. |last2=Linn |first2=Margaret W. |last3=Gurel |first3=Lee |title=Cumulative illness rating scale |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=622\u20136 |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.1968.tb02103.x |url=http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cumulative-illness-rating-scale/#page-1}}</ref>\n# Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G): This system is similar to CIRS, but for aged patients, offered by M.

In this system of comorbidity evaluation all the present (in a patient) diseases and their complications, depending on the level of their damaging effect on body organs, are classified as mild, moderate and severe. In this case the conclusion about cumulative comorbidity is drawn on the basis of the most decompensated biological system. This index gives cumulative, but less detailed as compared to CIRS, assessment of the condition of each of the biological systems: \"0\": Absence of disease, \"1\": Mild course of the disease, \"2\": Moderate disease, \"3\": Severe disease. The Kaplan\u2013Feinstein Index evaluates comorbidity by cumulative score, which can vary from 0 to 36. Apart from that the notable deficiency of this method of evaluating comorbidity is the excessive generalization of diseases (nosologies) and the absence of a large number of illnesses in the scale, which, probably, should be noted in the \"miscellaneous\" column, which undermines (decreases) this method's objectivity and productivity of this method. However the indisputable advantage of the Kaplan\u2013Feinstein Index as compared to CIRS is in the capability of independent analysis of malignant neoplasms and their severities.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=4689292 |year=1973 |last1=Kaplan |first1=M.

E. Charlson in 1987. This index is based on a point scoring system (from 0 to 40) for the presence of specific associated diseases and is used for prognosis of lethality. For its calculation the points are accumulated, according to associated diseases, as well as the addition of a single point for each 10 years of age for patients of ages above forty years (in 50 years 1 point, 60 years 2 points etc.). The distinguishing feature and undisputed advantage of the Charlson Index is the capability of evaluating the patient's age and determination of the patient's mortality rate, which in the absence of comorbidity is 12%, at 1\u20132 points it is 26%; at 3\u20134 points it is 52% and with the accumulation of more than 5 points it is 85%. Regretfully this method has some deficiencies: Evaluating comorbidity severity of many diseases is not considered, as well as the absence of many important for prognosis disorders. Apart from that it is doubtful that possible prognosis for a patient suffering from bronchial asthma and chronic leukemia is comparable to the prognosis for the patient ailing from myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction.<ref name=\"CharlsonMary\" /> ''In this case comorbidity of patient S, 73 years of age according to this method, is equivalent to mild state (9 out of 40 points)''.\n# Modified Charlson Index: R.

Greenfield to evaluate comorbidity in patients with malignant neoplasms, later it also became useful for other categories of patients. This method helps in calculating the duration of a patient's stay at a hospital and the risks of repeated admittance of the same at a hospital after going through surgical procedures. For the evaluation of comorbidity the ICED index suggests to evaluate the patient's condition separately as per two different components: Physiological functional characteristics. The first component comprises 19 associated disorders, each of which is assessed on a 4-point scale, where \"0\" indicates the absence of disease and \"3\" indicates the disease's severe form. The second component evaluates the effect of associated diseases on the physical condition of the patient. It assesses 11 physical functions using a 3-point scale, where \"0\" means normal functionality and \"2\" means the impossibility of functionality.\n# Geriatric Index of Comorbidity (GIC): Developed in 2002<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ageing/31.4.277 |title=Geriatric Index of Comorbidity: Validation and comparison with other measures of comorbidity |year=2002 |last1=Rozzini |first1=R. |journal=Age and Ageing |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=277\u201385 |pmid=12147566 |last2=Frisoni |first2=GB |last3=Ferrucci |first3=L |last4=Barbisoni |first4=P |last5=Sabatini |first5=T |last6=Ranieri |first6=P |last7=Guralnik |first7=JM |last8=Trabucchi |first8=M}}</ref>\n# Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI): Developed in 2005.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.10.018 |title=The development of a comorbidity index with physical function as the outcome |year=2005 |last1=Groll |first1=D |last2=To |first2=T |last3=Bombardier |first3=C |last4=Wright |first4=J |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=595\u2013602 |pmid=15878473}}</ref>\n# Total Illness Burden Index (TIBI): Developed in 2007.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cncr.22615 |title=Assessment of prognosis with the total illness burden index for prostate cancer |year=2007 |last1=Litwin |first1=Mark S. |last2=Greenfield |first2=Sheldon |last3=Elkin |first3=Eric P. |last4=Lubeck |first4=Deborah P. |last5=Broering |first5=Jeanette M. |last6=Kaplan |first6=Sherrie H. |journal=Cancer |volume=109 |issue=9 |pages=1777\u201383 |pmid=17354226}}</ref>\nAnalyzing the comorbid state of patient S, 73 years of age, using the most used international comorbidity assessment scales, a doctor would come across totally different evaluation. The uncertainty of these results would somewhat complicate the doctors judgment about the factual level of severity of the patient's condition and would complicate the process of prescribing rational medicinal therapy for the identified disorders. Such problems are faced by doctors on everyday basis, despite all their knowledge about medical science. The main hurdle in the way of inducting comorbidity evaluation systems in broad based diagnostic-therapeutic process is their inconsistency and narrow focus. Despite the variety of methods of evaluation of comorbidity, the absence of a singular generally accepted method, devoid of the deficiencies of the available methods of its evaluation, causes disturbance. The absence of a unified instrument, developed on the basis of colossal international experience, as well as the methodology of its use does not allow comorbidity to become doctor \"friendly\". At the same time due to the inconsistency in approach to the analysis of comorbid state and absence of components of comorbidity in medical university courses, the practitioner is unclear about its prognostic effect, which makes the generally available systems of associated pathology evaluation unreasoned and therefore un-needed as well.\n\n== Treatment of comorbid patient ==\nThe effect of comorbid pathologies on clinical implications, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of many diseases is polyhedral and patient-specific. The interrelation of the disease, age and drug pathomorphism greatly affect the clinical presentation and progress of the primary nosology, character and severity of the complications, worsens the patient's life quality and limit or make difficult the remedial-diagnostic process. Comorbidity affects life prognosis and increases the chances of fatality. The presence of comorbid disorders increases bed days, disability, hinders rehabilitation, increases the number of complications after surgical procedures, and increases the chances of decline in aged people.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(88)90074-5 |title=Financial risk, hospital cost, and complications and comorbidities in medical non-complications and comorbidity-stratified diagnosis-related groups |year=1988 |last1=Mu\u00f1oz |first1=Eric |last2=Rosner |first2=Fred |last3=Friedman |first3=Richard |last4=Sterman |first4=Harris |last5=Goldstein |first5=Jonathan |last6=Wise |first6=Leslie |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=933\u20139 |pmid=3129939}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of comorbidity must be taken into account when selecting the algorithm of diagnosis and treatment plans for any given disease. It is important to enquire comorbid patients about the level of functional disorders and anatomic status of all the identified nosological forms (diseases). Whenever a new, as well as mildly notable symptom appears, it is necessary to conduct a deep examination to uncover its causes. It is also necessary to be remembered that comorbidity leads to polypragmasy (polypharmacy), i.e. simultaneous prescription of a large number of medicines, which renders impossible the control over the effectiveness of the therapy, increases monetary expenses and therefore reduces compliance. At the same time, polypragmasy, especially in aged patients, renders possible the sudden development of local and systematic, unwanted medicinal side-effects. These side-effects are not always considered by the doctors, because they are considered as the appearance of comorbidity and as a result become the reason for the prescription of even more drugs, sealing-in the vicious circle.

description|Province of South Africa on the south-western coast}}\nThe '''Western Cape''' ({{lang-af|Wes-Kaap}}; {{lang-xh|iNtshona-Koloni}}) is a [[provinces of South Africa|province]] of [[South Africa]], situated on the south-western coast of the country. It is the [[List of South African provinces by area|fourth largest of the nine provinces]] with an area of {{convert|129449|km2}}, and [[List of South African provinces by population|the third most populous]], with an estimated 6.6 million inhabitants in 2018.<ref> Statistics South Africa, 2018. Mid- year population estimates. Available: http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0302/P03022018.pdf</ref> About two-thirds of these inhabitants live in the metropolitan area of [[Cape Town]], which is also the provincial capital. The Western Cape was created in 1994 from part of the former [[Cape Province]], The two largest cities are [[Cape Town]] and [[George, Western Cape|George]]\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Western Cape topography labelled (with provincial labels).svg|thumb|400px|left|Topography of the Western Cape. The Roggeveld and Nuweveld mountains are part of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] (see diagrams below). The other mountain ranges belong to the [[Cape Fold Belt]], also shown in the diagrams below. The Western Cape's inland boundary lies for the most part at the foot of the Great Escarpment.]]\n[[File:SW-NE geological cross section through South Africa.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|An approximate SW-NE cross section through South Africa with the [[Cape Peninsula]] (with [[Table Mountain]]) on left, and northeastern [[KwaZulu-Natal]] on the right. Diagrammatic and only roughly to scale. It shows the major geological structures (coloured layers) that dominate the southern and eastern parts of the country, as well as the relationship between the Central Plateau, the [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Fold Mountains]], and the [[Drakensberg]] escarpment. The significance and origin of the geological layers can be found under the headings \"[[Karoo Supergroup]]\" and \"[[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Supergroup]]\".]]\n[[File:NS cross section Southern Cape.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|A diagrammatic 400 km north-south crosssection through the southern portion of the country at approximately 21\u00b0 30\u2019 E (i.e. near [[Calitzdorp]] in the Little Karoo), showing the relationship between the [[Cape Fold Mountains]] (and their geological structure) and the [[Karoo Supergroup|geology of the Little and Great Karoo]], as well as the position of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]]. The colour code for the geological layers is the same as those used in the diagram above. The heavy black line flanked by opposing arrows is the fault that runs for nearly 300 km along the southern edge of the [[Swartberg]] Mountains. The Swartberg Mountain range owes some of its great height to upliftment along this fault line. The subsurface structures are not to scale.]]\nThe '''Western Cape Province''' is roughly L-shaped, extending north and east from the [[Cape of Good Hope]], in the southwestern corner of South Africa. It stretches about {{convert|400|km}} northwards along the Atlantic coast and about {{convert|500|km|-2}} eastwards along the South African south coast ([[Southern Indian Ocean]]). It is bordered on the north by the [[Northern Cape]] and on the east by the [[Eastern Cape]]. The total land area of the province is {{convert|129462|km2}},<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|9}} about 10.6% of the country's total. It is roughly the size of [[England]] or the [[State of Louisiana]]. Its capital city and largest city is [[Cape Town]], and some other major cities include [[Stellenbosch]], [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]], [[Paarl]], and [[George, South Africa|George]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] are popular coastal tourism areas.\n\nThe Western Cape is the '''southernmost region of the African continent''' with [[Cape Agulhas]] as its southernmost point, only 3800&nbsp;km from the Antarctic coastline. The coastline varies from sandy between capes, to rocky to steep and mountainous in places. The only natural harbour is [[Saldanha Bay]] on the west coast, about 140&nbsp;km north of Cape Town. However a lack of fresh water in the region meant that it has only recently been used as a harbour. The province's main harbour was built in [[Table Bay]], which in its natural state was fully exposed to the northwesterly storms that bring rain to the province in winter, as well as the almost uninterrupted dry southeasterly winds in summer. But fresh water coming off [[Table Mountain]] and [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] allowed the early European settlers to build Cape Town on the shores of this less than satisfactory anchorage.\n\nThe province is '''topographically''' exceptionally diverse. Most of the province falls within the [[Cape Fold Belt]], a set of nearly parallel ranges of [[Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|sandstone folded mountains]] of [[Cambrian]]-[[Ordovician]] age (the age of the rocks is from 510 to about 330&nbsp;million years ago; their folding into mountains occurred about 350 to about 270&nbsp;million years ago).<ref name=compton>Compton, J.S.

The valleys between ranges are generally very fertile as they contain the weathered loamy soils of the [[Cape Fold Belt#Bokkeveld Group|Bokkeveld mudstones]] (see the diagrams on the left).<ref name=McCarthy />\n\nThe '''far interior''' forms part of the [[Karoo]]. This region of the Province is generally arid and hilly with a [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|prominent escarpment]] that runs close to the Province's most inland boundary.\n\nThe '''Escarpment''' marks the southwestern edge of [[Geography of South Africa#Topographical Divisions|South Africa's central plateau]] (see the middle and bottom diagrams on the left).<ref name=McCarthy /><ref name= \"Altas\">Atlas of Southern Africa. (1984). p. 13. Readers Digest Association, Cape Town</ref> It runs parallel to the entire South African coastline except in the very far northeast, where it is interrupted by the [[Limpopo River]] valley, and the far northwest, where it is interrupted by the [[Orange River]] valley. The 1000&nbsp;km-long northeastern stretch of the escarpment is called the [[Drakensberg]], which is geographically and geologically quite distinct from the [[Cape Fold Belt#Cape Supergroup|Cape Fold Mountains]], which originated much earlier and totally independently of the origin of the escarpment.<ref name=McCarthy /><ref name=Truswell /><ref name= McCarthy1>McCarthy, T.S.

The [[Geography of South Africa#Namaqualand|West Coast]] and [[Karoo#Divisions|Little Karoo]] are [[semi-arid]] regions and are typified by many species of succulents and drought-resistant shrubs and acacia trees. The [[Garden Route]] on the south coast (between the [[Outeniqua Mountains]] and the [[Southern Indian Ocean]]) is extremely lush, with temperate rainforest (or [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Afromontane Forest]]) covering many areas adjacent to the coast, in the deep river valleys and along the southern slopes of the Outeniqua mountain range. Typical species are hardwoods of exceptional height, such as [[Podocarpus|Yellowwood]], [[Stinkwood]] and [[Ironwood]] trees.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Western Cape is also climatologically diverse, with many distinct micro- and macroclimates created by the varied topography and the influence of the surrounding ocean currents. These are the warm [[Agulhas Current]] which flows southwards along South Africa's east coast, and the cold [[Benguela Current]] which is an upwelling current from the depths of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] along South Africa's west coast.<ref name=Branch>Branch, M & Branch G. (1981). ''The Living Shores of Southern Africa.'' pp. 14\u201318. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.</ref><ref name=tyson>Tyson, P.D., Preston-Whyte, R.A. (2000) ''The Weather and Climate of Southern Africa''. pp. 221\u2013223. Oxford University Press, Cape Town</ref> Thus climatic statistics can vary greatly over short distances. Most of the province is considered to have a [[Mediterranean climate]] with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Both the [[Karoo|Great Karoo and Little Karoo]], in the interior, have an [[arid]] to [[semi-arid]] climate with cold, frosty winters and hot summers with occasional [[thunderstorms]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] on the south coast have a maritime climate with cool, moist winters and mild, moist summers. [[Mossel Bay]] in the Garden Route is considered to have the second mildest climate worldwide after Hawaii.\n\nThunderstorms are generally rare in the province (except in the [[Karoo]]) with most precipitation being of a [[Cold front|frontal]] or [[orographic]] nature.

The BCM represented a social movement for political consciousness.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Ideology of the Black Consciousness Movement |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/ideology-black-consciousness-movement |website=South African History Online |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1968, the [[South African Student Organization]] (SASO) was formed at a conference held in Marianhill, Natal. The conference was exclusively attended by Black students.

Poster parades by UWC and Black Power Salute marches by UCT was broken by the police, resulting in 73 students getting arrested and detained at [[Victor Verster Prison]], near Paarl.\n\nOn 1 September 1976, the unrest spread to the city of Cape Town itself. Approximately 2000 black students from Western Cape townships, namely Langa, Nyanga and Gugulethu, matched the Cape Town central business district (CBD). Coloured students also contributed to the protests by peacefully marching to the city, but were blockaded by the police in the CBD. The protests turned violent when coloured students started burning schools, libraries and a magistrate's court in support of the student revolt. Thereafter, 200,000 coloured workers partook in a two-day strike staying away from work in the Cape Town area.\n\nAccording to a report by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), the Western Cape experienced the second highest number of deaths and casualties associated with the 1976 uprising protests.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/cape-town/black-consciousness-and-student-revolt-cape|title = Black consciousness and student revolt in Cape Town|date = |accessdate = 14 June 2014|website = South African History Online|publisher = }}</ref>\n\n=== 1994 and the Western Cape post-apartheid ===\nIn 1994, at the introduction of the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] and the [[South African general election, 1994|first non-racial election]], South Africa's original provinces and [[bantustan]]s were abolished and [[Provinces of South Africa|nine new provinces]] were established. The former [[Cape Province]] was divided into the Western Cape, [[Northern Cape]], Eastern Cape and part of [[North West (South African province)|North West]].\n\nIn the 1994 election the Western Cape was one of two provinces that did not elect an [[African National Congress]] (ANC) provincial government (the other being [[KwaZulu-Natal]]). The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) won 53% of the votes and 23 seats in the 42-seat provincial legislature, and [[Hernus Kriel]], a former Minister of Law and Order, was elected [[Premier of the Western Cape|Premier]]. He resigned in 1998 and was replaced by [[Gerald Morkel]].\n\nThe [[South African general election, 1999|1999 election]] marked the beginning of a period of great turbulence in Western Cape politics. No party achieved an absolute majority in the provincial parliament, as the ANC won 18 seats while the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] (NNP), successor to the NP, won 17. The NNP went into coalition with the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]] (DP), which won 5 seats, to form a government, and Morkel remained Premier. In 2000 the DP and the NNP formalised their coalition by forming the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA).\n\nIn 2001, however, the NNP broke with the DA over the removal of [[Peter Marais]] from office as [[Mayor of Cape Town]] by DA leader [[Tony Leon]]. The NNP instead went into coalition with the ANC; Gerald Morkel, who was opposed to the split, resigned as Premier and was replaced by Peter Marais. In 2002 Marais resigned as Premier due to a sexual harassment scandal, and was replaced by NNP leader [[Marthinus van Schalkwyk]]. During the [[2003 South African floor-crossing window period|2003 floor-crossing period]] four members of the provincial parliament crossed to the ANC, giving it an absolute majority of 22 seats in the 42-seat house. However, the ANC remained in coalition with the NNP and van Schalkwyk remained as Premier.\n\nIn the [[South African general election, 2004|2004 election]] there was again no absolute winner in the provincial parliament; this time the ANC won 19 seats, the DA won 12, and the NNP won 5. The ANC-NNP coalition continued in power, but van Schalkwyk took up a ministerial post in the national cabinet and was replaced as Premier by the ANC's [[Ebrahim Rasool]]. The NNP was finally dissolved after the [[2005 South African floor-crossing window period|2005 floor-crossing period]] and its members joined the ANC, again giving that party an absolute majority of 24 seats. In the [[2007 South African floor-crossing window period|2007 floor-crossing period]] the ANC gained a further three members of the provincial parliament. In 2008 Rasool resigned as Premier due to internal party politics, and was replaced by [[Lynne Brown]].\n\nThe [[South African general election, 2009|2009 election]] marked a significant change in Western Cape politics, as the Democratic Alliance won 51% of the votes and an absolute majority of 22 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 31% of the vote. The DA leader [[Helen Zille]] was elected Premier. In 2010 the [[Independent Democrats]], which had won 3 seats with 5% of the vote, merged with the DA. In the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 election]] the DA won 59% of the votes and an absolute majority of 26 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 32% of the vote.

It had won   24 seats with 55%. Helen Zille was term-limited and the DA premier candidate [[Alan Winde]] succeeded her. The ANC also lost support. It had received 12 seats with 28% support, its lowest showing since 1994.

The provincial parliament is responsible for legislating within its responsibilities as set out by the [[Constitution of South Africa|national constitution]]; these responsibilities include agriculture, education, environment, health services, housing, language policies, tourism, trade, and welfare.\n\nThe provincial parliament also elects the [[Premier of the Western Cape]] to lead the provincial executive. Since 2019 the Premiership has been held by [[Alan Winde]], former Provincial Minister of Community Safety. The Premier appoints ten members of the provincial legislature to serve as a cabinet of ministers, overseeing the departments of the provincial government.

Other routes are the \"R\" roads which connect the smaller towns. All major roads are tarred with major rural gravel roads well maintained. Limited access motorways are limited to the Cape Metropolitan Area, Winelands and Garden Route, however due to the low population density of the remainder of the province, the highways remain efficient and high-speed, except during peak holiday travel seasons, when travel can be slow-going in places due to heavy traffic. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nTelecommunications in the province are highly sophisticated.

Major cities and towns have access to mobile internet speeds in excess of 21 Mbit/s (HSDPA+).

Africa]], situated on the south-western coast of the country. It is the [[List of South African provinces by area|fourth largest of the nine provinces]] with an area of {{convert|129449|km2}}, and [[List of South African provinces by population|the third most populous]], with an estimated 6.6 million inhabitants in 2018.<ref> Statistics South Africa, 2018. Mid- year population estimates. Available: http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0302/P03022018.pdf</ref> About two-thirds of these inhabitants live in the metropolitan area of [[Cape Town]], which is also the provincial capital.

The Roggeveld and Nuweveld mountains are part of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] (see diagrams below). The other mountain ranges belong to the [[Cape Fold Belt]], also shown in the diagrams below. The Western Cape's inland boundary lies for the most part at the foot of the Great Escarpment.]]\n[[File:SW-NE geological cross section through South Africa.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|An approximate SW-NE cross section through South Africa with the [[Cape Peninsula]] (with [[Table Mountain]]) on left, and northeastern [[KwaZulu-Natal]] on the right. Diagrammatic and only roughly to scale. It shows the major geological structures (coloured layers) that dominate the southern and eastern parts of the country, as well as the relationship between the Central Plateau, the [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Fold Mountains]], and the [[Drakensberg]] escarpment. The significance and origin of the geological layers can be found under the headings \"[[Karoo Supergroup]]\" and \"[[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Supergroup]]\".]]\n[[File:NS cross section Southern Cape.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|A diagrammatic 400 km north-south crosssection through the southern portion of the country at approximately 21\u00b0 30\u2019 E (i.e. near [[Calitzdorp]] in the Little Karoo), showing the relationship between the [[Cape Fold Mountains]] (and their geological structure) and the [[Karoo Supergroup|geology of the Little and Great Karoo]], as well as the position of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]]. The colour code for the geological layers is the same as those used in the diagram above. The heavy black line flanked by opposing arrows is the fault that runs for nearly 300 km along the southern edge of the [[Swartberg]] Mountains. The Swartberg Mountain range owes some of its great height to upliftment along this fault line. The subsurface structures are not to scale.]]\nThe '''Western Cape Province''' is roughly L-shaped, extending north and east from the [[Cape of Good Hope]], in the southwestern corner of South Africa. It stretches about {{convert|400|km}} northwards along the Atlantic coast and about {{convert|500|km|-2}} eastwards along the South African south coast ([[Southern Indian Ocean]]). It is bordered on the north by the [[Northern Cape]] and on the east by the [[Eastern Cape]]. The total land area of the province is {{convert|129462|km2}},<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|9}} about 10.6% of the country's total. It is roughly the size of [[England]] or the [[State of Louisiana]]. Its capital city and largest city is [[Cape Town]], and some other major cities include [[Stellenbosch]], [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]], [[Paarl]], and [[George, South Africa|George]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] are popular coastal tourism areas.\n\nThe Western Cape is the '''southernmost region of the African continent''' with [[Cape Agulhas]] as its southernmost point, only 3800&nbsp;km from the Antarctic coastline. The coastline varies from sandy between capes, to rocky to steep and mountainous in places. The only natural harbour is [[Saldanha Bay]] on the west coast, about 140&nbsp;km north of Cape Town. However a lack of fresh water in the region meant that it has only recently been used as a harbour. The province's main harbour was built in [[Table Bay]], which in its natural state was fully exposed to the northwesterly storms that bring rain to the province in winter, as well as the almost uninterrupted dry southeasterly winds in summer. But fresh water coming off [[Table Mountain]] and [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] allowed the early European settlers to build Cape Town on the shores of this less than satisfactory anchorage.\n\nThe province is '''topographically''' exceptionally diverse. Most of the province falls within the [[Cape Fold Belt]], a set of nearly parallel ranges of [[Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|sandstone folded mountains]] of [[Cambrian]]-[[Ordovician]] age (the age of the rocks is from 510 to about 330&nbsp;million years ago; their folding into mountains occurred about 350 to about 270&nbsp;million years ago).<ref name=compton>Compton, J.S.

This region of the Province is generally arid and hilly with a [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|prominent escarpment]] that runs close to the Province's most inland boundary.\n\nThe '''Escarpment''' marks the southwestern edge of [[Geography of South Africa#Topographical Divisions|South Africa's central plateau]] (see the middle and bottom diagrams on the left).<ref name=McCarthy /><ref name= \"Altas\">Atlas of Southern Africa.

The [[Geography of South Africa#Namaqualand|West Coast]] and [[Karoo#Divisions|Little Karoo]] are [[semi-arid]] regions and are typified by many species of succulents and drought-resistant shrubs and acacia trees. The [[Garden Route]] on the south coast (between the [[Outeniqua Mountains]] and the [[Southern Indian Ocean]]) is extremely lush, with temperate rainforest (or [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Afromontane Forest]]) covering many areas adjacent to the coast, in the deep river valleys and along the southern slopes of the Outeniqua mountain range. Typical species are hardwoods of exceptional height, such as [[Podocarpus|Yellowwood]], [[Stinkwood]] and [[Ironwood]] trees.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Western Cape is also climatologically diverse, with many distinct micro- and macroclimates created by the varied topography and the influence of the surrounding ocean currents. These are the warm [[Agulhas Current]] which flows southwards along South Africa's east coast, and the cold [[Benguela Current]] which is an upwelling current from the depths of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] along South Africa's west coast.<ref name=Branch>Branch, M & Branch G.

Most of the province is considered to have a [[Mediterranean climate]] with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Both the [[Karoo|Great Karoo and Little Karoo]], in the interior, have an [[arid]] to [[semi-arid]] climate with cold, frosty winters and hot summers with occasional [[thunderstorms]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] on the south coast have a maritime climate with cool, moist winters and mild, moist summers. [[Mossel Bay]] in the Garden Route is considered to have the second mildest climate worldwide after Hawaii.\n\nThunderstorms are generally rare in the province (except in the [[Karoo]]) with most precipitation being of a [[Cold front|frontal]] or [[orographic]] nature. Extremes of heat and cold are common inland, but rare near the coast. Snow is a common winter occurrence on the [[Cape Fold Belt|Western Cape Mountains]] occasionally reaching down into the more inland valleys. Otherwise, frost is relatively rare in coastal areas and many of the heavily cultivated valleys.\n\n* [[Cape Town International Airport]] averages: January maximum: 26&nbsp;\u00b0C (min: 16&nbsp;\u00b0C), July maximum: 18&nbsp;\u00b0C (min: 7&nbsp;\u00b0C), annual rainfall: 515mm\n* [[Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden]], [[Cape Town]] annual rainfall: 1395mm\n* [[George, Western Cape|George]] averages: January maximum: 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (min: 15&nbsp;\u00b0C), July maximum: 19&nbsp;\u00b0C (min: 7&nbsp;\u00b0C), annual rainfall: 715mm\n* [[Laingsburg, Western Cape|Laingsburg, on the N1 highway in the Great Karoo]] (coordinates:  Lat: S33.20\u00b0, Long: E20.85\u00b0) annual rainfall: 150&nbsp;mm, summer daytime temperatures exceeding 30&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n===Cities and towns===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n{{see also|List of cities and towns in the Western Cape}}\n[[File:Road map of the Western Cape with towns.svg|right|thumb|Towns and main roads in the Western Cape]]\n\n'''Population over 3 million:'''\n* [[Cape Town]] : 4,005,015\n\n'''Population 100,000\u20131,000,000:'''\n* [[Paarl]] * [[Wellington, Western Cape|Wellington]]  : 179, 319\n* [[George, Western Cape|George]] : 122,291\n* [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]] : 103,073\n\n'''Population 50,000\u2013100,000:'''\n{{div col |colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]]\n* [[Knysna]]\n* [[Mossel Bay]]\n* [[Oudtshoorn]]\n* [[Stellenbosch]]\n\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Population 10,000\u201350,000:'''\n{{div col |colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Ashton, Western Cape|Ashton]]\n* [[Beaufort West]]\n* [[Bredasdorp]]\n* [[Caledon, Western Cape|Caledon]]\n* [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]]\n* [[Darling, Western Cape|Darling]]\n* [[De Doorns]]\n* [[Dysselsdorp]]\n* [[Fisantekraal]]\n* [[Franschhoek]]\n* [[Gansbaai]]\n* [[Gordon's Bay]]\n* [[Grabouw]]\n* [[Great Brak River (town)|Great Brak River]]\n* [[Hermanus]]\n* [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]]\n* [[Melkbosstrand]]\n* [[Montagu, Western Cape|Montagu]]\n* [[Moorreesburg]]\n* [[Piketberg]]\n* [[Plettenberg Bay]]\n* [[Riversdale, Western Cape|Riversdale]]\n* [[Robertson, Western Cape|Robertson]]\n* [[Saldanha, Western Cape|Saldanha]]\n* [[St Helena Bay]]\n* [[Swellendam]]\n* [[Velddrif]]\n* [[Villiersdorp]]\n* [[Vredenburg]]\n* [[Vredendal]]\n* [[Wolseley, Western Cape|Wolseley]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Population 5,000\u201310,000:'''\n{{div col |colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Albertinia, Western Cape|Albertinia]]\n* [[Bonnievale, Western Cape|Bonnievale]]\n* [[Botrivier]]\n* [[Citrusdal]]\n* [[Clanwilliam, Western Cape|Clanwilliam]]\n* [[Genadendal]]\n* [[Hawston]]\n* [[Heidelberg, Western Cape|Heidelberg]]\n* [[Hopefield, Western Cape|Hopefield]]\n* [[Klapmuts]]\n* [[Klawer]]\n* [[Kleinmond]]\n* [[Ladismith]]\n* [[Laingsburg, Western Cape|Laingsburg]]\n* [[Lamberts Bay]]\n* [[Langebaan]]\n* [[Lutzville]]\n* [[Mamre, Western Cape|Mamre]]\n* [[Murraysburg]]\n* [[Onrusrivier]]\n* [[Porterville, Western Cape|Porterville]]\n* [[Prince Albert, Western Cape|Prince Albert]]\n* [[Prince Alfred Hamlet]]\n* [[Riviersonderend]]\n* [[Saron, Western Cape|Saron]]\n* [[Sedgefield, Western Cape|Sedgefield]]\n* [[Touws River (town)|Touws River]]\n* [[Tulbagh]]\n* [[Vanrhynsdorp]]\n* [[Wilderness, Western Cape|Wilderness]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Political history==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Contribution of the Western Cape in the National Youth Uprisings ===\nThe [[Black Consciousness Movement]] (BCM) was a grassroots anti-Apartheid activist movement that emerged in South Africa in the mid-1960s out of the political vacuum created by the jailing and banning of the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress leadership after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960. The BCM represented a social movement for political consciousness.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Ideology of the Black Consciousness Movement |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/ideology-black-consciousness-movement |website=South African History Online |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1968, the [[South African Student Organization]] (SASO) was formed at a conference held in Marianhill, Natal. The conference was exclusively attended by Black students. After its launch, SASO became the medium through which black consciousness ideology spread to schools and other university campuses across the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/cape-town/black-consciousness-and-student-revolt-cape|title = Black Consciousness and Student Revolt in the Cape|date = |accessdate = 16 June 2014|website = South African History Online|publisher = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, the then South African Minister of Bantu Education and Development, MC Botha, constituted the imposition of using [[Afrikaans]] as a medium of instruction in black schools, effective with students in Grade 7 (Standard 5) upwards.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Afrikaans Medium Decree |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-afrikaans-medium-decree-43416 |website=ThoughtCo |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref> As early as March 1976, students began passive resistance against Afrikaans, fueling the outbreak of the [[Soweto uprising|Soweto Uprising]] on 16 June 1976.

Poster parades by UWC and Black Power Salute marches by UCT was broken by the police, resulting in 73 students getting arrested and detained at [[Victor Verster Prison]], near Paarl.\n\nOn 1 September 1976, the unrest spread to the city of Cape Town itself. Approximately 2000 black students from Western Cape townships, namely Langa, Nyanga and Gugulethu, matched the Cape Town central business district (CBD). Coloured students also contributed to the protests by peacefully marching to the city, but were blockaded by the police in the CBD. The protests turned violent when coloured students started burning schools, libraries and a magistrate's court in support of the student revolt. Thereafter, 200,000 coloured workers partook in a two-day strike staying away from work in the Cape Town area.\n\nAccording to a report by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), the Western Cape experienced the second highest number of deaths and casualties associated with the 1976 uprising protests.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/cape-town/black-consciousness-and-student-revolt-cape|title = Black consciousness and student revolt in Cape Town|date = |accessdate = 14 June 2014|website = South African History Online|publisher = }}</ref>\n\n=== 1994 and the Western Cape post-apartheid ===\nIn 1994, at the introduction of the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] and the [[South African general election, 1994|first non-racial election]], South Africa's original provinces and [[bantustan]]s were abolished and [[Provinces of South Africa|nine new provinces]] were established. The former [[Cape Province]] was divided into the Western Cape, [[Northern Cape]], Eastern Cape and part of [[North West (South African province)|North West]].\n\nIn the 1994 election the Western Cape was one of two provinces that did not elect an [[African National Congress]] (ANC) provincial government (the other being [[KwaZulu-Natal]]). The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) won 53% of the votes and 23 seats in the 42-seat provincial legislature, and [[Hernus Kriel]], a former Minister of Law and Order, was elected [[Premier of the Western Cape|Premier]]. He resigned in 1998 and was replaced by [[Gerald Morkel]].\n\nThe [[South African general election, 1999|1999 election]] marked the beginning of a period of great turbulence in Western Cape politics. No party achieved an absolute majority in the provincial parliament, as the ANC won 18 seats while the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] (NNP), successor to the NP, won 17. The NNP went into coalition with the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]] (DP), which won 5 seats, to form a government, and Morkel remained Premier. In 2000 the DP and the NNP formalised their coalition by forming the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA).\n\nIn 2001, however, the NNP broke with the DA over the removal of [[Peter Marais]] from office as [[Mayor of Cape Town]] by DA leader [[Tony Leon]]. The NNP instead went into coalition with the ANC; Gerald Morkel, who was opposed to the split, resigned as Premier and was replaced by Peter Marais. In 2002 Marais resigned as Premier due to a sexual harassment scandal, and was replaced by NNP leader [[Marthinus van Schalkwyk]]. During the [[2003 South African floor-crossing window period|2003 floor-crossing period]] four members of the provincial parliament crossed to the ANC, giving it an absolute majority of 22 seats in the 42-seat house. However, the ANC remained in coalition with the NNP and van Schalkwyk remained as Premier.\n\nIn the [[South African general election, 2004|2004 election]] there was again no absolute winner in the provincial parliament; this time the ANC won 19 seats, the DA won 12, and the NNP won 5. The ANC-NNP coalition continued in power, but van Schalkwyk took up a ministerial post in the national cabinet and was replaced as Premier by the ANC's [[Ebrahim Rasool]]. The NNP was finally dissolved after the [[2005 South African floor-crossing window period|2005 floor-crossing period]] and its members joined the ANC, again giving that party an absolute majority of 24 seats. In the [[2007 South African floor-crossing window period|2007 floor-crossing period]] the ANC gained a further three members of the provincial parliament. In 2008 Rasool resigned as Premier due to internal party politics, and was replaced by [[Lynne Brown]].\n\nThe [[South African general election, 2009|2009 election]] marked a significant change in Western Cape politics, as the Democratic Alliance won 51% of the votes and an absolute majority of 22 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 31% of the vote. The DA leader [[Helen Zille]] was elected Premier. In 2010 the [[Independent Democrats]], which had won 3 seats with 5% of the vote, merged with the DA. In the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 election]] the DA won 59% of the votes and an absolute majority of 26 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 32% of the vote.

It had won   24 seats with 55%. Helen Zille was term-limited and the DA premier candidate [[Alan Winde]] succeeded her. The ANC also lost support. It had received 12 seats with 28% support, its lowest showing since 1994.

The provincial parliament is responsible for legislating within its responsibilities as set out by the [[Constitution of South Africa|national constitution]]; these responsibilities include agriculture, education, environment, health services, housing, language policies, tourism, trade, and welfare.\n\nThe provincial parliament also elects the [[Premier of the Western Cape]] to lead the provincial executive. Since 2019 the Premiership has been held by [[Alan Winde]], former Provincial Minister of Community Safety. The Premier appoints ten members of the provincial legislature to serve as a cabinet of ministers, overseeing the departments of the provincial government.

In areas where HSDPA+ is not available, networks make provisions for HSDPA, 3G, EDGE or finally GPRS if demand does not warrant higher speed investment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Western Cape population density map.svg|thumb|right|Population density in the Western Cape\n{{columns\n|col1 =\n{{legend|#ffffcc|&lt;1 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#ffeda0|1\u20133 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fed976|3\u201310 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#feb24c|10\u201330 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fd8d3c|30\u2013100 /km\u00b2}}\n|col2=\n{{legend|#fc4e2a|100\u2013300 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#e31a1c|300\u20131000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#bc0026|1000\u20133000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#800026|&gt;3000 /km\u00b2}}}}]]\n\n[[File:Western Cape 2001 dominant language map.svg|thumb|Dominant home languages in the Western Cape\n{{columns |col1=\n{{legend|#8dd3c7|[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffb3|[[South African English|English]]}}\n{{legend|#fb8072|[[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]}}\n|col2=\n{{legend|#fccde5|[[Tswana language|Tswana]]}}\n{{legend|#d0d0d0|No language dominant}}}}]]\n\nThe [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 Census]] recorded the population of the Western Cape as 5,822,734 people living in 1,634,000 households.<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|8, 63}} As the province covers an area of {{convert|129462|km2}},<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|9}} the population density was {{convert|45.0|PD/km2}} and the household density {{convert|12.6|/km2}}.\n\n49% of the people of the Western Cape described themselves as \"[[Coloured]]\", while 33% described themselves as \"[[Black African]]\", 17% as \"[[White South African|White]]\", and 1% as \"[[Indian South African|Indian]] or [[Asian South African|Asian]]\".<ref name=\"cib2011\" />{{rp|21}} [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] is the plurality language, spoken as the [[first language]] of 50% of the province's population.
