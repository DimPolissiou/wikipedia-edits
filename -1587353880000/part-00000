It was released on 26 May 2014 through [[Nuclear Blast]]. The album is named after the [[Rune Poems]] and is the band's first to feature Kristan Dawson, who replaced founding member Mehdi Vismara as Bury Tomorrow's lead guitarist in 2013. In June 2014, ''Runes'' reached number 34 on the UK charts and was also number 1 on the UK Rock Chart.\n\n==Background and promotion==\nThe band felt pressure during the recording of ''Runes'' in it being a follow up to ''The Union of Crowns''.<ref name=\"Metal Hammer 253\">{{cite journal |last= |first= |date= February 2014 |title= Tomorrow Never Dies |journal= [[Metal Hammer]] |issue= 253 |page = |publisher= [[Team Rock]] |editor= Alexander Milas | location= London, United Kingdom |issn=1422-9048}}</ref> At the end of the recording process Daniel Winter-Bates reflected positively on ''Runes'' saying that although this was the first time the band had recorded an album being a part of a record label, since he didn't think about it, it didn't affect his performance.

Writer for All About the Rock, Zack Slabbert said \"If you're a metalcore fan then this is another album to add to your collection. It's filled with awesome breakdowns and the guitar riffs on this album are so catchy and get stuck in your head instantly.\"<ref name=aatr /> ''Already Heard'' rated the album 4.5 out of 5 and said: \"It is a record that truly demonstrates why British metalcore is in the strong position it's currently in. Bury Tomorrow have confidently grown as a band on ''Runes'', an album that is thoroughly compelling and powerful. It deserves all the praise it gets. Not an album to be ignored.\"<ref name=\"alreadyheard\"/> Tony Bliss from ''Dead Press!'' rated the album positively calling it: \"What is perhaps most thrilling with ''Runes'' is that the record plays entirely to the strengths of Bury Tomorrow and makes no attempt to progress too far from their established expertise. Fine tuning, sharpening and polishing, this is a release which through embracing the explosive power of metalcore done well, is inevitably bound to catapult Bury Tomorrow into the stratosphere. Heavyweights take note, these erstwhile upstarts are soon to stand tall beside you.\"<ref name=\"deadpress\"/> ''[[Metal Hammer|Louder Sound]]'' gave the album a slightly negative review and stated: \"At its worst, ''Runes'' feels nakedly derivative; Dani Winter-Bates's roar is a dead ringer for Parkway Drive's Winston McCall, while Jason Cameron's polite croon owes more than a little to Alexisonfire's Dallas Green. They are capable of richly textured, expressive metalcore but those moments feel few and far between here.\"<ref name=\"loudersound\"/> Will Stevenson of ''Rock Sins'' rated the album 6.5 out of 10 and said: \"''Runes'' isn't a bad album; indeed, the songs themselves are all decent enough, and if you're already a fan of the band it's definitely worth a listen. Unfortunately, there are no mega choruses and no beatdowns that make you want to punch lions in the face, certainly not in the vein of ''The Union of Crowns''. Put simply, there's just no 'Knight Life' on this album.

Writer for All About the Rock, Zack Slabbert said \"If you're a metalcore fan then this is another album to add to your collection. It's filled with awesome breakdowns and the guitar riffs on this album are so catchy and get stuck in your head instantly.\"<ref name=aatr /> ''Already Heard'' rated the album 4.5 out of 5 and said: \"It is a record that truly demonstrates why British metalcore is in the strong position it's currently in. Bury Tomorrow have confidently grown as a band on ''Runes'', an album that is thoroughly compelling and powerful. It deserves all the praise it gets. Not an album to be ignored.\"<ref name=\"alreadyheard\"/> Tony Bliss from ''Dead Press!'' rated the album positively calling it: \"What is perhaps most thrilling with ''Runes'' is that the record plays entirely to the strengths of Bury Tomorrow and makes no attempt to progress too far from their established expertise. Fine tuning, sharpening and polishing, this is a release which through embracing the explosive power of metalcore done well, is inevitably bound to catapult Bury Tomorrow into the stratosphere. Heavyweights take note, these erstwhile upstarts are soon to stand tall beside you.\"<ref name=\"deadpress\"/> ''[[Metal Hammer|Louder Sound]]'' gave the album a slightly negative review and stated: \"At its worst, ''Runes'' feels nakedly derivative; Dani Winter-Bates's roar is a dead ringer for Parkway Drive's Winston McCall, while Jason Cameron's polite croon owes more than a little to Alexisonfire's Dallas Green. They are capable of richly textured, expressive metalcore but those moments feel few and far between here.\"<ref name=\"loudersound\"/> Will Stevenson of ''Rock Sins'' rated the album 6.5 out of 10 and said: \"''Runes'' isn't a bad album; indeed, the songs themselves are all decent enough, and if you're already a fan of the band it's definitely worth a listen. Unfortunately, there are no mega choruses and no beatdowns that make you want to punch lions in the face, certainly not in the vein of ''The Union of Crowns''. Put simply, there's just no 'Knight Life' on this album. In a world where Architects just released the superb ''Lost Forever // Lost Together'', why would you spend your time on this generic effort?\"<ref name=\"Rock Sins\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Runes'' entered the Official UK Chart at number 34.

They used a system that is termed as an ''[[abugida]]'', or an alphasyllabary. It was similar to the [[Baybayin|Tagalog]] and [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] scripts, where each character represented a consonant-vowel, or CV, sequence. The Ilocano version, however, was the first to designate coda consonants with a diacritic mark \u2013 a cross or [[virama]] \u2013 shown in the ''Doctrina Cristiana'' of 1621, one of the earliest surviving Ilokano publications. Before the addition of the virama, writers had no way to designate coda consonants. The reader, on the other hand, had to guess whether the vowel was read or not, due to this vowels \"e\" and \"i\" are interchangeable and letters \"o\" and \"u\", for instance \"tendera\" and tindira\" (shop-assistant)\n\n=== Modern ===\nIn recent times, there have been two systems in use: The \"Spanish\" system and the \"Tagalog\" system. In the ''Spanish'' system words of Spanish origin kept their spellings. Native words, on the other hand, conformed to the Spanish rules of spelling. Most older generation of Ilocanos use the ''Spanish'' system.\n\nIn the system based on that of Tagalog there is more of a phoneme-to-letter correspondence, and better reflects the actual pronunciation of the word.{{efn|However, there are notable exceptions. The reverse is true for the vowel {{IPA|/u/}} where it has two representations in native words. The vowel {{IPA|/u/}} is written '''o''' when it appears in the last syllable of the word or of the root, for example '''kitaemonto''' /ki.ta.e.mun.tu/. In addition, '''e''' represents two vowels in the southern dialect: {{IPA|[\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[]}}.}} The letters ''ng'' constitute a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] and counts as a single letter, following ''n'' in alphabetization. As a result, '''numo''' ''humility'' appears before '''ngalngal''' ''to chew'' in newer dictionaries. Words of foreign origin, most notably those from Spanish, need to be changed in spelling to better reflect Ilocano phonology. Words of English origin may or may not conform to this orthography. A prime example using this system is the weekly magazine ''[[Bannawag]]''.\n\n=== Samples of the two systems ===\nThe following are two versions of the Lord's Prayer. The one on the left is written using the Spanish-based orthography, while the one on the right uses the Tagalog-based system.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n: ''Amami, \u00f1ga addaca sadi la\u00f1git,''\n: ''Madaydayao coma ti Naganmo.''\n: ''Umay cuma ti pagariam.''\n: ''Maaramid cuma ti pagayatam''\n: ''Cas sadi la\u00f1git casta met ditoy daga.''\n: ''Itedmo cadacam ita ti taraonmi iti inaldao.''\n: ''Quet pacaoanennacami cadaguiti ut-utangmi,''\n: ''A cas met panamacaoanmi''\n: ''Cadaguiti nacautang cadacami.''\n: ''Quet dinacam iyeg iti pannacasulisog,''\n: ''No di quet isalacannacami iti daques.''\n\n{{col-2}}\n: ''Amami, nga addaka sadi langit,''\n: ''Madaydayaw koma ti Naganmo.''\n: ''Umay koma ti pagariam.''\n: ''Maaramid koma ti pagayatam''\n: ''Kas sadi langit kasta met ditoy daga.''\n: ''Itedmo kadakami iti taraonmi iti inaldaw.''\n: ''Ket pakawanennakami kadagiti ut-utangmi,''\n: ''A kas met panamakawanmi''\n: ''Kadagiti nakautang kadakami.''\n: ''Ket dinakam iyeg iti pannakasulisog,''\n: ''No di ket isalakannakami iti dakes.''{{col-end}}\n\n== Ilocano and education ==\nWith the implementation by the Spanish of the [[Bilingual Education]] System of 1897, Ilocano, together with the other seven [[Philippine languages|major languages]] (those that have at least a million speakers), was allowed to be used as a medium of instruction until the second grade.

It is the primary medium of instruction from kindergarten to grade 3 (except for the Filipino and English subjects) and is also a separate subject from grade 1 to grade 3. Thereafter, English and Filipino are introduced as mediums of instructions.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main article|Ilokano literature}}\n[[File:10 commandments in Ilokano.JPG|thumb|right|The ten commandments in Ilocano.]]\nIlocano animistic past offers a rich background in folklore, mythology and superstition (see [[Religion in the Philippines]]). There are many stories of good and malevolent spirits and beings. Its creation mythology centers on the giants Aran and her husband [[Angalo]], and Namarsua (the Creator).\n\nThe epic story ''[[Biag ni Lam-ang]]'' (The Life of Lam-ang) is undoubtedly one of the few indigenous stories from the Philippines that survived colonialism, although much of it is now acculturated and shows many foreign elements in the retelling. It reflects values important to traditional Ilokano society; it is a hero's journey steeped in courage, loyalty, pragmatism, honor, and ancestral and familial bonds.\n\nIlocano culture revolves around life rituals, festivities and oral history. These were celebrated in songs (''kankanta''), dances (''salsala''), poems (''dandaniw''), riddles (''burburtia''), proverbs (''pagsasao''), literary verbal jousts called ''bucanegan'' (named after the writer [[Pedro Bucaneg]], and is the equivalent of the [[Balagtasan]] of the [[Tagalogs]]) and epic stories.\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n=== Segmental ===\n\n==== Vowels ====\nModern Ilocano has two dialects, which are differentiated only by the way the letter '''''e''''' is pronounced. In the '''Amianan''' (''Northern'') dialect, there exist only five vowels while the '''Abagatan''' (''Southern'') dialect employs six.\n\n* Amianan: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}\n* Abagatan: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u026f/}}\n\nReduplicate vowels are not slurred together, but voiced separately with an intervening glottal stop:\n* saan: {{IPA|/sa.\u0294an/}} ''no''\n* siit: {{IPA|/si.\u0294it/}} ''thorn''\n\nThe letter in '''bold''' is the graphic (written) representation of the vowel.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto:\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Ilokano vowel chart'''\n! ||[[Front vowel|Front]]||[[Central vowel|Central]]||[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n|[[Close vowel|Close]]\n|'''i''' {{IPA|/i/}}\n|\n| '''u'''/'''o''' {{IPA|/u/}}\n'''e''' {{IPA|/\u026f/}}\n|-\n|[[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|'''e''' {{IPA|/\u025b/}}\n|\n|'''o''' {{IPA|/o/}}\n|-\n|[[Open vowel|Open]]\n|\n|'''a''' {{IPA|/a/}}\n|\n|}\n\nFor a better rendition of vowel distribution, please refer to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet#Vowels|IPA Vowel Chart]].\n\nUnstressed /a/ is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0250]}} in all positions except final syllables, like ''mad\u00ed'' {{IPA|[m\u0250\u02c8di]}} (cannot be) but ''ngiwat'' (mouth) is pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u014biwat]}}.\n\nAlthough the modern (Tagalog) writing system is largely phonetic, there are some notable conventions.\n\n===== O/U and I/E =====\nIn native [[morphemes]], the [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} is written differently depending on the syllable. If the vowel occurs in the [[ultima (linguistics)|ultima]] of the morpheme, it is written '''o'''; elsewhere, '''u'''.\n\n '''Example:'''\n     Root: '''luto''' ''cook''\n           '''agluto''' ''to cook''\n           '''lutuen''' ''to cook (something)'' '''example:lutuen dayta'''\n\nInstances such as '''masapulmonto''', ''You will manage to find it, to need it'', are still consistent. Note that '''masapulmonto''' is, in fact, three morphemes: '''masapul''' (verb base), '''-mo''' (pronoun) and '''-(n)to''' (future particle). An exception to this rule, however, is '''laud''' {{IPA|/la.\u0294ud/}} (''west''). Also, '''u''' in final stressed syllables can be pronounced [o], like {{IPA|[d\u0250.\u02c8nom]}} for '''danum''' (''water'').\n\nThe two vowels are not highly differentiated in native words due to fact that {{IPA|/o/}} was an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/u/}} in the history of the language. In words of foreign origin, notably Spanish, they are [[phonemic]].\n\n '''Example:'''\n     '''uso''' ''use''\n     '''oso''' ''bear''\n\nUnlike '''u''' and '''o''', '''i''' and '''e''' are not allophones, but '''i''' in final stressed syllables in words ending in consonants can be {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, like ''ub\u00edng'' {{IPA|[\u028a.\u02c8b\u025b\u014b]}} (''child'').\n\nThe two closed vowels become [[Semivowel|glides]] when followed by another vowel. The [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} becomes {{IPA|[w]}} before another vowel; and the [[close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|[j]}}.\n\n '''Example:'''\n     '''kuarta''' {{IPA|/kwa\u027e.ta/}} ''money''\n     '''paria''' {{IPA|/pa\u027e.ja/}} ''bitter melon''\n\nIn addition, [[Dental consonant|dental]]/[[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] consonants become [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] before {{IPA|/i/}}. (See [[#consonants|Consonants]] below).\n\nUnstressed /i/ and /u/ are pronounced {{IPA|[\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[\u028a]}} except in final syllables, like ''pint\u00e1s'' (beauty) {{IPA|[p\u026an.\u02c8tas]}} and ''but\u00e9ng'' (fear) {{IPA|[b\u028a.\u02c8t\u025b\u014b]}} but ''bangir'' (other side) and ''parabur'' (''grace'') are pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8ba.\u014bi\u027e]}} and {{IPA|[p\u0250.\u02c8\u027ea.bu\u027e]}}.\n\n===== Pronunciation of {{angbr|e}} =====\nThe letter {{angbr|e}} represents two vowels in the non-nuclear dialects (areas outside the Ilocos provinces) {{IPA|[\u025b]}} in words of foreign origin and {{IPA|[\u026f]}} in native words, and only one in the nuclear dialects of the Ilocos provinces, {{IPA|[\u025b]}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+caption|Realization of {{angbr|e}}\n!Word||Gloss||Origin||Nuclear||Non-nuclear\n|-\n|'''keddeng'''\n|''assign''\n|Native\n|{{IPA|[k\u025bd.d\u025b\u014b]}}\n|{{IPA|[k\u026fd.d\u026f\u014b]}}\n|-\n|'''elepante'''\n|''elephant''\n|Spanish\n|{{IPA|[\u0294\u025b.l\u025b.pan.t\u025b]}}\n|{{IPA|[\u0294\u025b.l\u025b.pan.t\u025b]}}\n|}\n\n==== Diphthongs ====\n\nDiphthongs are combination of a vowel and /i/ or /u/. In the orthography, the secondary vowels (underlying /i/ or /u/) are written with their corresponding glide, '''y''' or '''w''', respectively. Of all the possible combinations, only /aj/ or /ej/, /iw/, /aw/ and /uj/ occur. In the [[orthography]], vowels in sequence such as '''uo''' and '''ai''', do not coalesce into a diphthong, rather, they are pronounced with an intervening glottal stop, for example, '''buok''' ''hair'' {{IPA|/b\u028a.\u0294uk/}}  and '''dait''' ''sew'' {{IPA|/da.\u0294it/}}.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+Diphthongs\n!Diphthong||Orthography||Example\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|/au/\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|aw\n|'''kabaw''' \"''senile''\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|/iu/\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|iw\n|'''iliw''' \"''home sick''\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|/ai/\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|ay\n|'''maysa''' \"''one''\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|/ei/{{efn|The diphthong /ei/ is a variant of /ai/.}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|ey\n|'''idiey''' \"''there''\" (Regional variant.

Other occurrences are in words of  Spanish and English origin. Examples are ''reyna'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u027eei.na/}} (from Spanish ''reina'', ''queen'') and ''treyner'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u027eei.n\u025b\u027e/}} (''trainer''). The diphthongs {{IPA|/oi/}} and {{IPA|/ui/}} may be interchanged since {{IPA|/o/}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/u/}} in final syllables. Thus, ''ap\u00fay'' (fire) may be pronounced {{IPA|/\u0250.\u02c8pui/}} and ''baboy'' (pig) may be pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8ba.bui/}}.\n\n==== Consonants ====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"75%\"\n!colspan=2|\n![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n![[Dental consonant|Dental]]/<br />[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2 | '''[[Stop consonant|Stops]]'''\n|'''Voiceless'''\n|'''p'''\n|'''t'''\n|\n|'''k'''\n|  '''(#{{efn|The '#' represents the start of the word boundary}}{{IPA link|\u2205}}{{efn|the symbol '{{IPA|\u2205}}' represents ''zero'' or an absence of a phoneme.}} {{IPA|V/\u2205V\u2205/C-V}})'''{{IPA|[\u0294]}}{{efn|Ilocano syllables always begin with a consonant onset. Words that begin with a vowel actually begin with a glottal stop ('{{IPA|[\u0294]}}'), but it is not shown in the orthography. When the glottal stop occurs within a word there are two ways it is represented. When two vowels are juxtaposed, except certain vowel combinations beginning with {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} which in fact imply a glide {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}, the glottal stop is implied. Examples: '''buok''' ''hair'' {{IPA|[bu\u02d0.\u0294ok]}}, '''dait''' ''sew'' {{IPA|[da\u02d0.\u0294it]}}, but '''not''' '''ruar''' ''outside'' {{IPA|[\u027ewa\u027e]}}.

The phoneme /h/ is a borrowed sound and rarely occurs in coda position. Although, the Spanish word, '''reloj''', ''clock'', would have been heard as [re.loh], the final /h/ is dropped resulting in /re.lo/. However, this word also may have entered the Ilokano lexicon at early enough a time that the word was still pronounced {{IPA|/re.lo\u0292/}}, with the '''j''' pronounced as in [[French phonology|French]], resulting in /re.los/ in Ilokano. As a result, both /re.lo/ and /re.los/ occur.\n\nThe glottal stop {{IPA|/\u0294/}} is not permissible as coda; it can only occur as onset. Even as an onset, the glottal stop disappears in affixation. Take for example the root '''aramat''' {{IPA|[\u0294\u0250.ra.mat]}}, ''use''. When prefixed with '''ag-''', the expected form is  {{IPA|*[\u0294\u0250\u0261.\u0294\u0250.ra.mat]}}. But, the actual form is {{IPA|[\u0294\u0250.\u0261\u0250.ra.mat]}}; the glottal stop disappears. In a reduplicated form, the glottal stop returns and participates in the template, CVC, '''agar-aramat''' {{IPA|[\u0294\u0250.\u0261ar.\u0294\u0250.ra.mat]}}.\n\nStops are pronounced without aspiration. When they occur as coda, they are not released, for example, '''sungbat''' {{IPA|[s\u028a\u014b.bat\u031a]}} ''answer, response''.\n\nIlokano is one of the Philippine languages which is excluded from {{IPA|[\u027e]}}-{{IPA|[d]}} allophony, as /r/ in many cases is derived from a Proto-Austonesian *R, compare '''bago''' (Tagalog) and '''bar\u00f3''' (Ilokano) ''new''.\n\nThe language marginally has a trill [r] which was spelled as \"rr\", for example, '''serrek''' {{IPA|[s\u025b.\u02c8r\u025bk]}} ''to enter''. Trill [r] is sometimes an allophone of {{IPA|[\u027e]}} in word-initial position and word-final positions, spelled as single <r>. But it is different in proper names of foreign origin, mostly Spanish, like '''Serrano''', which is correctly pronounced {{IPA|[s\u025b.\u02c8rano]}}. Some speakers, however, pronounce '''Serrano''' as {{IPA|[s\u025b.\u02c8\u027eano]}}.\n\n=== Prosody ===\n\n==== Primary stress ====\nThe placement of primary stress is lexical in Ilocano. This results in [[minimal pair]]s such as /\u02c8ka\u02d0.yo/ (''wood'') and /ka.\u02c8yo/ (''you (plural or polite)'') or /\u02c8ki\u02d0.ta/ (''class, type, kind'') and /ki.\u02c8ta/ (''see''). In written Ilokano the reader must rely on context, thus \u27e8kayo\u27e9 and \u27e8kita\u27e9. Primary stress can fall only on either the [[Ultima (linguistics)|penult]] or the [[Ultima (linguistics)|ultima]] of the root, as seen in the previous examples.\n\n<!-- Patterns for determining a word's primary stress -->\nWhile stress is unpredictable in Ilokano, there are notable patterns that can determine where stress will fall depending on the structures of the penult, the ultima and the origin of the word.<ref name=\"rubino\" />\n\n* '''Foreign Words''' \u2013 The stress of foreign (mostly Spanish) words adopted into Ilokano fall on the same syllable as the original.{{efn|Spanish permits stress to fall on the antepenult. As a result, Ilokano will shift the stress to fall on the penult. For example, '''\u00e1rabe''' ''an Arab'' becomes '''ar\u00e1bo''' in Ilocano.}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Ilocano !! Gloss !!

They used a system that is termed as an ''[[abugida]]'', or an alphasyllabary. It was similar to the [[Baybayin|Tagalog]] and [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] scripts, where each character represented a consonant-vowel, or CV, sequence. The Ilocano version, however, was the first to designate coda consonants with a diacritic mark \u2013 a cross or [[virama]] \u2013 shown in the ''Doctrina Cristiana'' of 1621, one of the earliest surviving Ilokano publications. Before the addition of the virama, writers had no way to designate coda consonants. The reader, on the other hand, had to guess whether the vowel was read or not, due to this vowels \"e\" and \"i\" are interchangeable and letters \"o\" and \"u\", for instance \"tendera\" and tindira\" (shop-assistant)\n\n=== Modern ===\nIn recent times, there have been two systems in use: The \"Spanish\" system and the \"Tagalog\" system. In the ''Spanish'' system words of Spanish origin kept their spellings. Native words, on the other hand, conformed to the Spanish rules of spelling. Most older generation of Ilocanos use the ''Spanish'' system.\n\nIn the system based on that of Tagalog there is more of a phoneme-to-letter correspondence, and better reflects the actual pronunciation of the word.{{efn|However, there are notable exceptions. The reverse is true for the vowel {{IPA|/u/}} where it has two representations in native words. The vowel {{IPA|/u/}} is written '''o''' when it appears in the last syllable of the word or of the root, for example '''kitaemonto''' /ki.ta.e.mun.tu/. In addition, '''e''' represents two vowels in the southern dialect: {{IPA|[\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[]}}.}} The letters ''ng'' constitute a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] and counts as a single letter, following ''n'' in alphabetization. As a result, '''numo''' ''humility'' appears before '''ngalngal''' ''to chew'' in newer dictionaries. Words of foreign origin, most notably those from Spanish, need to be changed in spelling to better reflect Ilocano phonology. Words of English origin may or may not conform to this orthography. A prime example using this system is the weekly magazine ''[[Bannawag]]''.\n\n=== Samples of the two systems ===\nThe following are two versions of the Lord's Prayer. The one on the left is written using the Spanish-based orthography, while the one on the right uses the Tagalog-based system.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n: ''Amami, \u00f1ga addaca sadi la\u00f1git,''\n: ''Madaydayao coma ti Naganmo.''\n: ''Umay cuma ti pagariam.''\n: ''Maaramid cuma ti pagayatam''\n: ''Cas sadi la\u00f1git casta met ditoy daga.''\n: ''Itedmo cadacam ita ti taraonmi iti inaldao.''\n: ''Quet pacaoanennacami cadaguiti ut-utangmi,''\n: ''A cas met panamacaoanmi''\n: ''Cadaguiti nacautang cadacami.''\n: ''Quet dinacam iyeg iti pannacasulisog,''\n: ''No di quet isalacannacami iti daques.''\n\n{{col-2}}\n: ''Amami, nga addaka sadi langit,''\n: ''Madaydayaw koma ti Naganmo.''\n: ''Umay koma ti pagariam.''\n: ''Maaramid koma ti pagayatam''\n: ''Kas sadi langit kasta met ditoy daga.''\n: ''Itedmo kadakami iti taraonmi iti inaldaw.''\n: ''Ket pakawanennakami kadagiti ut-utangmi,''\n: ''A kas met panamakawanmi''\n: ''Kadagiti nakautang kadakami.''\n: ''Ket dinakam iyeg iti pannakasulisog,''\n: ''No di ket isalakannakami iti dakes.''{{col-end}}\n\n== Ilocano and education ==\nWith the implementation by the Spanish of the [[Bilingual Education]] System of 1897, Ilocano, together with the other seven [[Philippine languages|major languages]] (those that have at least a million speakers), was allowed to be used as a medium of instruction until the second grade.

It is the primary medium of instruction from kindergarten to grade 3 (except for the Filipino and English subjects) and is also a separate subject from grade 1 to grade 3. Thereafter, English and Filipino are introduced as mediums of instructions.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main article|Ilokano literature}}\n[[File:10 commandments in Ilokano.JPG|thumb|right|The ten commandments in Ilocano.]]\nIlocano animistic past offers a rich background in folklore, mythology and superstition (see [[Religion in the Philippines]]). There are many stories of good and malevolent spirits and beings. Its creation mythology centers on the giants Aran and her husband [[Angalo]], and Namarsua (the Creator).\n\nThe epic story ''[[Biag ni Lam-ang]]'' (The Life of Lam-ang) is undoubtedly one of the few indigenous stories from the Philippines that survived colonialism, although much of it is now acculturated and shows many foreign elements in the retelling. It reflects values important to traditional Ilokano society; it is a hero's journey steeped in courage, loyalty, pragmatism, honor, and ancestral and familial bonds.\n\nIlocano culture revolves around life rituals, festivities and oral history. These were celebrated in songs (''kankanta''), dances (''salsala''), poems (''dandaniw''), riddles (''burburtia''), proverbs (''pagsasao''), literary verbal jousts called ''bucanegan'' (named after the writer [[Pedro Bucaneg]], and is the equivalent of the [[Balagtasan]] of the [[Tagalogs]]) and epic stories.\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n=== Segmental ===\n\n==== Vowels ====\nModern Ilocano has two dialects, which are differentiated only by the way the letter '''''e''''' is pronounced. In the '''Amianan''' (''Northern'') dialect, there exist only five vowels while the '''Abagatan''' (''Southern'') dialect employs six.\n\n* Amianan: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}\n* Abagatan: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u026f/}}\n\nReduplicate vowels are not slurred together, but voiced separately with an intervening glottal stop:\n* saan: {{IPA|/sa.\u0294an/}} ''no''\n* siit: {{IPA|/si.\u0294it/}} ''thorn''\n\nThe letter in '''bold''' is the graphic (written) representation of the vowel.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto:\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Ilokano vowel chart'''\n! ||[[Front vowel|Front]]||[[Central vowel|Central]]||[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n|[[Close vowel|Close]]\n|'''i''' {{IPA|/i/}}\n|\n| '''u'''/'''o''' {{IPA|/u/}}\n'''e''' {{IPA|/\u026f/}}\n|-\n|[[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|'''e''' {{IPA|/\u025b/}}\n|\n|'''o''' {{IPA|/o/}}\n|-\n|[[Open vowel|Open]]\n|\n|'''a''' {{IPA|/a/}}\n|\n|}\n\nFor a better rendition of vowel distribution, please refer to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet#Vowels|IPA Vowel Chart]].\n\nUnstressed /a/ is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0250]}} in all positions except final syllables, like ''mad\u00ed'' {{IPA|[m\u0250\u02c8di]}} (cannot be) but ''ngiwat'' (mouth) is pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u014biwat]}}.\n\nAlthough the modern (Tagalog) writing system is largely phonetic, there are some notable conventions.\n\n===== O/U and I/E =====\nIn native [[morphemes]], the [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} is written differently depending on the syllable. If the vowel occurs in the [[ultima (linguistics)|ultima]] of the morpheme, it is written '''o'''; elsewhere, '''u'''.\n\n '''Example:'''\n     Root: '''luto''' ''cook''\n           '''agluto''' ''to cook''\n           '''lutuen''' ''to cook (something)'' '''example:lutuen dayta'''\n\nInstances such as '''masapulmonto''', ''You will manage to find it, to need it'', are still consistent. Note that '''masapulmonto''' is, in fact, three morphemes: '''masapul''' (verb base), '''-mo''' (pronoun) and '''-(n)to''' (future particle). An exception to this rule, however, is '''laud''' {{IPA|/la.\u0294ud/}} (''west''). Also, '''u''' in final stressed syllables can be pronounced [o], like {{IPA|[d\u0250.\u02c8nom]}} for '''danum''' (''water'').\n\nThe two vowels are not highly differentiated in native words due to fact that {{IPA|/o/}} was an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/u/}} in the history of the language. In words of foreign origin, notably Spanish, they are [[phonemic]].\n\n '''Example:'''\n     '''uso''' ''use''\n     '''oso''' ''bear''\n\nUnlike '''u''' and '''o''', '''i''' and '''e''' are not allophones, but '''i''' in final stressed syllables in words ending in consonants can be {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, like ''ub\u00edng'' {{IPA|[\u028a.\u02c8b\u025b\u014b]}} (''child'').\n\nThe two closed vowels become [[Semivowel|glides]] when followed by another vowel. The [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} becomes {{IPA|[w]}} before another vowel; and the [[close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|[j]}}.\n\n '''Example:'''\n     '''kuarta''' {{IPA|/kwa\u027e.ta/}} ''money''\n     '''paria''' {{IPA|/pa\u027e.ja/}} ''bitter melon''\n\nIn addition, [[Dental consonant|dental]]/[[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] consonants become [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] before {{IPA|/i/}}. (See [[#consonants|Consonants]] below).\n\nUnstressed /i/ and /u/ are pronounced {{IPA|[\u026a]}} and {{IPA|[\u028a]}} except in final syllables, like ''pint\u00e1s'' (beauty) {{IPA|[p\u026an.\u02c8tas]}} and ''but\u00e9ng'' (fear) {{IPA|[b\u028a.\u02c8t\u025b\u014b]}} but ''bangir'' (other side) and ''parabur'' (''grace'') are pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8ba.\u014bi\u027e]}} and {{IPA|[p\u0250.\u02c8\u027ea.bu\u027e]}}.\n\n===== Pronunciation of {{angbr|e}} =====\nThe letter {{angbr|e}} represents two vowels in the non-nuclear dialects (areas outside the Ilocos provinces) {{IPA|[\u025b]}} in words of foreign origin and {{IPA|[\u026f]}} in native words, and only one in the nuclear dialects of the Ilocos provinces, {{IPA|[\u025b]}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+caption|Realization of {{angbr|e}}\n!Word||Gloss||Origin||Nuclear||Non-nuclear\n|-\n|'''keddeng'''\n|''assign''\n|Native\n|{{IPA|[k\u025bd.d\u025b\u014b]}}\n|{{IPA|[k\u026fd.d\u026f\u014b]}}\n|-\n|'''elepante'''\n|''elephant''\n|Spanish\n|{{IPA|[\u0294\u025b.l\u025b.pan.t\u025b]}}\n|{{IPA|[\u0294\u025b.l\u025b.pan.t\u025b]}}\n|}\n\n==== Diphthongs ====\n\nDiphthongs are combination of a vowel and /i/ or /u/. In the orthography, the secondary vowels (underlying /i/ or /u/) are written with their corresponding glide, '''y''' or '''w''', respectively. Of all the possible combinations, only /aj/ or /ej/, /iw/, /aw/ and /uj/ occur. In the [[orthography]], vowels in sequence such as '''uo''' and '''ai''', do not coalesce into a diphthong, rather, they are pronounced with an intervening glottal stop, for example, '''buok''' ''hair'' {{IPA|/b\u028a.\u0294uk/}}  and '''dait''' ''sew'' {{IPA|/da.\u0294it/}}.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+Diphthongs\n!Diphthong||Orthography||Example\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|/au/\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|aw\n|'''kabaw''' \"''senile''\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|/iu/\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|iw\n|'''iliw''' \"''home sick''\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|/ai/\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|ay\n|'''maysa''' \"''one''\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|/ei/{{efn|The diphthong /ei/ is a variant of /ai/.}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|ey\n|'''idiey''' \"''there''\" (Regional variant.

Other occurrences are in words of  Spanish and English origin. Examples are ''reyna'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u027eei.na/}} (from Spanish ''reina'', ''queen'') and ''treyner'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u027eei.n\u025b\u027e/}} (''trainer''). The diphthongs {{IPA|/oi/}} and {{IPA|/ui/}} may be interchanged since {{IPA|/o/}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/u/}} in final syllables. Thus, ''ap\u00fay'' (fire) may be pronounced {{IPA|/\u0250.\u02c8pui/}} and ''baboy'' (pig) may be pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8ba.bui/}}.\n\n==== Consonants ====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"75%\"\n!colspan=2|\n![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n![[Dental consonant|Dental]]/<br />[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2 | '''[[Stop consonant|Stops]]'''\n|'''Voiceless'''\n|'''p'''\n|'''t'''\n|\n|'''k'''\n|  '''(#{{efn|The '#' represents the start of the word boundary}}{{IPA link|\u2205}}{{efn|the symbol '{{IPA|\u2205}}' represents ''zero'' or an absence of a phoneme.}} {{IPA|V/\u2205V\u2205/C-V}})'''{{IPA|[\u0294]}}{{efn|Ilocano syllables always begin with a consonant onset. Words that begin with a vowel actually begin with a glottal stop ('{{IPA|[\u0294]}}'), but it is not shown in the orthography. When the glottal stop occurs within a word there are two ways it is represented. When two vowels are juxtaposed, except certain vowel combinations beginning with {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} which in fact imply a glide {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}, the glottal stop is implied. Examples: '''buok''' ''hair'' {{IPA|[bu\u02d0.\u0294ok]}}, '''dait''' ''sew'' {{IPA|[da\u02d0.\u0294it]}}, but '''not''' '''ruar''' ''outside'' {{IPA|[\u027ewa\u027e]}}.

The phoneme /h/ is a borrowed sound and rarely occurs in coda position. Although, the Spanish word, '''reloj''', ''clock'', would have been heard as [re.loh], the final /h/ is dropped resulting in /re.lo/. However, this word also may have entered the Ilokano lexicon at early enough a time that the word was still pronounced {{IPA|/re.lo\u0292/}}, with the '''j''' pronounced as in [[French phonology|French]], resulting in /re.los/ in Ilokano. As a result, both /re.lo/ and /re.los/ occur.\n\nThe glottal stop {{IPA|/\u0294/}} is not permissible as coda; it can only occur as onset. Even as an onset, the glottal stop disappears in affixation. Take for example the root '''aramat''' {{IPA|[\u0294\u0250.ra.mat]}}, ''use''. When prefixed with '''ag-''', the expected form is  {{IPA|*[\u0294\u0250\u0261.\u0294\u0250.ra.mat]}}. But, the actual form is {{IPA|[\u0294\u0250.\u0261\u0250.ra.mat]}}; the glottal stop disappears. In a reduplicated form, the glottal stop returns and participates in the template, CVC, '''agar-aramat''' {{IPA|[\u0294\u0250.\u0261ar.\u0294\u0250.ra.mat]}}.\n\nStops are pronounced without aspiration. When they occur as coda, they are not released, for example, '''sungbat''' {{IPA|[s\u028a\u014b.bat\u031a]}} ''answer, response''.\n\nIlokano is one of the Philippine languages which is excluded from {{IPA|[\u027e]}}-{{IPA|[d]}} allophony, as /r/ in many cases is derived from a Proto-Austonesian *R, compare '''bago''' (Tagalog) and '''bar\u00f3''' (Ilokano) ''new''.\n\nThe language marginally has a trill [r] which was spelled as \"rr\", for example, '''serrek''' {{IPA|[s\u025b.\u02c8r\u025bk]}} ''to enter''. Trill [r] is sometimes an allophone of {{IPA|[\u027e]}} in word-initial position and word-final positions, spelled as single <r>. But it is different in proper names of foreign origin, mostly Spanish, like '''Serrano''', which is correctly pronounced {{IPA|[s\u025b.\u02c8rano]}}. Some speakers, however, pronounce '''Serrano''' as {{IPA|[s\u025b.\u02c8\u027eano]}}.\n\n=== Prosody ===\n\n==== Primary stress ====\nThe placement of primary stress is lexical in Ilocano. This results in [[minimal pair]]s such as /\u02c8ka\u02d0.yo/ (''wood'') and /ka.\u02c8yo/ (''you (plural or polite)'') or /\u02c8ki\u02d0.ta/ (''class, type, kind'') and /ki.\u02c8ta/ (''see''). In written Ilokano the reader must rely on context, thus \u27e8kayo\u27e9 and \u27e8kita\u27e9.
