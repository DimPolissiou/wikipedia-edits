If anyone but her mother touches her face, she lashes out \u2013 a consequence of a childhood trauma in which, according to the social worker, nappies were pressed into her face; this prompts other children to provoke her and set off an outburst of rage. She has been repeatedly suspended from her special school and no foster family or residential group can tolerate her for long. As a so-called \u201csystem crasher\u201d she seems likely to fall through the framework of the German support system for children and youths. Benni just yearns to live with her mother again. However, it is also too much for Bianca, who is afraid of her own daughter.<ref name=\"berlinale\">[https://www.berlinale.de/de/programm/berlinale_programm/datenblatt.html?film_id=201913679 Profil] at berlinale.de (retrieved 31 January 2019).</ref> She is also mother to two more young children and is living with the abusive Jens, from whom she is unable to part. In one scene Benni runs away and hitch-hikes home to find her small siblings alone, unsupervised and watching horror films. Showing she can be caring, she switches over to a children\u2019s channel against the wishes of her brother and prepares some food. When her mother returns with her current partner, whom she has for some time wanted to leave, Benni is at first overjoyed to see her but then explodes and with a vase attacks first Jens and then her mother who calls the police. Jens strikes Benni and shuts her in a wardrobe until the officers arrive.\n\nIn another effort, the dedicated Frau Bafan\u00e9 from youth services hires an anger-management trainer for Benni. Michael Heller, a boxing fan who has worked with male delinquents, is engaged to accompany her to school. After further violent outbursts, at his own suggestion, he takes her away to a lodge in the woods where he has previously taken the young offenders. This may be stretching \u201coutdoor education\u201d, but Benni goes along with him and he is able to engage with her. Benni sees him as a father figure, at one point even calling him \u201cPapa\u201d, which Micha will not allow, lest he lose his professional distance.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Benni clings to Micha and wants to stay with him. Micha, however, has his own family and would like to give up the case, but Frau Bafan\u00e9 persuades him to continue, as there are so few people on Benni\u2019s side.\n\nBenni\u2019s mother tells her and the social workers that she has left her belligerent partner for good and will take Benni back home, but when she arrives at one of the few case meetings she actually attends, she goes back on her word and then just runs away from the meeting. Frau Bafan\u00e9 breaks down in tears as she has to tell Benni of yet another disappointment, and now the child comforts the adult. Placement with a previous foster mother also fails when Benni seriously injures a foster child already there in a fit of rage.\n\nAs a short-term measure, Benni is returned to the emergency accommodation where she had previously been. There are no specialist boarding schools for children as young as Benni and a stay abroad in Kenya is suggested as a last resort. Benni flees to Micha and his family, who are prepared to let her stay for one night. In the morning, while the parents are still sleeping, Benni goes into their bedroom and lifts the baby from his cot, takes him downstairs and carefully gives him breakfast. When the baby unwittingly touches Benni\u2019s face, she makes no objection. On waking and coming to the kitchen, Elli, the baby\u2019s mother, tries to take him back and Benni becomes aggressive. She refuses to let the baby go and locks herself in the bathroom. Micha breaks the door open, but Benni has fled through the window, leaving the baby unharmed. She runs in her socks and nightclothes into the nearby wood, where she collapses into confused dreams. Hours later she is found hypothermic and taken to hospital.\n\nShe is to be sent to Kenya, but at the airport she runs out of security.

In some contexts, the term has been restricted to salts whose [[melting point]] is below some arbitrary temperature, such as {{convert|100|C}}. While ordinary liquids such as [[water]] and [[gasoline]] are predominantly made of [[electric charge|electrically neutral]] [[molecules]], ionic liquids are largely made of [[ion]]s and short-lived [[ion pair]]s.

They are powerful [[solvent]]s and can be used as [[electrolyte]]s.  Salts that are liquid at near-ambient temperature are important for [[electric battery]] applications, and have been considered as [[sealant]]s due to their very low [[vapor pressure]].\n\nAny salt that melts without [[pyrolysis|decomposing]] or vaporizing usually yields an ionic liquid. [[Sodium chloride]] (NaCl), for example, melts at {{convert|801|C}} into a liquid that consists largely of [[sodium]] cations ({{chem|Na|+}}) and chloride anions ({{chem|Cl|-}}). Conversely, when an ionic liquid is cooled, it often forms an [[ionic solid]]&mdash;which may be either [[crystal]]line or [[glass]]y.\n\nThe [[ionic bond]] is usually stronger than the [[Van der Waals force]]s between the molecules of ordinary liquids. For that reason, common salts tend to melt at higher temperatures than other solid molecules. Some salts are liquid at or below [[room temperature]].  Examples include compounds based on the 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMIM) cation and include: [[1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride|EMIM:Cl]], EMIM [[dicyanamide]], ({{chem|C|2|H|5}})({{chem|CH|3}}){{chem|C|3|H|3|N|2|+}}\u00b7{{chem|N(CN)|2|-}}, that melts at {{convert|\u221221|C}};<ref>{{cite journal | title = Low viscosity ionic liquids based on organic salts of the dicyanamide anion | author = D.

They are powerful [[solvent]]s and can be used as [[electrolyte]]s.  Salts that are liquid at near-ambient temperature are important for [[electric battery]] applications, and have been considered as [[sealant]]s due to their very low [[vapor pressure]].\n\nAny salt that melts without [[pyrolysis|decomposing]] or vaporizing usually yields an ionic liquid. [[Sodium chloride]] (NaCl), for example, melts at {{convert|801|C}} into a liquid that consists largely of [[sodium]] cations ({{chem|Na|+}}) and chloride anions ({{chem|Cl|-}}). Conversely, when an ionic liquid is cooled, it often forms an [[ionic solid]]&mdash;which may be either [[crystal]]line or [[glass]]y.\n\nThe [[ionic bond]] is usually stronger than the [[Van der Waals force]]s between the molecules of ordinary liquids. For that reason, common salts tend to melt at higher temperatures than other solid molecules. Some salts are liquid at or below [[room temperature]].

Concentrating solar thermal facilities such as [[parabolic trough]]s and [[solar power tower]]s focus the sun's energy onto a receiver, which can generate temperatures of around {{convert|600|C}}. This heat can then generate electricity in a steam or other cycle. For buffering during cloudy periods or to enable generation overnight, energy can be stored by heating an intermediate fluid. Although nitrate salts have been the medium of choice since the early 1980s, they freeze at {{convert|220|C}} and thus require heating to prevent solidification. Ionic liquids such as [[C4mim|{{chem|C|4|mim}}]][{{chem|BF|4}}] have more favorable liquid-phase temperature ranges (-75 to 459&nbsp;\u00b0C) and could therefore be excellent liquid thermal storage media and heat transfer fluids.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[International Solar Energy Conference]] | date = 2001 | pages = 445\u2013451 | title = Novel ionic liquid thermal storage for solar thermal electric power systems | author = Banqui Wu | author2 = Ramana G.

Thus, the current focus of research is on using ionic liquids as additives to lubricating oils, often with the motivation to replace widely used, ecologically harmful [[Oil additive|lubricant additives]].

The other children, being too young ever to have seen it themselves, do not believe her. Led by a boy named William, they bully and antagonise her, and just before the sun comes out, William rallies the other children, and they lock her in a closet down a tunnel.\n\nAs the Sun is about to appear, their teacher arrives to take the class outside to enjoy their two hours of sunshine and, in their astonishment and joy, they all forget about Margot. They run, play, skip, jump, and prance about, savouring every second of their newly found freedoms. \"Oh, it's better than the [[sunlamp]]s, isn't it?\" one of them cries.\n\nSuddenly, a girl catches a raindrop in her hands. Thunder sounds, then the lightning comes, and the children run back inside as the sun disappears and it starts to pour again. At this point, one of them remembers Margot, who is still locked in the closet. Ashamed, they let her out of the closet, standing frozen, embarrassed over what they have done and unable to \"meet each other's glances.\"\n\nThe precious Sun has come and gone, and because of their despicable act, Margot, who loved the Sun the most, has missed it.\n\n==Adaptations==\nA 30-minute television adaptation, originally broadcast on the [[PBS]]' children's series ''[[WonderWorks]]'' in 1982.

Highlighted are the [[Nucleobase|nucleobases]] (green) and the ribose-phosphate backbone (blue). This is a single strand of RNA that folds back upon itself. ]]\n\n'''Ribonucleic acid''' ('''RNA''') is a [[polymer]]ic molecule essential in various biological roles in [[Genetic code|coding]], [[Translation (biology)|decoding]], [[Regulatory RNA|regulation]] and [[RNA splicing|expression]] of [[gene]]s. RNA and [[DNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]s, and, along with [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s, constitute the four major [[macromolecule]]s essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, but unlike DNA, RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand. Cellular organisms use [[messenger RNA]] ('''''mRNA''''') to convey genetic information (using the [[nucleobase|nitrogenous bases]] of [[guanine]], [[uracil]], [[adenine]], and [[cytosine]], denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [[virus]]es encode their genetic information using an RNA [[genome]].\n\nSome RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling [[gene expression]], or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals.

RNA and [[DNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]s, and, along with [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s, constitute the four major [[macromolecule]]s essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, but unlike DNA, RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand. Cellular organisms use [[messenger RNA]] ('''''mRNA''''') to convey genetic information (using the [[nucleobase|nitrogenous bases]] of [[guanine]], [[uracil]], [[adenine]], and [[cytosine]], denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [[virus]]es encode their genetic information using an RNA [[genome]].\n\nSome RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling [[gene expression]], or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], a universal function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on [[ribosome]]s. This process uses [[transfer RNA]] ('''''tRNA''''') molecules to deliver [[amino acid]]s to the ribosome, where [[ribosomal RNA]] ('''''rRNA''''') then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.\n\n==Comparison with DNA==\n[[File:50S-subunit of the ribosome 3CC2.png|thumb|Three-dimensional representation of the [[50S]] ribosomal subunit.
