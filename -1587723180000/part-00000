Then, for the patient to exhale, the air inside the cylinder is compressed slightly (or allowed to equalize to ambient room pressure), causing the patient's chest and abdomen to partially collapse, forcing air out of the lungs, as the patient exhales the breath through their exposed mouth and nose, outside the cylinder.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" /><ref name=\"how_does_iron_lung_work_2018_08_21_newsweek\" />\n\nExamples of the device include the Drinker respirator, the Emerson respirator, and the Both respirator. Iron lungs can be either manually or mechanically powered, but normally are powered by an electric motor linked to a flexible pumping diaphragm (commonly on opposite the end of the cylinder from the patient's head).<ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /> Larger \"room-sized\" iron lungs were also developed, allowing for simultaneous ventilation of several patients (each with their heads protruding from sealed openings in the outer wall), with sufficient space inside for a [[nurse]] or a [[respiratory therapist]] to be inside the sealed room, attending the patients.<ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" />\n\nSmaller, single-patient versions of the iron lung include the so-called ''Cuirass ventilator'' (named for the [[Cuirass]], a torso-covering [[body armor]]). The Cuirass ventilator encloses only the patient's torso, or chest and abdomen, but otherwise operates essentially the same as the original, full-sized iron lung. A modern version is the ''exovent.''   A lightweight variation on the cuirass ventilator is the ''jacket ventilator'' or ''poncho'' or ''raincoat''  ventilator, which uses a flexible, impermeable material (such as plastic or rubber) stretched over a metal or plastic frame over the patient's torso.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"modern_iron_lung_2020_04_06_newatlas\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_and_2020_04_11_oxy_gen\">[http://oxygen.milano.it/en/the-iron-lung-and-the-modern-ventilation/ \"The 'iron lung' and the modern 'ventilation',\"] Oxy.gen, \nretrieved April 11, 2020 (caution: source unclear; apparently an Italian oxygen-supplier)</ref><ref name=\"poncho_dima_italia_sri\">[https://www.dimaitalia.com/en/tag/poncho/ \"Poncho,\"] by medical device manufacturer [[Dima Italia Srl]] of [[Bologna, Italy]] (picture of jacket ventilator (\"poncho\"), and other information.), retrieved April 12, 2020</ref>\n\n==Method and use==\n===normal breathing===\n:[[breathing|Main section: breathing]]\nHumans, like most mammals, breathe by ''negative pressure'' breathing:<ref name=stemnet>{{cite web|title=Gas Exchange in Humans|url=http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/~dpower/resp/exchange.htm|accessdate=2011-07-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423113840/http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/~dpower/resp/exchange.htm|archivedate=2009-04-23}}</ref> the rib cage expands and the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] contracts, expanding the [[chest cavity]]. This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air. A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their air pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.  As a result, outside (ambient) air forces its way in through the patient's exposed nose and mouth, into their airway, to fill the lower-pressure space inside the patient's lungs -- and the patient has thus \"taken a breath\" (\"inhaled\").<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nExhaling is stimulated by allowing the pressure inside the iron lung to return to normal, matching the outside (ambient) air pressure.  As a result, the patient's chest is no longer being expanded by negative pressure, and the natural elasticity of the patient's chest causes it to collapse, squeezing air from the patient's lungs, through the patient's airway, and out of their exposed mouth and nose -- and the patient has thus \"exhaled.\"<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThe process continues cycling, repetitively, at a rate set by the person operating the iron lung's controls, to maintain continuous patient artificial respiration (artificial \"breathing\").<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\n===normal application===\nThe iron lung may assist normal patient respiration, or it may completely substitute for it, depending upon the patient's condition.

(Iron lungs must move larger quantities of air for every breath, because they must change the pressure of the air in the entire vessel, not just inflate the lungs).\n* Electrical power failure can result in prompt patient death. (Most iron lungs and similar devices lack backup power supplies. Manual power is an option on some units, but requires multiple attendants, working alternately, to provide direct, continuous physical pumping of the iron lung's pump or diaphragm.)\n* Physical hazard to people and things in the immediate vicinity, because of exposed moving parts (Not true of all iron lungs).\n* Low-tech design creates low barrier to entry -- along with low historical demand -- resulting in lack of support from manufacturers of competing complex ventilator systems, who currently dominate and shape the market for ventilation equipment.\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air. A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their air pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.

(Iron lungs must move larger quantities of air for every breath, because they must change the pressure of the air in the entire vessel, not just inflate the lungs).\n* Electrical power failure can result in prompt patient death. (Most iron lungs and similar devices lack backup power supplies. Manual power is an option on some units, but requires multiple attendants, working alternately, to provide direct, continuous physical pumping of the iron lung's pump or diaphragm.)\n* Physical hazard to people and things in the immediate vicinity, because of exposed moving parts (Not true of all iron lungs).\n* Low-tech design creates low barrier to entry -- along with low historical demand -- resulting in lack of support from manufacturers of competing complex ventilator systems, who currently dominate and shape the market for ventilation equipment.\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

Emerson defended himself by making the case that such lifesaving devices should be freely available to all.<ref name=NMAH2011/> Emerson also demonstrated that every aspect of Drinker's patents had been published or used by others at earlier times. Since an invention must be novel to be patentable, prior publication/use of the invention meant it was not novel and therefore unpatentable. Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.\n\nThe United Kingdom's first iron lung was designed in 1934 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis. Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Both respirator===\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Nowadays, [[Respiratory therapist|respiratory therapists]] and [[doctors]] help most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.\n\n=== Continued use ===\nDespite the advantages of positive ventilation systems, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing, and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions,<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /> such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.
