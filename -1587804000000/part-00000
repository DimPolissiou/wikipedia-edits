He was most notable for his studies of historical patterns of religious belief among the [[Yoruba people]]. \n\n==Biography==\nJohn David Yeadon Peel was born in [[Dumfries]], [[Scotland]] on 11 November 1941 and was educated at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He gained a doctorate in [[sociology]] from the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) on [[African-initiated church|Independent Churches]] in [[Nigeria]]. He held a succession of academic posts at universities in the United Kingdom and Nigeria, finishing his career at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS).{{sfn|SOAS|2015}} As well as African subjects, he retained an interest in the [[history of sociology]] and authored a biography of the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1971 and taught [[social theory]].{{sfn|RAI|2016}}\n\nPeel was one of the first scholars to examine the theology and organisation of African independent churches. [[Paul Gifford]] wrote that \"[his] thrust was generally [[Max Weber|Weberian]], insisting that religion could not be reduced to material or class interests\".{{sfn|SOAS|2015}} He published three cumulative works on religious change among the [[Yoruba people]] in Nigeria between 1968 and 2015, exploring aspects of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Yoruba religion|indigenous belief]] among the Yoruba from the pre-colonial period onwards. [[Robin W. G.
