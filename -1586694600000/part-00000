A digital twin can be realized in this layer by integrating cyberspace to the physical components through [[tactile internet]]. Moreover, similarity-based methods can be used to perform peer to peer comparison across machines and help in better fault diagnosis and enhancing their efficiency.\n\n* Cognition layer\nIn this layer, infographic tools are utilized to present the results of analytic studies to the users. Simple radar charts and degradation trends can be used for a simple representation of the component's health condition. Then operators can easily make a decision based on the presented data.\n\n* Configuration layer\nIn this layer, the decisions made in the Cognition layer are applied to the physical system to make the systems self-adapt, self-configure, and self resilient.\n\n==Statistics==\nThe [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] in [[South Korea]] announced on 10 March 2016 that it had aided the construction of smart factories in 1,240 [[small and medium enterprise]]s, which it said resulted in an average 27.6% decrease in defective products, 7.1% faster production of prototypes, and 29.2% lower cost.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://businesskorea.co.kr/english/news/industry/14073-smart-benefits-smart-factories-improving-productivity-smes|title=Smart Factories Improving Productivity of SMEs |author=Jung Min-hee |date=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Action and effects ==\nFrom Siemens' perspective,<ref name=\":3\" /> there are three core elements to this evolution:\n# '''''Manufacturing execution'''''. Manufacturing execution will play an even more important role. The degree of connectivity between the automation level and the manufacturing execution system (MES) will increase significantly, also across the borders of companies and locations. The integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and MES levels will also advance to achieve complete transparency as well as connectivity to business data. That means that all necessary information is available in real time.\n# '''''The merging of the product and production life cycle'''''. The second core element is the merging of product and production life cycle based on a common data model. This will allow manufacturers to meet the challenges that result through ever-shorter product life cycles, both technically and in business.\n# '''''Cyber-physical systems'''''. [[Cyber-physical systems]] are a basis for the increase in manufacturing flexibility that results in shorter time to market. These production units can be flexibly integrated into existing production processes. Cyber physical systems combine communications, IT, data, and physical elements using core technologies, including sensor networks; Internet communication infrastructure; intelligent, real-time processing and event management; big data and data provisioning; embedded software for logic; and automated operations and management of systemic activities across enterprises.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Open manufacturing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://cesmii.org/ CESMII - US National Institute on Smart Manufacturing]\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/factories-of-the-future_en.html Factories of the Future]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064 The Smart Factory: Exploring an Open Innovation Solution for Manufacturing Ecosystems: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064]\n* [http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ge-launches-microfactory-to-co-create-the-future-of-manufacturing/#ftag=RSS56d97e7 GE launches 'microfactory' to co-create the future of manufacturing]\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing]]\n", "text_old": "{{merge from|Industry 4.0|date=June 2019}}\n{{buzzword|date=April 2019}}\n{{speculation|date=June 2019}}\n\n'''Smart manufacturing''' is a broad category of [[manufacturing]] that employs [[computer-integrated manufacturing]], high levels of adaptability and rapid design changes, digital information technology, and more flexible technical workforce training.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title = Smart manufacturing, manufacturing intelligence and demand-dynamic performance|journal = Computers & Chemical Engineering|date = 2012-12-20|pages = 145\u2013156|volume = 47|series = FOCAPO 2012|doi = 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2012.06.037|first = Jim|last = Davis|first2 = Thomas|last2 = Edgar|first3 = James|last3 = Porter|first4 = John|last4 = Bernaden|first5 = Michael|last5 = Sarli}}</ref> Other goals sometimes include fast changes in production levels based on demand,<ref name=\"SMLC 2011\">SMLC 2011</ref> optimization of the [[supply chain]],<ref name=\"SMLC 2011\"/> efficient production and recyclability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Emerging_Global_Trends_in_Advanced_Manufacturing.pdf|title=Emerging Global Trends in Advanced Manufacturing|last=Shipp|first=Stephanie S.|authorlink=Stephanie Shipp|date=March 2012|website=Emerging Global Trends in Advanced Manufacturing|publisher=Insititute for Defense Analysis|access-date=April 2016}}</ref> In this concept, as '''smart factory''' has interoperable systems, multi-scale dynamic modelling and simulation, intelligent automation, strong cyber security, and networked sensors.\n\nThe broad definition of smart manufacturing covers many different technologies.

The goal is the intelligent factory (Smart Factory) that is characterized by adaptability, resource efficiency, and ergonomics, as well as the integration of customers and business partners in business and value processes. Its technological foundation consists of cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.totallyintegratedautomation.com/2014/07/smart-manufacturing-industry-4-0-whats/|title=Smart Manufacturing?

Some examples are:\n* Advanced manufacturing processes and [[rapid prototyping]] will make possible for each customer to order one-of-a-kind product without significant cost increase.\n* Collaborative Virtual Factory (VF) platforms will drastically reduce cost and time associated to new product design and engineering of the production process, by exploiting complete simulation and virtual testing throughout the Product Lifecycle.\n* Advanced Human-Machine interaction (HMI) and [[augmented reality]] (AR) devices will help increasing safety in production plants and reducing physical demand to workers (whose age has an increasing trend).\n* [[Machine learning]] will be fundamental to optimize the production processes, both for reducing lead times and reducing the energy consumption.\n* [[Cyber-physical systems]] and [[machine-to-machine]] (M2M) communication will allow to gather and share real-time data from the shop floor in order to reduce down and idle times by conducting extremely effective [[predictive maintenance]].\n\n==Smart Manufacturing Paradigms== \nIn this section, the leading visions for the future of smart manufacturing are discussed and for each one, different examples from leading industry and research organizations are presented.\n\n===Cyber Physical Systems in Smart Manufacturing===\nAs one of the main elements of Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems play a significant role in the future of smart manufacturing systems.\n* Connection Layer\nSystems, comments, machines, and humans are essential parts of manufacturing systems and their contributions highly depend on their connection with the rest of the manufacturing elements. For instance, an operator may require advanced intelligence from the production system in order to make the most efficient decisions for scheduling maintenance or production orders. Advanced communication technologies such as [[5G|5G technology]] <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Jeffrey G. |last2=Buzzi |first2=Stefano |last3=Choi |first3=Wan |last4=Hanly |first4=Stephen V. |last5=Lozano |first5=Angel |last6=Soong |first6=Anthony C.

A digital twin can be realized in this layer by integrating cyberspace to the physical components through [[tactile internet]]. Moreover, similarity-based methods can be used to perform peer to peer comparison across machines and help in better fault diagnosis and enhancing their efficiency.\n\n* Cognition layer\nIn this layer, infographic tools are utilized to present the results of analytic studies to the users. Simple radar charts and degradation trends can be used for a simple representation of the component's health condition. Then operators can easily make a decision based on the presented data.\n\n* Configuration layer\nIn this layer, the decisions made in the Cognition layer are applied to the physical system to make the systems self-adapt, self-configure, and self resilient.\n\n==Statistics==\nThe [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] in [[South Korea]] announced on 10 March 2016 that it had aided the construction of smart factories in 1,240 [[small and medium enterprise]]s, which it said resulted in an average 27.6% decrease in defective products, 7.1% faster production of prototypes, and 29.2% lower cost.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://businesskorea.co.kr/english/news/industry/14073-smart-benefits-smart-factories-improving-productivity-smes|title=Smart Factories Improving Productivity of SMEs |author=Jung Min-hee |date=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Action and effects ==\nFrom Siemens' perspective,<ref name=\":3\" /> there are three core elements to this evolution:\n# '''''Manufacturing execution'''''. Manufacturing execution will play an even more important role. The degree of connectivity between the automation level and the manufacturing execution system (MES) will increase significantly, also across the borders of companies and locations. The integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and MES levels will also advance to achieve complete transparency as well as connectivity to business data. That means that all necessary information is available in real time.\n# '''''The merging of the product and production life cycle'''''. The second core element is the merging of product and production life cycle based on a common data model. This will allow manufacturers to meet the challenges that result through ever-shorter product life cycles, both technically and in business.\n# '''''Cyber-physical systems'''''. [[Cyber-physical systems]] are a basis for the increase in manufacturing flexibility that results in shorter time to market. These production units can be flexibly integrated into existing production processes. Cyber physical systems combine communications, IT, data, and physical elements using core technologies, including sensor networks; Internet communication infrastructure; intelligent, real-time processing and event management; big data and data provisioning; embedded software for logic; and automated operations and management of systemic activities across enterprises.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Open manufacturing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://cesmii.org/ CESMII - US National Institute on Smart Manufacturing]\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/factories-of-the-future_en.html Factories of the Future]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064 The Smart Factory: Exploring an Open Innovation Solution for Manufacturing Ecosystems: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064]\n* [http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ge-launches-microfactory-to-co-create-the-future-of-manufacturing/#ftag=RSS56d97e7 GE launches 'microfactory' to co-create the future of manufacturing]\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_manufacturing"}

Created by prominent game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Luigi is portrayed as the slightly younger but taller brother of Nintendo's mascot [[Mario]], and appears in many games throughout the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], often as a [[sidekick]] to his older brother.\n\nLuigi first appeared in the 1983 [[Game & Watch]] game ''[[List of LCD games featuring Mario#Mario Bros.|Mario Bros.]]'' as the character controlled by the second player, and retained this role in the ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' arcade game, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', and other titles. The first game where he was available as a primary character was ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the ''[[Mario Party]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, though he has been featured in a starring role on seven occasions: first in the 1990 LCD wrist watch game ''[[Nelsonic Industries|Luigi's Hammer Toss]]'', in ''[[Mario is Missing]]'', in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for the [[GameCube]] in 2001, in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013, in ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for the [[Wii U]] in 2013, in [[Luigi's Mansion Arcade|''Luigi's Mansion Arcade'']] in 2015 for arcades and [[Luigi's Mansion 3|''Luigi's Mansion 3'']] for [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2019. In all seven of these games, he is called upon to act as the hero because usually Mario, the usual hero within the franchise, is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three [[DiC]] TV series based on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games.\n\nOriginally developed as a [[palette swap]] of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red, Luigi has since developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the ''Mario'' series progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his brother. Nintendo called the period of March 2013 to March 2014 \"The Year of Luigi\" to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character's existence. Correspondingly, games released in 2013 emphasised Luigi, such as ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'', and the level pack ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for ''[[New Super Mario Bros U]]''. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' titled ''Luigi Bros.'' was also included with ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Luigi emblem.svg|150px|thumb|left|This emblem appears on Luigi's hat and as a symbol for him in many game interfaces.]]\nThe events leading to Luigi's creation began in 1982, during the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', where the Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (then known as \"[[Mario#Conception and creation|Jumpman]]\") hoping that he would be able to recast the character in a variety of roles in future games.<ref name=\"hiscore\">Demaria, R: \"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games\", page 238. McGraw Hill-Osbourne, 2002</ref> Miyamoto had been inspired by the game ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'' to create a game with a simultaneous two-player mode, which led to his development of the game ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' in 1983, with Luigi filling the role of Mario's brother as the second playable character.<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\"/> Luigi's name is said to have been inspired by a pizza parlor near Nintendo of America's headquarters in [[Redmond, Washington]], called \"Mario & Luigi's\".<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\">{{cite web|publisher=International Arcade Museum|title=Mario Bros.

The later Japan-only version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' in 1986 (later released in the west as ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'') marked the beginning of Luigi's development toward becoming a more distinguished character. As with his previous appearances, Luigi remained a palette swap of Mario; however, his movement was no longer identical. Luigi could now jump higher and farther than his brother, at the expense of movement response and precision.<ref name=\"LL1up\">Hayward, Andrew.

[[1up.com]]. Retrieved 2008-04-14.</ref>\n\nWhile this version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' was released in Japan, it was deemed to be too difficult for American audiences at the time.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> In 1988, consequently, an alternative release was developed to serve as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' for western players (and later released in Japan as ''Super Mario USA''); this version played a key role in shaping Luigi's current appearance.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> The game was a conversion of ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]'', with the graphics altered to represent characters and scenes from the ''Mario'' franchise. In this release, the character of \"Mama\", who had the highest jump among the original cast, served as the template for Luigi, resulting in his taller, thinner look, combined with his Marioesque outfit and ubiquitous green color scheme. There were earlier appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario: in the 1988 Famicom Disk System game ''[[Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally]]'' and earlier, in a very rare 1986 anime ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' (though in the anime he wore a yellow shirt and the color of his hat and overalls were blue). Promotional artwork for ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'' depicts Luigi with this new look, but the actual games did not adapt this different character design in-game until the 1992 game ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''. Luigi's distinctive appearance from the ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]''-inspired version of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' has been used ever since, even for remakes of games in which he was originally a palette swap.\n\n===Actor portrayal===\nMuch like his appearance, Luigi's vocal portrayal has fluctuated over the years. In ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', which voiced many characters for the first time, some characters, including Luigi, had two different voices according to the region of the game: North American and European versions feature a low-pitched voice for Luigi, provided by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]], and [[Toadsworth]], whereas the Japanese version uses a high-pitched, [[falsetto]] voice, provided by (then French translator at Nintendo) Julien Bardakoff. All versions of ''[[Mario Party]]'' feature Bardakoff's high-pitched clips from ''Mario Kart 64''. Luigi retained this higher voice in ''[[Mario Party 2]]''. In ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Party 3]]'', his voice returned to a lower state. Since then, with the exceptions of ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi has consistently had a medium-pitched voice. In ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', Luigi's voice was the same high voice from the Japanese ''Mario Kart 64''. In ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi's voice is made up of clips from Mario's voice taken from ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', with raised pitches. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' and subsequent instalments in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, he has his own voice (which is medium-pitched) instead of a pitched-up version of Mario's.\n\n==Characteristics==\n<!-- Note that any content in this section, as with everywhere on Wikipedia, must be RELIABLY SOURCED.

He also appeared in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' as a playable character along with Baby Mario. He is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], just like his adult self.

Wii]]'', where four players can play at once cooperatively as Mario, Luigi, and two [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]]s. He also appears in ''Super Mario 3D Land'' as a playable character as well as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', the latter having a DLC mode, where he is the main character, called ''New Super Luigi U''. It has levels altered to his specific play abilities, including higher jumping. The DLC is also available as a standalone retail version. Luigi also appeared in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' along with his brother, Peach, Rosalina and Toad.\n\nLuigi appears in many of the ''Mario'' spin-offs, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', and all of the [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]]. He also appears in all five instalments of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series; in the first three instalments, he is an unlockable character.\n\nLuigi has appeared in every [[Mario role-playing games|''Mario'' role-playing game]]. While he originally made a cameo appearance in the end credits of ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he appears more prominently in the ''Paper Mario'' series. He is a non-playable character in the original ''[[Paper Mario]]''. In the sequel ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', he appears yet again as a non-playable character, going on a separate adventure from Mario's. ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' features him as a playable character after he is initially brainwashed into working for the antagonist under the name \"Mr. L.\" The ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series features Luigi as a main protagonist; the events of the games focus on him and his brother Mario. He has appeared in all five ''Mario & Luigi'' games.\n\n===Other media===\n{{see also|Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros. (TV series)}}\n\nLuigi made his animated debut in the 1986 film ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach!]]''. In the film, he was voiced by [[Y\u016b Mizushima]] and had a different color scheme than he has today, sporting a blue cap, blue overalls, and a yellow shirt. This was because he was not yet given a consistent color scheme. In the film, Luigi was very greedy and even left Mario at one point to look for coins. He was also a little more serious than his brother Mario, who constantly daydreamed about Princess Peach, although he was not as brave as Mario.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nLuigi later made an appearance in the third of a trilogy of OVAs entitled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'' released in 1989, in which the Mario characters acted out the story of [[Snow White]]. He appears at the end of the video to save Mario and Peach from the Wicked Queen, portrayed by [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]].\n\nLuigi regularly appeared in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', airing from 1989 to 1990, which cast [[Danny Wells]] as both his live-action portrayal and voice. Like his brother, Luigi's voice actor changed in later cartoons, in his case to [[Tony Rosato]]. Even though he was not the starring character in the show, Luigi appeared in all 91 episodes of the three [[DiC]] Mario cartoons, in one of which his brother himself did not appear (\"Life's Ruff\" from ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'').\n\nLuigi played a different role in the [[Super Mario Bros.

Created by prominent game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Luigi is portrayed as the slightly younger but taller brother of Nintendo's mascot [[Mario]], and appears in many games throughout the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], often as a [[sidekick]] to his older brother.\n\nLuigi first appeared in the 1983 [[Game & Watch]] game ''[[List of LCD games featuring Mario#Mario Bros.|Mario Bros.]]'' as the character controlled by the second player, and retained this role in the ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' arcade game, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', and other titles. The first game where he was available as a primary character was ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the ''[[Mario Party]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, though he has been featured in a starring role on seven occasions: first in the 1990 LCD wrist watch game ''[[Nelsonic Industries|Luigi's Hammer Toss]]'', in ''[[Mario is Missing]]'', in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for the [[GameCube]] in 2001, in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2013, in ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for the [[Wii U]] in 2013, in [[Luigi's Mansion Arcade|''Luigi's Mansion Arcade'']] in 2015 for arcades and [[Luigi's Mansion 3|''Luigi's Mansion 3'']] for [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2019. In all seven of these games, he is called upon to act as the hero because usually Mario, the usual hero within the franchise, is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three [[DiC]] TV series based on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games.\n\nOriginally developed as a [[palette swap]] of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red, Luigi has since developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the ''Mario'' series progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his brother. Nintendo called the period of March 2013 to March 2014 \"The Year of Luigi\" to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character's existence. Correspondingly, games released in 2013 emphasised Luigi, such as ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', ''[[Dr. Luigi]]'', and the level pack ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' for ''[[New Super Mario Bros U]]''. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' titled ''Luigi Bros.'' was also included with ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Luigi emblem.svg|150px|thumb|left|This emblem appears on Luigi's hat and as a symbol for him in many game interfaces.]]\nThe events leading to Luigi's creation began in 1982, during the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', where the Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (then known as \"[[Mario#Conception and creation|Jumpman]]\") hoping that he would be able to recast the character in a variety of roles in future games.<ref name=\"hiscore\">Demaria, R: \"High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games\", page 238. McGraw Hill-Osbourne, 2002</ref> Miyamoto had been inspired by the game ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'' to create a game with a simultaneous two-player mode, which led to his development of the game ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' in 1983, with Luigi filling the role of Mario's brother as the second playable character.<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\"/> Luigi's name is said to have been inspired by a pizza parlor near Nintendo of America's headquarters in [[Redmond, Washington]], called \"Mario & Luigi's\".<ref name=\"Mario_Bros\">{{cite web|publisher=International Arcade Museum|title=Mario Bros.

The later Japan-only version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' in 1986 (later released in the west as ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'') marked the beginning of Luigi's development toward becoming a more distinguished character. As with his previous appearances, Luigi remained a palette swap of Mario; however, his movement was no longer identical. Luigi could now jump higher and farther than his brother, at the expense of movement response and precision.<ref name=\"LL1up\">Hayward, Andrew.

[[1up.com]]. Retrieved 2008-04-14.</ref>\n\nWhile this version of ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' was released in Japan, it was deemed to be too difficult for American audiences at the time.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> In 1988, consequently, an alternative release was developed to serve as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' for western players (and later released in Japan as ''Super Mario USA''); this version played a key role in shaping Luigi's current appearance.<ref name=\"ignhistory\" /> The game was a conversion of ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]'', with the graphics altered to represent characters and scenes from the ''Mario'' franchise. In this release, the character of \"Mama\", who had the highest jump among the original cast, served as the template for Luigi, resulting in his taller, thinner look, combined with his Marioesque outfit and ubiquitous green color scheme. There were earlier appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario: in the 1988 Famicom Disk System game ''[[Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally]]'' and earlier, in a very rare 1986 anime ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' (though in the anime he wore a yellow shirt and the color of his hat and overalls were blue). Promotional artwork for ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'' depicts Luigi with this new look, but the actual games did not adapt this different character design in-game until the 1992 game ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''. Luigi's distinctive appearance from the ''[[Yume K\u014dj\u014d: Doki Doki Panic]]''-inspired version of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' has been used ever since, even for remakes of games in which he was originally a palette swap.\n\n===Actor portrayal===\nMuch like his appearance, Luigi's vocal portrayal has fluctuated over the years. In ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'', which voiced many characters for the first time, some characters, including Luigi, had two different voices according to the region of the game: North American and European versions feature a low-pitched voice for Luigi, provided by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]], and [[Toadsworth]], whereas the Japanese version uses a high-pitched, [[falsetto]] voice, provided by (then French translator at Nintendo) Julien Bardakoff. All versions of ''[[Mario Party]]'' feature Bardakoff's high-pitched clips from ''Mario Kart 64''. Luigi retained this higher voice in ''[[Mario Party 2]]''. In ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Party 3]]'', his voice returned to a lower state. Since then, with the exceptions of ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi has consistently had a medium-pitched voice. In ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', Luigi's voice was the same high voice from the Japanese ''Mario Kart 64''. In ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Luigi's voice is made up of clips from Mario's voice taken from ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', with raised pitches. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' and subsequent instalments in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, he has his own voice (which is medium-pitched) instead of a pitched-up version of Mario's.\n\n==Characteristics==\n<!-- Note that any content in this section, as with everywhere on Wikipedia, must be RELIABLY SOURCED.

''Super Mario Bros. 2'' introduced Luigi as the taller of the two brothers, as well as the better jumper. ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', and ''Super Mario World'' returned to featuring Luigi as a reskinned Mario. He made a minor appearance in his baby form in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''. Luigi was conspicuously absent in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. However, the [[Super Mario 64 DS|Nintendo DS remake]] of ''Super Mario 64'' features him as a playable character alongside Mario, [[Yoshi]], and [[Wario]]. He received his own starring role in the [[GameCube]] game ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', where he wins a mansion from a contest he never entered, and saves Mario from [[King Boo]]. ''Luigi's Mansion'' has cultivated such a cult following that [[Nintendo]] made a sequel to the game nearly a decade after the original game's release date. The sequel is called ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' and is playable on the [[Nintendo 3DS]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Nintendo World Report |title=Luigi's Mansion 2 to Haunt Nintendo 3DS |date = June 7, 2011 |author=Brown, Andrew |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/26596}}</ref> He reprised his role in the third game, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', on [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\nLuigi has been associated with the more difficult second acts of multiple ''Super Mario'' games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/new-super-luigi-u-review|title=New Super Luigi U Review|author=Jeremy Parish|work=[[USGamer]]|date=June 25, 2013|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> These include ''The Lost Levels'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' and the [[new game plus]] in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', which offer more challenging elaborations on their respective predecessors and allow the player to use Luigi as the main character, in whom reduced friction and higher jumping is consistent in all of these games.

He also appears in ''Super Mario 3D Land'' as a playable character as well as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', the latter having a DLC mode, where he is the main character, called ''New Super Luigi U''. It has levels altered to his specific play abilities, including higher jumping. The DLC is also available as a standalone retail version. Luigi also appeared in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' along with his brother, Peach, Rosalina and Toad.\n\nLuigi appears in many of the ''Mario'' spin-offs, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', and all of the [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]]. He also appears in all five instalments of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series; in the first three instalments, he is an unlockable character.\n\nLuigi has appeared in every [[Mario role-playing games|''Mario'' role-playing game]]. While he originally made a cameo appearance in the end credits of ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he appears more prominently in the ''Paper Mario'' series. He is a non-playable character in the original ''[[Paper Mario]]''. In the sequel ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', he appears yet again as a non-playable character, going on a separate adventure from Mario's. ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' features him as a playable character after he is initially brainwashed into working for the antagonist under the name \"Mr. L.\" The ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series features Luigi as a main protagonist; the events of the games focus on him and his brother Mario. He has appeared in all five ''Mario & Luigi'' games.\n\n===Other media===\n{{see also|Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros. (TV series)}}\n\nLuigi made his animated debut in the 1986 film ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!|Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach!]]''. In the film, he was voiced by [[Y\u016b Mizushima]] and had a different color scheme than he has today, sporting a blue cap, blue overalls, and a yellow shirt. This was because he was not yet given a consistent color scheme. In the film, Luigi was very greedy and even left Mario at one point to look for coins. He was also a little more serious than his brother Mario, who constantly daydreamed about Princess Peach, although he was not as brave as Mario.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nLuigi later made an appearance in the third of a trilogy of OVAs entitled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'' released in 1989, in which the Mario characters acted out the story of [[Snow White]]. He appears at the end of the video to save Mario and Peach from the Wicked Queen, portrayed by [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]].\n\nLuigi regularly appeared in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', airing from 1989 to 1990, which cast [[Danny Wells]] as both his live-action portrayal and voice. Like his brother, Luigi's voice actor changed in later cartoons, in his case to [[Tony Rosato]]. Even though he was not the starring character in the show, Luigi appeared in all 91 episodes of the three [[DiC]] Mario cartoons, in one of which his brother himself did not appear (\"Life's Ruff\" from ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'').\n\nLuigi played a different role in the [[Super Mario Bros.

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at [[Cambridge University]], and became President of the [[Footlights]] club, touring internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He is best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He had also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and has been a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for over 40 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read Economics and Politics before changing to read Law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the prestigious [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot;&gt;''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;footlights&quot;&gt;''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'' was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run, that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and the revue transferred to the West End in London, and then later taken to both New Zealand and to Broadway in the United States in September 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;footlights&quot;/&gt; He was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' in which he performed and co-wrote.&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] &quot;Did somebody call?&quot; uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.  Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt;\n\nIn the mid-'60s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the TV series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E. L. Wisty]]. Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary right-wing city gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; The &quot;[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]&quot; sketch was co-written by the four writers/performers of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrightRoss2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Tim Brooke-Taylor and John Cleese, from ''At Last the 1948 Show'', was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the Monty Python style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch where Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of [[John Cleese]] and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches mentions John Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named &quot;Christine Weadon&quot;, the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD with the title of ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]], however the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]] (and [[Bill Oddie]] joining the series for the second season).&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; Describing itself as &quot;An Encyclopedia of the Air&quot;, this series was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt;\n\nHe also appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a public information film for the now-defunct E111 form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' (His scene was the final one filmed for the movie). After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nTim appeared, with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden, in the [[Amnesty International]] show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' (during which they sang their hit song &quot;[[Funky Gibbon]]&quot;), and also appeared in the Amnesty International show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' in the sketches &quot;Top of the Form&quot; (with John Cleese, Graham Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot; (with John Cleese and Graham Chapman).\n\nBrooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, and Bill Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with their song &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;. Brooke-Taylor also appeared with Graeme Garden in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled &quot;antidote to panel games&quot; ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' which started in 1972, and Tim still appears regularly. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGraeme Garden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Tim Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game &quot;I Couldn't Disagree More&quot; he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied &quot;I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.&quot; This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in usual game show &quot;banter&quot;, but took the quiz itself seriously. He has appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. Around 1982, he branched out into pantomime as the Dame in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He is also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books based mainly on his radio and television work and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. He also took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]). Brooke-Taylor appeared on the premiere episode of the [[BBC]] golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrooke-Taylor married Christine Weadon in 1968 and they have two sons, Ben and Edward.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Who's Who on Television''&quot; \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1985). {{ISBN|0-907965-31-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Who's Who on Television''&quot; \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1988). {{ISBN|0-907965-49-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Berkshire.&lt;ref&gt;Old Wykehamist Record.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBrooke-Taylor was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to light entertainment.&lt;ref name=LG59808&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=12 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/13455/obes_all_round...|title=OBEs all round...|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9510000/9510621.stm|title=BBC News - Today - Graeme Garden 'thought OBE letter was a bill'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8568812/Birthday-Honours-List-2011-in-pictures.html?image=6|title=Birthday Honours List 2011 in pictures|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/goodies-pair-thrilled-with-obes-16010736.html|title=Goodies pair 'thrilled' with OBEs|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn 12 April 2020 it was confirmed that Brooke-Taylor had died after contracting [[coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]].<ref name=BBCDeath>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dies with coronavirus, aged 79 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52262490 |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=BBC News |date=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dead: Comedian and actor dies aged 79 after contracting coronavirus |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/tim-brooketaylor-dead-dies-79-coronavirus-a4412831.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; ;\n|- style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;\n!

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at [[Cambridge University]], and became President of the [[Footlights]] club, touring internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He is best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He had also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and has been a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for over 40 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read Economics and Politics before changing to read Law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the prestigious [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot;&gt;''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;footlights&quot;&gt;''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'' was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run, that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and the revue transferred to the West End in London, and then later taken to both New Zealand and to Broadway in the United States in September 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;footlights&quot;/&gt; He was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' in which he performed and co-wrote.&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] &quot;Did somebody call?&quot; uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.  Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt;\n\nIn the mid-'60s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the TV series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E. L. Wisty]]. Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary right-wing city gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; The &quot;[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]&quot; sketch was co-written by the four writers/performers of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrightRoss2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Tim Brooke-Taylor and John Cleese, from ''At Last the 1948 Show'', was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the Monty Python style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch where Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of [[John Cleese]] and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches mentions John Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named &quot;Christine Weadon&quot;, the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD with the title of ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]], however the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]] (and [[Bill Oddie]] joining the series for the second season).&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; Describing itself as &quot;An Encyclopedia of the Air&quot;, this series was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt;\n\nHe also appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a public information film for the now-defunct E111 form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' (His scene was the final one filmed for the movie). After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nTim appeared, with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden, in the [[Amnesty International]] show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' (during which they sang their hit song &quot;[[Funky Gibbon]]&quot;), and also appeared in the Amnesty International show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' in the sketches &quot;Top of the Form&quot; (with John Cleese, Graham Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot; (with John Cleese and Graham Chapman).\n\nBrooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, and Bill Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with their song &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;. Brooke-Taylor also appeared with Graeme Garden in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled &quot;antidote to panel games&quot; ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' which started in 1972, and Tim still appears regularly. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGraeme Garden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Tim Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game &quot;I Couldn't Disagree More&quot; he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied &quot;I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.&quot; This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in usual game show &quot;banter&quot;, but took the quiz itself seriously. He has appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. Around 1982, he branched out into pantomime as the Dame in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He is also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books based mainly on his radio and television work and the sports of golf and [[cricket]].

It had been originally KQXM, owned by Leslie Morgan Wills, but was sold before it signed on. The KDUO call letters were used as it is the acronym for the phrase \"'''D'''o '''U'''nto '''O'''thers\". KDUO was initially owned by the College of Medical Evangelists, a predecessor to [[Loma Linda University]], until being sold to the Southeastern California Broadcasting Company and then the KFXM Broadcasting Company in 1969.\n\nKDUO would later adopt an [[easy listening]] music format. However, the format was in decline in the 1980s and KDUO's ratings were in a steady decline.\n\nOn the morning of January 25, 1992 at 6 a.m, KDUO dropped the easy listening music format and began [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] as a \"public radio\" outlet. [[Radio personality|Disc jockeys]] from other radio stations took over the station and each played a different music format every hour, including classic rock, pop, country, oldies, and smooth jazz. On January 31, 1992 at 5:00 pm, the 97-hour stunt ended with an announcement that the new format would be [[oldies]]. The station adopted the name \"K-Hits 97.5\"; the first song played was \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" by [[The Beach Boys]]. Soon after, KDUO changed its call letters to '''KHTX'''. Despite the changes, the station's ratings did not improve much; this might be attributed to KHTX's marketing strategy. Instead of a direct challenge to [[KOLA]], which was airing a similar format via satellite, it elected to target [[KRTH]]. This move was not successful, likely because it did not cover the entire [[Greater Los Angeles area|Greater Los Angeles]] area and competition in the market was fierce as [[KCBS-FM]] aired an [[oldies]] music format at this time.\n\nIn 1994, KHTX dropped the oldies format in favor of [[country music]]. This put KHTX in direct competition with [[KFRG]], which had a loyal listening audience evident by its high ratings. KHTX was acquired by Noggales Broadcasting.\n\nKHTX's format was changed yet again in 1995, this time to Spanish hits under the call letters '''KVAR''' as \"Variedades 97.5\". In 1997, the station was rebranded as Latin pop format \"Super Estrella\" adopting the call letters of '''[[KSSE]]'''. On January 16, 2003, [[KSSE]] moved to 107.1 [[FM Broadcasting|FM]] and a call letter swap landed the present '''KLYY''' call letters on 97.5 [[FM Broadcasting|FM]].\n\nOn January 8, 2018, Entravision flipped the KLYY/[[KDLD|KDLD/KDLE]] trimulcast, carrying Spanish [[adult hits]] format \"Jos\u00e9 97.5\", to [[Regional Mexican]] as \"La Tricolor 97.5 y 103.1\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/122265/entravision-ditches-jose-twelve-markets/ |last=Venta |first=Lance |title=Entravision Brings La Tricolor To Los Angeles; Suavecita To 11 Markets |work=Radio Insight |date=January 10, 2018 |accessdate=May 3, 2018 }}</ref> Just four months later, on May 2, KLYY reverted to the previous Spanish hits format and \"Jos\u00e9 97.5\" branding.

The Laurentian warm, shallow seas and on [[Continental shelf|shelves]] a diverse assemblage of [[benthos]] evolved, including the largest [[trilobite]]s exceeding {{Convert|1|m|abbr=on}}.  The [[Old Red Sandstone]] Continent stretched across northern Laurentia and into Avalonia and Baltica but for most of the Devonian a narrow seaway formed a barrier where the North Atlantic would later open.  Tetrapods evolved from fish in the Late Devonian, with the oldest known fossils from Greenland.  Low sea-levels during the Early Devonian produced natural barriers in Laurussia which resulted in [[Geologic province|provincialism]] within the benthic fauna.  In Laurentia the [[Transcontinental Arch]] divided [[brachiopod]]s into two provinces, with one of them confined to a large embayment west of the Appalachians.  By the Middle Devonian, these two provinces had been united into one and the closure of the Rheic Ocean finally united faunas across Laurussia.  High plankton productivity from the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary resulted in [[anoxic event]]s that left [[black shale]]s in the basins of Laurentia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cocks|Torsvik|2011|loc= Facies and faunas, pp. 10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n===Pangaea===\n{{Main|Pangaea}}\n[[File:Laurasia 330Ma.jpg|thumb|Pangaea formed during the closure of the Rheic Ocean 330&nbsp;Mya (early Carboniferous) (view centred on 30\u00b0S,30\u00b0E)]]\nThe subduction of the Iapetus Ocean resulted in the first contact between Laurussia and Gondwana in the Late Devonian and terminated in full collision or the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian/Variscan orogeny]] in the early Carboniferous (340&nbsp;Mya).<ref name=\"Ziegler-2012\" />  The Variscan orogeny closed the [[Rheic Ocean]] (between Avalonia and Armorica) and the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (between Armorica and Gondwana) to form the supercontinent Pangaea.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rey|Burg|Casey|1997|loc=Introduction, pp. 1\u20132}}</ref>  The Variscan orogeny is complex and the exact timing and the order of the collisions between involved microcontinent has been debated for decades.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eckelmann|Nesbor|K\u00f6nigshof|Linnemann|2014|loc=Introduction, pp. 1484\u20131486}}</ref>\n\nPangaea was completely assembled by the Permian except for the Asian blocks.

Caused by the detachment of subducted mantle slabs, this reorganisation resulted in rising [[mantle plume]]s that produced [[large igneous province]]s when they reached the crust.  This tectonic activity also resulted in the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]].  Tentional stresses across Eurasia developed into a large system of rift basins (Urengoy, East Uralian-Turgay and Khudosey) and floodbasalts in the [[West Siberian petroleum basin|West Siberian Basin]], the [[Pechora coal basin|Pechora Basin]], and South China.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nikishin|Ziegler|Abbott|Brunet|2002|loc=Introduction, pp. 4\u20135; Fig. 4, p. 8}}</ref>\n\nLaurasia and Gondwana were equal in size but had distinct geological histories.  Gondwana was assembled before the formation of Pangaea, but the assembly of Laurasia occurred during and after the formation of the supercontinent.  These differences resulted in different patterns of basin formation and transport of sediments.  East Antarctica was the highest ground within Pangaea and produced sediments that were transported across eastern Gondwana but never reached Laurasia.

As a result, two groups of [[Tribosphenida|tribosphenic mammals]] evolved separately on the newly formed landmasses: the [[Boreosphenida]] (marsupials and placentals) in Laurasia and the [[Australosphenida]] (monotremes and extinct relatives) in Gondwana.  The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.

Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.

In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia.

The Laurentian warm, shallow seas and on [[Continental shelf|shelves]] a diverse assemblage of [[benthos]] evolved, including the largest [[trilobite]]s exceeding {{Convert|1|m|abbr=on}}.  The [[Old Red Sandstone]] Continent stretched across northern Laurentia and into Avalonia and Baltica but for most of the Devonian a narrow seaway formed a barrier where the North Atlantic would later open.  Tetrapods evolved from fish in the Late Devonian, with the oldest known fossils from Greenland.  Low sea-levels during the Early Devonian produced natural barriers in Laurussia which resulted in [[Geologic province|provincialism]] within the benthic fauna.  In Laurentia the [[Transcontinental Arch]] divided [[brachiopod]]s into two provinces, with one of them confined to a large embayment west of the Appalachians.  By the Middle Devonian, these two provinces had been united into one and the closure of the Rheic Ocean finally united faunas across Laurussia.  High plankton productivity from the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary resulted in [[anoxic event]]s that left [[black shale]]s in the basins of Laurentia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cocks|Torsvik|2011|loc= Facies and faunas, pp. 10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n===Pangaea===\n{{Main|Pangaea}}\n[[File:Laurasia 330Ma.jpg|thumb|Pangaea formed during the closure of the Rheic Ocean 330&nbsp;Mya (early Carboniferous) (view centred on 30\u00b0S,30\u00b0E)]]\nThe subduction of the Iapetus Ocean resulted in the first contact between Laurussia and Gondwana in the Late Devonian and terminated in full collision or the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian/Variscan orogeny]] in the early Carboniferous (340&nbsp;Mya).<ref name=\"Ziegler-2012\" />  The Variscan orogeny closed the [[Rheic Ocean]] (between Avalonia and Armorica) and the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (between Armorica and Gondwana) to form the supercontinent Pangaea.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rey|Burg|Casey|1997|loc=Introduction, pp. 1\u20132}}</ref>  The Variscan orogeny is complex and the exact timing and the order of the collisions between involved microcontinent has been debated for decades.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eckelmann|Nesbor|K\u00f6nigshof|Linnemann|2014|loc=Introduction, pp. 1484\u20131486}}</ref>\n\nPangaea was completely assembled by the Permian except for the Asian blocks.

East Antarctica was the highest ground within Pangaea and produced sediments that were transported across eastern Gondwana but never reached Laurasia.
