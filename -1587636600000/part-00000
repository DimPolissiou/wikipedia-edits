It was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=cannes/><ref name=rogerebert/>\n\n==Plot==\nMarco Silvestri is a seaman who works abroad and rarely sees his sister and her family. After the suicide of his brother-in-law, who he was good friends with, he returns. At the urging of his sister, Sandra, who believes that her husband's death was caused by a [[creditor]], Marco tries to avenge the death. He moves into an apartment above the one occupied by the creditor, Edouard Laporte, and begins an affair with his wife, Rapha\u00eblle. Marco discovers that his sister is deep in debt and that his niece, Justine, has been hospitalized and might need reconstructive surgery as her vagina has been badly damaged. After some investigation, he believes that Edouard was the one who injured his niece by penetrating her with a [[corncob]].\n\nJustine eventually runs away from hospital. Her friends show Marco images of her going to a sex club with Edouard and her father. After viewing the images, Marco realizes that his sister and brother-in-law allowed Edouard to use their daughter for sexual favors in return for money to keep their failing shoe factory afloat. Later, Justine and her friends leave, but she deliberately crashes their car, killing them all.\n\nDiscovering that Rapha\u00eblle and Marco are sleeping together, Edouard leaves her, taking their young son. When he returns to collect some of his son's things and to tell Rapha\u00eblle that he and the boy are moving to Geneva, Marco tries to stop him.

After the suicide of his brother-in-law, he returns home. At the urging of his sister, Sandra, who believes that her husband's death was caused by a [[creditor]], Marco tries to avenge his family. He moves into an apartment above the one occupied by the creditor, Edouard Laporte, and begins an affair with his wife, Rapha\u00eblle. Marco discovers that his sister is deep in debt and that his niece, Justine, has been hospitalized and might need reconstructive surgery as her vagina has been badly damaged. After some investigation, he believes that Edouard was the one who injured his niece by penetrating her with a [[corncob]].\n\nJustine eventually runs away from hospital. Her friends show Marco images of her going to a sex club with Edouard and her father. After viewing the images, Marco realizes that his sister and brother-in-law allowed Edouard to use their daughter for sexual favors in return for money to keep their failing shoe factory afloat. Later, Justine and her friends leave, but she deliberately crashes their car, killing them all.\n\nDiscovering that Rapha\u00eblle and Marco are sleeping together, Edouard leaves her, taking their young son. When he returns to collect some of his son's things and to tell Rapha\u00eblle that he and the boy are moving to Geneva, Marco tries to stop him. In the ensuing fight, Marco is shot and killed by Rapha\u00eblle. Sandra receives a video in the mail which she watches with Justine's doctor.
