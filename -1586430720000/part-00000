He joined Throop's board of trustees in 1907, and soon began developing it and the whole of Pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination. He engineered the appointment of [[James Augustin Brown Scherer|James A. B.

While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'':\n\n<blockquote>Throop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation.

On November 29, 1921, the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the Institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time \"to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science, basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry; broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as English, history, and economics; and vitalizing all the work of the Institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research\".<ref name=\"Caltech Catalog\"/> In 1923, Millikan was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. In 1925, the school established a department of geology and hired [[William Bennett Munro]], then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at [[Harvard University]], to create a division of [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s at Caltech. In 1928, a division of [[biology]] was established under the leadership of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the [[chromosome]] in heredity. In 1930, [[Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor George MacGinitie. In 1926, a graduate school of [[aeronautics]] was created, which eventually attracted [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]].

According to tradition, a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a [[triboluminescence|triboluminescent]] spark. This yearly event involves a crowd of observers, who try to spot the elusive spark. The title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous [[oil-drop experiment|Millikan oil-drop experiment]] which measured ''e'', the [[elementary charge|elemental unit of electrical charge]].\n\nOn Ditch Day, the seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. Over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen. Each group of seniors designs a \"stack\" to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year.\n\nAnother long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's \"[[Ride of the Valkyries]]\" at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time (except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of ''[[The Ring Cycle]]''), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. \n{{clear}}\n\n==== Pranks ====\n[[File:Fleming cannon firing.jpg|thumb|The Fleming cannon]]\n\nCaltech students have been known for the many [[Student prank|prank]]s (also known as \"RFs\").<ref name=\"Caltech1\">{{cite news|last=Hiszpanski|first=Anna|title=Fleming Cannon Gone|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1976/1/2006_04_01_107_21.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2014|newspaper=The California Tech|date=April 3, 2006|volume=107|number=21|page=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419014754/http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1976/1/2006_04_01_107_21.pdf|archive-date=April 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two most famous in recent history are the changing of the [[Hollywood Sign]] to read \"Caltech\", by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the scoreboard to read Caltech 38, MIT 9 during the [[1984 Rose Bowl|1984 Rose Bowl Game]].

These include covering up the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the main building fa\u00e7ade with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology\". A group of [[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT hackers]] responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read \"The Only Institute of Technology.\" Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class that had MIT written on the front and \"...{{nbsp}}because not everyone can go to Caltech\" along with an image of a palm tree on the back.\n\nMIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe & Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.\n\nOn April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from ''The California Tech'', Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed fake copies of ''The Tech'', MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included \"MIT Invents the Interweb\", \"Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate'\", and \"[[Infinite Corridor]] Not Actually Infinite\".\n\nIn December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A \"sold\" banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a \"Welcome to Caltech East: School of the Humanities\" banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance. Newspapers and T-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the \"curriculum change.\"<ref>[http://east.caltech.edu/ Caltech Opens Humanities School at MIT Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202233541/http://east.caltech.edu/ |date=December 2, 2009 }}, December 6, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 Citybeats: Future Tournament of Roses chief vows even better parades] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212234513/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 |date=December 12, 2009 }}, ''Pasadena Star-News'', December 6, 2009</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, MIT students attempted to put a [[TARDIS]], the time machine from the BBC's ''[[Doctor Who]]'', onto a roof.

For example, the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.\n\nThrough the late 1990s, the only exception to the honor code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy, and alcohol policy. Although both policies are presented in the Honor System Handbook given to new members of the Caltech community, some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Rodriguez\n  | first =Juan\n  | title =Ricketts Pres.

While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'':\n\n<blockquote>Throop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation.

On November 29, 1921, the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the Institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time \"to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science, basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry; broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as English, history, and economics; and vitalizing all the work of the Institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research\".<ref name=\"Caltech Catalog\"/> In 1923, Millikan was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. In 1925, the school established a department of geology and hired [[William Bennett Munro]], then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at [[Harvard University]], to create a division of [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s at Caltech. In 1928, a division of [[biology]] was established under the leadership of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the [[chromosome]] in heredity. In 1930, [[Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor George MacGinitie. In 1926, a graduate school of [[aeronautics]] was created, which eventually attracted [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]]. K\u00e1rm\u00e1n later helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and played an integral part in establishing Caltech as one of the world's centers for [[rocket|rocket science]].

Each group of seniors designs a \"stack\" to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year.\n\nAnother long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's \"[[Ride of the Valkyries]]\" at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available.

A group of [[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT hackers]] responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read \"The Only Institute of Technology.\" Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class that had MIT written on the front and \"...{{nbsp}}because not everyone can go to Caltech\" along with an image of a palm tree on the back.\n\nMIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe & Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.\n\nOn April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from ''The California Tech'', Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed fake copies of ''The Tech'', MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included \"MIT Invents the Interweb\", \"Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate'\", and \"[[Infinite Corridor]] Not Actually Infinite\".\n\nIn December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A \"sold\" banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a \"Welcome to Caltech East: School of the Humanities\" banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance. Newspapers and T-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the \"curriculum change.\"<ref>[http://east.caltech.edu/ Caltech Opens Humanities School at MIT Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202233541/http://east.caltech.edu/ |date=December 2, 2009 }}, December 6, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 Citybeats: Future Tournament of Roses chief vows even better parades] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212234513/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 |date=December 12, 2009 }}, ''Pasadena Star-News'', December 6, 2009</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, MIT students attempted to put a [[TARDIS]], the time machine from the BBC's ''[[Doctor Who]]'', onto a roof.

When heated, the mugs turn orange, display a palm tree, and read \"Caltech The Hotter Institute of Technology.\" Identical mugs continue to be sold at the Caltech campus store.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bookstore.caltech.edu/catalogs/CatalogProductItems?Title=Drinkware&Sku=1*100985&Delc=Merchandise|title=CatalogProductITems \u2013 Caltech Bookstore|publisher=|accessdate=July 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930081159/https://bookstore.caltech.edu/catalogs/CatalogProductItems?Title=Drinkware&Sku=1*100985&Delc=Merchandise|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Honor code ====\nLife in the Caltech community is governed by the [[honor code]], which simply states: \"No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.\" This is enforced by a Board of Control, which consists of undergraduate students,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://donut.caltech.edu/about/boc/ug_handbook.php |title=The Honor System Handbook from the Board of Control at Caltech.edu |publisher=Donut.caltech.edu |accessdate=October 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106150251/http://donut.caltech.edu/about/boc/ug_handbook.php |archive-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> and by a similar body at the graduate level, called the Graduate Honor Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/hc |title=Graduate Studies Office \u2013 The Honor Code |publisher=www.gradoffice.caltech.edu |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408100956/http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/hc |archive-date=April 8, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe honor code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows Caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere. For example, the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.\n\nThrough the late 1990s, the only exception to the honor code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy, and alcohol policy. Although both policies are presented in the Honor System Handbook given to new members of the Caltech community, some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Rodriguez\n  | first =Juan\n  | title =Ricketts Pres.

The promotion of physics made him a public figure of science, although his Nobel-winning work in [[quantum electrodynamics]] was already very established in the scientific community. [[Murray Gell-Mann]], a Nobel-winning physicist, introduced a classification of [[hadrons]] and went on to postulate the existence of [[quark]]s, which is currently accepted as part of the [[Standard Model]]. Long-time Caltech President [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] was the first to calculate the charge of the [[electron]] with his well-known [[oil-drop experiment]], while [[Richard Chace Tolman]] is remembered for his contributions to [[cosmology]] and [[statistical mechanics]]. 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] winner [[H. David Politzer]] is a current professor at Caltech, as is astrophysicist and author [[Kip Thorne]] and eminent mathematician [[Barry Simon]]. [[Linus Pauling]] pioneered [[quantum chemistry]] and [[molecular biology]], and went on to discover the nature of the chemical bond in 1939. Seismologist [[Charles Richter]], also an alumnus, developed the magnitude scale that bears his name, the [[Richter magnitude scale]] for measuring the power of earthquakes. One of the founders of the geochemistry department, [[Clair Patterson]] was the first to accurately determine the age of the Earth via lead:uranium ratio in meteorites. In engineering, [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] made many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] airflow characterization. A repeating pattern of swirling [[vortices]] is named after him, the [[von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]]. Participants in von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's GALCIT project included [[Frank Malina]], who helped develop the [[WAC Corporal]] which was the first U.S. rocket to reach the edge of space, [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]], a pioneer in the development of liquid and solid rocket fuels who designed the first castable composite-based rocket motor, and [[Qian Xuesen]], who was dubbed the \"Father of Chinese Rocketry\". More recently, [[Michael E.
