It has been published by [[Shueisha]] since May 2008, first under their [[Super Dash Bunko]] imprint (which was abolished in 2014) and then under their Dash X Bunko imprint since. The series concluded with the 21st volume on November 22, 2017. It has been adapted into a [[manga]] series published in [[Shueisha]]'s ''Super Dash & Go!''. A 13-episode [[anime]] television series, produced by [[Diomed\u00e9a]] aired in Japan on [[AT-X (company)|AT-X]] and [[Tokyo MX]] beginning in July 2012 and ended in September 2012. [[Section23 Films#Sentai Filmworks|Sentai Filmworks]] released an English dub of the TV series in North America. The novel's story focuses on Godou Kusanagi, a former middle school baseball player who was forced to retire due to injury, as he becomes a Campione after killing the god of war, [[Verethragna]]. Hanabee Entertainment later licensed the series on February 23, 2014 alongside [[From the New World (novel)|From the New World]] and [[The Familiar of Zero]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-02-24/hanabee-announces-new-acquisitions-including-the-familar-of-zero|title=Hanabee Announces New Acquisitions Including ''The Familar &#91;sic&#93; of Zero''|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=February 23, 2014|accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGodou Kusanagi, a former middle school baseball player who had to retire due to injury, is asked by his grandfather to return a stone tablet to a friend in [[Sardinia]] named Lucrezia Zora. After meeting the demonically manipulative sword-mistress Erica Blandelli, he encounters the god of war, [[Verethragna]]. After [[Deicide|killing]] the god, Godou becomes a Campione, or god slayer. His duty is to fight heretical gods who start changing things to suit themselves, usually at the expense of the people in the area. One of the problems associated with being a Campione, is that his status keeps attracting attention and difficult girls. Erica, who strongly professes her love for him, usually creates awkward and misunderstood situations for him in particular. Every time he fights a god, he kisses one of the girls he has brought with him.\n\n==Characters==\n<!--Adding spoiler warnings to or removing plot details from the article without good reason are contrary to Wikipedia policies and guidelines.

He is a retired middle school baseball player (wild pitch injured and weakened right shoulder), after his grandfather asked him to return a stone tablet in [[Sardinia]] to [[Campione&#33;#Lucrezia Zora|Lucrezia Zora]]. Upon his encounter with [[Campione&#33;#Erica Blandelli|Erica Blandelli]], he manages to slay the god [[Campione&#33;#Verethragna|Verethragna]], a Persian god of Victory. After obtaining Verethragna's Golden Sword and becoming a Campione, Godou obtains the abilities of Verethragna's ten incarnations: Gale (wind), Bull (strength), White Stallion (sun), Camel (leg strength), Boar (trample), Youth (divine protection), Raptor (speed), Ram (resurrection), Goat (thunder) and Warrior (Golden Sword). The Golden Sword allows Godou to seal the authority of a god, only if he accomplish the condition of using the power which is to have substantial knowledge about his enemy. He receives the information via kissing one of the female protagonists, which is the only way to infuse the information into a Campione due to their incredible magic resistance. This and ingestion are the only ways someone can have their magic, benign or malign, bypass a majority of the resistance. He is a little afraid of women due to being completely dense to their feelings, numerous interrogations and punishments from his sister, along with Erica's pranks and occasional blackmail. He tends to take what people say at face value, missing their intentions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Erica Blandelli}}|\u30a8\u30ea\u30ab\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30ea|Erika Buranderri}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Monica Rial]]<ref name=\"engcast\"/>}}\n:Erica is an Italian girl who is member of the {{nihongo|Copper Black Cross|\u8d64\u9285\u9ed2\u5341\u5b57|Shakud\u014d Kuro J\u016bji}}, one of the European magic organizations that inherited secret rites from the [[Knights Templar]] and is based in [[Milan]], Italy. Their battle tactics and colors (red and black) has likened them to that of red devils. Holding the rank of Great Knight and the title of Diavolo Rosso (Dark Red Devil), she is a magic swordsman that through coincidence meets Godou and assists him while he was in Sardinia, Italy. She ends up falling in love with him. She uses her weapon Cuore di Leone (Heart of Lion), an enchanted sword that she can summon to her hand. She also has the ability to use the sword to summon a large silver lion which can attack in place of Erica in the anime. Her weapon can transform into a spear, lance or sword for offense, or simply a shield for defense. Its true form is that of a long, silvery, broadsword infused with the spell words of David which she must cast, giving it the ability to harm gods. She is able to multiply the Cuore di Leone, even after throwing it, or in its lion form. Whether there is a restriction on how many duplicates she can make, due to ability or power, is unknown but so far has made up to thirteen lions and seven spears. Her lions are infused with intelligence allowing them to act independently just like real lions, but under her control. Although she fares well against [[Campione&#33;#Liliana Kranjcar|Liliana Kranjcar]] in martial arts as a knight, her magic expertise excels Liliana's and can be even be considered unrivaled in the areas of iron alchemy, fire, creation, transformation, destruction and reinforcement spells. Erica can use leap magic, able to boost jumping while in midair. She is an Italian girl who likes to keep herself in control of her own situation, thus she can be very forceful in her affection and jealousy. However, she knows her own limitations to be able to help and protect Godou, and she is willing to be open-minded enough to allow the other girls to become additional \"wives\", although she is to be recognized as his number one wife.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Yuri Mariya}}|\u4e07\u91cc\u8c37 \u7950\u7406|Mariya Yuri}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Hilary Haag]]<ref name=\"engcast\"/>}}\n:Yuri is a dark-haired Hime-Miko (princess [[shrine maiden]]) under Musashino, an organization whose duty is to protect [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]], handling the greatest tasks and responsibilities. She is subject to the authority of The Committee for the Compilation of True History, a Japanese government based magic organization, who aims to use Godou to protect Japan while minimizing his potential as a threat. She is quite harsh on Godou the majority of the time due to the misunderstanding that Godou is doing something lecherous, but is endured by Godou as he sees the self-sacrifice that lies behind it. Often called a [[Yamato nadeshiko]], Yuri is [[clairvoyant]] and uses magic to heal and send knowledge to Godou. In terms of fighting level and physical stamina, she is the weakest, shown when playing sports, but excels at support and is unrivaled at information gathering. She is an excellent cook in both taste and visual appeal, and the head of the [[Tea Ceremony]] Club that God\u014du's little sister [[Campione&#33;#Shizuka Kusanagi|Shizuka Kusanagi]] is a member of. Like Erica, she falls in love with Godou when she sees how willing he is to put his all to protect others. Yuri gets upset when she sees Godou with one of the other girls, (which she misinterprets as flirting), or extremely serious she unknowingly smiles while giving off an extremely cold presence like a [[yaksha]].\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Liliana Kranj\u010dar}}|\u30ea\u30ea\u30a2\u30ca\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30cb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30eb|Ririana Kuranicharu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Eri Kitamura]]|Genevieve Simmons<ref name=\"engcast\"/>}}\n:Liliana is the Croatian childhood friend of Erica and belongs to the organization {{nihongo|Bronze Black Cross|\u9752\u9285\u9ed2\u5341\u5b57|Seid\u014d Kuro J\u016bji}} which is a mage/knight organization similar to, yet occasionally working but usually competing with, the Copper Black Cross. The organization serves the Campione [[Campione&#33;#Salvatore Doni|Salvatore Doni]], although her grandfather and some other members favor and support the Campione [[Campione&#33;#Sasha Dejanstahl Voban|Sasha Dejanstahl Voban]] by preference. The Bronze Black Cross are referred to as blue berserkers. Liliana has been also been called the Sword Fairy and Blue Witch, although these seem to be more nicknames as she is rarely called either while Erica is called or calls herself Diavolo Rosso often. She possesses the sword Il Maestro, able to fight with great speed, excellent magic, and flying attacks similar to that of a falcon. When released, takes on its true appearance of a naginata, which releases spell melodies when swung that can disrupt the concentration of even the toughest of opponents, although since magic in nature it has limit, if any effect, on Campiones or gods. However, in naginata form the spell words of David are infused into it as well giving it the ability to harm gods. She is often compared to be on equal footing to Erica in both martial skills and combat, as well as known by people to be among the top of the current generation of Great Knights. However, due to her direct and upfront nature, she does not have the political acumen Erica possesses and is more gullible to Erica and Karen's pranks. She is also in love with Godou, but does her best to hide it from others. Usually covering up her desire to be in close proximity or help Godou with claims of merely serving her role as a knight or bodyguard. She is a silver-haired girl with a svelte body. Though she lacks the well-curved, voluptuous figure Erica possesses, her beauty is more along that of an ephemeral, delicate fairy. She is great at housework and cooking, is a descendant of witches, and has the hobby of writing embarrassing romantic novels. Her expertise over Erica is in flight magic, witchcraft, potions, communicating with plants and animals, and spells relating to water, earth, and sky. This allows her to make flying attacks similar to a sparrow, but with the ability to halt in midair, unaffected by gravity, before continuing her attack. This also gives her the ability to swim through water as easily as a fish, harvest herbs, cast hard spells and create difficult potions. She proved invaluable in not only opening a gate to the astral realm to rescue Godou and Erica, but the knowledge to create the potion required to be unaffected by the astral realm's environment. She can also summon and use the Bow of Jonathon, which is powerful enough to harm gods, such as [[Campione&#33;#Perseus|Perseus]]. Although it appears she shoots four arrows at a time, only one is real, the others are illusions to increase the chances of the real arrow hitting.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Ena Seishuin}}|\u9752\u6d32\u9662 \u6075\u90a3|Seish\u016bin Ena}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yuka Sait\u014d (voice actress)|Yuka Sait\u014d]]|[[Carli Mosier]]<ref name=\"engcast\"/>}}\n:Ena is a girl with long, shiny, black hair with red eyes. She is a Hime Miko as well as a [[Yamato nadeshiko]] but with a figure similar to Erica's. She is the strongest of all Japan's Hime Miko, being specially trained by [[Susanoo]]. She is aggressive, impulsive, and has a tendency to ignore complicated things. Due to the harsh training she endured, Ena lacks a bit of common sense in everyday life, but this has made her an unpredictable fighter as she relies on instinct. She possesses the sword Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi and can draw power from it, becoming [[demonic possession|possessed]] in the process. However, she can only do this for short periods before her body starts taking damage. Also, if she takes in too much power, there's a chance of Susanoo's instincts or Ama no Murakumo taking control of her and running amok. When this happens she can fight on par with Campiones and gods alike. Erica considers her a threat to her position with Godou, due to Ena being another harem member with both a strong personality and a voluptuous, curvy figure; Liliana and Yuri are more submissive and easier for Erica to either manipulate or dominate. Erica believes that Ena can get close to Godou as a \"guy\" with her forthright nature before showing some feminine charm as a \"girl\". Due to isolation from society during her training, Ena is not very experienced with relationships in general. Although her mission was to seduce Godou, she knew that he was her soulmate the instant she saw him and has completely fallen for him to the point that she is willing to be his mistress as long as she can be with him. She misunderstands his wanting to develop their relationship slowly as well as his desire to become a man good enough for her as signs that she is not good enough to be his wife, which frustrates Godou as much as Erica's wild antics do.\n\n===Campiones===\nCampione, or God Slayers, are humans who have obtain the abilities of the first slain god called Authorities. They have enhanced bodies that can heal from even mortal wounds much faster and magic abilities which exceed that of the most powerful mages. They also have very high magic immunity which protects them from mortal enemy magic, but also prevents them from receiving beneficial magic such as teaching or healing. Thus, a caster has to deliver the spells internally through methods such as kissing or ingestion. The number of the Campiones are in chronological from when they first appeared, not a reference to power level or actual age.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Sasha Dejanstahl Voban}}|\u30b5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u00b7\u30c7\u30e4\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30eb\u00b7\u30a6\u30a9\u30d0\u30f3|S\u0101sha Deyansut\u0101ru Voban}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Unsh\u014d Ishizuka]]|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:Voban is the 1st Campione and of Hungarian descent. He is a cold man whose only desire is to battle worthy opponents and obtaining abilities. His normal appearance is that of a healthy and athletic old man with gray hair. His true form is the appearance of a huge werewolf. Voban is the oldest of the Campiones, as he has defeated and usurped the authorities of Apollo and Osiris. He has the abilities to create severe storms, summon swarms of dire wolves, swallow sun-based attacks, turning people into salt with his eyes and summon the bodies of those he has killed to serve him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Luo Hao}}|\u7f85\u6fe0|Ruo Hao}}\n:Luo Hao is the 2nd Campione and of Chinese descent. She was a great figure who carried herself with royal splendor. She possess the full set of the five Confucian virtues: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, knowledge and integrity. She was seeking a worthy opponent who could defeat her just like Verethragna had before Godou met her. Also, she believes her valor to be the greatest in the world, she places greater value on herself than anyone else on the Earth and is undecided on whether humanity is worth saving or not. Despite all this, Luo Hao is very observant of formality and propriety, as well as the rules of etiquette. She is able to control flowers, albeit harmless, poisonous or dangerous. With over two hundred years experience she has mastered Daoist arts which allows her to use techniques similar to European magic spells. Another ability is changing herself to a small lizard, although whether it is an Authority or a Daoist art is unknown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Aisha}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3|A\u012bsha}}\n:Aisha is the 3rd Campione and of Alexandrian descent. She has the nicknames the Eternal Beauty, Goddess of Caves or Mysterious Queen of Caves, which refers to her ability to create a hole to another world and has the appearance of a cave. She is a beautiful maiden with black hair and olive skin, having the personality of a wanderer. The Authorities she possess do not have any combat potential, however one of the Authorities she received from Persephone allows her to share the energy of life with living things which heals even severe wounds. Although, if she has a day to prep she can flip the Authority's \"spring side\" into the \"winter side\", which can remove life, but Godou stopped her from actually using it the time she considered it. Another she usurped from a certain Catholic saint in the Catholic religion causes everyone to like her which helps keep her out of trouble in areas where the locals ostracize or treat strangers with hostility. Although if she does not keep the effect toned down or inspires a group of defenders too often then she could unintentionally create a cult that would lay down their lives for her. This is considered a most troublesome Authority by Saint Raffaello in that most of the holes link to the past. This is a problem in that any changes in the past could affect the future similar to the [[butterfly effect]]. The main problem with this Authority is that she has no control over what time period the holes open up to, and the holes appearing and sucking her in whenever she forgets about having the Authority. Also, the connection in time is not stable so someone entering the hole a few minutes earlier or later than another person will still arrive at the same spot, but days or years before or after the other.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Annie Charlton}}|\u30a2\u30cb\u30fc\u00b7\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c8\u30f3|An\u012b Ch\u0101ruton}}\n:Annie is the 4th Campion and of American descent. She also goes by the masked identity of John Pluto Smith. A serious minded individual, she only lets her feelings show when she is drunk. When in the armored form of John Pluto Smith, she acts much more relaxed and flamboyant. At some point the Smith persona turned into a semi-split personality, which seems to express all the emotions and stuff Annie has been heavily suppressing. So Annie and Smith are aware and know everything the other personality experiences, but thoughts and actions reflect whichever one is out. She starts to grow feelings toward Godou after fighting alongside him and Luo Hao, although she denies to herself due to the difference between their ages and Godou's reputation of being a playboy. Has usurped the Authorities of Tezcatlipoca, which requires sacrificing sources to temporarily transform into a jaguar, and Artemis, which automatically reloads arrows in a large, six-shooter revolver. Annie wears dark leather suits, rectangular half-glasses, with short fiery red hair. John Pluto Smith wears various cloths that present the proper atmosphere of a hero over armor that makes her look like an insect, primarily the helmet, and hides the fact that Smith is a woman.\n \n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Alexander Gascoigne}}|\u30a2\u30ec\u30af\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u00b7\u30ac\u30b9\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3|Arekusand\u0101 Gasukoin}}\n:Alexander is the 5th Campione and of British descent. He is also known as Black Prince Alec, leader of political organization Royal Arsenal that oppose Princess Alice's organization Witengamot. He looks like a young man with black hair. He has an arrogant personality, willing to work with Alice when their goals align on issues. He has the Authority of Fallen Angel Ramiel \"Black Lightning,\" an ability that grants him super speed. He can also turn himself into a lightning avatar made of plasma to travel even faster, evade physical injury and use lightning strikes. However, if the lightning avatar is dispelled, he will revert to his normal physical form. He also defeated the Minotaur Granting, which creates an underground labyrinth where he always understands the full layout and where his opponents are located, and the three Judging Furies, which returns all damage done in front of him back to an opponent using any physical or magical form of destructive power.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Salvatore Doni}}|\u30b5\u30eb\u30f4\u30a1\u30c8\u30fc\u30ec\u00b7\u30c9\u30cb|Saruvat\u014dre Doni}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takuya Eguchi]]|Andrew Love}}\n:Salvatore is the 6th Campione and of Italian descent. He has blonde hair and has a scar going around his right shoulder where it meets the arm He has a carefree personality, considered by most to be a complete idiot with no common sense and lacks magical skills. He is on equal levels with [[Campione&#33;#Godou Kusanagi|Godou Kusanagi]] as a Campione, as they had a draw on their fight. Salvatore is also notably hated or strongly disliked by the Campione [[Campione&#33;#Sasha Dejanstahl Voban|Sasha Dejanstahl Voban]], for stealing his prey that he had summoned specifically to relieve boredom. He is feared for all the trouble his antics causes and his utter lack of understanding and caring about serious issues, as he believes his scabbard is the solution to every issue. He does not see Godou as a friend or an ally, but an adversary. He therefore anticipated for a rematch, warning Godou about Voban entering Japan as an excuse for Godou to grow stronger and faster. He is a former Templar candidate, but failed due to abysmally poor magic scores and ability well below that of a young novice who never heard of magic before. He is considered an exceptional prodigy with swords and always carries one around with him wherever he goes just in case he gets into an interesting fight. The Copper Black Cross answers to him since his home base coincides with their headquarters. He has usurped three Authorities from the king of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. Nuadha (Ripping Arm of Silver) allows him to turn his arm silver and gaining the ability to cut through anything. Nordic hero Siegfried (Man of Steel) provides a body of steel that cannot be damaged but increases his mass in proportion to how strong the protection is. Vulcan (Return to Medieval Style) reduces the technology level of an area to that of the Middle Ages for about half a day. His fourth Authority he usurped from Dionysus, which causes all magical powers to overload, activate and run out of control. His creed and spell words is that he will not allow anything to exist in the world that he can not cut.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Uldin}}|\u30a6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3|Urudin}}\n:Uldin is the 8th Campione and of Hunnic descent. He is a warrior, who is compared to Godou, due to similarities in personalities and fighting temperaments, possibly due to being an unrecorded and distant ancestor. He has a habit of acting on his impulses and therefore has a harem of women spread throughout the world, although he is apparently married to four of them, with Ruska (first wife) and Clotilde (fourth wife) making their appearance along with Uldin. His other two wives are at two other fortresses he controls. As with the time period feels that if he likes a woman it is okay to carry her off as she will eventually fall for him like the others anyway. His primary Authority that is used is Dragon Tamer, which allows him to control the dragons that he keeps in the forest near his castle. He also can turn dragon bones into an army of smaller skeleton dragons similar to the story of sowing teeth of dragons into the ground to raise an army. He is also known as Tyr's Sword due to having Authority of Tyr, which allows him to temporarily resurrect his army of dragons to fight again.\n\n===Heretic Gods===\nHeretic Gods, or Rogue Gods, are gods that come to exist in real world, rather than staying as myths. A human who weakens and killed a Heretic God single-handedly will gain their abilities and become a Campione, while Campiones can also kill other Heretic Gods single-handedly to gain more abilities. Killing a Heretic God who is already weakened by someone else or cooperating with other people during the fight to kill them will not receive any ability. Note that even if killed, Heretic Gods will resurrect later as long as the myth is still known among humans.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Athena}}|\u30a2\u30c6\u30ca|Atena}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Ogura]]|[[Brittney Karbowski]]}}\n:Athena has a cold personality and seems willing to do anything to reclaim her lost powers. Her appearance is that of a young teenager with silver hair and black eyes similar to those of an owl. After using the Gorgoneion to transform herself into true her goddess, she was defeated by [[Campione&#33;#Godou Kusanagi|Godou Kusanagi]] and [[Campione&#33;#Erica Blandelli|Erica Blandelli]], returning to her youth form. She later returns to help Godou by offering information to defeat [[Campione&#33;#Perseus|Perseus]]. In exchange for her assistance, Godou had to promise her that he would fulfill any one wish. It is stated that she lost her age and rank before becoming a Heretic God, so her young form appears to be a punishment of some kind. While she claims that she does not want anyone else to defeat Godou but her, she does seem to have taken an interest in Godou's growth and development. It is possible that, like Erica and the others, having watched and interacted with him she has started to develop feelings for him that she is not aware of or willing to admit to herself. This is shown when she sought his help after losing her memories. When she talked with [[Campione&#33;#Shizuka Kusanagi|Shizuka Kusanagi]], it is hinted that her feelings towards Godou might be affectionate.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Verethragna}}|\u30a6\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30b0\u30ca|Urusuraguna}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Junko Minagawa]]|[[Leraldo Anzaldua]]}}\n:Verethragna is an ancient Persian warlord who likes to fight and will do anything to challenge a worthy opponent. He has defeated nine other warlords and inherited their abilities. He meets Godou in the form of the Youth, but he does not remember his name or that he is a god. After seeing that Godou possess the grimoire based on the Book of Prometheus, he flees. After recovering his divinity, he forgets that Godou has the grimoire. When Verethragna attacks in Sardinia, Godou uses the grimoire to steal Verethrana's incarnation of the Horse. After being defeated, his powers were usurped by Godou, who thereby became a Campione. Being joyful at finally being defeated, he blesses Godou before passing on, along with a stern command not to fall to anyone else before their rematch.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Perseus}}|\u30da\u30eb\u30bb\u30a6\u30b9|Peruseusu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nobutoshi Canna]]|[[Chris Patton]]}}\n:Perseus masquerades himself as a Greek hero, but he is actually the Persian god Mithra. He is known as the Legendary Dragon Killer, slaying any dragon he encounters but disregarding the consequences that come from killing the dragons. He possesses the Heroic Steel, being known in many myths worn to conquer dragons, which was use in rescuing and marrying any maiden in distress, allowing him to dominate and control any descendant of those goddesses and priestesses, as shown when he enthralled [[Campione&#33;#Liliana Kranjcar|Liliana Kranjcar]] before Godou managed to break the spell since she loved him. Godou defeated him during the battle in a coliseum in front of an audience. Perseus was consumed by a shadowy figure, later recognized as Metis.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Pandora}}|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yuiko Tatsumi]]|[[Sasha Paysinger]]}}\n: Pandora, known to be the mother of all Campiones, appears twice in Godou's dreams when he is in the border between life and death after the Ram activated. She provides information, criticism, pep talks or even just small talk with any of the Campiones who either have just become a Campione, or died but have not yet revived through their Authorities. However, until the Campione reaches some level in an unknown aspect, most of the talk will be forgotten with only the subconscious remembering anything.\n\n===Secondary characters===\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Lucrezia Zora}}|\u30eb\u30af\u30ec\u30b7\u30a2\u00b7\u30be\u30e9|Rukureshia Zora}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]]|[[Maggie Flecknoe]]}}\n:She is a powerful witch whom [[Campione&#33;#Godou Kusanagi|Godou Kusanagi]] meets when returning a grimoire based on the Book of Prometheus in place of his grandfather, who had promised his departed wife to never meet with Lucrezia again. She attended college with and befriended Godou's grandfather, but she is able to retain the appearance of a young woman due to her high magic ability and talent. She has long, flaxen hair and voluptuous body and lives on the island of [[Sardinia]]. While living away from major cities she makes sure to have modern conveniences such as a refrigerator, air conditioning, and a computer with internet access. Lucretia is very knowledgeable about gods and magic, and also shares the same disposition with [[Campione&#33;#Erica Blandelli|Erica Blandelli]] for always choosing the more interesting course of action and teasing Godou. Deciding it would be more interesting, and keep Erica from blindly charging forth with it, Lucrezia returned the grimoire to Godou to help him deal make an alliance with a Heretic God named Melqart to defeat [[Campione&#33;#Verethragna|Verethragna]] to become a Campione.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Arianna Hayama Arialdi}}|\u30a2\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u30fb\u30cf\u30e4\u30de\u30fb\u30a2\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3|Arianna Hayama Ariarudi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sachika Misawa]]|[[Juliet Simmons]]}}\n:Arianna is Erica's personal maid, chosen by her master due to her possessing interesting aspects. She has black hair and black eyes constantly wears a maid outfit, but she wears only a apron when wearing a swimsuit. Although smart, responsible and hardworking, she has a few flaws. She has extremely dangerous driving habits, her cooking is on a level to be found in any fancy restaurant, but any meals she cooks with a pot are considered awful. She has no martial or magic ability at all. While otherwise perfect, she will make a single unintentional major mistake every three days like clockwork.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Karen Jankulovski|\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30fb\u30e4\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30b9\u30ad|Karen Yankurofusuki}}\n:{{Voiced by|Kanami Sat\u014d|[[Allison Sumrall]]}}\n:Karen is Liliana's personal maid from [[North Macedonia]], who notices Liliana's feeling toward Godou and often gives her advice as a push, as well as making fun of her master. She has short green hair and constantly wears a maid outfit unless meeting Erica in secret. She secretly sells copies of Liliana's romance novels. Karen is someone Erica feels is good to have a long term relationship with, as she considers selling privileged information on the Bronze Black Cross as too risky and thus is less likely to get caught from overextending herself. Although she appears to be a teenager, she has already learned and finished equivalency exams equal to that of a college degree. She is apprenticed to and learning how to be a witch from Liliana. She also occasionally takes bribes from Liliana's grandfather to get Liliana to dress and act more sexily and less strictly.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Shizuka Kusanagi}}|\u8349\u8599 \u9759\u82b1|Kusanagi Shizuka}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]|[[Luci Christian]]}}\n:Shizuka is Godou's younger sister, who has short brown hair. She is a strong-willed girl who is suspicious about her brother's actions and fears that he has inherited their grandfather's lady-killer ways. Shizuka is aware of a multitude of girls, especially several of her friends, being fond of him but refuses to enlighten him about it. She worries that one day Godou will not only realize his extreme talent at attracting the love and affection of women, but will come to abuse it. Like [[Campione&#33;#Yuri Mariya|Yuri Mariya]], Shizuka often criticizes Godou, but it is a front for her concern for her brother. Since Godou's high school and her middle school are part of the same school complex, she is a member of the same tea ceremony club that Yuri belongs to. Shizuka is jealous of all the attention Godou receives from Erica.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Hikari Mariya}}|\u3072\u304b\u308a\u307e\u308a\u3084|Mariya Hikari}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ai Kakuma]]|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actor)|Meg McDonald]]}}\n:Hikari is Yuri's younger sister, who is Hime-Miko at the apprentice level. She, like her sister, is stated to be a descendant of a Divine Ancestor, a former Mother Goddess defeated and cast down from her divinity. She used Yuri's cellphone to call Godou in order to get help from him to put off a young man who was relentlessly trying to recruit her to being the Hime-Miko of the temple under his guardianship. She revealed he was of a high ranking family so she could not simply tell him no, she needed the aide of someone whom even a member of one of the Four Families could not ignore or override. After a bit of talking, they are convinced to take a look and see what Hikari would be getting into, and go to visit the Monkey King that is sealed within the temple. Once there, meeting the Monkey King, they were attacked by the Campione [[Campione&#33;#Luo Hao|Luo Hao]], who wishes to fight and defeat the Monkey King, and forces Hikari to start unsealing the Monkey King using the sword Zanryuuto. After a short battle, Hikari, Yuri, and Godou escape into another part of the Netherworld and eventually return to the surface with the help of Godou's Wind Authority. Hikari has the rare power of Disaster Purification, which allows her to cancel and negate magical effects and powers. This ability will not work to the full extent on the Authorities of Campione or Heretic Gods, though it can diminish their power slightly. She has a huge crush on Godou as she stated that she will follow him like Erica and the others.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Light novel===\nThe first volume of ''Campione!'' was published on May 28, 2008.

Erica later discovers that Godou is delivering the grimoire to Lucrezia, and Erica's maid [[Campione&#33;#Arianna Hayama Arialdi|Arianna Hayama Arialdi]] accompanies them to Lucrezia's house. While there, Lucrezia reveals that the grimoire is based on the book of Prometheus, telling Godou to look after it. The next day, Godou and Erica encounter another rogue god named Melqart. Having learned of the ten incarnations from the grimoire, Godou asks Melqart to form an alliance against Verethragna. Using the grimoire, Godou steals Verethragna's golden sword. After kissing Erica, Godou kills Verethragna using the Warrior, therefore becoming a god slayer known as a Campione.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = The Landscape with a King\n| TranslitTitle       = \u014csama no iru F\u016bkei\n| NativeTitle         = \u738b\u69d8\u306e\u3044\u308b\u98a8\u666f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|7|13}}\n| ShortSummary        = Godou has a dream of meeting [[Campione&#33;#Pandora|Pandora]], mother of all Campiones, who hereby dubs him a Campione.

Upon hearing this, Godou and Erica set out to find and stop Athena to buy enough time for Yuri to seal the Gorgoneion. Unfortunately, Athena kisses Godou as an unexpected move to take him out, forcing Erica to fight back but to no avail. Yuri, on the other hand, is approached by a girl named [[Campione&#33;#Liliana Kranjcar|Liliana Kranjcar]], a knight of the Bronze Black Cross, who has come to take the Gorgoneion.

During the battle, Godou reveals that Perseus disguised himself as a Greek god, for he is actually the Persian god Mithra. Although Godou breaks Perseus's bow and arrow, Perseus stabs Godou with his sword, but Godou uses the Camel to kick him away.

As Erica is slowly dying, Godou tries to teleport her back on Earth, but ends up taking her to various places. At the Kusanagi household, Shizuka misunderstands the things Athena said about her relationship with Godou before suddenly leaving. On an island, as Erica says her last words, Godou finally masters summoning the Youth from Verethragna's spirit, having her ingest it through him to save her life and give her divine protection. While trying to rescue Godou and Erica, Liliana and Yuri are interrupted by the same scythe-wielding serpent goddess that consumed Perseus.

In order to prevent the prophecy from coming true, Godou receives help from each of the four girls to expose Metis's weaknesses.

After meeting the demonically manipulative sword-mistress Erica Blandelli, he encounters the god of war, [[Verethragna]]. After [[Deicide|killing]] the god, Godou becomes a Campione, or god slayer. His duty is to fight heretical gods who start changing things to suit themselves, usually at the expense of the people in the area. One of the problems associated with being a Campione, is that his status keeps attracting attention and difficult girls. Erica, who strongly professes her love for him, usually creates awkward and misunderstood situations for him in particular. Every time he fights a god, he kisses one of the girls he has brought with him.\n\n==Characters==\n<!--Adding spoiler warnings to or removing plot details from the article without good reason are contrary to Wikipedia policies and guidelines.

Upon his encounter with [[Campione&#33;#Erica Blandelli|Erica Blandelli]], he manages to slay the god [[Campione&#33;#Verethragna|Verethragna]], a Persian god of Victory. After obtaining Verethragna's Golden Sword and becoming a Campione, Godou obtains the abilities of Verethragna's ten incarnations: Gale (wind), Bull (strength), White Stallion (sun), Camel (leg strength), Boar (trample), Youth (divine protection), Raptor (speed), Ram (resurrection), Goat (thunder) and Warrior (Golden Sword). The Golden Sword allows Godou to seal the authority of a god, only if he accomplish the condition of using the power which is to have substantial knowledge about his enemy. He receives the information via kissing one of the female protagonists, which is the only way to infuse the information into a Campione due to their incredible magic resistance. This and ingestion are the only ways someone can have their magic, benign or malign, bypass a majority of the resistance. He is a little afraid of women due to being completely dense to their feelings, numerous interrogations and punishments from his sister, along with Erica's pranks and occasional blackmail. He tends to take what people say at face value, missing their intentions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Erica Blandelli}}|\u30a8\u30ea\u30ab\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30ea|Erika Buranderri}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Monica Rial]]<ref name=\"engcast\"/>}}\n:Erica is an Italian girl who is member of the {{nihongo|Copper Black Cross|\u8d64\u9285\u9ed2\u5341\u5b57|Shakud\u014d Kuro J\u016bji}}, one of the European magic organizations that inherited secret rites from the [[Knights Templar]] and is based in [[Milan]], Italy. Their battle tactics and colors (red and black) has likened them to that of red devils. Holding the rank of Great Knight and the title of Diavolo Rosso (Dark Red Devil), she is a magic swordsman that through coincidence meets Godou and assists him while he was in Sardinia, Italy. She ends up falling in love with him. She uses her weapon Cuore di Leone (Heart of Lion), an enchanted sword that she can summon to her hand. She also has the ability to use the sword to summon a large silver lion which can attack in place of Erica in the anime. Her weapon can transform into a spear, lance or sword for offense, or simply a shield for defense. Its true form is that of a long, silvery, broadsword infused with the spell words of David which she must cast, giving it the ability to harm gods. She is able to multiply the Cuore di Leone, even after throwing it, or in its lion form. Whether there is a restriction on how many duplicates she can make, due to ability or power, is unknown but so far has made up to thirteen lions and seven spears. Her lions are infused with intelligence allowing them to act independently just like real lions, but under her control. Although she fares well against [[Campione&#33;#Liliana Kranjcar|Liliana Kranjcar]] in martial arts as a knight, her magic expertise excels Liliana's and can be even be considered unrivaled in the areas of iron alchemy, fire, creation, transformation, destruction and reinforcement spells. Erica can use leap magic, able to boost jumping while in midair. She is an Italian girl who likes to keep herself in control of her own situation, thus she can be very forceful in her affection and jealousy. However, she knows her own limitations to be able to help and protect Godou, and she is willing to be open-minded enough to allow the other girls to become additional \"wives\", although she is to be recognized as his number one wife.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Yuri Mariya}}|\u4e07\u91cc\u8c37 \u7950\u7406|Mariya Yuri}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Hilary Haag]]<ref name=\"engcast\"/>}}\n:Yuri is a dark-haired Hime-Miko (princess [[shrine maiden]]) under Musashino, an organization whose duty is to protect [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]], handling the greatest tasks and responsibilities.

She is quite harsh on Godou the majority of the time due to the misunderstanding that Godou is doing something lecherous, but is endured by Godou as he sees the self-sacrifice that lies behind it. Often called a [[Yamato nadeshiko]], Yuri is [[clairvoyant]] and uses magic to heal and send knowledge to Godou. In terms of fighting level and physical stamina, she is the weakest, shown when playing sports, but excels at support and is unrivaled at information gathering. She is an excellent cook in both taste and visual appeal, and the head of the [[Tea Ceremony]] Club that God\u014du's little sister [[Campione&#33;#Shizuka Kusanagi|Shizuka Kusanagi]] is a member of. Like Erica, she falls in love with Godou when she sees how willing he is to put his all to protect others. Yuri gets upset when she sees Godou with one of the other girls, (which she misinterprets as flirting), or extremely serious she unknowingly smiles while giving off an extremely cold presence like a [[yaksha]].\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Liliana Kranj\u010dar}}|\u30ea\u30ea\u30a2\u30ca\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30cb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30eb|Ririana Kuranicharu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Eri Kitamura]]|Genevieve Simmons<ref name=\"engcast\"/>}}\n:Liliana is the Croatian childhood friend of Erica and belongs to the organization {{nihongo|Bronze Black Cross|\u9752\u9285\u9ed2\u5341\u5b57|Seid\u014d Kuro J\u016bji}} which is a mage/knight organization similar to, yet occasionally working but usually competing with, the Copper Black Cross. The organization serves the Campione [[Campione&#33;#Salvatore Doni|Salvatore Doni]], although her grandfather and some other members favor and support the Campione [[Campione&#33;#Sasha Dejanstahl Voban|Sasha Dejanstahl Voban]] by preference. The Bronze Black Cross are referred to as blue berserkers. Liliana has been also been called the Sword Fairy and Blue Witch, although these seem to be more nicknames as she is rarely called either while Erica is called or calls herself Diavolo Rosso often. She possesses the sword Il Maestro, able to fight with great speed, excellent magic, and flying attacks similar to that of a falcon. When released, takes on its true appearance of a naginata, which releases spell melodies when swung that can disrupt the concentration of even the toughest of opponents, although since magic in nature it has limit, if any effect, on Campiones or gods. However, in naginata form the spell words of David are infused into it as well giving it the ability to harm gods. She is often compared to be on equal footing to Erica in both martial skills and combat, as well as known by people to be among the top of the current generation of Great Knights. However, due to her direct and upfront nature, she does not have the political acumen Erica possesses and is more gullible to Erica and Karen's pranks. She is also in love with Godou, but does her best to hide it from others. Usually covering up her desire to be in close proximity or help Godou with claims of merely serving her role as a knight or bodyguard. She is a silver-haired girl with a svelte body. Though she lacks the well-curved, voluptuous figure Erica possesses, her beauty is more along that of an ephemeral, delicate fairy. She is great at housework and cooking, is a descendant of witches, and has the hobby of writing embarrassing romantic novels. Her expertise over Erica is in flight magic, witchcraft, potions, communicating with plants and animals, and spells relating to water, earth, and sky. This allows her to make flying attacks similar to a sparrow, but with the ability to halt in midair, unaffected by gravity, before continuing her attack. This also gives her the ability to swim through water as easily as a fish, harvest herbs, cast hard spells and create difficult potions. She proved invaluable in not only opening a gate to the astral realm to rescue Godou and Erica, but the knowledge to create the potion required to be unaffected by the astral realm's environment. She can also summon and use the Bow of Jonathon, which is powerful enough to harm gods, such as [[Campione&#33;#Perseus|Perseus]]. Although it appears she shoots four arrows at a time, only one is real, the others are illusions to increase the chances of the real arrow hitting.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Ena Seishuin}}|\u9752\u6d32\u9662 \u6075\u90a3|Seish\u016bin Ena}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yuka Sait\u014d (voice actress)|Yuka Sait\u014d]]|[[Carli Mosier]]<ref name=\"engcast\"/>}}\n:Ena is a girl with long, shiny, black hair with red eyes. She is a Hime Miko as well as a [[Yamato nadeshiko]] but with a figure similar to Erica's. She is the strongest of all Japan's Hime Miko, being specially trained by [[Susanoo]]. She is aggressive, impulsive, and has a tendency to ignore complicated things. Due to the harsh training she endured, Ena lacks a bit of common sense in everyday life, but this has made her an unpredictable fighter as she relies on instinct. She possesses the sword Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi and can draw power from it, becoming [[demonic possession|possessed]] in the process. However, she can only do this for short periods before her body starts taking damage. Also, if she takes in too much power, there's a chance of Susanoo's instincts or Ama no Murakumo taking control of her and running amok. When this happens she can fight on par with Campiones and gods alike. Erica considers her a threat to her position with Godou, due to Ena being another harem member with both a strong personality and a voluptuous, curvy figure; Liliana and Yuri are more submissive and easier for Erica to either manipulate or dominate. Erica believes that Ena can get close to Godou as a \"guy\" with her forthright nature before showing some feminine charm as a \"girl\". Due to isolation from society during her training, Ena is not very experienced with relationships in general. Although her mission was to seduce Godou, she knew that he was her soulmate the instant she saw him and has completely fallen for him to the point that she is willing to be his mistress as long as she can be with him. She misunderstands his wanting to develop their relationship slowly as well as his desire to become a man good enough for her as signs that she is not good enough to be his wife, which frustrates Godou as much as Erica's wild antics do.\n\n===Campiones===\nCampione, or God Slayers, are humans who have obtain the abilities of the first slain god called Authorities. They have enhanced bodies that can heal from even mortal wounds much faster and magic abilities which exceed that of the most powerful mages. They also have very high magic immunity which protects them from mortal enemy magic, but also prevents them from receiving beneficial magic such as teaching or healing. Thus, a caster has to deliver the spells internally through methods such as kissing or ingestion. The number of the Campiones are in chronological from when they first appeared, not a reference to power level or actual age.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Sasha Dejanstahl Voban}}|\u30b5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u00b7\u30c7\u30e4\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30eb\u00b7\u30a6\u30a9\u30d0\u30f3|S\u0101sha Deyansut\u0101ru Voban}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Unsh\u014d Ishizuka]]|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:Voban is the 1st Campione and of Hungarian descent. He is a cold man whose only desire is to battle worthy opponents and obtaining abilities. His normal appearance is that of a healthy and athletic old man with gray hair. His true form is the appearance of a huge werewolf. Voban is the oldest of the Campiones, as he has defeated and usurped the authorities of Apollo and Osiris. He has the abilities to create severe storms, summon swarms of dire wolves, swallow sun-based attacks, turning people into salt with his eyes and summon the bodies of those he has killed to serve him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Luo Hao}}|\u7f85\u6fe0|Ruo Hao}}\n:Luo Hao is the 2nd Campione and of Chinese descent. She was a great figure who carried herself with royal splendor. She possess the full set of the five Confucian virtues: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, knowledge and integrity. She was seeking a worthy opponent who could defeat her just like Verethragna had before Godou met her. Also, she believes her valor to be the greatest in the world, she places greater value on herself than anyone else on the Earth and is undecided on whether humanity is worth saving or not. Despite all this, Luo Hao is very observant of formality and propriety, as well as the rules of etiquette. She is able to control flowers, albeit harmless, poisonous or dangerous. With over two hundred years experience she has mastered Daoist arts which allows her to use techniques similar to European magic spells. Another ability is changing herself to a small lizard, although whether it is an Authority or a Daoist art is unknown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Aisha}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3|A\u012bsha}}\n:Aisha is the 3rd Campione and of Alexandrian descent. She has the nicknames the Eternal Beauty, Goddess of Caves or Mysterious Queen of Caves, which refers to her ability to create a hole to another world and has the appearance of a cave. She is a beautiful maiden with black hair and olive skin, having the personality of a wanderer. The Authorities she possess do not have any combat potential, however one of the Authorities she received from Persephone allows her to share the energy of life with living things which heals even severe wounds. Although, if she has a day to prep she can flip the Authority's \"spring side\" into the \"winter side\", which can remove life, but Godou stopped her from actually using it the time she considered it. Another she usurped from a certain Catholic saint in the Catholic religion causes everyone to like her which helps keep her out of trouble in areas where the locals ostracize or treat strangers with hostility. Although if she does not keep the effect toned down or inspires a group of defenders too often then she could unintentionally create a cult that would lay down their lives for her. This is considered a most troublesome Authority by Saint Raffaello in that most of the holes link to the past. This is a problem in that any changes in the past could affect the future similar to the [[butterfly effect]]. The main problem with this Authority is that she has no control over what time period the holes open up to, and the holes appearing and sucking her in whenever she forgets about having the Authority. Also, the connection in time is not stable so someone entering the hole a few minutes earlier or later than another person will still arrive at the same spot, but days or years before or after the other.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Annie Charlton}}|\u30a2\u30cb\u30fc\u00b7\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c8\u30f3|An\u012b Ch\u0101ruton}}\n:Annie is the 4th Campion and of American descent. She also goes by the masked identity of John Pluto Smith. A serious minded individual, she only lets her feelings show when she is drunk. When in the armored form of John Pluto Smith, she acts much more relaxed and flamboyant. At some point the Smith persona turned into a semi-split personality, which seems to express all the emotions and stuff Annie has been heavily suppressing. So Annie and Smith are aware and know everything the other personality experiences, but thoughts and actions reflect whichever one is out. She starts to grow feelings toward Godou after fighting alongside him and Luo Hao, although she denies to herself due to the difference between their ages and Godou's reputation of being a playboy. Has usurped the Authorities of Tezcatlipoca, which requires sacrificing sources to temporarily transform into a jaguar, and Artemis, which automatically reloads arrows in a large, six-shooter revolver. Annie wears dark leather suits, rectangular half-glasses, with short fiery red hair. John Pluto Smith wears various cloths that present the proper atmosphere of a hero over armor that makes her look like an insect, primarily the helmet, and hides the fact that Smith is a woman.\n \n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Alexander Gascoigne}}|\u30a2\u30ec\u30af\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u00b7\u30ac\u30b9\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3|Arekusand\u0101 Gasukoin}}\n:Alexander is the 5th Campione and of British descent. He is also known as Black Prince Alec, leader of political organization Royal Arsenal that oppose Princess Alice's organization Witengamot. He looks like a young man with black hair. He has an arrogant personality, willing to work with Alice when their goals align on issues. He has the Authority of Fallen Angel Ramiel \"Black Lightning,\" an ability that grants him super speed. He can also turn himself into a lightning avatar made of plasma to travel even faster, evade physical injury and use lightning strikes. However, if the lightning avatar is dispelled, he will revert to his normal physical form. He also defeated the Minotaur Granting, which creates an underground labyrinth where he always understands the full layout and where his opponents are located, and the three Judging Furies, which returns all damage done in front of him back to an opponent using any physical or magical form of destructive power.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Salvatore Doni}}|\u30b5\u30eb\u30f4\u30a1\u30c8\u30fc\u30ec\u00b7\u30c9\u30cb|Saruvat\u014dre Doni}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takuya Eguchi]]|Andrew Love}}\n:Salvatore is the 6th Campione and of Italian descent. He has blonde hair and has a scar going around his right shoulder where it meets the arm He has a carefree personality, considered by most to be a complete idiot with no common sense and lacks magical skills. He is on equal levels with [[Campione&#33;#Godou Kusanagi|Godou Kusanagi]] as a Campione, as they had a draw on their fight. Salvatore is also notably hated or strongly disliked by the Campione [[Campione&#33;#Sasha Dejanstahl Voban|Sasha Dejanstahl Voban]], for stealing his prey that he had summoned specifically to relieve boredom. He is feared for all the trouble his antics causes and his utter lack of understanding and caring about serious issues, as he believes his scabbard is the solution to every issue. He does not see Godou as a friend or an ally, but an adversary. He therefore anticipated for a rematch, warning Godou about Voban entering Japan as an excuse for Godou to grow stronger and faster. He is a former Templar candidate, but failed due to abysmally poor magic scores and ability well below that of a young novice who never heard of magic before. He is considered an exceptional prodigy with swords and always carries one around with him wherever he goes just in case he gets into an interesting fight. The Copper Black Cross answers to him since his home base coincides with their headquarters. He has usurped three Authorities from the king of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. Nuadha (Ripping Arm of Silver) allows him to turn his arm silver and gaining the ability to cut through anything. Nordic hero Siegfried (Man of Steel) provides a body of steel that cannot be damaged but increases his mass in proportion to how strong the protection is. Vulcan (Return to Medieval Style) reduces the technology level of an area to that of the Middle Ages for about half a day. His fourth Authority he usurped from Dionysus, which causes all magical powers to overload, activate and run out of control. His creed and spell words is that he will not allow anything to exist in the world that he can not cut.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Uldin}}|\u30a6\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3|Urudin}}\n:Uldin is the 8th Campione and of Hunnic descent. He is a warrior, who is compared to Godou, due to similarities in personalities and fighting temperaments, possibly due to being an unrecorded and distant ancestor. He has a habit of acting on his impulses and therefore has a harem of women spread throughout the world, although he is apparently married to four of them, with Ruska (first wife) and Clotilde (fourth wife) making their appearance along with Uldin. His other two wives are at two other fortresses he controls. As with the time period feels that if he likes a woman it is okay to carry her off as she will eventually fall for him like the others anyway. His primary Authority that is used is Dragon Tamer, which allows him to control the dragons that he keeps in the forest near his castle. He also can turn dragon bones into an army of smaller skeleton dragons similar to the story of sowing teeth of dragons into the ground to raise an army. He is also known as Tyr's Sword due to having Authority of Tyr, which allows him to temporarily resurrect his army of dragons to fight again.\n\n===Heretic Gods===\nHeretic Gods, or Rogue Gods, are gods that come to exist in real world, rather than staying as myths. A human who weakens and killed a Heretic God single-handedly will gain their abilities and become a Campione, while Campiones can also kill other Heretic Gods single-handedly to gain more abilities. Killing a Heretic God who is already weakened by someone else or cooperating with other people during the fight to kill them will not receive any ability. Note that even if killed, Heretic Gods will resurrect later as long as the myth is still known among humans.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Athena}}|\u30a2\u30c6\u30ca|Atena}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Ogura]]|[[Brittney Karbowski]]}}\n:Athena has a cold personality and seems willing to do anything to reclaim her lost powers. Her appearance is that of a young teenager with silver hair and black eyes similar to those of an owl. After using the Gorgoneion to transform herself into true her goddess, she was defeated by [[Campione&#33;#Godou Kusanagi|Godou Kusanagi]] and [[Campione&#33;#Erica Blandelli|Erica Blandelli]], returning to her youth form. She later returns to help Godou by offering information to defeat [[Campione&#33;#Perseus|Perseus]]. In exchange for her assistance, Godou had to promise her that he would fulfill any one wish. It is stated that she lost her age and rank before becoming a Heretic God, so her young form appears to be a punishment of some kind. While she claims that she does not want anyone else to defeat Godou but her, she does seem to have taken an interest in Godou's growth and development. It is possible that, like Erica and the others, having watched and interacted with him she has started to develop feelings for him that she is not aware of or willing to admit to herself. This is shown when she sought his help after losing her memories. When she talked with [[Campione&#33;#Shizuka Kusanagi|Shizuka Kusanagi]], it is hinted that her feelings towards Godou might be affectionate.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Verethragna}}|\u30a6\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30b0\u30ca|Urusuraguna}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Junko Minagawa]]|[[Leraldo Anzaldua]]}}\n:Verethragna is an ancient Persian warlord who likes to fight and will do anything to challenge a worthy opponent. He has defeated nine other warlords and inherited their abilities. He meets Godou in the form of the Youth, but he does not remember his name or that he is a god. After seeing that Godou possess the grimoire based on the Book of Prometheus, he flees. After recovering his divinity, he forgets that Godou has the grimoire. When Verethragna attacks in Sardinia, Godou uses the grimoire to steal Verethrana's incarnation of the Horse. After being defeated, his powers were usurped by Godou, who thereby became a Campione. Being joyful at finally being defeated, he blesses Godou before passing on, along with a stern command not to fall to anyone else before their rematch.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Perseus}}|\u30da\u30eb\u30bb\u30a6\u30b9|Peruseusu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nobutoshi Canna]]|[[Chris Patton]]}}\n:Perseus masquerades himself as a Greek hero, but he is actually the Persian god Mithra. He is known as the Legendary Dragon Killer, slaying any dragon he encounters but disregarding the consequences that come from killing the dragons. He possesses the Heroic Steel, being known in many myths worn to conquer dragons, which was use in rescuing and marrying any maiden in distress, allowing him to dominate and control any descendant of those goddesses and priestesses, as shown when he enthralled [[Campione&#33;#Liliana Kranjcar|Liliana Kranjcar]] before Godou managed to break the spell since she loved him. Godou defeated him during the battle in a coliseum in front of an audience. Perseus was consumed by a shadowy figure, later recognized as Metis.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Pandora}}|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yuiko Tatsumi]]|[[Sasha Paysinger]]}}\n: Pandora, known to be the mother of all Campiones, appears twice in Godou's dreams when he is in the border between life and death after the Ram activated. She provides information, criticism, pep talks or even just small talk with any of the Campiones who either have just become a Campione, or died but have not yet revived through their Authorities. However, until the Campione reaches some level in an unknown aspect, most of the talk will be forgotten with only the subconscious remembering anything.\n\n===Secondary characters===\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Lucrezia Zora}}|\u30eb\u30af\u30ec\u30b7\u30a2\u00b7\u30be\u30e9|Rukureshia Zora}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]]|[[Maggie Flecknoe]]}}\n:She is a powerful witch whom [[Campione&#33;#Godou Kusanagi|Godou Kusanagi]] meets when returning a grimoire based on the Book of Prometheus in place of his grandfather, who had promised his departed wife to never meet with Lucrezia again. She attended college with and befriended Godou's grandfather, but she is able to retain the appearance of a young woman due to her high magic ability and talent. She has long, flaxen hair and voluptuous body and lives on the island of [[Sardinia]]. While living away from major cities she makes sure to have modern conveniences such as a refrigerator, air conditioning, and a computer with internet access. Lucretia is very knowledgeable about gods and magic, and also shares the same disposition with [[Campione&#33;#Erica Blandelli|Erica Blandelli]] for always choosing the more interesting course of action and teasing Godou. Deciding it would be more interesting, and keep Erica from blindly charging forth with it, Lucrezia returned the grimoire to Godou to help him deal make an alliance with a Heretic God named Melqart to defeat [[Campione&#33;#Verethragna|Verethragna]] to become a Campione.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Arianna Hayama Arialdi}}|\u30a2\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u30fb\u30cf\u30e4\u30de\u30fb\u30a2\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3|Arianna Hayama Ariarudi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sachika Misawa]]|[[Juliet Simmons]]}}\n:Arianna is Erica's personal maid, chosen by her master due to her possessing interesting aspects.

She has extremely dangerous driving habits, her cooking is on a level to be found in any fancy restaurant, but any meals she cooks with a pot are considered awful. She has no martial or magic ability at all. While otherwise perfect, she will make a single unintentional major mistake every three days like clockwork.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Karen Jankulovski|\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30fb\u30e4\u30f3\u30af\u30ed\u30d5\u30b9\u30ad|Karen Yankurofusuki}}\n:{{Voiced by|Kanami Sat\u014d|[[Allison Sumrall]]}}\n:Karen is Liliana's personal maid from [[North Macedonia]], who notices Liliana's feeling toward Godou and often gives her advice as a push, as well as making fun of her master. She has short green hair and constantly wears a maid outfit unless meeting Erica in secret. She secretly sells copies of Liliana's romance novels. Karen is someone Erica feels is good to have a long term relationship with, as she considers selling privileged information on the Bronze Black Cross as too risky and thus is less likely to get caught from overextending herself. Although she appears to be a teenager, she has already learned and finished equivalency exams equal to that of a college degree. She is apprenticed to and learning how to be a witch from Liliana. She also occasionally takes bribes from Liliana's grandfather to get Liliana to dress and act more sexily and less strictly.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Shizuka Kusanagi}}|\u8349\u8599 \u9759\u82b1|Kusanagi Shizuka}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]|[[Luci Christian]]}}\n:Shizuka is Godou's younger sister, who has short brown hair. She is a strong-willed girl who is suspicious about her brother's actions and fears that he has inherited their grandfather's lady-killer ways. Shizuka is aware of a multitude of girls, especially several of her friends, being fond of him but refuses to enlighten him about it. She worries that one day Godou will not only realize his extreme talent at attracting the love and affection of women, but will come to abuse it. Like [[Campione&#33;#Yuri Mariya|Yuri Mariya]], Shizuka often criticizes Godou, but it is a front for her concern for her brother. Since Godou's high school and her middle school are part of the same school complex, she is a member of the same tea ceremony club that Yuri belongs to. Shizuka is jealous of all the attention Godou receives from Erica.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Hikari Mariya}}|\u3072\u304b\u308a\u307e\u308a\u3084|Mariya Hikari}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ai Kakuma]]|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actor)|Meg McDonald]]}}\n:Hikari is Yuri's younger sister, who is Hime-Miko at the apprentice level. She, like her sister, is stated to be a descendant of a Divine Ancestor, a former Mother Goddess defeated and cast down from her divinity. She used Yuri's cellphone to call Godou in order to get help from him to put off a young man who was relentlessly trying to recruit her to being the Hime-Miko of the temple under his guardianship. She revealed he was of a high ranking family so she could not simply tell him no, she needed the aide of someone whom even a member of one of the Four Families could not ignore or override. After a bit of talking, they are convinced to take a look and see what Hikari would be getting into, and go to visit the Monkey King that is sealed within the temple. Once there, meeting the Monkey King, they were attacked by the Campione [[Campione&#33;#Luo Hao|Luo Hao]], who wishes to fight and defeat the Monkey King, and forces Hikari to start unsealing the Monkey King using the sword Zanryuuto. After a short battle, Hikari, Yuri, and Godou escape into another part of the Netherworld and eventually return to the surface with the help of Godou's Wind Authority. Hikari has the rare power of Disaster Purification, which allows her to cancel and negate magical effects and powers. This ability will not work to the full extent on the Authorities of Campione or Heretic Gods, though it can diminish their power slightly. She has a huge crush on Godou as she stated that she will follow him like Erica and the others.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Light novel===\nThe first volume of ''Campione!'' was published on May 28, 2008.

Erica later discovers that Godou is delivering the grimoire to Lucrezia, and Erica's maid [[Campione&#33;#Arianna Hayama Arialdi|Arianna Hayama Arialdi]] accompanies them to Lucrezia's house. While there, Lucrezia reveals that the grimoire is based on the book of Prometheus, telling Godou to look after it. The next day, Godou and Erica encounter another rogue god named Melqart. Having learned of the ten incarnations from the grimoire, Godou asks Melqart to form an alliance against Verethragna. Using the grimoire, Godou steals Verethragna's golden sword.

Since Godou still does not have what he needs to achieve victory, Liliana makes a decision to kiss him, which gives him the necessary knowledge to defeat Perseus. During the battle, Godou reveals that Perseus disguised himself as a Greek god, for he is actually the Persian god Mithra. Although Godou breaks Perseus's bow and arrow, Perseus stabs Godou with his sword, but Godou uses the Camel to kick him away. Perseus then uses his ability to force Liliana into subservience to attack Godou, but Liliana manages to break free of the spell after hearing Godou call her name. Liliana shoots Perseus with her bow and arrows, allowing Godou to use the Boar to defeat Perseus. Athena appears to heal Godou's wounds by kissing him before departing, much to Liliana's chagrin.

On an island, as Erica says her last words, Godou finally masters summoning the Youth from Verethragna's spirit, having her ingest it through him to save her life and give her divine protection. While trying to rescue Godou and Erica, Liliana and Yuri are interrupted by the same scythe-wielding serpent goddess that consumed Perseus. At the shrine, when Ena reappears completely merged with her in the form of a god, Godou and Erica save her, but the serpent goddess, recognized as Metis, absorbs the power of Ena's sword.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = Tale of the God Slayer\n| NativeTitle         = \u795e\u6bba\u3057\u306e\u7269\u8a9e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|9|28}}\n| ShortSummary        = Godou recalls from Susanoo that Metis, who is Athena's mother, wants to swallow the heavens as prophesied in the Gorgoneion, which actually does not pertain to Athena. Arianna and Amakasu come to retrieve Godou as well as Athena, who seems to have lost her memories after Metis previously absorbed her powers. Erica, Yuri, Liliana and Ena stay behind to try to buy enough time against Metis to allow Godou to recharge his powers. However, after the four are easily defeated, Metis comes after Godou, who manages to revive his powers. During the fight, Metis absorbs Athena's powers again, transforming her into her true goddess form. In order to prevent the prophecy from coming true, Godou receives help from each of the four girls to expose Metis's weaknesses. With the last kiss given by Athena after summoning her with the Gale, Godou is able to achieve victory, banishing the black aura from the sky and returning everything back to normal.\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://dash.shueisha.co.jp/feature/campione/ Official light novel website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.campi-anime.com/ Official anime website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{Ann|anime|13841}}\n\n{{Diomed\u00e9a}}\n{{Jukki Hanada}}\n\n[[Category:2008 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:2011 manga]]\n[[Category:2012 anime television series]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga based on light novels]]\n[[Category:Diomedea (studio)]]\n[[Category:Fantasy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Harem anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Sentai Filmworks]]\n[[Category:Shueisha franchises]]\n[[Category:Shueisha manga]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on light novels]]\n[[Category:AT-X shows]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toFrom the New World(link changed toFrom the New World (novel)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campione!"}

From 1811 until his accession, he served as [[regent]] during his father's final mental illness.\n\nGeorge IV was the eldest child of King George III and [[Queen Charlotte]]. He led an extravagant lifestyle that contributed to the fashions of the [[Regency era]]. He was a patron of new forms of leisure, style and taste. He commissioned [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] to build the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]] and remodel [[Buckingham Palace]], and commissioned Sir [[Jeffry Wyatville]] to rebuild [[Windsor Castle]]. George's charm and culture earned him the title \"the first gentleman of England\", but his dissolute way of life and poor relationships with his parents and his wife, [[Caroline of Brunswick]], earned him the contempt of the people and dimmed the prestige of the monarchy. He excluded Caroline from [[Coronation of George IV|his coronation]] and asked the government to introduce the unpopular [[Pains and Penalties Bill]] in an unsuccessful attempt to divorce her.\n\nDespite presiding over the British Empire's [[Pax Britannica|emergence as a global hegemon]], George IV's rule was tarnished by scandal and financial extravagance. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible, and he was strongly influenced by favourites.<ref name=sketch>{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|title=George IV: a Sketch|journal=History Today|year=2005|volume=55|issue=10|pages=30\u201336}}</ref> Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During most of George's regency and reign, [[Lord Liverpool]] controlled the government as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory over Napoleon and negotiated a peace settlement with the French. After Liverpool's retirement, George IV was forced to accept [[Catholic emancipation]] despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], predeceased him in 1817; on his death, he was succeeded by his younger brother, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Allan Ramsay - Queen Charlotte (1744-1818), with her Two Eldest Sons - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George (left) with his mother [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] and younger brother [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Frederick]]. Portrait by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], 1764]]\nGeorge was born at [[St James's Palace]], London, on 12 August 1762, the first child of the British king [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. As the eldest son of a British sovereign, he automatically became [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]] at birth; he was created [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Earl of Chester]] a few days later.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 1</ref> On 18 September of the same year, he was baptised by [[Thomas Secker]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 2</ref> His godparents were: his uncle [[Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] (for whom the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire]], stood proxy); his paternal great-uncle [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]]; and his grandmother, the [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Dowager Princess of Wales]].<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Prince of Wales 1762\u20131811'', p. 2</ref> George was a talented student, and quickly learned to speak French, German and Italian, in addition to his native English.<ref name=\"dnb\">{{Cite journal |last=Hibbert |first=Christopher |title=George IV (1762\u20131830) |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 18 the Prince of Wales was given a separate establishment, and in dramatic contrast with his prosaic, scandal-free father, threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was a witty conversationalist, drunk or sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of \u00a360,000 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60000|1783|r=-3}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) from Parliament and an annual income of \u00a350,000 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50000|1783|r=-3}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) from his father. It was far too little for his needs \u2013 the stables alone cost \u00a331,000 a year. He then established his residence in [[Carlton House]], where he lived a profligate life.<ref>Smith, E. A., pp. 25\u201328</ref> Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour on the part of the [[heir apparent]]. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince's adherence to [[Charles James Fox]] and other radically inclined politicians.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 48</ref>\n[[File:GeorgeIV1780.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Portrait miniature]] by [[Richard Cosway]], c. 1780\u201382]]\nSoon after he reached the age of 21, the prince became infatuated with [[Maria Fitzherbert]]. She was a commoner (though granddaughter of a baronet), six years his elder, twice widowed, and a Roman Catholic.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 33</ref> Nevertheless, the prince was determined to marry her. This was in spite of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which barred the spouse of a Catholic from succeeding to the throne, and the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], which prohibited his marriage without the King's consent.<ref>Parissien, p. 64</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the couple went through a marriage ceremony on 15 December 1785 at her house in Park Street, [[Mayfair]]. Legally the union was void, as the King's consent was not granted (and never even requested).<ref>Smith, E. A., pp. 36\u201338</ref> However, Fitzherbert believed that she was the prince's [[Canon law|canonical]] and true wife, holding the law of the Church to be superior to the law of the State. For political reasons, the union remained secret and Fitzherbert promised not to reveal it.<ref>David, pp. 57\u201391</ref>\n\nThe prince was plunged into debt by his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to assist him, forcing him to quit Carlton House and live at Fitzherbert's residence. In 1787, the prince's political allies proposed to relieve his debts with a parliamentary grant. The prince's relationship with Fitzherbert was suspected, and revelation of the illegal marriage would have scandalised the nation and doomed any parliamentary proposal to aid him. Acting on the prince's authority, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] leader Charles James Fox declared that the story was a calumny.<ref name=\"vol3\">{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 3 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1914 | pages =396\u2013397 }}</ref> Fitzherbert was not pleased with the public denial of the marriage in such vehement terms and contemplated severing her ties to the prince. He appeased her by asking another Whig, [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], to restate Fox's forceful declaration in more careful words.

In the House of Commons, Charles James Fox declared his opinion that the Prince of Wales was automatically entitled to exercise sovereignty during the King's incapacity. A contrasting opinion was held by the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger]], who argued that, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the right to choose a regent belonged to Parliament alone.<ref>Smith, E.

The Prince of Wales's brother, [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York]], declared that George would not attempt to exercise any power without previously obtaining the consent of Parliament.<ref>Derry, p. 91</ref> Following the passage of preliminary resolutions Pitt outlined a formal plan for the regency, suggesting that the powers of the Prince of Wales be greatly limited. Among other things, the Prince of Wales would not be able either to sell the King's property or to grant a [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerage]] to anyone other than a child of the King. The Prince of Wales denounced Pitt's scheme, declaring it a \"project for producing weakness, disorder, and insecurity in every branch of the administration of affairs.\"<ref name=\"may\">{{cite book|last=May|first=Thomas Erskine|authorlink=Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|title=The Constitutional History of England Since the Accession of George the Third, 1760\u20131860|year=1896|edition=11th|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|pages=chapter III pp. 184\u2013195|nopp=true}}</ref> In the interests of the nation, both factions agreed to compromise.<ref name=\"david1\" />\n\nA significant technical impediment to any Regency Bill involved the lack of a speech from the throne, which was necessary before Parliament could proceed to any debates or votes. The speech was normally delivered by the King, but could also be delivered by royal representatives known as [[Lords Commissioners]]; but no document could empower the Lords Commissioners to act unless the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] was affixed to it. The seal could not be legally affixed without the prior authorisation of the sovereign. Pitt and his fellow ministers ignored the last requirement and instructed the [[Lord Chancellor]] to affix the Great Seal without the King's consent, as the act of affixing the Great Seal in itself gave legal force to the bill. This [[legal fiction]] was denounced by [[Edmund Burke]] as \"forgery, fraud\",<ref>Derry, p. 181</ref> a \"glaring falsehood\",<ref name=\"derry\">Derry, p. 109</ref> and as a \"palpable absurdity\".<ref name=\"derry\" /> The Duke of York described the plan as \"unconstitutional and illegal.\"<ref name=\"may\" /> Nevertheless, others in Parliament felt that such a scheme was necessary to preserve an effective government. Consequently, on 3 February 1789, more than two months after it had convened, Parliament was formally opened by an \"illegal\" group of Lords Commissioners. The Regency Bill was introduced, but before it could be passed the King recovered. The King declared retroactively that the instrument authorising the Lords Commissioners to act was valid.<ref name=\"vol3\" /><ref name=\"david1\" />\n\n==Marriage and mistresses==\n[[File:GeorgeIV1798.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait after [[William Beechey|Sir William Beechey]], 1798]]\nThe Prince of Wales's debts continued to climb, and his father refused to aid him unless he married his cousin Princess [[Caroline of Brunswick]].<ref>Smith, E.

It also led to a Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry into Princess Caroline's conduct after the Prince of Wales accused her of having an illegitimate son. The investigation cleared Caroline of the charge but still revealed her behaviour to have been extraordinarily indiscreet.<ref>{{cite book | last =Ashley| first =Mike | title = The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens | publisher=Robinson| year =1998 | location =London | page =684| isbn= 1-84119-096-9}}</ref>\n\n==Regency==\n{{Main|Regency era}}\n[[File:George IV by Sir Thomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|Profile by Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]], c. 1814]]\n[[File:George IV van het Verenigd Koninkrijk.jpg|thumb|Portrait in [[Order of the Garter#Habit and insignia|Garter robes]] by Lawrence, 1816]]\n\nIn late 1810, the King was once again overcome by his malady following the death of his youngest daughter, [[Princess Amelia of the United Kingdom|Princess Amelia]]. Parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1788; without the King's consent, the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to [[letters patent]] naming Lords Commissioners. The letters patent lacked the [[Royal Sign Manual]], but were sealed by request of resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament. The Lords Commissioners appointed by the letters patent, in the name of the King, then signified the granting of [[Royal Assent]] to a bill that became the [[Regency Act 1811]]. Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent (as the Prince of Wales became known). The constraints expired one year after the passage of the Act.<ref>{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 4 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1915 | page = 50 }}</ref> The Prince of Wales became Prince Regent on 5 February 1811.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=16451|page=227|date=5 February 1811}}</ref>\n\nThe Regent let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father. The principle that the prime minister was the person supported by a majority in the House of Commons, whether the king personally favoured him or not, became established.<ref>Bagehot, Walter (1872) ''The English constitution'', p. 247</ref> His governments, with little help from the Regent, presided over British policy. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned [[Catholic emancipation]], the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by Prime Minister [[Spencer Perceval]], were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales was expected to support the Whig leader, [[Lord Grenville]]. He did not, however, immediately put Grenville and the Whigs into office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.<ref>Parissien, p. 185</ref>\n\nIn 1812, when it appeared highly unlikely that the King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.<ref>Smith, E. A., pp. 141\u2013142</ref>\n\nOn 11 May 1812, [[Assassination of Spencer Perceval|Perceval was assassinated]] by [[John Bellingham]]. The Prince Regent was prepared to reappoint all the members of the Perceval ministry under a new leader. The House of Commons formally declared its desire for a \"strong and efficient administration\",<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 144</ref> so the Prince Regent then offered leadership of the government to [[Lord Wellesley]] and afterwards to [[Lord Moira]]. He doomed the attempts of both to failure, however, by forcing each to construct an all-party ministry at a time when neither party wished to share power with the other. Possibly using the failure of the two peers as a pretext, the Prince Regent immediately reappointed the Perceval administration, with [[Lord Liverpool]] as Prime Minister.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 145</ref>\n\nThe Tories, unlike Whigs such as [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]], sought to continue the vigorous prosecution of the war in Continental Europe against the powerful and aggressive Emperor of the French, [[Napoleon I]].<ref>Smith, E. A., p.146</ref> An anti-French alliance, which included Russia, [[Prussia]], Austria, Britain and several smaller countries, defeated Napoleon in 1814. In the subsequent [[Congress of Vienna]], it was decided that the [[Electorate of Hanover]], a state that had shared a monarch with Britain since 1714, would be raised to the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. Napoleon returned from exile in 1815, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] by the [[Duke of Wellington]], brother of Lord Wellesley.<ref>Parissien, pp. 264\u2013281</ref>\n\nDuring this period George took an active interest in matters of style and taste, and his associates such as the dandy [[Beau Brummell]] and the architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] created the [[Regency style]]. In London Nash designed the Regency terraces of [[Regent's Park]] and [[Regent Street]]. George took up the new idea of the seaside spa and had the [[Brighton Pavilion]] developed as a fantastical seaside palace, adapted by Nash in the \"Indian Gothic\" style inspired loosely by the [[Taj Mahal]], with extravagant \"Indian\" and \"Chinese\" interiors.<ref>{{cite book | last =Rutherford | first =Jessica M.

They had lived separately since 1796, and both were having affairs. In 1814, Caroline left the United Kingdom for continental Europe, but she chose to return for her husband's [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]], and to publicly assert her rights as [[queen consort]]. However, he refused to recognise Caroline as Queen, and commanded British ambassadors to ensure that monarchs in foreign courts did the same. By royal command, Caroline's name was omitted from the [[Book of Common Prayer]], the [[liturgy]] of the [[Church of England]].<ref>Parissien, pp. 209\u2013224</ref>\n\nThe King sought a divorce, but his advisors suggested that any divorce proceedings might involve the publication of details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured the introduction of the [[Pains and Penalties Bill]], under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at [[Westminster Abbey]], on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.<ref>{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 4 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1915 | page = 82 }}</ref>\n[[File:George4coin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half-crown]] of George IV, 1821]]\n[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] depicting the King during [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|his 1822 trip to Scotland]]]]\n[[Coronation of George IV|George's coronation]] was a magnificent and expensive affair, costing about \u00a3243,000 (approximately \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|243000|1822|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}};{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for comparison, his father's coronation had only cost about \u00a310,000, less than a twentieth of George IV's).

At first it was believed that he would support [[Catholic emancipation]], as he had proposed a Catholic Emancipation Bill for Ireland in 1797, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1813 when he privately canvassed against the ultimately defeated Catholic Relief Bill of 1813. By 1824 he was denouncing Catholic emancipation in public.<ref>Parissien, p. 189</ref> Having taken the coronation oath on his accession, George now argued that he had sworn to uphold the Protestant faith, and could not support any pro-Catholic measures.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 238</ref> The influence of the Crown was so great, and the will of the Tories under Prime Minister Liverpool so strong, that Catholic emancipation seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-emancipation Tory [[George Canning]]. When Canning entered office, the King, hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a public declaration to the effect that his sentiments on the question were those of his revered father, George III.<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811\u20131830'', p. 292</ref>\n\nCanning's views on the Catholic Question were not well received by the most conservative Tories, including the Duke of Wellington. As a result, the ministry was forced to include Whigs.<ref>Smith, E.

With great difficulty Wellington obtained the King's consent to the introduction of a Catholic Relief Bill on 29 January 1829. Under pressure from his fanatically anti-Catholic brother, the [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Duke of Cumberland]], the King withdrew his approval and in protest the Cabinet resigned ''en masse'' on 4 March.

Sir Henry! Fetch him; this is death!\"<ref name=P7/> Accounts of George's final moments and [[last words]] vary. According to Halford, following his arrival and that of Sir [[William Knighton]], the King's \"lips grew livid, and he dropped his head on the page's shoulder...I was up the stairs in five minutes, and he died but eight minutes afterwards.\"<ref name=P7/> Other accounts state the King placed his hands on his stomach and said \"Surely, this must be death,\" or that he called out \"Good God, what is this?\", clasped his page's hand, said \"my boy, this is death\", and died.<ref>De-la-Noy, p. 103; Parissien, pp. 7\u20138; Smith, E.

Quoted in Parissien, p.420</ref> He was bright, clever, and knowledgeable, but his laziness and gluttony led him to squander much of his talent.

After political opponents put a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on wig powder]], he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair.<ref>Parissien, p. 112</ref> He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin.<ref>Parissien, p. 114</ref> His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish [[tartan]] dress as it is known today.<ref>Parissien, pp. 324\u2013326</ref>\n\nDuring the political crisis caused by Catholic emancipation, the Duke of Wellington said that George was \"the worst man he ever fell in with his whole life, the most selfish, the most false, the most ill-natured, the most entirely without one redeeming quality\".<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811\u20131830'', p. 310</ref> However, his eulogy delivered in the [[House of Lords]] called George \"the most accomplished man of his age\" and praised his knowledge and talent.<ref name=\"hibbert\">Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811\u20131830'', p. 344</ref> Wellington's true feelings probably lie somewhere between these two extremes; as he said later, George was \"a magnificent patron of the arts&nbsp;... the most extraordinary compound of talent, wit, buffoonery, obstinacy, and good feeling\u2014in short a medley of the most opposite qualities, with a great preponderance of good\u2014that I ever saw in any character in my life.\"<ref name=\"hibbert\" />\n\nUpon George's death, ''[[The Times]]'' captured elite opinion succinctly: \"There never was an individual less regretted by his fellow-creatures than this deceased king. What eye has wept for him? What heart has heaved one throb of unmercenary sorrow?&nbsp;... If he ever had a friend \u2013 a devoted friend in any rank of life \u2013 we protest that the name of him or her never reached us\".<ref>''The Times (London)'' 15 July 1830 quoted in Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811\u20131830'', p. 342</ref> \n\n[[File:Statue of King George IV in Trafalgar Square, London (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of George IV in [[Trafalgar Square]], London]]\nThere are many statues of George IV, a large number of which were erected during his reign.

of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and [[King of Hanover]] from the death of his father, [[King George III]], on 29 January 1820 until his own death ten years later. From 1811 until his accession, he served as [[regent]] during his father's final mental illness.\n\nGeorge IV was the eldest child of King George III and [[Queen Charlotte]]. He led an extravagant lifestyle that contributed to the fashions of the [[Regency era]]. He was a patron of new forms of leisure, style and taste. He commissioned [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] to build the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]] and remodel [[Buckingham Palace]], and commissioned Sir [[Jeffry Wyatville]] to rebuild [[Windsor Castle]]. George's charm and culture earned him the title \"the first gentleman of England\", but his dissolute way of life and poor relationships with his parents and his wife, [[Caroline of Brunswick]], earned him the contempt of the people and dimmed the prestige of the monarchy. He excluded Caroline from his coronation and asked the government to introduce the unpopular [[Pains and Penalties Bill]] in an unsuccessful attempt to divorce her.\n\nDespite presiding over the British Empire's [[Pax Britannica|emergence as a global hegemon]], George IV's rule was tarnished by scandal and financial extravagance. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible, and he was strongly influenced by favourites.<ref name=sketch>{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|title=George IV: a Sketch|journal=History Today|year=2005|volume=55|issue=10|pages=30\u201336}}</ref> Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During most of George's regency and reign, [[Lord Liverpool]] controlled the government as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory over Napoleon and negotiated a peace settlement with the French. After Liverpool's retirement, George IV was forced to accept [[Catholic emancipation]] despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], predeceased him in 1817; on his death, he was succeeded by his younger brother, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Allan Ramsay - Queen Charlotte (1744-1818), with her Two Eldest Sons - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George (left) with his mother [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] and younger brother [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Frederick]].

He was a witty conversationalist, drunk or sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of \u00a360,000 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60000|1783|r=-3}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) from Parliament and an annual income of \u00a350,000 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50000|1783|r=-3}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) from his father. It was far too little for his needs \u2013 the stables alone cost \u00a331,000 a year. He then established his residence in [[Carlton House]], where he lived a profligate life.<ref>Smith, E. A., pp. 25\u201328</ref> Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour on the part of the [[heir apparent]]. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince's adherence to [[Charles James Fox]] and other radically inclined politicians.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 48</ref>\n[[File:GeorgeIV1780.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Portrait miniature]] by [[Richard Cosway]], c. 1780\u201382]]\nSoon after he reached the age of 21, the prince became infatuated with [[Maria Fitzherbert]]. She was a commoner (though granddaughter of a baronet), six years his elder, twice widowed, and a Roman Catholic.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 33</ref> Nevertheless, the prince was determined to marry her. This was in spite of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which barred the spouse of a Catholic from succeeding to the throne, and the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], which prohibited his marriage without the King's consent.<ref>Parissien, p. 64</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the couple went through a marriage ceremony on 15 December 1785 at her house in Park Street, [[Mayfair]]. Legally the union was void, as the King's consent was not granted (and never even requested).<ref>Smith, E. A., pp. 36\u201338</ref> However, Fitzherbert believed that she was the prince's [[Canon law|canonical]] and true wife, holding the law of the Church to be superior to the law of the State. For political reasons, the union remained secret and Fitzherbert promised not to reveal it.<ref>David, pp. 57\u201391</ref>\n\nThe prince was plunged into debt by his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to assist him, forcing him to quit Carlton House and live at Fitzherbert's residence. In 1787, the prince's political allies proposed to relieve his debts with a parliamentary grant. The prince's relationship with Fitzherbert was suspected, and revelation of the illegal marriage would have scandalised the nation and doomed any parliamentary proposal to aid him. Acting on the prince's authority, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] leader Charles James Fox declared that the story was a calumny.<ref name=\"vol3\">{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 3 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1914 | pages =396\u2013397 }}</ref> Fitzherbert was not pleased with the public denial of the marriage in such vehement terms and contemplated severing her ties to the prince. He appeased her by asking another Whig, [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], to restate Fox's forceful declaration in more careful words. Parliament, meanwhile, granted the prince \u00a3161,000 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|161000|1787|r=-3}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) to pay his debts and \u00a360,000 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60000|1787|r=-3}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) for improvements to Carlton House.<ref name=\"dnb\" /><ref>De-la-Noy, p. 31</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Marilyn Morris, \"Princely Debt, Public Credit, and Commercial Values in Late Georgian Britain.\" ''Journal of British Studies'' 2004 43(3): 339\u2013365</ref>\n\n==Regency crisis of 1788==\n[[File:GeorgeIV1785.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait published by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1785]]\nIn the summer of 1788 the King's mental health deteriorated, possibly as the result of the hereditary disease [[porphyria]].<ref>{{cite book | last = R\u00f6hl | first= J.

During the prorogation he became deranged, posing a threat to his own life, and when Parliament reconvened in November the King could not deliver the customary [[speech from the throne]] during the [[State Opening of Parliament]]. Parliament found itself in an untenable position: according to long-established law it could not proceed to any business until the delivery of the King's Speech at a State Opening.<ref name=\"vol3\" /><ref name=\"david1\">David, pp. 92\u2013119</ref>\n\nAlthough arguably barred from doing so, Parliament began debating a regency. In the House of Commons, Charles James Fox declared his opinion that the Prince of Wales was automatically entitled to exercise sovereignty during the King's incapacity. A contrasting opinion was held by the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger]], who argued that, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the right to choose a regent belonged to Parliament alone.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 54</ref> He even stated that, without parliamentary authority \"the Prince of Wales had no more right&nbsp;... to assume the government, than any other individual subject of the country.\"<ref>Derry, p. 71</ref> Though disagreeing on the principle underlying a regency, Pitt agreed with Fox that the Prince of Wales would be the most convenient choice for a regent.<ref name=\"vol3\" /><ref name=\"david1\" />\n[[File:GeorgeIV1792.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Miniature by [[Richard Cosway]], 1792]]\nThe Prince of Wales\u2014though offended by Pitt's boldness\u2014did not lend his full support to Fox's approach. The Prince of Wales's brother, [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York]], declared that George would not attempt to exercise any power without previously obtaining the consent of Parliament.<ref>Derry, p. 91</ref> Following the passage of preliminary resolutions Pitt outlined a formal plan for the regency, suggesting that the powers of the Prince of Wales be greatly limited. Among other things, the Prince of Wales would not be able either to sell the King's property or to grant a [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerage]] to anyone other than a child of the King. The Prince of Wales denounced Pitt's scheme, declaring it a \"project for producing weakness, disorder, and insecurity in every branch of the administration of affairs.\"<ref name=\"may\">{{cite book|last=May|first=Thomas Erskine|authorlink=Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|title=The Constitutional History of England Since the Accession of George the Third, 1760\u20131860|year=1896|edition=11th|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|pages=chapter III pp. 184\u2013195|nopp=true}}</ref> In the interests of the nation, both factions agreed to compromise.<ref name=\"david1\" />\n\nA significant technical impediment to any Regency Bill involved the lack of a speech from the throne, which was necessary before Parliament could proceed to any debates or votes. The speech was normally delivered by the King, but could also be delivered by royal representatives known as [[Lords Commissioners]]; but no document could empower the Lords Commissioners to act unless the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] was affixed to it. The seal could not be legally affixed without the prior authorisation of the sovereign. Pitt and his fellow ministers ignored the last requirement and instructed the [[Lord Chancellor]] to affix the Great Seal without the King's consent, as the act of affixing the Great Seal in itself gave legal force to the bill. This [[legal fiction]] was denounced by [[Edmund Burke]] as \"forgery, fraud\",<ref>Derry, p. 181</ref> a \"glaring falsehood\",<ref name=\"derry\">Derry, p. 109</ref> and as a \"palpable absurdity\".<ref name=\"derry\" /> The Duke of York described the plan as \"unconstitutional and illegal.\"<ref name=\"may\" /> Nevertheless, others in Parliament felt that such a scheme was necessary to preserve an effective government. Consequently, on 3 February 1789, more than two months after it had convened, Parliament was formally opened by an \"illegal\" group of Lords Commissioners. The Regency Bill was introduced, but before it could be passed the King recovered. The King declared retroactively that the instrument authorising the Lords Commissioners to act was valid.<ref name=\"vol3\" /><ref name=\"david1\" />\n\n==Marriage and mistresses==\n[[File:GeorgeIV1798.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait after [[William Beechey|Sir William Beechey]], 1798]]\nThe Prince of Wales's debts continued to climb, and his father refused to aid him unless he married his cousin Princess [[Caroline of Brunswick]].<ref>Smith, E.

It also led to a Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry into Princess Caroline's conduct after the Prince of Wales accused her of having an illegitimate son. The investigation cleared Caroline of the charge but still revealed her behaviour to have been extraordinarily indiscreet.<ref>{{cite book | last =Ashley| first =Mike | title = The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens | publisher=Robinson| year =1998 | location =London | page =684| isbn= 1-84119-096-9}}</ref>\n\n==Regency==\n{{Main|Regency era}}\n[[File:George IV by Sir Thomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|Profile by Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]], c. 1814]]\n[[File:George IV van het Verenigd Koninkrijk.jpg|thumb|Portrait in [[Order of the Garter#Habit and insignia|Garter robes]] by Lawrence, 1816]]\n\nIn late 1810, the King was once again overcome by his malady following the death of his youngest daughter, [[Princess Amelia of the United Kingdom|Princess Amelia]]. Parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1788; without the King's consent, the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to [[letters patent]] naming Lords Commissioners. The letters patent lacked the [[Royal Sign Manual]], but were sealed by request of resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament. The Lords Commissioners appointed by the letters patent, in the name of the King, then signified the granting of [[Royal Assent]] to a bill that became the [[Regency Act 1811]]. Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent (as the Prince of Wales became known). The constraints expired one year after the passage of the Act.<ref>{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 4 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1915 | page = 50 }}</ref> The Prince of Wales became Prince Regent on 5 February 1811.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=16451|page=227|date=5 February 1811}}</ref>\n\nThe Regent let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father. The principle that the prime minister was the person supported by a majority in the House of Commons, whether the king personally favoured him or not, became established.<ref>Bagehot, Walter (1872) ''The English constitution'', p. 247</ref> His governments, with little help from the Regent, presided over British policy. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned [[Catholic emancipation]], the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by Prime Minister [[Spencer Perceval]], were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales was expected to support the Whig leader, [[Lord Grenville]]. He did not, however, immediately put Grenville and the Whigs into office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.<ref>Parissien, p. 185</ref>\n\nIn 1812, when it appeared highly unlikely that the King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.<ref>Smith, E. A., pp. 141\u2013142</ref>\n\nOn 11 May 1812, [[Assassination of Spencer Perceval|Perceval was assassinated]] by [[John Bellingham]]. The Prince Regent was prepared to reappoint all the members of the Perceval ministry under a new leader. The House of Commons formally declared its desire for a \"strong and efficient administration\",<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 144</ref> so the Prince Regent then offered leadership of the government to [[Lord Wellesley]] and afterwards to [[Lord Moira]]. He doomed the attempts of both to failure, however, by forcing each to construct an all-party ministry at a time when neither party wished to share power with the other. Possibly using the failure of the two peers as a pretext, the Prince Regent immediately reappointed the Perceval administration, with [[Lord Liverpool]] as Prime Minister.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 145</ref>\n\nThe Tories, unlike Whigs such as [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]], sought to continue the vigorous prosecution of the war in Continental Europe against the powerful and aggressive Emperor of the French, [[Napoleon I]].<ref>Smith, E. A., p.146</ref> An anti-French alliance, which included Russia, [[Prussia]], Austria, Britain and several smaller countries, defeated Napoleon in 1814. In the subsequent [[Congress of Vienna]], it was decided that the [[Electorate of Hanover]], a state that had shared a monarch with Britain since 1714, would be raised to the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. Napoleon returned from exile in 1815, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] by the [[Duke of Wellington]], brother of Lord Wellesley.<ref>Parissien, pp. 264\u2013281</ref>\n\nDuring this period George took an active interest in matters of style and taste, and his associates such as the dandy [[Beau Brummell]] and the architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] created the [[Regency style]]. In London Nash designed the Regency terraces of [[Regent's Park]] and [[Regent Street]]. George took up the new idea of the seaside spa and had the [[Brighton Pavilion]] developed as a fantastical seaside palace, adapted by Nash in the \"Indian Gothic\" style inspired loosely by the [[Taj Mahal]], with extravagant \"Indian\" and \"Chinese\" interiors.<ref>{{cite book | last =Rutherford | first =Jessica M.

They had lived separately since 1796, and both were having affairs. In 1814, Caroline left the United Kingdom for continental Europe, but she chose to return for her husband's [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]], and to publicly assert her rights as [[queen consort]]. However, he refused to recognise Caroline as Queen, and commanded British ambassadors to ensure that monarchs in foreign courts did the same. By royal command, Caroline's name was omitted from the [[Book of Common Prayer]], the [[liturgy]] of the [[Church of England]].<ref>Parissien, pp. 209\u2013224</ref>\n\nThe King sought a divorce, but his advisors suggested that any divorce proceedings might involve the publication of details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured the introduction of the [[Pains and Penalties Bill]], under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at [[Westminster Abbey]], on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.<ref>{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 4 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1915 | page = 82 }}</ref>\n[[File:George4coin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half-crown]] of George IV, 1821]]\n[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] depicting the King during [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|his 1822 trip to Scotland]]]]\n[[Coronation of George IV|George's coronation]] was a magnificent and expensive affair, costing about \u00a3243,000 (approximately \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|243000|1822|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}};{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for comparison, his father's coronation had only cost about \u00a310,000, less than a twentieth of George IV's).

At first it was believed that he would support [[Catholic emancipation]], as he had proposed a Catholic Emancipation Bill for Ireland in 1797, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1813 when he privately canvassed against the ultimately defeated Catholic Relief Bill of 1813. By 1824 he was denouncing Catholic emancipation in public.<ref>Parissien, p. 189</ref> Having taken the coronation oath on his accession, George now argued that he had sworn to uphold the Protestant faith, and could not support any pro-Catholic measures.<ref>Smith, E. A., p. 238</ref> The influence of the Crown was so great, and the will of the Tories under Prime Minister Liverpool so strong, that Catholic emancipation seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-emancipation Tory [[George Canning]]. When Canning entered office, the King, hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a public declaration to the effect that his sentiments on the question were those of his revered father, George III.<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811\u20131830'', p. 292</ref>\n\nCanning's views on the Catholic Question were not well received by the most conservative Tories, including the Duke of Wellington. As a result, the ministry was forced to include Whigs.<ref>Smith, E. A., pp. 231\u2013234</ref> Canning died later in that year, leaving [[Lord Goderich]] to lead the tenuous Tory\u2013Whig coalition. Goderich left office in 1828, to be succeeded by Wellington, who had by that time accepted that the denial of some measure of relief to Roman Catholics was politically untenable.<ref>Parissien, p. 190</ref><ref>Smith, E. A., p. 237</ref> George was never as friendly with Wellington as he had been with Canning and chose to annoy the Duke by pretending to have fought at Waterloo disguised as a German general. With great difficulty Wellington obtained the King's consent to the introduction of a Catholic Relief Bill on 29 January 1829. Under pressure from his fanatically anti-Catholic brother, the [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Duke of Cumberland]], the King withdrew his approval and in protest the Cabinet resigned ''en masse'' on 4 March. The next day the King, now under intense political pressure, reluctantly agreed to the Bill and the ministry remained in power.<ref name=\"dnb\" /> [[Royal Assent]] was finally granted to the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] on 13 April.<ref>Parissien, p. 381</ref>\n\n==Decline and death==\n[[File:His Most Excellent Majesty George the Fourth, lithograph by T.C.P., from the original by George Atkinson, profile artist to His Majesty, printed by C.

In his last years, he spent whole days in bed and suffered spasms of breathlessness that would leave him half-asphyxiated.<ref name=\"dnb\" />\n\nGeorge's last years were marked by increasing physical and mental decay and withdrawal from public affairs. Privately, a senior aide to the King confided to his diary: \"A more contemptible, cowardly, selfish, unfeeling dog does not exist&nbsp;... There have been good and wise kings but not many of them&nbsp;... and this I believe to be one of the worst.\"<ref name=sketch/> By December 1828, like his father, George was almost completely blind from [[cataracts]], and was suffering from such severe gout in his right hand and arm that he could no longer sign documents.<ref name=Smith266>Smith, E.

Now largely confined to his bedchambers, having completely lost sight in one eye and describing himself \"as blind as a beetle\", he was forced to approve legislation with a stamp of his signature in the presence of witnesses.<ref name=\"Parissien, p. 3\">Parissien, p. 3</ref> His weight was recorded to be {{convert|20|st|kg lb}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Kenneth|title=George IV: a life in caricature|year=2005|publisher=Hudson and Thames|page=202|isbn=978-0-500-25127-0}}</ref> Attacks of breathlessness due to dropsy forced him to sleep upright in a chair, and doctors frequently tapped his abdomen to drain excess fluid.<ref name=\"Smith269\"/> Despite his obvious decline, George was admired for clinging doggedly to life.<ref>Smith, E.

After political opponents put a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on wig powder]], he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair.<ref>Parissien, p. 112</ref> He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin.<ref>Parissien, p. 114</ref> His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish [[tartan]] dress as it is known today.<ref>Parissien, pp. 324\u2013326</ref>\n\nDuring the political crisis caused by Catholic emancipation, the Duke of Wellington said that George was \"the worst man he ever fell in with his whole life, the most selfish, the most false, the most ill-natured, the most entirely without one redeeming quality\".<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811\u20131830'', p. 310</ref> However, his eulogy delivered in the [[House of Lords]] called George \"the most accomplished man of his age\" and praised his knowledge and talent.<ref name=\"hibbert\">Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811\u20131830'', p. 344</ref> Wellington's true feelings probably lie somewhere between these two extremes; as he said later, George was \"a magnificent patron of the arts&nbsp;... the most extraordinary compound of talent, wit, buffoonery, obstinacy, and good feeling\u2014in short a medley of the most opposite qualities, with a great preponderance of good\u2014that I ever saw in any character in my life.\"<ref name=\"hibbert\" />\n\nUpon George's death, ''[[The Times]]'' captured elite opinion succinctly: \"There never was an individual less regretted by his fellow-creatures than this deceased king.

In later years he took the name '''Zekkariyas'''.\n\n==Career==\nCecil Womack was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. He and his brothers [[Bobby Womack|Bobby]] (1944\u20132014), [[Harry Womack|Harry]] (1945\u20131974), Friendly and Curtis, were a [[gospel music|gospel]] [[musical group|group]] appearing on the gospel circuit in the mid 50s where they were seen by [[Sam Cooke]] of the [[Soul Stirrers]] who signed them for his [[SAR Records|SAR]] records. As Cooke's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s they changed their name to [[the Valentinos]] and in 1961 began to sing and record for secular audiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soultracks.com/womack_and_womack.htm |title=Womack and Womack &#124; SoulTracks - Soul Music Biographies, News and Reviews |publisher=SoulTracks |date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref> The Valentinos had hit records with \"[[Lookin' for a Love]]\" and \"[[It's All Over Now]]\", the latter being [[cover version|covered]] by [[the Rolling Stones]]. Cooke's death at a L.A. motel in December 1964, had dramatic consequences for the Womack Brothers as SAR folded and Bobby Womack, who was now married to Sam Cooke's widow, Barbara, left the group for a solo career. The Valentinos briefly disbanded before regrouping as a quartet in 1966, signing with Chess Records where they recorded the Northern Soul hit, \"Sweeter than the Day Before\", written by Cecil Womack and singer [[Mary Wells]].

As husband of Mary Wells he was well placed to provide several R & B chart successes for her including \"[[The Doctor (Mary Wells song)|The Doctor]]\", \"Dig The Way I Feel\" and \"Never Give A Man The World\" on which he backed his wife on vocals, all released on Jubilee Records.<ref>Joel Whitburn, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles, 1942-2004, Billboard Chart Data, (2004)</ref> Womack's later songwriting credits include \"[[Love TKO]]\" a major hit for [[Teddy Pendergrass]], \"I Just Want To Satisfy You\" for [[the O'Jays]], \"Love Symphony\" for [[Patti LaBelle]], \"Your Song\" for [[Four Tops]] and \"New Day\" for [[George Benson]].<ref name=soulwalking/>\n\n==Womack & Womack==\n{{main|Womack & Womack}}\nIn 1983, Cecil and his wife Linda, who is Sam Cooke's daughter, began performing and recording together as '''Womack & Womack''', and released a successful album, ''[[Love Wars]]'' on [[Elektra Records]].

He and his brothers [[Bobby Womack|Bobby]] (1944\u20132014), [[Harry Womack|Harry]] (1945\u20131974), Friendly and Curtis, were a [[gospel music|gospel]] [[musical group|group]] appearing on the gospel circuit in the mid 50s where they were seen by [[Sam Cooke]] of the [[Soul Stirrers]] who signed them for his [[SAR Records|SAR]] records. As Cooke's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s they changed their name to [[the Valentinos]] and in 1961 began to sing and record for secular audiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soultracks.com/womack_and_womack.htm |title=Womack and Womack &#124; SoulTracks - Soul Music Biographies, News and Reviews |publisher=SoulTracks |date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref> The Valentinos had hit records with \"[[Lookin' for a Love]]\" and \"[[It's All Over Now]]\", the latter being [[cover version|covered]] by [[the Rolling Stones]]. Cooke's death at a L.A. motel in December 1964, had dramatic consequences for the Womack Brothers as SAR folded and Bobby Womack, who was now married to Sam Cooke's widow, Barbara, left the group for a solo career. The Valentinos briefly disbanded before regrouping as a quartet in 1966, signing with Chess Records where they recorded the Northern Soul hit, \"Sweeter than the Day Before\", written by Cecil Womack and singer [[Mary Wells]].

{"title_page": "Resuscitator", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2014}}\nA '''resuscitator''' is a device using positive pressure to inflate the lungs of an [[Syncope (medicine)|unconscious]] person who is [[apnea|not breathing]], in order to keep them [[oxygen]]ated and alive. There are three basic types: a ''manual'' version (also known as a ''[[bag valve mask]]'') consisting of a mask and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a high-pressure tank. The second type is the ''Expired Air'' or breath powered resuscitator. The first appearance of the second type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957. The third type is an ''oxygen powered'' resuscitator. These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered resuscitator are Time Cycled, Volume Constant Ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box. Most modern resuscitators are designed to allow the patient to breathe on his own should he recover the ability to do so. All resuscitation devices should be able to deliver >85% oxygen when a gas source is available.\n\n== History ==\n\nResuscitators began in 1907 <ref name=\"The dawn of mechanical ventilation\">{{cite book|last=Bahns|first=Ernst|title=The Evolution of Ventilation|publisher=Dragerwerk AG|isbn=3-926762-17-9|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>  when Heinrich Dr\u00e4ger, owner of the Dr\u00e4gerwerk AG Company, produced the \"Pulmotor\" Resuscitator. Considered to be the first practical device for delivering oxygen to unconscious patients or patients in respiratory distress, the Pulmotor influenced resuscitators for many years.\n\n[[File:Lungmotor resuscitation device advertisement (newspaper, 1917).jpg|thumb|Early \"Lungmotor\" resuscitation device]]\nWhen ambulance services began to form in major cities around the world, such as in London, New York and Los Angeles, [[Emergency medical services]] or EMS was developed. In these early days, perhaps the most advanced piece of equipment carried on these ambulances were devices for delivering supplemental oxygen to patients in respiratory distress. The Pulmotor and later models, such as the Emerson Resuscitator, utilized heavy tanks of oxygen to power a device which forced air into the patient's lungs. While better than no oxygen at all, these old units were problematic. Aside from often failing to sense obstructions in the airway, the Emerson, and to a lesser degree the Pulmotor, were large, bulky and heavy. The Emerson Resuscitator required two strong men to carry it from the ambulance to the victim. Perhaps the greatest defect, however, was the fact that these units \"cycled\".\n\nCycling was a feature that was built into most resuscitators built before the 1960s, including the Pulmotor and Emerson models. To ensure that the victim's lungs were not injured from being over-inflated, the resuscitator was pre-set to provide what was considered a safe pressure of oxygen. Once the unit reached this limit, it ceased to pump oxygen. For patients suffering from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), or any form of obstructive lung disease, the delivered pressure was insufficient pressure to fill the lungs with oxygen, meaning that, for patients with any sort of obstructive lung disease, units that pressure cycled did more harm than good. Pressure cycling also meant that [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] was impossible to perform if a patient's respiration was being supported by one of these units. If chest compressions were to be done, the cycle would be retarded and the resuscitator would be unable to provide oxygen as long as the chest was being compressed. For victims of smoke inhalation and drowning, however, the benefits outweighed the negatives, so these units found a home on ambulances around the world. The devices that cycled on the basis of upper and lower pressure limits are known as pressure cycled automatic resuscitators. In the UK the introduction of BS6850:1987 Ventilatory Resuscitators confirmed that \"....automatic pressure-cycled gas-powered resuscitators are not considered suitable for such use (closed chest cardiac compression)...\" and confirmed the standards required for gas powered resuscitators and operator powered resuscitators.<ref>{{cite book|title=BS 6850:1987 British Standard Specification for Ventilatory resuscitators|year=1987|publisher=British Standards Institution|isbn=0 580 15880 2}}</ref> The following year a similar ISO standard was introduced.<ref>{{cite book|title=ISO 8382:1988 Resuscitators intended for use with humans|year=1988|publisher=International Organisation for Standardisation}}</ref> Around this date most manufacturers supplied or introduced time - volume cycled resuscitators and pressure cycled devices were discontinued.\n\nBoth the Pulmotor and the Emerson depended to a large extent upon the patient's ability to breathe the oxygen in order to be beneficial. Due to the limitations imposed by the cycling feature, this meant that patients in need of rescue breathing benefited little from the application of these devices. The Emerson and Pulmotor were utilized until the mid-1960s, when a breakthrough in the history of oxygen delivery was made: the demand valve.<ref name=\"Demand valve assembly for use with breathing or resuscitation equipment\" <ref>{{cite book|last=CHANEY|first=G.|title=US Patent 3,285,261|date=Nov 15, 1966}}</ref>\n\nThe demand valve was a revolutionary new piece of equipment. At the simple push of a button, high-flow oxygen could be delivered into the lungs of the patient without the worry of the device cycling and, thus, ceasing to pump oxygen. Any amount of pressure that might be required to inflate the lungs could be achieved, and the demand valve was better able to detect obstructions in the lungs and more able to \"work with the patient\" than the Emerson and Pulmotor could. The demand valve could also provide oxygen at any flow rate required to a conscious patient in respiratory distress. Conserving the often limited reserves of oxygen was easier with a demand valve, as oxygen was designed only to flow when either the button was depressed or the casualty inhaled. Later medical opinion decided that getting high flow oxygen into a patients airway was a factor in causing vomiting and aspiration. Demand valve resuscitators were introduced with restrictors to limit flow rates to 40 lpm. Use of the demand valve resuscitator in Europe was limited by the lack of pressure relief valve or audible alarm for high pressure.\n\n== Modern day ==\nThe [[bag valve mask|ambu-bag]] was a further advancement in resuscitation. Introduced in the 1960s by the Danish company Ambu, this device allowed two rescuers to perform CPR and ventilation on a non-breathing patient with an acceptable chance of success. The ambu-bag has now mostly replaced the demand valve as the primary method of ventilation, largely due to concerns of potential over-inflation with the demand valve by untrained rescuers. The ambu-bag, unlike the older version of the demand valve (all new models of demand valve now have pressure relief valves set at 60&nbsp;cm of water to prevent accidental overinflation of the lungs), has a \"pop-off\" valve to prevent inflation at greater than 40 pounds -per-square-inch (275.79 kilo-pascals), with the result being that it is generally more common in the pre-hospital setting than the demand valve. However, the demand valve remains popular with BLS providers, and in situations where conserving supplies of oxygen is  of paramount importance. The demand valve, while less popular today than it was previously, still remains in service, albeit with important safety features added, including the addition of a pressure-relief valve to prevent over-inflation and the restriction of its flow to 40 liters a minute.\n\nEven newer products have been developed and are now available. In 1992 the Genesis(R) II time/volume cycled resuscitator (now upgraded to meet the current, International, resuscitation guidelines and called the CAREvent(R) ALS and CA)provide the SIMV automatic ventilation mode with demand breathing for the spontaneously breathing patient. These devices work like full blown transport ventilators yet are simple enough to operate that they can be used in an emergency situation by pre-hospital healthcare providers and are small enough to be easily transportable. Having a manual override control for use during mask CPR they meet the requirements of the current resuscitation standards. The Oxylator (R) EM-100 introduced in the late 1990s and subsequently replaced by the more flexible Oxylator (R) EMX and HD are pressure cycled devices that utilize pressure, rather than time, cycling to ventilate the patient. \nMore recently the microVENT resuscitator range introduced two new models, the microVENT(R) CPR and the microVENT(R)World.

There are three basic types: a ''manual'' version (also known as a ''[[bag valve mask]]'') consisting of a mask and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a high-pressure tank. The second type is the ''Expired Air'' or breath powered resuscitator. The first appearance of the second type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957. The third type is an ''oxygen powered'' resuscitator. These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered resuscitator are Time Cycled, Volume Constant Ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box.
