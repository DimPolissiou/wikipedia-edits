It received mostly positive reviews, as well as one [[Primetime Emmy Award]] win, six [[Annie Award]] nominations, and two additional Emmy Award nominations during its run. The series finale, \"Chowder Grows Up\", aired on August 7, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series follows an aspiring young chef apprentice named Chowder and his day-to-day adventures in Chef Mung Daal's [[catering]] company. Although he means well, Chowder often finds himself in predicaments due to his [[Gourmand|perpetual appetite]] and his nature as a [[wikt:scatterbrain|scatterbrain]]. It is animated with both [[traditional animation]] as well as short [[stop motion]] and [[puppet]] sequences that are inter-cut into episodes and the end credits.

Chowder wants to become a great chef, but he is very impulsive and scatterbrained and often gives in to his urges. He is always hungry and eats anything, even a customer's order. Chowder can also regurgitate objects, and he is used as a storage container by the other characters. According to Greenblatt, he is a composite of a cat, a bear and a rabbit, and his species was verified in at least one episode.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Puckerberry Overlords|series=Chowder|airdate=January 18, 2008}}</ref> C.

Shnitzel is the \"[[straight man]]\" to the other more excitable characters and is frequently agitated.

H. Greenblatt): Chowder's pet, who lives in a cage next to his bed. Kimchi is an anthropomorphic flatus (due to the unpleasant odor of [[kimchi]]). He likes things with odors unpleasant for the other characters, and he \"talks\" by making flatulent sounds. Kimchi was first seen in the episode \"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin\". Kimchi is usually shown with a blank personality but in \"Stinky Love\" it is shown that he has an opinion.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/> What happens to Kimchi in the final episode is unknown, but it\u2019s possible that he still lives with Chowder.\n*'''Gazpacho''' (voiced by [[Dana Snyder]]): A [[woolly mammoth]] storekeeper who sells strange [[produce]] and ingredients at the farmer's market. He does his best to offer advice to Chowder when needed. He lives with his overbearing mother, who never appears on screen, but is present at the end of episode \"Gazpacho!\". In \"The Spookiest House in Marzipan\" it is hinted at that Gazpacho has no mother, and that he actually suffers with [[dissociative identity disorder]], but creator Greenblatt says this was merely to \"pay homage to ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''\". Gazpacho shows no interest in moving out and improving his own life. Gazpacho's worst enemies are [[ninja]]s. Greenblatt named him after the cold soup [[gazpacho]]; Greenblatt said that he did not know why, but the name suited the character immediately.<ref name=\"food\"/> In the final episode, Gazpacho closed the stand, and became a nomad. He later pursued his dream and open a Comedy Night Club.\n*'''Panini''' (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]): A 12-year-old pink [[cabbit]] who has a crush on Chowder and reminds him at every opportunity. Chowder does not return the feelings and responds with \"I'm not your boyfriend!\" whenever she greets him. Panini is an apprentice to Ms. Endive, and is also possessive of Chowder. Panini gets jealous when she sees Chowder with another girl, in which Chowder really does to avoid her. Her original character concept had her [[bullying|bully]] Chowder in a manner described by Greenblatt as similar to [[Angelica Pickles]] from ''[[Rugrats]]''.<ref name=\"OldPanEn\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/06/early-endive-panini-designs.html|title=Early Endive & Panini Designs|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=June 15, 2009|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=June 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714054958/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/06/early-endive-panini-designs.html|archive-date=July 14, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenblatt removed the pointy ears since he felt this did not fit in with the rounded shapes in ''Chowder''. Greenblatt did not like characters similar to Angelica and believed that he needed to make Panini \"cuter and sweeter\".<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> Greenblatt said that the details of Panini formed when the creator decided that Panini had a crush on Chowder; since Chowder is not old enough to fall in love with females, according to Greenblatt this aspect would frustrate Chowder \"in a more fun way\".<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> In the last episode, it is shown that Chowder finally returned Panini's feelings and accepted her because he realizes that he made Panini's life miserable and they are married with many kids and was voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. Panini's name literally means \"sandwiches\" in Italian, while her former name, Borlotti, is a type of beans. In the final episode Panini married Chowder, and is currently a mother of 50, she then promised Chowder to stop having more. It\u2019s also likely that she took over Truffles old job.\n*'''Gorgonzola''' (voiced by Will Shadley): A young green [[rat]] apprentice candle holder with an unlikeable attitude. He shows jealousy over Chowder which is, in fact Chowder having a better job than him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/07/gorgonzola.html|title=Gorgonzola|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=July 18, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107091545/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/07/gorgonzola.html|archive-date=November 7, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> He will occasionally use Chowder, and if forced, will partner with him in games. Since [[blue cheese]] was one of the few foods Greenblatt disliked, he decided to use the name \"[[Gorgonzola (cheese)|gorgonzola]]\" for a character who did not get along with Chowder. Gorgonzola resembles a green [[opossum]] or a green [[rat]]. He wears tattered brown clothes and no shoes, and has a partially melted candle on his head (for traditional reasons). He is desperate to get cash, and will do almost anything to get it. Gorgonzola also loves to play Sniffleball, as seen in the episode ''Sniffleball''. Despite his unpleasant and boastful attitude to Chowder, Chowder sees him as a close friend, which irritates him even more. Gorgonzola is an apprentice to Stilton, who is a candle holder, hence why both characters have burning candles on their heads.<ref name=\"food\"/> In the final episode, Gorgonzola runs a very successful company, most likely involving candle holding.\n*'''Ms. Endive''' (voiced by [[Mindy Sterling]]): An [[obesity|obese]], intelligent, and somewhat snobbish 46-year-old female chef who teaches cooking to Panini with strict discipline. She is usually depicted as gargantuan in size. This is shown in the episode \"The Apprentice Games\" where Mung Daal and Chowder enter the games by riding on Endive's posterior. She regularly berates Mung Daal, whom she considers a rival. In the episode \"Chowder's Girlfriend\", it is revealed she despises boys and boyfriends because her fianc\u00e9 did not show up on their wedding day. Ms. Endive is first seen in the second episode with Panini, \"Chowder's Girlfriend\". The creator describes her as [[Martha Stewart]] with [[Oompa-Loompa]] colors.<ref name=\"endive\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/04/endive.html|title=Ms. Endive|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=April 19, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118022158/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/04/endive.html|archive-date=November 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenblatt chose to name her after the [[endive]] since endive is bitter and Belgian endive is fancy; hence the character is bitter and fancy.<ref name=\"food\"/> Endive's character stayed constant throughout the initial development. The long nose, which changed from a rectangular shape to a triangle shape for the final version, represents how Endive looks down at other characters. It was revealed in later episodes that Ms. Endive is in love with Shnitzel. Greenblatt said that he felt that her evolution throughout the series was fun to observe, especially when William Reiss wrote plots involving Endive.<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> In the final episode, Endive is living a happy life with her Husband, Schnitzel.\n\n===Recurring===\n*'''Kiwi''' (voiced by C. H. Greenblatt) is a [[photorealistic]] pink creature who always gives advice to Chowder and his friends and occasionally provides interstitial narrations, especially at times where particularly corny humor is displayed. His name is revealed (for the first and only time ever in the show's run) in the episode \"Brain Grub\", where it is known that after Chowder alters the animated universe, Kiwi is reduced to selling used cars.\n*'''Ceviche''' (voiced by Elan Garfias): A young yellow (and somewhat androgynous) [[goat]] apprentice to Pat\u00e9 and Panini's best friend, Ceviche was introduced in the episode \"The Apprentice Games\". He practices aerobic-style dancing and is very charitable and kind to others. Because of his admirable attitude and amazing talents (as well as good looks, as it was shown on one episode that he has a well-sculpted body) he is well-liked.  He is good friends with Panini and will make unwanted advances upon her, which are either refused or unnoticed. Ceviche is also a close friend to Chowder. He has a crush on Panini.  He speaks in a [[wikt:monotone|monotonous]] voice and serves as [[deadpan]] humor for the show.\n*'''Pat\u00e9''' (voiced by John DiMaggio): A tall, well-sculpted [[humanoid]] ballet dance master and operatic singer with a deep voice, grass-green hair, a small black hat, and exaggerated lips who is the mentor of Ceviche. Pat\u00e9 was introduced briefly on the second episode of the first show ''Chowder's Girlfriend'' (Episode #1b), where he sings \"I'm Not Your Boyfriend\" on stage to Panini (on behalf of Chowder) in front of an audience. His name, however, was revealed for the first time on ''The Apprentice Games'' (Episode 20), where he appeared as a judge for the Marzipan City Apprentice Games. In that same episode, it was also revealed that he lives in another dimension, as was shown by the portal through which he and Ceviche made their entrance and exit.\n*'''Chestnut''' (originally voiced by [[Tone L\u014dc]], then [[John DiMaggio]]): Like the food, Chestnut is small and tough. He is a tiny, [[blue]] horned [[devil]]-like creature with a deep, gravelly voice and, to many character's surprise, is physically very strong.  Because of his size, he uses everyday objects as other things (e.g. using a briefcase for a hydrofoil, or a hat as a vacation home). He sings small songs to himself, usually consisting of his catchphrase of \"Dinka-loo, dinka-lee.\" He is teacher of the BLTs, a parody of the [[SAT]]s. He always refers to himself in the [[Grammatical person|third person]] when speaking.\n*'''Reuben''' (voiced by [[Paul Reubens]]): A pig who is a [[confidence trick|conman]] and steals from others.\n* Mr. Fugu (voiced by [[Bob Joles]]): A sentient floating balloon who is said to be Mung's most frequent customer. He is proven to be more greedy than Chowder and never shares any food with him. He is often seen with his valet, Foie Gras, a [[Maneki-neko]] (meows provided by [[George Takei]]) holding Mr. Fugu's string as he cannot control his flotation.\n*'''Sgt. Hoagie''' (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]): He is a [[dog]] who is a police officer in Marzipan City. In ''The Hot Date'', he was going out on a date after several years and asked the other cops for advice.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Chowder episodes}}\n{{:List of Chowder episodes}}\nA total of 49 episodes were aired in the series. Season 1, which consists of 20 episodes, started on November 2, 2007, with the series premiere, entitled \"The Froggy Apple Crumble Thumpkin/Chowder's Girlfriend\". Season 1 ended on July 24, 2008, with the special \"The Apprentice Games\". Season 2 also contains 20 episodes, debuting on October 1, 2008, with \"The Arborians/The Garage Sale\", and ending with \"A Faire to Remember/Tofu-Town Showdown\", broadcasting on September 29, 2009, and October 6, 2009, respectively. Season 3 consists of only 9 episodes, premiering October 12, 2009, with \"The Blast Raz\", and ending with the series finale, entitled \"Chowder Grows Up\", which aired on August 7, 2010.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:ChowderPuppets.jpg|thumb|The puppet versions of the characters Chowder (a Hand-Rod puppet) and Mung Daal]]\nDuring his time working on Nickelodeon's ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/> Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]''. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy.<ref name=\"kitty-interview\"/> Some of the inspiration comes from [[Dr. Seuss]], with other inspiration from [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s.<ref name=\"kitty-interview\"/><ref name=\"armada\">{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=139420 |title=Meet the Master Chef&nbsp;\u2013 C.H.

A similar technique was used in the ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' video game series (particularly for the Stan), the Nickelodeon series [[The Off-Beats]], and the [[Mr. Bean (animated TV series)|''Mr. Bean'' animated series]].<ref name=\"armada\"/>\n\nThe show is also known for the very wide variety of media used in various episodes. These include animation using watercolors and ink-and-paint in addition to the cartoon's classic pattern style. It also uses stop motion animation with real food, action figures and clay; live-action scenes with the voice actors of the show and puppets; both marionette and hand-controlled. This was also sometimes used in ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]''. It boasts one of the most diverse varieties of mediums used in any single series.\n\n==Cancellation==\n''Chowder'' was cancelled by Cartoon Network in August 2009, as the network felt the show did not fit its new demographic of older boys, favoring shows such as the live-action ''[[Destroy, Build, Destroy]]'' instead.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/152842491532/you-mentioned-in-an-ask-that-you-went-through-the | title=Tumblr | access-date=November 15, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116103638/http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/152842491532/you-mentioned-in-an-ask-that-you-went-through-the | archive-date=November 16, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> On his blog, C.H.

It received mostly positive reviews, as well as one [[Primetime Emmy Award]] win, six [[Annie Award]] nominations, and two additional Emmy Award nominations during its run.

Greenblatt said that he based Truffles on his mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/11/mahjongg-night.html|title=Mahjongg Night|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|work=Nerd Armada|date=November 28, 2007|accessdate=September 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823031150/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/11/mahjongg-night.html|archive-date=August 23, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenblatt said that he initially found difficulty in working on any story with Truffles since the character could be \"so abrasive\" that the ''Chowder'' staff had to be \"a little more sensitive about finding her softer side.\" Greenblatt said that the staff eventually decided that \"a little Truffles goes a long way.\" Therefore, she would appear occasionally in ''Chowder'' in a manner similar to how [[Oscar the Grouch]] appears on ''[[Sesame Street]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakertoons.blogspot.com/2009/08/exit-interview-with-ch-greenblatt.html|title=Exit interview with C.H.

H. Greenblatt): Chowder's pet, who lives in a cage next to his bed. Kimchi is an anthropomorphic flatus (due to the unpleasant odor of [[kimchi]]). He likes things with odors unpleasant for the other characters, and he \"talks\" by making flatulent sounds. Kimchi was first seen in the episode \"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin\". Kimchi is usually shown with a blank personality but in \"Stinky Love\" it is shown that he has an opinion.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/> What happens to Kimchi in the final episode is unknown, but it\u2019s possible that he still lives with Chowder.\n*'''Gazpacho''' (voiced by [[Dana Snyder]]): A [[woolly mammoth]] storekeeper who sells strange [[produce]] and ingredients at the farmer's market. He does his best to offer advice to Chowder when needed. He lives with his overbearing mother, who never appears on screen, but is present at the end of episode \"Gazpacho!\". In \"The Spookiest House in Marzipan\" it is hinted at that Gazpacho has no mother, and that he actually suffers with [[dissociative identity disorder]], but creator Greenblatt says this was merely to \"pay homage to ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''\". Gazpacho shows no interest in moving out and improving his own life. Gazpacho's worst enemies are [[ninja]]s. Greenblatt named him after the cold soup [[gazpacho]]; Greenblatt said that he did not know why, but the name suited the character immediately.<ref name=\"food\"/> In the final episode, Gazpacho closed the stand, and became a nomad. He later pursued his dream and open a Comedy Night Club.\n*'''Panini''' (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]): A 12-year-old pink [[cabbit]] who has a crush on Chowder and reminds him at every opportunity. Chowder does not return the feelings and responds with \"I'm not your boyfriend!\" whenever she greets him. Panini is an apprentice to Ms. Endive, and is also possessive of Chowder. Panini gets jealous when she sees Chowder with another girl, in which Chowder really does to avoid her. Her original character concept had her [[bullying|bully]] Chowder in a manner described by Greenblatt as similar to [[Angelica Pickles]] from ''[[Rugrats]]''.<ref name=\"OldPanEn\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/06/early-endive-panini-designs.html|title=Early Endive & Panini Designs|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=June 15, 2009|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=June 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714054958/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2009/06/early-endive-panini-designs.html|archive-date=July 14, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenblatt removed the pointy ears since he felt this did not fit in with the rounded shapes in ''Chowder''. Greenblatt did not like characters similar to Angelica and believed that he needed to make Panini \"cuter and sweeter\".<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> Greenblatt said that the details of Panini formed when the creator decided that Panini had a crush on Chowder; since Chowder is not old enough to fall in love with females, according to Greenblatt this aspect would frustrate Chowder \"in a more fun way\".<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> In the last episode, it is shown that Chowder finally returned Panini's feelings and accepted her because he realizes that he made Panini's life miserable and they are married with many kids and was voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. Panini's name literally means \"sandwiches\" in Italian, while her former name, Borlotti, is a type of beans. In the final episode Panini married Chowder, and is currently a mother of 50, she then promised Chowder to stop having more. It\u2019s also likely that she took over Truffles old job.\n*'''Gorgonzola''' (voiced by Will Shadley): A young green [[rat]] apprentice candle holder with an unlikeable attitude. He shows jealousy over Chowder which is, in fact Chowder having a better job than him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/07/gorgonzola.html|title=Gorgonzola|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=July 18, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107091545/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/07/gorgonzola.html|archive-date=November 7, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> He will occasionally use Chowder, and if forced, will partner with him in games. Since [[blue cheese]] was one of the few foods Greenblatt disliked, he decided to use the name \"[[Gorgonzola (cheese)|gorgonzola]]\" for a character who did not get along with Chowder. Gorgonzola resembles a green [[opossum]] or a green [[rat]]. He wears tattered brown clothes and no shoes, and has a partially melted candle on his head (for traditional reasons). He is desperate to get cash, and will do almost anything to get it. Gorgonzola also loves to play Sniffleball, as seen in the episode ''Sniffleball''. Despite his unpleasant and boastful attitude to Chowder, Chowder sees him as a close friend, which irritates him even more. Gorgonzola is an apprentice to Stilton, who is a candle holder, hence why both characters have burning candles on their heads.<ref name=\"food\"/> In the final episode, Gorgonzola runs a very successful company, most likely involving candle holding.\n*'''Ms. Endive''' (voiced by [[Mindy Sterling]]): An [[obesity|obese]], intelligent, and somewhat snobbish 46-year-old female chef who teaches cooking to Panini with strict discipline. She is usually depicted as gargantuan in size. This is shown in the episode \"The Apprentice Games\" where Mung Daal and Chowder enter the games by riding on Endive's posterior. She regularly berates Mung Daal, whom she considers a rival. In the episode \"Chowder's Girlfriend\", it is revealed she despises boys and boyfriends because her fianc\u00e9 did not show up on their wedding day. Ms. Endive is first seen in the second episode with Panini, \"Chowder's Girlfriend\". The creator describes her as [[Martha Stewart]] with [[Oompa-Loompa]] colors.<ref name=\"endive\">{{cite web|url=http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/04/endive.html|title=Ms. Endive|first=C.H.|last=Greenblatt|date=April 19, 2007|work=Nerd Armada|accessdate=November 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118022158/http://nerdarmada.blogspot.com/2007/04/endive.html|archive-date=November 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenblatt chose to name her after the [[endive]] since endive is bitter and Belgian endive is fancy; hence the character is bitter and fancy.<ref name=\"food\"/> Endive's character stayed constant throughout the initial development. The long nose, which changed from a rectangular shape to a triangle shape for the final version, represents how Endive looks down at other characters. It was revealed in later episodes that Ms. Endive is in love with Shnitzel. Greenblatt said that he felt that her evolution throughout the series was fun to observe, especially when William Reiss wrote plots involving Endive.<ref name=\"OldPanEn\"/> In the final episode, Endive is living a happy life with her Husband, Schnitzel.\n\n===Recurring===\n*'''Kiwi''' (voiced by C. H. Greenblatt) is a [[photorealistic]] pink creature who always gives advice to Chowder and his friends and occasionally provides interstitial narrations, especially at times where particularly corny humor is displayed. His name is revealed (for the first and only time ever in the show's run) in the episode \"Brain Grub\", where it is known that after Chowder alters the animated universe, Kiwi is reduced to selling used cars.\n*'''Ceviche''' (voiced by Elan Garfias): A young yellow (and somewhat androgynous) [[goat]] apprentice to Pat\u00e9 and Panini's best friend, Ceviche was introduced in the episode \"The Apprentice Games\". He practices aerobic-style dancing and is very charitable and kind to others. Because of his admirable attitude and amazing talents (as well as good looks, as it was shown on one episode that he has a well-sculpted body) he is well-liked.  He is good friends with Panini and will make unwanted advances upon her, which are either refused or unnoticed. Ceviche is also a close friend to Chowder. He has a crush on Panini.  He speaks in a [[wikt:monotone|monotonous]] voice and serves as [[deadpan]] humor for the show.\n*'''Pat\u00e9''' (voiced by John DiMaggio): A tall, well-sculpted [[humanoid]] ballet dance master and operatic singer with a deep voice, grass-green hair, a small black hat, and exaggerated lips who is the mentor of Ceviche. Pat\u00e9 was introduced briefly on the second episode of the first show ''Chowder's Girlfriend'' (Episode #1b), where he sings \"I'm Not Your Boyfriend\" on stage to Panini (on behalf of Chowder) in front of an audience. His name, however, was revealed for the first time on ''The Apprentice Games'' (Episode 20), where he appeared as a judge for the Marzipan City Apprentice Games. In that same episode, it was also revealed that he lives in another dimension, as was shown by the portal through which he and Ceviche made their entrance and exit.\n*'''Chestnut''' (originally voiced by [[Tone L\u014dc]], then [[John DiMaggio]]): Like the food, Chestnut is small and tough. He is a tiny, [[blue]] horned [[devil]]-like creature with a deep, gravelly voice and, to many character's surprise, is physically very strong.  Because of his size, he uses everyday objects as other things (e.g. using a briefcase for a hydrofoil, or a hat as a vacation home). He sings small songs to himself, usually consisting of his catchphrase of \"Dinka-loo, dinka-lee.\" He is teacher of the BLTs, a parody of the [[SAT]]s. He always refers to himself in the [[Grammatical person|third person]] when speaking.\n*'''Reuben''' (voiced by [[Paul Reubens]]): A pig who is a [[confidence trick|conman]] and steals from others.\n* Mr. Fugu (voiced by [[Bob Joles]]): A sentient floating balloon who is said to be Mung's most frequent customer. He is proven to be more greedy than Chowder and never shares any food with him. He is often seen with his valet, Foie Gras, a [[Maneki-neko]] (meows provided by [[George Takei]]) holding Mr. Fugu's string as he cannot control his flotation.\n*'''Sgt. Hoagie''' (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]): He is a [[dog]] who is a police officer in Marzipan City. In ''The Hot Date'', he was going out on a date after several years and asked the other cops for advice.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Chowder episodes}}\n{{:List of Chowder episodes}}\nA total of 49 episodes were aired in the series. Season 1, which consists of 20 episodes, started on November 2, 2007, with the series premiere, entitled \"The Froggy Apple Crumble Thumpkin/Chowder's Girlfriend\". Season 1 ended on July 24, 2008, with the special \"The Apprentice Games\". Season 2 also contains 20 episodes, debuting on October 1, 2008, with \"The Arborians/The Garage Sale\", and ending with \"A Faire to Remember/Tofu-Town Showdown\", broadcasting on September 29, 2009, and October 6, 2009, respectively. Season 3 consists of only 9 episodes, premiering October 12, 2009, with \"The Blast Raz\", and ending with the series finale, entitled \"Chowder Grows Up\", which aired on August 7, 2010.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:ChowderPuppets.jpg|thumb|The puppet versions of the characters Chowder (a Hand-Rod puppet) and Mung Daal]]\nDuring his time working on Nickelodeon's ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/> Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]''. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy.<ref name=\"kitty-interview\"/> Some of the inspiration comes from [[Dr. Seuss]], with other inspiration from [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s.<ref name=\"kitty-interview\"/><ref name=\"armada\">{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=139420 |title=Meet the Master Chef&nbsp;\u2013 C.H.

Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on ''Chowder'' before the show made it to air in 2007.<ref name=\"toonzone\"/>\n\n==Production and format==\nEpisodes are produced in seasons which consist of twenty 24-minute episodes.

These include animation using watercolors and ink-and-paint in addition to the cartoon's classic pattern style. It also uses stop motion animation with real food, action figures and clay; live-action scenes with the voice actors of the show and puppets; both marionette and hand-controlled. This was also sometimes used in ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]''. It boasts one of the most diverse varieties of mediums used in any single series.\n\n==Cancellation==\n''Chowder'' was cancelled by Cartoon Network in August 2009, as the network felt the show did not fit its new demographic of older boys, favoring shows such as the live-action ''[[Destroy, Build, Destroy]]'' instead.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/152842491532/you-mentioned-in-an-ask-that-you-went-through-the | title=Tumblr | access-date=November 15, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116103638/http://chgreenblatt.tumblr.com/post/152842491532/you-mentioned-in-an-ask-that-you-went-through-the | archive-date=November 16, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> On his blog, C.H.

The following year, at the age of 20, he was nominated for the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] award, named in the [[PFA Team of the Year]] and Champions League Squad of the Season, and became the youngest-ever player to start in two consecutive Champions League finals, with Liverpool winning the [[2019 UEFA Champions League Final]].\n\nAlexander-Arnold has also represented England at various youth levels and made his senior debut in 2018.

He sort of nodded and gave me a warm sympathetic smile and said, \"I forgive you.\"<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\" /></blockquote>For Hastie, the death of the boys was both personally affecting and a turning point in his political outlook:<blockquote>I just felt sick... It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5.

An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s<ref name=\":2\" /> the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties. For Hastie:<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission. We were protecting the base from attack. We just thought of Aussie diggers, aid workers, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]] and everyone else supporting us behind the wire.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

One SASR operator recalled \"We watched the heat dissipate from his shit in the cold of night.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Hastie's men deployed to make the capture by Bushmasters, along with a Wakunish force element. These were special-forces-like soldiers from the North of Afghanistan, whom Hastie held in high regard. \"The Wakunish were disciplined. They were tactically proficient. They were sensitive to the populace...\" They encircled the target and attacked at first light, as per their rules of engagement for this context. The entire mission was observed by the commander of all Special Operations Forces for [[International Security Assistance Force]], Brigadeer Bill Dechow, who \"watched on as the Wakunish made entry and captured the senior objective without bloodshed.\" Hastie regarded it as exemplary of the kind of work special forces could achieve, \"surgical and sensitive to locals.

He sort of nodded and gave me a warm sympathetic smile and said, \"I forgive you.\"<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\" /></blockquote>For Hastie, the death of the boys was both personally affecting and a turning point in his political outlook:<blockquote>I just felt sick... It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

Suicide bomber capture ====\nIntelligence gathering operations constantly scanned for \"chatter\" on plans for suicide bombings by the Taliban. To interdict these operations, Hastie was required to work with local forces, however by May 2013 the Wakunish were now working independently,<ref name=\":2\" /> so Australia's forces need to work with the Provincial Response Company<ref name=\":2\" /> with whom they had few shared values. One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5. Truck bomb ====\nHastie's B Company received intelligence of a Taliban plan to use a truck to enter their own [[Forward operating base]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s<ref name=\":2\" /> the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties. For Hastie:<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission. We were protecting the base from attack. We just thought of Aussie diggers, aid workers, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]] and everyone else supporting us behind the wire.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

{"title_page": "Court-martial of Fitz John Porter", "text_new": "[[File:Fitz John Porter.jpg|thumb|250px|Fitz John Porter.]]\n\nThe '''court-martial of Fitz John Porter''' (November 25, 1862{{spaced ndash}}January 22, 1863) was a major event of the [[American Civil War]]. [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Fitz John Porter]] was found guilty of disobeying a lawful order, and misconduct in front of the enemy and removed from command based on internal political machinations of the [[Union Army]]. The [[court-martial]] was later found to be unjust and overturned, and Porter was reinstated in the [[United States Army]].\n\n==Background==\nPorter was a career army officer from a family of famous naval officers, including his cousin, [[David Farragut]], the first [[Admiral (United States)|United States admiral]]. He graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in 1845, eighth in his class, and served with great distinction as an artillery officer in the Mexican War.<ref>Anders, 1\u20132.</ref> After the war, Porter served in various posts, including a stint as an instructor of artillery at West Point, where he became good friends with both [[George B. McClellan]] and [[William B. Franklin]] and, eventually, post adjutant for [[Robert E. Lee]].\n\nAs tensions increased in 1860, Porter traveled to threatened locations in the South in order to prepare for the upcoming conflict, including Charleston, South Carolina, where he advised [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Robert Anderson (major)|Robert Anderson]] be placed in charge of the defenses and that they be consolidated at [[Fort Sumter]].<ref>Anders, 2.</ref> When war broke out, he initially served on the staff of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Patterson]], but when his old friend McClellan was asked to take charge of the [[Army of the Potomac]] he was transferred to command a division at the new commander's explicit request.\n\nWhen McClellan took the Army of the Potomac south for the [[Peninsula Campaign]], he reorganized the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II]], [[III Corps (Union Army)|III]], and [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV]] Corps to create two new provisional units, the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] under Porter, and the [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] under Franklin. McClellan trusted his old friends much more than the other corps commanders and wanted subordinates he considered loyal.<ref>Snell, Mark A (2002).''From First to Last: The Life of Major General William B. Franklin''. Fordham University Press. 131.</ref> He relied, in particular, on Porter, who often acted as his surrogate on the battlefield during McClellan's frequent absences. One such instance, the [[Battle of Malvern Hill]], especially cemented Porter's reputation as a superb commander on the battlefield.\n\n==Porter's command at the Second Battle of Bull Run==\n{{main|Second Battle of Bull Run}}\n\nAfter the failure of McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, Porter's corps was one of the corps reassigned to the [[Army of Virginia]] under Major General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]. Porter shared his commander and friend's dislike for Pope both personally and professionally. As he moved his corps into position at Aquia Creek near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], Porter sent a number of telegrams to Major General [[Ambrose Burnside]] complaining about Pope's poor leadership and handling of the army.<ref>Anders, 195\u201399.</ref> Burnside, who, along with many others, shared Porter's low opinion of Pope's abilities, forwarded these communications to McClellan, [[General-in-Chief]] [[Henry Halleck]], [[Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]], and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Halleck, Stanton, and Lincoln were not pleased, since Pope had been their choice to lead in an attempt to sideline the uncooperative McClellan. The President was especially displeased, since Pope was a personal friend.\n\n{{Quote box\n|align = right\n|width = 35%\n|quote = The major-general commanding directs that you start at 1 o'clock to-night, and come forward with your whole corps...Hooker has had very severe action with the enemy...[and the enemy has] been driven back, but is retiring along the railroad.

Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], August 27, 6:30pm<ref>http://www.civilwarhome.com/prtrchgs.htm Contains many electronically transcribed excerpts from the ''War of the Rebellion''</ref>\n}}\n\nOn August 27, the left wing of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] under [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]] seized Pope's supply depot at [[Manassas|Manassas Junction]]. Pope believed the main Confederate army to be somewhere south of his force and so became panicked and sent a flurry of orders. In a repetitive and unorganized telegram sent to Porter, Pope ordered him to join him at [[Bristow, Virginia|Bristoe Station]] by morning with his corps, or as much of his corps as he could gather by 1:00 in the morning. He was also to send word to another Union corps commander, Major General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], to secure [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton Junction]].\n\nPorter consulted with his divisional commanders, Major General [[George W. Morell]] and [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[George Sykes]], about the feasibility of marching that evening. Both generals were against the movement, they would later testify, but Porter wanted to go forward. Morrell and Sykes were finally able to convince Porter that the way was too dark and they were too unsure of the location of the Confederate forces in order to move in the dark and the order to move at 1:00 am was disregarded and instead the V Corps moved to Bristoe Station the morning of August 28. By 5:30 that evening{{spaced ndash}}when Jackson's men first engaged a division from the corps of Major General [[Irvin McDowell]]{{spaced ndash}}Porter had moved his men to [[Greenwich, Virginia|Greenwich]], making him the most westerly located corps commander in the Army of Virginia.<ref>Esposito, Map 60.</ref>\n\nDuring the next morning, August 29, Pope's attention was occupied along the unfinished railroad grade that Jackson was using as defense while the Union army assaulted in wave after wave. Meanwhile, Porter, now joined with parts of McDowell's [[I Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] and the general himself, repulsed an exploratory attack by the Confederate cavalry division under Major General [[J.E.B. Stuart]]. Porter and McDowell had no sooner halted their advance when they received an order from Pope, now known as the \"Joint Order.\" Historian John J. Hennessy described the order as a \"masterpiece of contradiction and obfuscation that would become the focal point of decades of wrangling.\" It described the attacks on Jackson's left, which were already underway, but was unclear about what Porter and McDowell were supposed to do. Rather than moving \"to\" Gainesville and striking Jackson's supposedly unprotected right flank, it described a move \"toward\" Gainesville and \"as soon as communication is established [with the other divisions] the whole command shall halt. It may be necessary to fall back behind Bull Run to Centreville tonight.\" Nowhere in the order did Pope explicitly direct Porter and McDowell to attack and he concluded the order with \"If any considerable advantages are to be gained from departing from this order it will not be strictly carried out,\" rendering the document virtually useless as a military order.<ref>Hennessy, John J., ''Return to Bull Run: The Campaign and Battle of Second Manassas'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8061-3187-X}}, pp. 232\u201336.</ref>\n\nPope launched another assault on Jackson, believing that Porter and McDowell would be attacking Jackson's right-flank at any moment. But Brigadier General [[John Buford]] had arrived from [[Battle of Thoroughfare Gap|Thoroughfare Gap]] to report that Major General [[James Longstreet|James Longstreet's]] wing of the Army of Northern Virginia had broken out of the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and was on its way to the battlefield. In fact, by noon, the first units of Longstreet's corps were already taking up positions guarding Jackson's right. McDowell, the senior commander, decided to not move the two corps to Gainesville and attack, but, for unknown reasons, did not forward Buford's report to Pope.\n\n{{Quote box\n|align = left\n|width = 35%\n|quote = Your line of march brings you in on the enemy's right flank. I desire you to push forward into action at once on the enemy's flank, and, if possible, on his rear, keeping your right in communication with General Reynolds.

[[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], August 29, 4:30pm<ref name=\"civilwarhome.com\">[http://www.civilwarhome.com/prtrchgs.htm Fitz John Porter's Charges and Specifications<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\n}}\n\nAt 4:30 pm, Pope, frustrated that no attack was occurring on Jackson's right flank and still unaware of Longstreet's presence, despite numerous reports of a large Confederate force forming west of his position, sent an explicit order to attack by way of his nephew. But his nephew became lost and was unable to deliver the message until 6:30 pm. Even had the message been on time, it was impossible for Porter to both move forward and attack Jackson's right flank and maintain contact with Brigadier General [[John F. Reynolds|John F. Reynolds's]] division of McDowell's corps. To attack would place the V Corps on one side of Longstreet's Corps and Reynolds on the other. Porter again ignored Pope's orders and Pope again assumed Porter was attacking and launched a costly attack on Jackson's left flank. During the attack, McDowell finally delivered Buford's report to Pope, who then had to acknowledge that Longstreet was on the battlefield. When the attack failed, Pope sent explicit orders to Porter to march his corps to the main battlefield and meet with him personally. Porter did so, but sent one of his brigades to [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]].\n\nThat night Pope convened his generals and they argued about the Confederates' intentions. Pope insisted that Longstreet had arrived only to help cover Jackson's retreat. Porter maintained that Jackson was still well-entrenched and determined to fight, but McDowell claimed to be unable to find evidence that Jackson's corps was holding position. Pope ordered another large-scale assault on Jackson the next day, with Porter's corps leading the attack.\n\nOn the morning of August 30, Porter organized his corps for the assault, but it took them two hours to organize and begin advancing. Some of Porter's men had to cross 600 yards of open pasture land, the final 150 yards of which were steeply uphill, to attack a strong position behind the unfinished railroad; others had only 300 yards to traverse, but were required to perform a complex right wheel maneuver under fire to hit the Confederate position squarely in its front. They experienced devastating fire from Confederate batteries and then withering volleys from the infantrymen in the line. Nevertheless, they were able to break the Confederate line, but Confederate reinforcements drove them back. In what was arguably the most famous incident of the battle, some Confederate brigades fired so much that they ran out of ammunition and resorted to throwing large rocks. To support Jackson's exhausted defense, Longstreet's artillery added to the barrage against Union reinforcements attempting to move in, cutting them to pieces.<ref>Hennessy, pp. 339\u201357</ref>\n\nAs the V Corps fell back, Longstreet launched a counterattack, sweeping Pope's whole army back and threatening to rout it. A difficult defense of Henry Hill by some of Sykes' division was all that enabled the Union to stabilize the situation and retreat from Manassas in an orderly fashion.\n\n==Court-martial==\nAfter the battle, Pope was relieved of command and his corps were merged into McClellan's Army of the Potomac. Pope was sent to [[Minnesota]] to command U.S. forces in the [[Dakota War of 1862]], but kept up a correspondence with his allies in Washington. McClellan, meanwhile, led his army to a victory over the Army of Northern Virginia at the [[Battle of Antietam]], but failed to rout them, in part because he was too nervous to commit Porter's V Corps to battle after the general is said to have warned him, \"Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic.\" In the weeks following the battle, McClellan failed to take any decisive action and Lee's army slipped back into Virginia to regroup and fight again. On November 5, McClellan was ordered to hand over his command to Burnside. Two and a half weeks later, on November 25, without the protection of his friend as commander of the army, Porter was arrested and relieved of command.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1862/11/14/90516867.pdf Farewell Order from Gen. Porter],\" ''New York Times'', Nov 13, 1862. Fitz John Porter's farewell order to the V Corps</ref>\n\n===Charges===\nPorter was charged with two violations of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|Articles of War]] for his actions during the Second Battle of Bull Run, Article IX, disobeying a lawful order, and Article LII, misbehavior in front of the enemy. Both charges contained specifications, examples when Porter allegedly committed the offense. The two charges were serious and a conviction could result in anything from expulsion from the army to execution. Due to the rules of courts-martial, charges were filed not by Pope himself, but by Brigadier General [[Benjamin S. Roberts|B.S. Roberts]], the [[Inspector-General]] of the Army of Virginia.<ref name=\"civilwarhome.com\"/>\n\n====First Charge: Disobeying a Lawful Order====\n* Specification 1: disobeying Pope's order on the night of August 27 to move to Bristoe Station at 1:00 am\n* Specification 2: disobeying Pope's order on the morning of August 29 to move the V Corps towards Gainesville\n* Specification 3: disobeying Pope's order on the afternoon of August 29 to attack Jackson's right flank\n* Specification 4: disobeying Pope's further order on the evening of August 29 to commence an attack on Jackson's right flank immediately\n* Specification 5: sending one brigade to Centreville on the night of August 29, in disobedience of Pope's orders to bring his entire corps to the battlefield\n\n====Second Charge: Misbehavior in Front of the Enemy====\n* Specification 1: not engaging, nor making any effort to engage, Jackson's right flank as ordered on the afternoon of August 29, but instead falling back\n* Specification 2: falling back on August 29, while in earshot of the battle and knowing his corps was needed, without even attempting to ascertain the strength of the enemy\n* Specification 3: falling back on August 29, while aware that Pope's attacks were failing, and thereby aiding in the defeat of a Union army and placing in jeopardy the capital city\n* Specification 4: moving slowly to attack on August 30, and, when the attack had commenced, not making a full effort and not attempting to rally his troops or otherwise inspire them to break through the enemy line\n\nIn the first charge, Pope \u2013 through his inspector general \u2013 was trying to prove that Porter's failure to follow his orders resulted in the situation which gave the Confederates the upper hand on the battlefield. Of particular importance to Pope was the assertion that if Porter had moved at 1:00 am as ordered, Longstreet would have been unable to take up the close position on Jackson's right flank and then the Confederates behind the unfinished railroad grade might have been dislodged. This also helped draw attention away from Pope's failure to acknowledge the reality of Longstreet's corps arrival to the battlefield, though the general would continue to deny that the second Confederate corps had arrived until the evening of August 29.\n\nIn the second, Pope accused Porter of cowardice at best, open treason at worst. Porter pleaded \"not guilty\" to all charges.\n\n===Court===\n[[File:The court martial of Major General Fitz-John Porter.jpg|thumb|250px|The court-martial of Fitz John Porter sketched by [[Alfred Waud]]]]\nThe trial was prosecuted by the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|United States Army Judge Advocate General]] Colonel [[Joseph Holt]].

Slough]], the military governor of the City of Alexandria\n\nFor his defense, Porter chose [[Reverdy Johnson]], former [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] for [[Zachary Taylor]]. Johnson was a contentious figure in the north. He was a staunchly conservative Democrat who had supported [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] against Lincoln and who had argued on behalf of the slave-owning defendant in the infamous [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' case]]. But Johnson was known to be personally opposed to slavery and had been instrumental in ensuring [[Maryland]] remained in the Union.\n\n===Trial===\nHunter determined that the trial should be open to the public and the newspapers and daily magazines all rushed to get reporters and artists to Washington. In the wake of the tumultuous [[United States House elections, 1862|election loss]] for Republicans, most of the country viewed the trial through partisan, political eyes. Newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', dutifully recorded and printed the testimony, often accentuating the most outrageous aspects of it. It was not a difficult task. The prosecution found ready testimony from other officers of Pope's army that sought to clear their own names after the disaster of Manassas. McDowell, in the midst of answering to his own court of inquiry regarding actions during the battle that had led to his virtual banishment from the army, was an eager cooperator in pinning much of the blame for the loss on Porter. Even more damaging than the testimony of prominent Republican generals was that the only maps used during the trial were supplied by Pope and substantiated his version of the time-line for the positioning of Longstreet's corps.\n\nThe defense argued that Pope was incompetent, and that Porter's actions had saved the army from an even greater defeat. Sykes and Morell testified on behalf of their former commander that movement on the night of August 27 was not only impractical, but reckless. Even Burnside took a leave from his command to testify on behalf of Porter in reference to the telegrams criticizing Pope he had received, though the newest commander of the Army of the Potomac had a specific interest in drawing attention away from his own recent loss at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. Other prominent friends of Porter, including McClellan, who was now openly decrying Lincoln and making plans to enter into Democratic Party politics, testified that the vast majority of the army agreed with Porter's assessments of Pope's poor leadership expressed in the telegrams.\n\n{{Quote box\n|align = right\n|width = 35%\n|quote = Traitor to my country!

Fitz John Porter's defense.</ref>\n}}\n\nUltimately, both sides turned the case into one of character. For the prosecution, Porter was an arrogant disciple of an arrogant commander (McClellan), who was more interested in his own career than in the good of his country. Much was made of his previous relationship with Lee at West Point and of his role as McClellan's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, just as McClellan had been the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of then-Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]]. Porter had had more affection for these connections and so let his contempt for Pope override obedience to his superior and handed victory to the Confederates.\n\nTo the defense, Porter was an American hero that had been wronged by a petty, incompetent former commander who happened to be friends with the President. His record of service before the war, and especially his successes during the Peninsula Campaign, were cited as evidence for his loyalty.\n\nThe Court held their vote in secret, but word of it leaked out to the press. Porter first heard the results when a ''New York Times'' correspondent asked him for a comment. He was found guilty of both charges, though not guilty of the fourth and fifth specifications of the first charge, and the implication that he had retreated in the first specification of the second charge was stricken.<ref>http://www.civilwarhome.com/Porter-fin.htm findings of the court</ref> On January 21, the court ordered Fitz John Porter cashiered, or dismissed from the army for disciplinary reasons, and \"forever disqualified from holding any office of trust or profit under the Government of the United States.\"<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/01/22/80270703.pdf Important From Washington],\" ''New York Times'', Jan 21, 1863. Announcement of Porter's sentence.</ref>\n\n==Porter attempts to clear his name==\nThe conviction, rather than ending the controversy, served only to extend it. Coupled with the disastrous loss at Fredericksburg, the near mutiny of Burnside's officers after the [[Mud March (American Civil War)|Mud March]], and the resurgence of the Democratic Party, which was increasingly calling for negotiated settlement, the trial severely unsettled the public perception of competence in the army and administration. ''The New York Times'' even went so far as to question the loyalty-inspiring capabilities of West Point as an institute, though it took the conviction as proof that the vast majority of West Pointers were loyal, unlike Porter.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/01/23/80270907.pdf Loyalty of West Point Graduates]\", ''New York Times'', Jan 23, 1863.</ref>\n\nPorter immediately set about attempting to overturn the conviction. He began by extensively surveying and mapping the battleground to develop a comprehensive map of every tree, bush, and hill in the vicinity of his corps. Then he meticulously transcribed testimony of anyone he could get to cooperate in order to record exact positions during the battle. With the help of his friends, especially the increasingly powerful McClellan, he began petitioning famous figures to write letters on his behalf. They also used their influence to try to get state and local lawmakers to pass resolutions condemning the U.S. government for dismissing Porter.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/03/03/90516090.pdf The Fitz-John Porter Resolutions: Mayor Opdyke vetoes them],\" ''New York Times'', March 3, 1863.</ref>\n\nHe also tried to draw attention to the make-up of the court and argued that a Republican administration had fixed a court to rule against him in order to protect its own interests. Not long after he had testified as an administration witness against Porter, McDowell's court of inquiry exonerated him of wrongdoing at the Second Battle of Bull Run and recommended he be returned to command. Several of the other officers on the court received promotions shortly after the trial.\n\nBut Porter's actions were met with furious counter-actions. Stanton repeatedly blocked any attempt by the government to re-investigate the matter and saw to it that officers who spoke out in support of Porter were punished. In the Republican press especially, Porter was savaged as a traitor who had escaped the punishment he had deserved. ''The New York Times'' opined that not only was Porter's crusade to overturn his conviction immoral in that it encouraged dissent in the ranks, but that the general himself ought to have been executed.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/01/28/80271794.pdf Disobedient and Unwilling Generals],\" ''New York Times'', Jan 28, 1863.</ref>\n\nWhen the war ended, Porter wrote to both Lee and Longstreet asking for their assistance in the matter and also petitioned to be allowed access to captured papers of the Confederacy. Both Lee and Longstreet replied, Longstreet in great detail, and Porter used the evidence to garner supporters to send petitions to President [[Andrew Johnson]] asking for a new trial.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/09/13/79343963.pdf Fitz John Porter: His appeal to the President for a new trial],\" ''New York Times'', Sept. 13, 1867.</ref> Resolutions demanding his case be reopened and equally fierce denunciations of those resolution had swirled on the local and national level, barely slowed since January 1863,<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1870/02/22/80200157.pdf Forty-First Congress, Second Session],\" ''New York Times'', Feb 22, 1870.</ref> but Porter supporters \u2013 now including such famous generals as [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], and [[George H. Thomas]], which contributed greatly to their rapid decline in popularity with their own party \u2013 were finally gaining enough headway to reexamine the issue.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1870/04/05/80251707.pdf Fitz John Porter],\" ''New York Times'', April 5, 1870.</ref>\n\nHowever, the President had no power to hold a new trial and, despite his support for Porter, during Grant's term he was unwilling to revisit the decision in any fashion, perhaps to appease Republican supporters. Finally, in 1878, President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] commissioned a board under Major General [[John Schofield]], who had briefly replaced Stanton as Secretary of War after Johnson [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|forced him out]], to investigate.\n\n==Schofield Commission==\nSchofield was joined by Brigadier General [[Alfred Terry]], in between stints commanding U.S. forces in the [[Dakota Territory]], and [[Colonel]] (since wartime [[Brevet (military)|brevets]] had reverted to regular army ranks) [[George W. Getty]], who had been part of Burnside's corps that had not made it in time to the battlefield near Manassas in August 1862. They reviewed the extensive evidence compiled by Porter during the intervening years and conducted interviews of their own with principals from both sides of the fighting on the day of the battle.\n\nOn March 19, 1879, the commission issued a report to President Hayes recommending that \"justice requires at [the President's] hands such action as may be necessary to annul and set aside the findings and sentence of the court-martial in the case of Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter, and to restore him to the positions of which that sentence deprived him \u2013 such restoration to take effect from the date of his dismissal from the service.\" The report found Porter guilty of no wrongdoing during the course of action on August 29, 1862, and, in fact, credited him with saving the Union Army from an even greater defeat, declaring:\n\n<blockquote> What General Porter actually did do, although his situation was by no means free from embarrassment and anxiety at the time, now seems to have been only the simple, necessary action which an intelligent soldier had no choice but to take. It is not possible that any court-martial could have condemned such conduct if it had been correctly understood. On the contrary, that conduct was obedient, subordinate, faithful, and judicious. It saved the Union army from disaster on the 29th of August.<ref>[http://www.civilwarhome.com/porterinquiry.htm Text of the Schofield Commission's report]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough the report \u2013 a detailed narrative of the entire events of the battle from a third-person perspective of Porter \u2013 focused on absolving Porter of guilt for disobedience to orders or misbehavior in the face of the enemy, it also attributed much of the confusion of the situation and overall loss of the battle to Pope and McDowell. Pope is repeatedly described as out of touch with the situation and unaware of troop positions as he issued orders. Accordingly, Porter had to decide mid-battle whether to be \"true\" to a very confused commander. Two credible witnesses testified that, during the time of his original court martial, Porter said privately that he had not been \"true to Pope.\" <ref>Soini, Wayne, ''Porter's Secret'', Peter E. Randall Publisher, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9828236-8-2}}, pp. 73\u201374.</ref> The commission rested its decision on other evidence. Focusing specifically on the 4:30 order to attack Jackson's right flank, the commission determined that not only had Pope's nephew arrived much later than he had claimed in the court-martial, rendering the order obsolete, but that if he had arrived promptly Porter would still not have been able to carry out an attack as \"such an attack, under such circumstances, would have been not only a great blunder, but, on the part of an intelligent officer, it would have been a great crime.\"\n\nThe harshest criticism was saved for McDowell, who was repeatedly described as indecisive, uncommunicative, and inept. Under the Articles of War, McDowell should have taken command of both his and Porter's corps, as the senior officer, either on his own initiative when determining Longstreet's arrival or upon the arrival of the \"Joint Order.\" Instead, he hesitated, deferred, and then ultimately split the command, leaving Porter with 9,000 men to face Longstreet's corps of at least 20,000. The report stated that McDowell at best drastically misunderstood the situation and his own responsibilities when testifying, at worst perjured himself. After the issuance of the report, McDowell's reputation suffered greatly.\n\nWhile lauding his actions, Schofield and his fellow justices found fault with Porter's behavior before the battle. They attributed some of the negative feelings he had expressed to the confusion of command from Washington, since it was unclear if Pope's army was intended to unite to McClellan's, McClellan's to Pope's, or both together, with Halleck himself arriving to take command. The report declared that the telegrams to Burnside and other negative statements by Porter were beyond the scope of the investigation and only tangential to the events of the battle, but \"that the indiscreet and unkind terms in which General Porter expressed his distrust of the capacity of his superior commander cannot be defended. And to that indiscretion was due, in very great measure, the misinterpretation of both his motives and his conduct and his consequent condemnation.\"\n\nDespite the commission's findings, political opposition still prevented Porter from obtaining reinstatement. Hayes, a Republican, did not have the political support to overcome his own party's opposition to a pardon. Porter was still seen by the [[Radical Republicans]] as a traitor and his success in obtaining national figures to speak on his behalf was seen as connected to a dangerous resurgence of the Democrats in national politics.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/06/02/102779341.pdf Fitz John Porter's hair-splitting lawyers...]\" ''New York Times'', June 2, 1882.</ref> And when Hayes left office, he was succeeded by James A. Garfield, who had voted to convict Porter as part of the court. When, on May 6, 1882, President [[Chester A. Arthur]] \u2013 who succeeded Garfield after his assassination \u2013 commuted Porter's sentence by restoring his rights to hold public office, it was seen by ''The New York Times'' as a collapse to pressure from powerful interests, and special note was made that the President had not agreed or disagreed with the Schofield Commission in his order.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/05/07/112631621.pdf Fitz John Porter's Relief],\" ''New York Times'' May 7, 1882.</ref>\n\nMuch partisan wrangling erupted in both houses of Congress. The Radical Republicans were organized primarily by Senator [[John A. Logan]],<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/06/01/102779025.pdf Fitz John Porter's Crime],\" ''New York Times'', June 1, 1882.</ref> one of Grant's top generals during the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg campaign]], and focused on the illegality of the Schofield Commission and the perceived traitorous nature of Porter. Despite their vocal and fierce counterattack and after a veto of a bill to restore Porter to the army by President Arthur in 1884, a bill passed the Congress and was signed by President Cleveland in 1886 to restore Porter to his regular army rank of colonel, but with no compensation for back pay missed. Two days later, vindicated, Porter retired from the army.\n\n==Statue==\n[[File:Statue of General Fitzjohn Porter, Portsmouth, N.H.jpg|thumb|Statue of Fitz John Porter, Portsmouth, N.H.]]\nOnce on his death bed, General Porter began working with sculptor James E. Kelly to create a monument that reflected how he viewed his legacy. The statue stands today, at Haven Park in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It is graced by metal tablets at the base, which attempt to convey the error of Porter's court-martial.<ref>{{cite book|last=Soini}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\nThough the obsessive, partisan animosity that gripped much of the country during the trial and subsequent attempts to overturn the verdict have been almost entirely forgotten, the effect of the meticulous casework undertaken by Porter and his allies can be seen at [[Manassas National Battlefield Park]], the site of the Second Battle of Bull Run. When construction of the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]], an annex to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]], disturbed wetlands on the site, the Smithsonian and its funders paid to restore portions of the Battlefield Park that had been disrupted by construction during the 1980s by [[John T. \"Til\" Hazel]] to their 1862 conditions. Using Porter's extremely detailed maps, they were able to restore the grounds to within one inch of their previous form and replant to create the most historically accurate battlefield in the park system.<ref>Weiss, Eric, \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/491011011.html?dids=491011011:491011011&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Dec+14%2C+2003&author=Eric+M.+Weiss&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=A.12&desc=Project+Links+Battlefield%2C+Museum%3B+Civil+War-Era+Effort+Helped+Map+Future+For+Aviation+Center Project Links Battlefield, Museum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008194253/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/491011011.html?dids=491011011:491011011&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Dec+14,+2003&author=Eric+M.+Weiss&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=A.12&desc=Project+Links+Battlefield,+Museum%3B+Civil+War-Era+Effort+Helped+Map+Future+For+Aviation+Center |date=2012-10-08 }},\" ''Washington Post'', Dec 14, 2003.</ref>\n\nPorter's papers are available through the Library of Congress.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/mss/text/porter_fj.html Fitz John Porter Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329015836/http://www.loc.gov/rr/mss/text/porter_fj.html |date=March 29, 2008 }}.

[[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Fitz John Porter]] was found guilty of disobeying a lawful order, and misconduct in front of the enemy and removed from command based on internal political machinations of the [[Union Army]]. The [[court-martial]] was later found to be unjust and overturned, and Porter was reinstated in the [[United States Army]].\n\n==Background==\nPorter was a career army officer from a family of famous naval officers, including his cousin, [[David Farragut]], the first [[Admiral (United States)|United States admiral]]. He graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in 1845, eighth in his class, and served with great distinction as an artillery officer in the Mexican War.<ref>Anders, 1\u20132.</ref> After the war, Porter served in various posts, including a stint as an instructor of artillery at West Point, where he became good friends with both [[George B. McClellan]] and [[William B. Franklin]] and, eventually, post adjutant for [[Robert E. Lee]].\n\nAs tensions increased in 1860, Porter traveled to threatened locations in the South in order to prepare for the upcoming conflict, including Charleston, South Carolina, where he advised [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Robert Anderson (major)|Robert Anderson]] be placed in charge of the defenses and that they be consolidated at [[Fort Sumter]].<ref>Anders, 2.</ref> When war broke out, he initially served on the staff of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Patterson]], but when his old friend McClellan was asked to take charge of the [[Army of the Potomac]] he was transferred to command a division at the new commander's explicit request.\n\nWhen McClellan took the Army of the Potomac south for the [[Peninsula Campaign]], he reorganized the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II]], [[III Corps (Union Army)|III]], and [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV]] Corps to create two new provisional units, the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] under Porter, and the [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] under Franklin. McClellan trusted his old friends much more than the other corps commanders and wanted subordinates he considered loyal.<ref>Snell, Mark A (2002).''From First to Last: The Life of Major General William B. Franklin''. Fordham University Press. 131.</ref> He relied, in particular, on Porter, who often acted as his surrogate on the battlefield during McClellan's frequent absences. One such instance, the [[Battle of Malvern Hill]], especially cemented Porter's reputation as a superb commander on the battlefield.\n\n==Porter's command at the Second Battle of Bull Run==\n{{main|Second Battle of Bull Run}}\n\nAfter the failure of McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, Porter's corps was one of the corps reassigned to the [[Army of Virginia]] under Major General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]. Porter shared his commander and friend's dislike for Pope both personally and professionally. As he moved his corps into position at Aquia Creek near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], Porter sent a number of telegrams to Major General [[Ambrose Burnside]] complaining about Pope's poor leadership and handling of the army.<ref>Anders, 195\u201399.</ref> Burnside, who, along with many others, shared Porter's low opinion of Pope's abilities, forwarded these communications to McClellan, [[General-in-Chief]] [[Henry Halleck]], [[Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]], and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Halleck, Stanton, and Lincoln were not pleased, since Pope had been their choice to lead in an attempt to sideline the uncooperative McClellan. The President was especially displeased, since Pope was a personal friend.\n\n{{Quote box\n|align = right\n|width = 35%\n|quote = The major-general commanding directs that you start at 1 o'clock to-night, and come forward with your whole corps...Hooker has had very severe action with the enemy...[and the enemy has] been driven back, but is retiring along the railroad.

Pope believed the main Confederate army to be somewhere south of his force and so became panicked and sent a flurry of orders. In a repetitive and unorganized telegram sent to Porter, Pope ordered him to join him at [[Bristow, Virginia|Bristoe Station]] by morning with his corps, or as much of his corps as he could gather by 1:00 in the morning. He was also to send word to another Union corps commander, Major General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], to secure [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton Junction]].\n\nPorter consulted with his divisional commanders, Major General [[George W. Morell]] and [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[George Sykes]], about the feasibility of marching that evening. Both generals were against the movement, they would later testify, but Porter wanted to go forward. Morrell and Sykes were finally able to convince Porter that the way was too dark and they were too unsure of the location of the Confederate forces in order to move in the dark and the order to move at 1:00 am was disregarded and instead the V Corps moved to Bristoe Station the morning of August 28. By 5:30 that evening{{spaced ndash}}when Jackson's men first engaged a division from the corps of Major General [[Irvin McDowell]]{{spaced ndash}}Porter had moved his men to [[Greenwich, Virginia|Greenwich]], making him the most westerly located corps commander in the Army of Virginia.<ref>Esposito, Map 60.</ref>\n\nDuring the next morning, August 29, Pope's attention was occupied along the unfinished railroad grade that Jackson was using as defense while the Union army assaulted in wave after wave. Meanwhile, Porter, now joined with parts of McDowell's [[I Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] and the general himself, repulsed an exploratory attack by the Confederate cavalry division under Major General [[J.E.B. Stuart]]. Porter and McDowell had no sooner halted their advance when they received an order from Pope, now known as the \"Joint Order.\" Historian John J. Hennessy described the order as a \"masterpiece of contradiction and obfuscation that would become the focal point of decades of wrangling.\" It described the attacks on Jackson's left, which were already underway, but was unclear about what Porter and McDowell were supposed to do. Rather than moving \"to\" Gainesville and striking Jackson's supposedly unprotected right flank, it described a move \"toward\" Gainesville and \"as soon as communication is established [with the other divisions] the whole command shall halt. It may be necessary to fall back behind Bull Run to Centreville tonight.\" Nowhere in the order did Pope explicitly direct Porter and McDowell to attack and he concluded the order with \"If any considerable advantages are to be gained from departing from this order it will not be strictly carried out,\" rendering the document virtually useless as a military order.<ref>Hennessy, John J., ''Return to Bull Run: The Campaign and Battle of Second Manassas'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8061-3187-X}}, pp. 232\u201336.</ref>\n\nPope launched another assault on Jackson, believing that Porter and McDowell would be attacking Jackson's right-flank at any moment. But Brigadier General [[John Buford]] had arrived from [[Battle of Thoroughfare Gap|Thoroughfare Gap]] to report that Major General [[James Longstreet|James Longstreet's]] wing of the Army of Northern Virginia had broken out of the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and was on its way to the battlefield. In fact, by noon, the first units of Longstreet's corps were already taking up positions guarding Jackson's right. McDowell, the senior commander, decided to not move the two corps to Gainesville and attack, but, for unknown reasons, did not forward Buford's report to Pope.\n\n{{Quote box\n|align = left\n|width = 35%\n|quote = Your line of march brings you in on the enemy's right flank.

[[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], August 29, 4:30pm<ref name=\"civilwarhome.com\">[http://www.civilwarhome.com/prtrchgs.htm Fitz John Porter's Charges and Specifications<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\n}}\n\nAt 4:30 pm, Pope, frustrated that no attack was occurring on Jackson's right flank and still unaware of Longstreet's presence, despite numerous reports of a large Confederate force forming west of his position, sent an explicit order to attack by way of his nephew. But his nephew became lost and was unable to deliver the message until 6:30 pm. Even had the message been on time, it was impossible for Porter to both move forward and attack Jackson's right flank and maintain contact with Brigadier General [[John F. Reynolds|John F. Reynolds's]] division of McDowell's corps. To attack would place the V Corps on one side of Longstreet's Corps and Reynolds on the other. Porter again ignored Pope's orders and Pope again assumed Porter was attacking and launched a costly attack on Jackson's left flank. During the attack, McDowell finally delivered Buford's report to Pope, who then had to acknowledge that Longstreet was on the battlefield. When the attack failed, Pope sent explicit orders to Porter to march his corps to the main battlefield and meet with him personally. Porter did so, but sent one of his brigades to [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]].\n\nThat night Pope convened his generals and they argued about the Confederates' intentions. Pope insisted that Longstreet had arrived only to help cover Jackson's retreat. Porter maintained that Jackson was still well-entrenched and determined to fight, but McDowell claimed to be unable to find evidence that Jackson's corps was holding position. Pope ordered another large-scale assault on Jackson the next day, with Porter's corps leading the attack.\n\nOn the morning of August 30, Porter organized his corps for the assault, but it took them two hours to organize and begin advancing. Some of Porter's men had to cross 600 yards of open pasture land, the final 150 yards of which were steeply uphill, to attack a strong position behind the unfinished railroad; others had only 300 yards to traverse, but were required to perform a complex right wheel maneuver under fire to hit the Confederate position squarely in its front. They experienced devastating fire from Confederate batteries and then withering volleys from the infantrymen in the line. Nevertheless, they were able to break the Confederate line, but Confederate reinforcements drove them back. In what was arguably the most famous incident of the battle, some Confederate brigades fired so much that they ran out of ammunition and resorted to throwing large rocks. To support Jackson's exhausted defense, Longstreet's artillery added to the barrage against Union reinforcements attempting to move in, cutting them to pieces.<ref>Hennessy, pp. 339\u201357</ref>\n\nAs the V Corps fell back, Longstreet launched a counterattack, sweeping Pope's whole army back and threatening to rout it. A difficult defense of Henry Hill by some of Sykes' division was all that enabled the Union to stabilize the situation and retreat from Manassas in an orderly fashion.\n\n==Court-martial==\nAfter the battle, Pope was relieved of command and his corps were merged into McClellan's Army of the Potomac. Pope was sent to [[Minnesota]] to command U.S. forces in the [[Dakota War of 1862]], but kept up a correspondence with his allies in Washington. McClellan, meanwhile, led his army to a victory over the Army of Northern Virginia at the [[Battle of Antietam]], but failed to rout them, in part because he was too nervous to commit Porter's V Corps to battle after the general is said to have warned him, \"Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic.\" In the weeks following the battle, McClellan failed to take any decisive action and Lee's army slipped back into Virginia to regroup and fight again. On November 5, McClellan was ordered to hand over his command to Burnside. Two and a half weeks later, on November 25, without the protection of his friend as commander of the army, Porter was arrested and relieved of command.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1862/11/14/90516867.pdf Farewell Order from Gen. Porter],\" ''New York Times'', Nov 13, 1862. Fitz John Porter's farewell order to the V Corps</ref>\n\n===Charges===\nPorter was charged with two violations of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|Articles of War]] for his actions during the Second Battle of Bull Run, Article IX, disobeying a lawful order, and Article LII, misbehavior in front of the enemy. Both charges contained specifications, examples when Porter allegedly committed the offense. The two charges were serious and a conviction could result in anything from expulsion from the army to execution. Due to the rules of courts-martial, charges were filed not by Pope himself, but by Brigadier General [[Benjamin S. Roberts|B.S. Roberts]], the [[Inspector-General]] of the Army of Virginia.<ref name=\"civilwarhome.com\"/>\n\n====First Charge: Disobeying a Lawful Order====\n* Specification 1: disobeying Pope's order on the night of August 27 to move to Bristoe Station at 1:00 am\n* Specification 2: disobeying Pope's order on the morning of August 29 to move the V Corps towards Gainesville\n* Specification 3: disobeying Pope's order on the afternoon of August 29 to attack Jackson's right flank\n* Specification 4: disobeying Pope's further order on the evening of August 29 to commence an attack on Jackson's right flank immediately\n* Specification 5: sending one brigade to Centreville on the night of August 29, in disobedience of Pope's orders to bring his entire corps to the battlefield\n\n====Second Charge: Misbehavior in Front of the Enemy====\n* Specification 1: not engaging, nor making any effort to engage, Jackson's right flank as ordered on the afternoon of August 29, but instead falling back\n* Specification 2: falling back on August 29, while in earshot of the battle and knowing his corps was needed, without even attempting to ascertain the strength of the enemy\n* Specification 3: falling back on August 29, while aware that Pope's attacks were failing, and thereby aiding in the defeat of a Union army and placing in jeopardy the capital city\n* Specification 4: moving slowly to attack on August 30, and, when the attack had commenced, not making a full effort and not attempting to rally his troops or otherwise inspire them to break through the enemy line\n\nIn the first charge, Pope \u2013 through his inspector general \u2013 was trying to prove that Porter's failure to follow his orders resulted in the situation which gave the Confederates the upper hand on the battlefield. Of particular importance to Pope was the assertion that if Porter had moved at 1:00 am as ordered, Longstreet would have been unable to take up the close position on Jackson's right flank and then the Confederates behind the unfinished railroad grade might have been dislodged. This also helped draw attention away from Pope's failure to acknowledge the reality of Longstreet's corps arrival to the battlefield, though the general would continue to deny that the second Confederate corps had arrived until the evening of August 29.\n\nIn the second, Pope accused Porter of cowardice at best, open treason at worst. Porter pleaded \"not guilty\" to all charges.\n\n===Court===\n[[File:The court martial of Major General Fitz-John Porter.jpg|thumb|250px|The court-martial of Fitz John Porter sketched by [[Alfred Waud]]]]\nThe trial was prosecuted by the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|United States Army Judge Advocate General]] Colonel [[Joseph Holt]].

Slough]], the military governor of the City of Alexandria\n\nFor his defense, Porter chose [[Reverdy Johnson]], former [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] for [[Zachary Taylor]]. Johnson was a contentious figure in the north. He was a staunchly conservative Democrat who had supported [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] against Lincoln and who had argued on behalf of the slave-owning defendant in the infamous [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' case]]. But Johnson was known to be personally opposed to slavery and had been instrumental in ensuring [[Maryland]] remained in the Union.\n\n===Trial===\nHunter determined that the trial should be open to the public and the newspapers and daily magazines all rushed to get reporters and artists to Washington. In the wake of the tumultuous [[United States House elections, 1862|election loss]] for Republicans, most of the country viewed the trial through partisan, political eyes. Newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', dutifully recorded and printed the testimony, often accentuating the most outrageous aspects of it. It was not a difficult task. The prosecution found ready testimony from other officers of Pope's army that sought to clear their own names after the disaster of Manassas. McDowell, in the midst of answering to his own court of inquiry regarding actions during the battle that had led to his virtual banishment from the army, was an eager cooperator in pinning much of the blame for the loss on Porter. Even more damaging than the testimony of prominent Republican generals was that the only maps used during the trial were supplied by Pope and substantiated his version of the time-line for the positioning of Longstreet's corps.\n\nThe defense argued that Pope was incompetent, and that Porter's actions had saved the army from an even greater defeat. Sykes and Morell testified on behalf of their former commander that movement on the night of August 27 was not only impractical, but reckless. Even Burnside took a leave from his command to testify on behalf of Porter in reference to the telegrams criticizing Pope he had received, though the newest commander of the Army of the Potomac had a specific interest in drawing attention away from his own recent loss at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. Other prominent friends of Porter, including McClellan, who was now openly decrying Lincoln and making plans to enter into Democratic Party politics, testified that the vast majority of the army agreed with Porter's assessments of Pope's poor leadership expressed in the telegrams.\n\n{{Quote box\n|align = right\n|width = 35%\n|quote = Traitor to my country!

Fitz John Porter's defense.</ref>\n}}\n\nUltimately, both sides turned the case into one of character. For the prosecution, Porter was an arrogant disciple of an arrogant commander (McClellan), who was more interested in his own career than in the good of his country. Much was made of his previous relationship with Lee at West Point and of his role as McClellan's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, just as McClellan had been the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of then-Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]]. Porter had had more affection for these connections and so let his contempt for Pope override obedience to his superior and handed victory to the Confederates.\n\nTo the defense, Porter was an American hero that had been wronged by a petty, incompetent former commander who happened to be friends with the President. His record of service before the war, and especially his successes during the Peninsula Campaign, were cited as evidence for his loyalty.\n\nThe Court held their vote in secret, but word of it leaked out to the press. Porter first heard the results when a ''New York Times'' correspondent asked him for a comment. He was found guilty of both charges, though not guilty of the fourth and fifth specifications of the first charge, and the implication that he had retreated in the first specification of the second charge was stricken.<ref>http://www.civilwarhome.com/Porter-fin.htm findings of the court</ref> On January 21, the court ordered Fitz John Porter cashiered, or dismissed from the army for disciplinary reasons, and \"forever disqualified from holding any office of trust or profit under the Government of the United States.\"<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/01/22/80270703.pdf Important From Washington],\" ''New York Times'', Jan 21, 1863. Announcement of Porter's sentence.</ref>\n\n==Porter attempts to clear his name==\nThe conviction, rather than ending the controversy, served only to extend it. Coupled with the disastrous loss at Fredericksburg, the near mutiny of Burnside's officers after the [[Mud March (American Civil War)|Mud March]], and the resurgence of the Democratic Party, which was increasingly calling for negotiated settlement, the trial severely unsettled the public perception of competence in the army and administration. ''The New York Times'' even went so far as to question the loyalty-inspiring capabilities of West Point as an institute, though it took the conviction as proof that the vast majority of West Pointers were loyal, unlike Porter.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/01/23/80270907.pdf Loyalty of West Point Graduates]\", ''New York Times'', Jan 23, 1863.</ref>\n\nPorter immediately set about attempting to overturn the conviction. He began by extensively surveying and mapping the battleground to develop a comprehensive map of every tree, bush, and hill in the vicinity of his corps. Then he meticulously transcribed testimony of anyone he could get to cooperate in order to record exact positions during the battle. With the help of his friends, especially the increasingly powerful McClellan, he began petitioning famous figures to write letters on his behalf. They also used their influence to try to get state and local lawmakers to pass resolutions condemning the U.S. government for dismissing Porter.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/03/03/90516090.pdf The Fitz-John Porter Resolutions: Mayor Opdyke vetoes them],\" ''New York Times'', March 3, 1863.</ref>\n\nHe also tried to draw attention to the make-up of the court and argued that a Republican administration had fixed a court to rule against him in order to protect its own interests. Not long after he had testified as an administration witness against Porter, McDowell's court of inquiry exonerated him of wrongdoing at the Second Battle of Bull Run and recommended he be returned to command. Several of the other officers on the court received promotions shortly after the trial.\n\nBut Porter's actions were met with furious counter-actions. Stanton repeatedly blocked any attempt by the government to re-investigate the matter and saw to it that officers who spoke out in support of Porter were punished. In the Republican press especially, Porter was savaged as a traitor who had escaped the punishment he had deserved. ''The New York Times'' opined that not only was Porter's crusade to overturn his conviction immoral in that it encouraged dissent in the ranks, but that the general himself ought to have been executed.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1863/01/28/80271794.pdf Disobedient and Unwilling Generals],\" ''New York Times'', Jan 28, 1863.</ref>\n\nWhen the war ended, Porter wrote to both Lee and Longstreet asking for their assistance in the matter and also petitioned to be allowed access to captured papers of the Confederacy. Both Lee and Longstreet replied, Longstreet in great detail, and Porter used the evidence to garner supporters to send petitions to President [[Andrew Johnson]] asking for a new trial.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/09/13/79343963.pdf Fitz John Porter: His appeal to the President for a new trial],\" ''New York Times'', Sept. 13, 1867.</ref> Resolutions demanding his case be reopened and equally fierce denunciations of those resolution had swirled on the local and national level, barely slowed since January 1863,<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1870/02/22/80200157.pdf Forty-First Congress, Second Session],\" ''New York Times'', Feb 22, 1870.</ref> but Porter supporters \u2013 now including such famous generals as [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], and [[George H. Thomas]], which contributed greatly to their rapid decline in popularity with their own party \u2013 were finally gaining enough headway to reexamine the issue.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1870/04/05/80251707.pdf Fitz John Porter],\" ''New York Times'', April 5, 1870.</ref>\n\nHowever, the President had no power to hold a new trial and, despite his support for Porter, during Grant's term he was unwilling to revisit the decision in any fashion, perhaps to appease Republican supporters. Finally, in 1878, President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] commissioned a board under Major General [[John Schofield]], who had briefly replaced Stanton as Secretary of War after Johnson [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|forced him out]], to investigate.\n\n==Schofield Commission==\nSchofield was joined by Brigadier General [[Alfred Terry]], in between stints commanding U.S. forces in the [[Dakota Territory]], and [[Colonel]] (since wartime [[Brevet (military)|brevets]] had reverted to regular army ranks) [[George W. Getty]], who had been part of Burnside's corps that had not made it in time to the battlefield near Manassas in August 1862. They reviewed the extensive evidence compiled by Porter during the intervening years and conducted interviews of their own with principals from both sides of the fighting on the day of the battle.\n\nOn March 19, 1879, the commission issued a report to President Hayes recommending that \"justice requires at [the President's] hands such action as may be necessary to annul and set aside the findings and sentence of the court-martial in the case of Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter, and to restore him to the positions of which that sentence deprived him \u2013 such restoration to take effect from the date of his dismissal from the service.\" The report found Porter guilty of no wrongdoing during the course of action on August 29, 1862, and, in fact, credited him with saving the Union Army from an even greater defeat, declaring:\n\n<blockquote> What General Porter actually did do, although his situation was by no means free from embarrassment and anxiety at the time, now seems to have been only the simple, necessary action which an intelligent soldier had no choice but to take. It is not possible that any court-martial could have condemned such conduct if it had been correctly understood. On the contrary, that conduct was obedient, subordinate, faithful, and judicious. It saved the Union army from disaster on the 29th of August.<ref>[http://www.civilwarhome.com/porterinquiry.htm Text of the Schofield Commission's report]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough the report \u2013 a detailed narrative of the entire events of the battle from a third-person perspective of Porter \u2013 focused on absolving Porter of guilt for disobedience to orders or misbehavior in the face of the enemy, it also attributed much of the confusion of the situation and overall loss of the battle to Pope and McDowell. Pope is repeatedly described as out of touch with the situation and unaware of troop positions as he issued orders. Accordingly, Porter had to decide mid-battle whether to be \"true\" to a very confused commander. Two credible witnesses testified that, during the time of his original court martial, Porter said privately that he had not been \"true to Pope.\" <ref>Soini, Wayne, ''Porter's Secret'', Peter E. Randall Publisher, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9828236-8-2}}, pp. 73\u201374.</ref> The commission rested its decision on other evidence. Focusing specifically on the 4:30 order to attack Jackson's right flank, the commission determined that not only had Pope's nephew arrived much later than he had claimed in the court-martial, rendering the order obsolete, but that if he had arrived promptly Porter would still not have been able to carry out an attack as \"such an attack, under such circumstances, would have been not only a great blunder, but, on the part of an intelligent officer, it would have been a great crime.\"\n\nThe harshest criticism was saved for McDowell, who was repeatedly described as indecisive, uncommunicative, and inept. Under the Articles of War, McDowell should have taken command of both his and Porter's corps, as the senior officer, either on his own initiative when determining Longstreet's arrival or upon the arrival of the \"Joint Order.\" Instead, he hesitated, deferred, and then ultimately split the command, leaving Porter with 9,000 men to face Longstreet's corps of at least 20,000. The report stated that McDowell at best drastically misunderstood the situation and his own responsibilities when testifying, at worst perjured himself. After the issuance of the report, McDowell's reputation suffered greatly.\n\nWhile lauding his actions, Schofield and his fellow justices found fault with Porter's behavior before the battle. They attributed some of the negative feelings he had expressed to the confusion of command from Washington, since it was unclear if Pope's army was intended to unite to McClellan's, McClellan's to Pope's, or both together, with Halleck himself arriving to take command. The report declared that the telegrams to Burnside and other negative statements by Porter were beyond the scope of the investigation and only tangential to the events of the battle, but \"that the indiscreet and unkind terms in which General Porter expressed his distrust of the capacity of his superior commander cannot be defended. And to that indiscretion was due, in very great measure, the misinterpretation of both his motives and his conduct and his consequent condemnation.\"\n\nDespite the commission's findings, political opposition still prevented Porter from obtaining reinstatement. Hayes, a Republican, did not have the political support to overcome his own party's opposition to a pardon. Porter was still seen by the [[Radical Republicans]] as a traitor and his success in obtaining national figures to speak on his behalf was seen as connected to a dangerous resurgence of the Democrats in national politics.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/06/02/102779341.pdf Fitz John Porter's hair-splitting lawyers...]\" ''New York Times'', June 2, 1882.</ref> And when Hayes left office, he was succeeded by James A. Garfield, who had voted to convict Porter as part of the court. When, on May 6, 1882, President [[Chester A. Arthur]] \u2013 who succeeded Garfield after his assassination \u2013 commuted Porter's sentence by restoring his rights to hold public office, it was seen by ''The New York Times'' as a collapse to pressure from powerful interests, and special note was made that the President had not agreed or disagreed with the Schofield Commission in his order.<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/05/07/112631621.pdf Fitz John Porter's Relief],\" ''New York Times'' May 7, 1882.</ref>\n\nMuch partisan wrangling erupted in both houses of Congress. The Radical Republicans were organized primarily by Senator [[John A. Logan]],<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1882/06/01/102779025.pdf Fitz John Porter's Crime],\" ''New York Times'', June 1, 1882.</ref> one of Grant's top generals during the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg campaign]], and focused on the illegality of the Schofield Commission and the perceived traitorous nature of Porter. Despite their vocal and fierce counterattack and after a veto of a bill to restore Porter to the army by President Arthur in 1884, a bill passed the Congress and was signed by President Cleveland in 1886 to restore Porter to his regular army rank of colonel, but with no compensation for back pay missed. Two days later, vindicated, Porter retired from the army.\n\n==Statue==\n[[File:Statue of General Fitzjohn Porter, Portsmouth, N.H.jpg|thumb|Statue of Fitz John Porter, Portsmouth, N.H.]]\nOnce on his death bed, General Porter began working with sculptor James E.

It is graced by metal tablets at the base, which attempt to convey the error of Porter's court-martial.<ref>{{cite book|last=Soini}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\nThough the obsessive, partisan animosity that gripped much of the country during the trial and subsequent attempts to overturn the verdict have been almost entirely forgotten, the effect of the meticulous casework undertaken by Porter and his allies can be seen at [[Manassas National Battlefield Park]], the site of the Second Battle of Bull Run.

The United States arranged for  [[Indian Removal]] after 1830, forcibly displacing most Southeast tribes to west of the Mississippi River to what was then called Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). These actions affected the Cherokee, Creek (Muscogee), and Chickasaw, among others. After this, European-American arrived in large numbers, bringing or buying African Americans in the domestic [[slave trade]].\n\nIn antebellum Alabama, wealthy planters created large cotton [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] based in the fertile central [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] of the upland region, which depended on the labor of enslaved [[African people|Africans]]. Tens of thousands of slaves were transported to and sold in the state by [[Atlantic slave trade|slave traders]] who purchased them in the [[Upper South]]. In the mountains and foothills, poorer whites practiced [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]]. By 1860 blacks (nearly all slaves) comprised 45 percent of the state's 964,201 people.\n\nThe state's wealthy planters considered slavery essential to their economy. As one of the largest slaveholding states, Alabama was among the first six states to secede. It declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] in January 1861 and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] in February. During the ensuing [[American Civil War]] [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama had moderate levels of warfare]]. The population suffered economic losses and hardships as a result of the war. Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] freed all enslaved people in Confederate states. The Southern capitulation in 1865 ended the Confederate state government. A decade of  [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] began, a controversial time that has a range of interpretation. Its biracial government established the first public schools and welfare institutions in the state.\n\nAfter the war, planters worked to get their vast cotton plantations back into production. African Americans chose to exert some independence as free tenant farmers and sharecroppers, rather than working in labor gangs. Wherever possible, African-American women left the fields. Small farms, which produced general crops before the war, turned to cotton as a cash crop. The market for cotton was overloaded, and prices dropped 50%.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/reconstruction/section3/section3_wfarmer.html America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414181748/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/reconstruction/section3/section3_wfarmer.html |date=2012-04-14 }}, University of Houston</ref>\n\nFor a half century after the Civil War, Alabama was a poor, heavily rural state, with an economy based on cotton; most farmers were tenant, sharecroppers or laborers who did not own land.   Reconstruction ended when [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrats]], calling themselves known as \"[[Redeemers]]\"  regained control of the state legislature by both legal and extralegal means (including violence and harassment). They established political and social dominance over African Americans. In 1901, Southern Democrats passed a state Constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised most African Americans]] (who in 1900 comprised more than 45 percent of the state's population), as well as tens of thousands of [[Poor White|poor whites]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Glenn Feldman.

Also in the region were the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Cherokee]], from a different family and cultural group.

They named the region as [[Spanish Florida|La Florida]], which extended to the southeast peninsular state now bearing the name.\n\nAlthough a member of [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]'s expedition of 1528 may have entered southern Alabama, the first fully documented visit was by explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]. In 1539 he made an arduous expedition along the [[Coosa River|Coosa]], [[Alabama River|Alabama]] and [[Tombigbee River|Tombigbee]] rivers.\n\nThe English also laid claims to the region north of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. [[Charles II of England]] included the territory of modern Alabama in the [[Province of Carolina]], with land granted to certain of his favorites by the charters of 1663 and 1665. English traders from Carolina frequented the valley of the [[Alabama River]] as early as 1687 to trade for deerskins with the Native American peoples.\n\n[[File:Mobile1725.jpg|thumb|left|1725 map of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama's first permanent European settlement.]]\nThe [[French (people)|French]] also colonized the region. In 1702 they founded a settlement on the [[Mobile River]] near its mouth, constructing ''[[Old Mobile Site|Fort Louis]].''  For the next nine years this was the French seat of government of New France, or ''La Louisiane'' ([[Louisiana]]). In 1711, they abandoned Fort Louis because of repeated flooding. Settlers rebuilt a fort on higher ground known as ''[[Fort Conde]]''. This was the start of what developed as present-day [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], the first permanent European settlement in Alabama. [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] was another early French settlement on the Gulf Coast, to the west in what is now Mississippi.\n\nThe French and the English contested the region, each attempting to forge strong alliances with Indian tribes. To strengthen their position, defend their Indian allies, and draw other tribes to them, the French established the military posts of ''[[Fort Toulouse]]'', near the junction of the Coosa and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers, and ''[[Fort Tombecbe]]'' on the Tombigbee River.\n\nThe French and the English engaged in competition for Indian trade in what is now the state of Alabama between roughly the 1690s and the 1750s, at which point the [[French and Indian War]] broke out. It was the North American front of the Seven Years' War between these two nations in Europe.  Though the French claimed the territory as their own and attempted to rule it from [[Fort Toulouse]], so as to engage in trade with the Indians, English traders based out of the Carolinas infiltrated the region, also engaging in trade. The Chickasaw frequently favored the English in this contest. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nOverall, during this time the English proved to be the better traders and colonizers. They operated independently, while the French government was more directly involved in its colonies. On this note [[Edmund Burke]] would later note that English colonists in America would owe their freedom more \"to [the Crown's] carelessness than to its design\". This was a policy referred to as \"salutary neglect\". The distance between the colonies and the home countries meant they could always operated with some freedom.<ref>William Garrott Brown, Albert James Pickett, ''A History of Alabama, for Use in Schools: Based as to Its Earlier Parts on the Work of Albert J. Pickett'', University Publishing Company, 1900, p. 56</ref>{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} <!-- Surely a better source can be found than a 1900 pro-British one -->\n\nThe English Crown's grant of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to [[James Oglethorpe|Oglethorpe]] and his associates in 1732 included a portion of what is now northern Alabama. In 1739, Oglethorpe visited the [[Creek Indians]] west of the [[Chattahoochee River]] and made a [[treaty]] with them.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], which ended the [[Seven Years' War]] after France's defeat by Britain, resulted in France ceding its territories east of the Mississippi to Britain. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] came into undisputed control of the region between the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers, in terms of other European powers. Of course it had not consulted with any of the numerous indigenous peoples whom it nominally \"ruled.\" The portion of Alabama below the [[31st parallel north|31st parallel]] was considered a part of British [[West Florida]]. The British Crown defined the portion north of this line as part of the \"[[Illinois Country]]\"; the area west of the Appalachian Mountains was to be reserved for use by Native American tribes. European-American settlers were not supposed to encroach in that territory, but they soon did. In 1767, Britain expanded the province of West Florida northward to 32\u00b028'N latitude.\n\nMore than a decade later, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British informally ceded this West Florida region to Spain. By the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]], September 3, 1783, Great Britain formally ceded West Florida to Spain. By the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], signed the same day, Britain ceded to the newly established United States all of this province north of 31\u00b0N, thus laying the foundation for a long controversy.\n\n[[File:Mississippi Territory dark.gif|270px|thumb|Mississippi Territory changes 1798\u20131817.]]\nBy the [[Treaty of Madrid (1795)|Treaty of Madrid]] in 1795, Spain ceded to the United States the lands east of the Mississippi between 31\u00b0N and 32\u00b028'N. Three years later, in 1798, Congress organized this district as the [[Mississippi Territory]]. A strip of land 12 or 14 miles wide near the present northern boundary of Alabama and Mississippi was claimed by [[South Carolina]], as part of the eastern colonies' previous hopeful extensions to the west. In 1787, during constitutional negotiations, South Carolina ceded this claim to the federal government. Georgia likewise claimed all the lands between the 31st and [[35th parallel north|35th parallels]] from its present western boundary to the Mississippi River, and did not surrender its claim until 1802. Two years later, the boundaries of Mississippi Territory were extended so as to include all of the Georgia cession.\n\nIn 1812, Congress added the [[Mobile District]] of West Florida to the Mississippi Territory, claiming that it was included in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The following year, General [[James Wilkinson]] occupied the Mobile District with a military force. The Spanish did not resist. Thus the whole area of the present state of Alabama was taken under the jurisdiction of the United States. Several powerful Native American tribes still occupied most of the land, with some formal ownership recognized by treaty with the United States. Five of the major tribes became known as the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], as they had highly complex cultures and adopted some elements of European-American culture.\n\nIn 1817, the Mississippi Territory was divided. The western portion, which had attracted population more quickly, became the state of [[Mississippi]]. The eastern portion became the [[Alabama Territory]], with [[St. Stephens, Alabama|St. Stephens]] on the [[Tombigbee River]] as its temporary seat of government.\n\nConflict between the various tribes in Alabama and American settlers increased rapidly in the early 19th century because the Americans kept encroaching on Native American territories. The great [[Shawnee]] chief [[Tecumseh]] visited the region in 1811, seeking to forge an Indian alliance among these tribes to join his resistance in the Great Lakes area. With the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]], Britain encouraged Tecumseh's resistance movement, in the hope of expelling American settlers from west of the Appalachians. Several tribes were divided in opinion.\n\nThe Creek tribe fell to [[Creek war|civil war]] (1813-1814). Violence between Creeks and Americans escalated, culminating in the [[Fort Mims massacre]]. Full-scale war between the United States and the \"Red Stick\" Creeks began; they were the more traditional members of their society who resisted US encroachment. The Chickasaw, Choctaw, [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] and other Creek factions remained neutral to or allied with the United States during the war; they were highly decentralized in bands' alliances. Some warriors from among the bands served with American troops. Volunteer militias from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee marched into Alabama, fighting the Red Sticks.\n\nLater, federal troops became the main fighting force for the United States. General [[Andrew Jackson]] was the commander of the American forces during the Creek War and in the continuing effort against the British in the War of 1812. His leadership and military success during the wars made him a national hero. The [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] (August 9, 1814) ended the Creek War. By the terms of the treaty, the Creek, Red Sticks and neutrals alike, ceded about one-half of the present state of Alabama to the United States. Due to later cessions by the Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw in 1816, they retained only about one-quarter of their former territories in Alabama.\n\n==Early statehood==\nIn 1819, Alabama was admitted as the 22nd state to the Union. Its constitution provided for equal [[suffrage]] for white men, a standard it abandoned in its constitution of 1901, which reduced suffrage of poor whites and most blacks, disenfranchising tens of thousands of voters.<ref>This section is largely copied from {{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm, ed \"Alabama\"|title= The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: 11th edition|publisher=At the University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopdiabrit23chisgoog|year=1910|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopdiabrit23chisgoog/page/n482 463]}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first problems of the new state was finance. Since the amount of money in circulation was not sufficient to meet the demands of the increasing population, a system of state banks was instituted. State bonds were issued and public lands were sold to secure capital, and the notes of the banks, loaned on security, became a medium of exchange. Prospects of an income from the banks led the legislature of 1836 to abolish all taxation for state purposes. The [[Panic of 1837]] wiped out a large portion of the banks' assets, leaving the state poor. Next came revelations of grossly careless and corrupt management. In 1843 the banks were placed in liquidation. After disposing of all their available assets, the state assumed the remaining liabilities, for which it had pledged its faith and credit.<ref>{{cite book|author=Murray Rothbard|title=The Panic of 1819: Reactions and Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmH6BLCkBj4C&pg=PA81|year=1962|page=81|isbn=9781610163705}}</ref>\n\nIn 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] under the leadership of President Andrew Jackson, authorizing federal [[Indian removal|removal]] of southeastern tribes to west of the Mississippi River, including the Five Civilized Tribes of Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and [[Seminole]] (in Florida). In 1832, the national government provided for the removal of the Creek via the [[Treaty of Cusseta]]. Before the removal occurred between 1834 and 1837, the state legislature organized counties in the lands to be ceded, and European-American settlers flocked in before the Native Americans had left.<ref>{{cite book|author=John T.

Disagreements over whether a state could [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] a federal law caused a division within the Democratic party. About the same time the [[Whig party (United States)|Whig party]] emerged as an opposition party. It drew support from planters and townsmen, while the Democrats were strongest among poor farmers and Catholic communities (descendants of French and Spanish colonists) in the Mobile area. For some time, the Whigs were almost as numerous as the Democrats, but they never secured control of the state government. The States' Rights faction were in a minority; nevertheless, under their persistent leader, [[William L. Yancey]] (1814\u20131863), they prevailed upon the Democrats in 1848 to adopt their most radical views.<ref>Austin L. Venable, \"William L. Yancey's Transition from Unionism to State Rights.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 10.3 (1944): 331-342.</ref>\n\nDuring the agitation over the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would bar slavery from territory acquired from [[Mexico]] as a result of the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]] (1848), Yancey induced the [[Democratic State Convention]] of 1848 to adopt what was known as the \"[[Alabama Platform]]\". It declared that neither Congress nor the government of a territory had the right to interfere with slavery in a territory, that those who held opposite views were not Democrats, and that the Democrats of Alabama would not support a candidate for the presidency if he did not agree with them. This platform was endorsed by conventions in Florida and Virginia and by the legislatures of Georgia and Alabama.\n\nTensions related to slavery divided many state delegations in Congress, as this body tried to determine the futures of territories beyond the Mississippi River. Following the Congressional passage of the [[Compromise of 1850]], which assigned certain territories as slave or free, in Alabama people began to realign politically. The States' Rights faction, joined by many Democrats, founded the [[Southern Rights Party]], which demanded the repeal of the Compromise, advocated resistance to future encroachments, and prepared for secession. The Whigs were joined by the remaining Democrats and called themselves the \"Unionists\". The party unwillingly accepted the Compromise and denied that the Constitution provided for secession.\n\nSince the turn of the 19th century, development of large cotton plantations had taken place across the upland Black Belt after the invention of the [[cotton gin]] made short-staple cotton profitable. Cotton had added dramatically to the state's wealth. The owners' wealth depended on the labor of hundreds of thousands of enslaved African Americans, many initially transported in the domestic trade from the Upper South, which resulted in one million workers being relocated to the South. In other parts of the state, the soil supported only subsistence farming. Most of the [[yeoman]] farmers owned few or no slaves. By 1860 the investment and profits in cotton production resulted in planters holding 435,000 enslaved African Americans, who made up 45% of the state's population.\n\nAt the time of statehood, the early Alabama settlers adopted universal white suffrage. They were noted for a spirit of frontier democracy and egalitarianism, but this declined after the slave society developed.<ref>Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick, \"A Meaning for Turner's Frontier: Part II: The Southwest Frontier and New England.\" ''Political Science Quarterly'' 69.4 (1954): 565-602 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2145637 in JSTOR].</ref> J. Mills Thornton argues that Whigs worked for positive state action to benefit society as a whole, while the Democrats feared any increase of power in government or in state-sponsored institutions as central banks. Fierce political battles raged in Alabama on issues ranging from banking to the removal of the Creek Indians. Thornton suggested the overarching issue in the state was how to protect liberty and equality for white people. Fears that Northern agitators threatened their value system and slavery as the basis of their wealthy economy made voters ready to secede when [[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected in 1860.<ref>J. Mills Thornton, III, ''Politics and Power in a Slave Society: Alabama, 1800-1860'' (1978)</ref>\n\n==Secession and Civil War, 1861-1865==\n{{Main|Alabama in the American Civil War}}\n\nThe \"Unionists\" were successful in the elections of 1851 and 1852. Passage of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Bill]] and uncertainty about agitation against slavery led the State Democratic convention of 1856 to revive the \"Alabama Platform\". When the Democratic National Convention at [[Charleston, South Carolina]], failed to approve the \"Alabama Platform\" in 1860, the Alabama delegates, followed by those of the other \"cotton states\", withdrew. Upon the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], Governor [[Andrew B. Moore]], as previously instructed by the legislature, called a state convention. Many prominent men had opposed secession. In North Alabama, there was an attempt to organize a neutral state to be called [[Nickajack]]. With President Lincoln's call to arms in April 1861, most opposition to secession ended.\n\nOn January 11, 1861, the State of Alabama adopted the ordinances of secession<ref>Alabama Department of Archives and History, [http://archives.state.al.us/timeline/1861/const.html Ordinances and Constitution of the State of Alabama]</ref> from the Union (by a vote of 61-39).\n\nAlabama joined the [[Confederate States of America]], whose government was first organized at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] on February 4, 1861. The CSA set up its temporary capital in Montgomery and selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as president. In May 1861, the Confederate government abandoned Montgomery before the sickly season began and relocated to [[Richmond, Virginia]], the capital of that state.\n\n[[File:1861 Davis Inaugural.jpg|thumb|right|The inauguration of [[Jefferson Davis]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] on February 18, 1861.]]\nGovernor Moore energetically supported the Confederate war effort. Even before hostilities began, he seized Federal facilities, sent agents to buy rifles in the Northeast and scoured the state for weapons. Despite some resistance in the northern part of the state, Alabama joined the Confederate States of America (CSA). Congressman [[Williamson Robert Winfield Cobb|Williamson R. W. Cobb]] was a Unionist and pleaded for compromise. When he ran for the Confederate congress in 1861, he was defeated.  (In 1863, with [[war-weariness]] growing in Alabama, he was elected on a wave of antiwar sentiment.)\n\nSome idea of the current transportation patterns and severe internal logistic problems faced by the Confederacy can be seen by tracing Jefferson Davis' journey from his plantation in Mississippi to Montgomery. With few roads and railroads, he traveled by [[steamboat]] from his plantation on the Mississippi River down to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], where he boarded a train to [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. He took another train north to Grand Junction, then a third train east to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] and a fourth train south to the main hub at Atlanta, Georgia. He took another train to the Alabama border and a last one to Montgomery in the center of the state.\n\nAs the war proceeded, the Federals seized ports along the Mississippi River, burned trestles and railroad bridges and tore up track. The frail Confederate railroad system faltered and virtually collapsed for want of repairs and replacement parts.\n\nIn the early part of the Civil War, Alabama was not the scene of military operations. The state contributed about 120,000 men to the Confederate service, practically all the white male population capable of bearing arms. Most were recruited locally and served with men they knew, which built esprit and strengthened ties to home. Medical conditions were severe for all soldiers. About 15% of fatalities were from disease, more than the 10% from battle. Alabama had few well-equipped hospitals, but it had many women who volunteered to nurse the sick and wounded. Soldiers were poorly equipped, especially after 1863. Often they pillaged the dead for boots, belts, canteens, blankets, hats, shirts and pants. Uncounted thousands of slaves were impressed to work for Confederate troops; they took care of horses and equipment, cooked and did laundry, hauled supplies, and helped in field hospitals. Other slaves built defensive installations, especially those around Mobile. They graded roads, repaired railroads, drove supply wagons, and labored in iron mines, iron foundries and even in the munitions factories. The service of slaves was involuntary: their unpaid labor was impressed from their unpaid masters. About 10,000 slaves escaped and joined the Union army, along with 2,700 white men.\n\nThirty-nine Alabamians attained [[flag rank]], most notably Lieutenant General [[James Longstreet]] and Admiral [[Raphael Semmes]]. [[Josiah Gorgas]], who came to Alabama from Pennsylvania, was the chief of ordnance for the Confederacy. He located new munitions plants in [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], which employed 10,000 workers until the Union soldiers burned the factories down in 1865. Selma Arsenal made most of the Confederacy's ammunition. The Selma Naval Ordnance Works made artillery, turning out a cannon every five days. The Confederate Naval Yard built ships and was noted for launching the [[CSS Tennessee (1863)|CSS ''Tennessee'']] in 1863 to defend Mobile Bay. Selma's Confederate Nitre Works procured niter for the [[Nitre and Mining Bureau]] for gunpowder, from limestone caves. When supplies were low, it advertised for housewives to save the contents of their chamber pots\u2014as urine was a rich source of [[nitrogen]].\n\nIn 1863, Union forces secured a foothold in northern Alabama in spite of the opposition of General [[Nathan B. Forrest]]. From 1861, the Union blockade shut Mobile, and, in 1864, the outer defenses of Mobile were taken by a Union fleet; the city itself held out until April 1865.<ref>Rogers, ch 12</ref>\n\n===Losses===\nAlabama soldiers fought in hundreds of battles; the state's losses at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] were 1,750 dead plus more captured or wounded; the \"Alabama Brigade\" took 781 casualties. Governor [[Lewis E. Parsons]] in July 1865 made a preliminary estimate of losses. Nearly all the white men served, some 122,000 he said, of whom 35,000 died in the war and another 30,000 were seriously disabled. The next year Governor [[Robert M. Patton]] estimated that 20,000 veterans had returned home permanently disabled, and there were 20,000 widows and 60,000 orphans. With cotton prices low, the value of farms shrank, from $176 million in 1860 to only $64 million in 1870. The livestock supply shrank too, as the number of horses fell from 127,000 to 80,000, and mules from 111,000 to 76,000. The overall population remained the same\u2014the growth that might have been expected was neutralized by death and emigration.<ref>Walter Lynwood Fleming, ''Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama'' (1905) pp 251-4 [https://archive.org/details/civilwarreconstr00flemuoft  online edition]</ref>\n\n==Reconstruction, 1865-1875==\nAccording to the Presidential plan of reorganization, a provisional governor for Alabama was appointed in June 1865. A state convention met in September of the same year, and declared the ordinance of secession null and void and slavery abolished. A legislature and a governor were elected in November, and the legislature was at once recognized by President [[Andrew Johnson]], but not by Congress, which refused to seat the delegation. Johnson ordered the army to allow the inauguration of the governor after the legislature ratified the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in December, 1865. But the legislature's passage of [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] to control the [[freedmen]] who were flocking from the plantations to the towns, and its rejection of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to grant suffrage, intensified Congressional hostility to the Presidential plan.\n[[File:Kkk-carpetbagger-cartoon.jpg|thumb|350px|A cartoon threatening that the KKK will lynch scalawags (left) and carpetbaggers (right) on March 4, 1869, the day [[Horatio Seymour]], a Democrat, will supposedly become President.

The freedmen were enrolled as voters. Only whites who could swear the [[Ironclad oath]] could be voters; that is they had to swear they had never voluntarily supported the Confederacy. This provision was insisted upon by the whites in the northern hill counties so they could control local government. As a result, Republicans controlled 96 of the 100 seats in the state constitutional convention.<ref>Rogers et al. ''Alabama'' p 244-45</ref> The new Republican party, made up of freedmen, Union sympathizers ([[scalawags]]), and northerners who had settled in the South ([[carpetbaggers]]), took control two years after the war ended. The constitutional convention in November 1867 framed a constitution which conferred universal manhood suffrage and imposed the iron-clad oath, so that whites who had supported the Confederacy were temporarily prohibited from holding office. The Reconstruction Acts of Congress required every new constitution to be ratified by a majority of the legal voters of the state. Most whites boycotted the polls and the new constitution fell short. Congress enacted that a majority of the votes cast should be sufficient. Thus the constitution went into effect, the state was readmitted to the Union in June 1868, and a new governor and legislature were elected.\n\nMany whites resisted postwar changes, complaining that the Republican governments were notable for legislative extravagance and corruption. But the Republican biracial coalition created the first system of public education in the state, which would benefit poor white children as well as freedmen. They also created charitable public institutions, such as hospitals and orphanages, to benefit all citizens. The planters had not made public investment but kept their wealth for themselves. As the state tried to improve institutions and infrastructure for the future, the state debt and state taxes rose. The state endorsed railway bonds at the rate of $12,000 and $16,000 a mile until the state debt had increased from eight million to seventeen million dollars. The native whites united, peeled many Scalawags away from the Republican coalition, and elected a governor and a majority of the lower house of the legislature in 1870, in an election characterized by widespread violence and fraud. As the new administration was overall a failure, in 1872, voters re-elected Republicans.\n\nBy 1874, however, the power of the Republicans was broken, and Democrats regained power in all state offices. A commission appointed to examine the state debt found it to be $25,503,000; by compromise, it was reduced to $15,000,000. A new constitution was adopted in 1875, which omitted the guarantee of the previous constitution that no one should be denied suffrage on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude. Its provisions forbade the state to engage in [[internal improvements]] or to give its credit to any private enterprise, an anti-industrial stance that persisted and limited the state's progress for decades into the 20th century.<ref>Rogers et al. ''Alabama,'' p 247-58</ref>\n\nIn the South, the interpretation of the tumultuous 1860s has differed sharply by race. Americans often interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in white versus black using Baptist sermons in Alabama. White preachers expressed the view that:\n: God had chastised them and given them a special mission \u2013 to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, [[emancipation]] was a historical tragedy, and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.\nIn sharp contrast, black preachers interpreted the Civil War, emancipation and Reconstruction as:\n: God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations and conventions. These institutions offered self-help, racial uplift and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help them: God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Wilson Fallin Jr., ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp 52-53</ref>\n\n==Democratic politics and disfranchisement 1874-1901==\nAfter 1874, the Democratic party had constant control of the state administration. The Republican Party by then was chiefly supported by African Americans. Republicans held no local or state offices, but the party did have some federal patronage. It failed to make nominations for office in 1878 and 1880 and endorsed the ticket of the Greenback party in 1882.<ref>Rogers, et al. ''Alabama: The History of a Deep South State '' (1994) 288-342</ref><ref>Frances Roberts, \"William Manning Lowe and the Greenback Party in Alabama.\" ''[[Alabama Review]]'' 5 (1952): 100-21.</ref>\n\nThe development of mining and manufacturing was accompanied by economic distress among the farming classes, which found expression in the Jeffersonian Democratic party, organized in 1892. The regular Democratic ticket was elected and the new party was merged into the Populist party. In 1894, the Republicans united with the Populists, elected three congressional representatives, and secured control of many of the counties. They did not succeed in carrying the state. They Populist coalition had less success in the next campaigns. Partisanship became intense, and Democratic charges of corruption of the black electorate were matched by Republican and Populist accusations of fraud and violence by Democrats.<ref>William Warren Rogers, \"The Farmers Alliance in Alabama,\" ''Alabama Review' 15 (1962): 5-18.</ref>\n\nDespite opposition by Republicans and Populists, Democrats completed their dominance with passage of a new constitution in 1901 that restricted suffrage and effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites, through requirements for voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy tests]] and restrictive residency requirements. From 1900 to 1903, the number of white registered voters fell by more than 40,000, from 232,821 to 191,492, despite a growth in population. By 1941 a total of more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks. This was due mostly to effects of the cumulative poll tax.<ref>Rogers, et al. ''Alabama: The History of a Deep South State '' (1994) 343-54.</ref>\n\nThe damage to the African-American community was severe and pervasive, as nearly all its eligible citizens lost the ability to vote. In 1900 45% of Alabama's population were African American: 827,545 citizens.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.edu./collections/stats/histcensus/php/state/php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed 15 Mar 2008</ref> In 1900 fourteen Black Belt counties (which were primarily African American) had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls. By June 1, 1903, the number of registered voters had dropped to 1,081. While [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas]] and [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes]] counties were each 75% black, between them only 103 African-American voters managed to register. In 1900 Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903 only 2,980 had managed to \"qualify\" to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were literate. The shut out was long-lasting. The effects of segregation suffered by African Americans were severe. At the end of WWII, for instance, in the black Collegeville community of Birmingham, only eleven voters in a population of 8,000 African Americans were deemed \"eligible\" to register to vote.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Disfranchisement also meant that blacks and poor whites could not serve on juries, so were subject to a justice system in which they had no part.\n\n==Progressive era 1900-1930==\nThe [[Progressive Movement]] in Alabama, while not as colorful or successful as in some other states, drew upon the energies of a rapidly growing middle class, and flourished from 1900 to the late 1920s.<ref>Sheldon Hackney, ''Populism to Progressivism in Alabama'' (1969), Covers 1892 1910</ref>  [[B. B. Comer]] (1848 \u2013 1927) was the state's most prominent progressive leader, especially during his term as governor (1907-1911). Middle-class reformers placed high on their agenda the regulation of railroads, and a better school system, with compulsory education and the prohibition of child labor.<ref>Rogers, et al. ''Alabama: The History of a Deep South State '' (1994) 355-75</ref> Comer sought 20 different railroad laws, to strengthen the railroad commission, reduce free passes handed out to grasping politicians, lobbying, and secret rebates to favored shippers. The Legislature approved his package, except for a provision that tried to forbid freight trains operating on Sundays. The result was a reduction in both freight and passenger rates. Railroads fought back vigorously in court, and in the arena of public opinion. The issue was fiercely debated for years, making Alabama laggard among the southern states in terms of controlling railroad rates.  Finally in 1914 a compromise was reached, in which the railroads accepted the reduced passenger rates, but were free to seek higher freight rates through the court system.<ref>James Fletcher Doster, ''Railroads in Alabama politics: 1875-1914'' (1957).</ref><ref>James F Doster, \"Comer, Smith and  Jones: Alabama's Railroad War,\" in Wiggins, ed., ''From Civil War to Civil Rights--Alabama, 1860-1960: An Anthology from the Alabama Review'' (1987) pp 221-30.</ref>\n\nProgressive reforms cost money, especially for the improved school system. Eliminating the inefficiencies of the tax collection system helped a bit. Reformers wanted to end the convict lease system, but it was producing a profit to the government of several hundred thousand dollars a year. That was too lucrative to abolish; however the progressives did move control over convict lease from the counties to a statewide system.  Finally the legislature increased statewide funding for the schools, and established the policy of at least one high school in every county; by 1911 half the counties operated public high schools for whites. Compulsory education was opposed by working-class families who wanted their children to earn money, and who distrusted the schooling the middle class was so insistent upon. But it finally passed in 1915; it was enforced for whites only and did not apply to farms. By 1910 Alabama still lagged with 62 percent of its children in school, compared to a national average of 71 percent.\n\nThe progressives worked hard to upgrade the hospital and public health system, with provisions to require the registration of births and deaths to provide the information needed. When the Rockefeller Foundation identified the hookworm as a critical element in draining energy out of Southern workers, Alabama discovered hookworm cases in every county, with rates as high as 60 percent. The progressive genius for organization and devotion to the public good was least controversial in the public health area and probably most successful there.<ref>Rogers et al. ''Alabama''pp 362\u201367</ref>  Prohibition was a favorite reform for Protestant churches across this entire country, and from the 1870s to the 1920s, Alabama passed a series of more restrictive laws that were demanded by the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) and other reform elements.<ref>Rogers et al.

These materials did, however, combine to make ideal foundry iron. Because of low transportation and labor costs, Birmingham quickly became the largest and cheapest foundry iron-producing area. By 1915, twenty-five percent of the nation's foundry pig iron was produced in Birmingham.<ref>Ethel Armes and James R.

The rural-dominated legislature refused to redistrict state House and Senate seats from 1901 to the 1960s. In addition, the state legislature had a senate based on one for each county. The state legislative delegations controlled counties. This led to a stranglehold on the state by a white rural minority. The contemporary interests of urbanizing, industrial cities and tens of thousands of citizens were not adequately represented in the government.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary, accessed 10 Mar 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |date=2007-10-17 }}</ref> One result was that Jefferson County, home of Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state. It received back only 1/67th of the tax money, as the state legislature ensured taxes were distributed equally to each county regardless of population.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1940, tens of thousands of African Americans migrated out of Alabama in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to seek jobs, education for their children, and freedom from [[lynching]] in northern and midwestern cities, such as [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], and [[Cleveland]]. These cities had many industrial jobs, but the migrants also had to compete with new waves of European immigrants. The rate of population growth in Alabama dropped from 20.8% in 1900 and 16.9% in 1910, to 9.8% in 1920, reflecting the impact of the outmigration. Formal disenfranchisement was ended only after the mid-1960s after African Americans led the Civil Rights Movement and gaining Federal legislation to protect their voting and civil rights. But the state devised new ways to reduce their political power. By that time, African Americans comprised a smaller minority than at the turn of the century, and a majority in certain rural counties.\n\nA rapid pace of change across the country, especially in growing cities, combined with new waves of immigration and migration of rural whites and blacks to cities, all contributed to a volatile social environment and the rise of a second [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) in the South and Midwest after 1915. In many areas it represented itself as a fraternal group to give aid to a community. Feldman (1999) has shown that the second KKK was not a mere hate group; it showed a genuine desire for political and social reform on behalf of poor whites. For example, Alabama Klansmen such as [[Hugo Black]] were among the foremost advocates of better public schools, effective Prohibition enforcement, expanded road construction, and other \"progressive\" measures to benefit poor whites. By 1925, the Klan was a powerful political force in the state, as urban politicians such as [[J. Thomas Heflin]], [[David Bibb Graves]], and [[Hugo Black]] manipulated the KKK membership against the power of the \"Big Mule\" industrialists and especially the Black Belt planters who had long dominated the state.<ref>Feldman (1999)</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Democrat [[Bibb Graves]], a former chapter head, won the governor's office with KKK members' support. He led one of the most progressive administrations in the state's history, pushing for increased education funding, better public health, new highway construction, and pro-labor legislation. At the same time, KKK vigilantes---thinking they enjoyed governmental protection\u2014launched a wave of physical terror across Alabama in 1927, targeting both blacks and whites. The Republicans responded: The major newspapers kept up a steady, loud attack on the Klan as violent and unAmerican. Sheriffs cracked down on Klan violence, and a national scandal among Klan leaders in the 1920s turned many members away.  The state voted for Democrat [[Al Smith]] in 1928, although he was Roman Catholic (a target of the KKK), and the Klan's official membership plunged to under six thousand by 1930.\n\n==Civil Rights Movement and redistricting, 1945-1975==\n{{CRM in Alabama|state=uncollapsed}}\nEconomically, the major force in Alabama was the mechanization and consolidation of agriculture. Mechanical cotton pickers became available in the postwar era, reducing the need for many agricultural workers. They tended to move into the region's urban areas. Still, by 1963, only about a third of the state's cotton was picked by machine.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flynt|first1=Wayne|title=Poor But Proud|date=February 5, 2016|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=6913}}</ref> Diversification from cotton into soybeans, poultry and dairy products also drove more poor people off the land.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flynt|first1=Wayne|title=Poor But Proud|date=February 5, 2016|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=6973}}</ref> In the state's thirty-five Appalachian counties, twenty-one lost population between 1950 and 1960.

The [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] from 1955 to 1956 was one of the most significant African-American protests against the policy of racial segregation in the state. Although constituting a majority of bus passengers, African Americans were discriminated against in seating policy. The protest nearly brought the city bus system to bankruptcy and changes were negotiated. The legal challenge was settled in ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' (1956), a case in which the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]] found the segregation policy to be unconstitutional under Fourteenth Amendment provisions for equal treatment; it ordered that public transit in Alabama be desegregated.\n\nThe rural white minority's hold on the legislature continued, however, suppressing attempts by more progressive elements to modernize the state. A study in 1960 concluded that because of rural domination, \"A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> Given the legislature's control of the county governments, the rural interests had even more power. Legislators and others filed suit in the 1960s to secure redistricting and reapportionment. It took years and Federal court intervention to achieve the redistricting necessary to establishing \"[[one man, one vote]]\" representation, as a result of ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962) and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964). The court ruled that, in addition to the states having to redistrict to reflect decennial censuses in congressional districts, both houses of state governments had to be based on representation by population districts, rather than by geographic county as the state senate had been, as the senate's make-up prevented equal representation. These court decisions caused redistricting in many northern and western states as well as the South, where often rural interests had long dominated state legislatures and prevented reform.\n\nIn 1960 on the eve of important civil rights battles, 30% of Alabama's population was African American or 980,000.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1960 US Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=2007-08-23 }}, accessed 13 Mar 2008</ref>\n\nAs Birmingham was the center of industry and population in Alabama, in 1963 civil rights leaders chose to mount a campaign there for desegregation. Schools, restaurants and department stores were segregated; no African Americans were hired to work in the stores where they shopped or in the city government supported in part by their taxes. There were no African-American members of the police force. Despite segregation, African Americans had been advancing economically. But from 1947 to 1965, Birmingham suffered \"about 50 racially motivated bomb attacks.\"<ref name=\"bombings\"/> Independent groups affiliated with the [[KKK]] bombed transitional residential neighborhoods to discourage blacks' moving into them; in 19 cases, they bombed black churches with congregations active in civil rights, and the homes of their ministers.<ref name=\"bombings\">[http://www.al.com/specialreport/?bombing/97-min.html CHANDA TEMPLE and JEFF HANSEN, \"Ministers' homes, churches among bomb targets\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701091931/http://www.al.com/specialreport/?bombing%2F97-min.html |date=2015-07-01 }}, AL.com, 16 July 2000, accessed 3 February 2015</ref>)\n\nTo help with the campaign and secure national attention, the Rev. [[Fred Shuttlesworth]] invited members of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) to Birmingham to help change its leadership's policies. Non-violent action had produced good results in some other cities. The Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], Rev. [[Wyatt Tee Walker]], his executive director; and other leaders came to Birmingham to help.\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1963, national attention became riveted on Birmingham. The media covered the series of peaceful marches that the Birmingham police, headed by Police Commissioner [[Bull Connor]], attempted to divert and control. He invited high school students to join the marches, as King intended to fill the jails with nonviolent protesters to make a moral argument to the United States. Dramatic images of Birmingham police using police dogs and powerful streams of water against children protesters filled newspapers and television coverage, arousing national outrage. The [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] during a Sunday service, which killed four African-American girls, caused a national outcry and gained support for the civil rights cause in the state. [[16th Street Baptist Church]] had been a rallying point and staging area for civil rights activities in Birmingham prior to the bombing. Finally, Birmingham leaders King and Shuttlesworth agreed to end the marches when the businessmen's group committed to end segregation in stores and public facilities.\n\nBefore his November, 1963 assassination, President [[John F. Kennedy]] had supported civil rights legislation. In 1964 President [[Lyndon Johnson]] helped secure its passage and signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]]. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] in 1965 attracted national and international press and TV coverage. The nation was horrified to see peaceful protesters beaten as they entered the county. That year, Johnson helped achieve passage of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] to gain federal oversight and enforcement to ensure the ability of all citizens to vote.\n\nCourt challenges related to \"[[one man, one vote]]\" and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 finally provided the groundwork for federal court rulings. In 1972, the federal court required the legislature to create a statewide redistricting plan in order to correct the imbalances in representation in the legislature related to population patterns.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> Redistricting, together with federal oversight of voter registration and election practices, enabled hundreds of thousands of Alabama citizens, both white and black, to vote and participate for the first time in the political system.\n\n==1975-2000==\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Twenty-first century, 2000-present==\nIn 2015, state budget reductions of $83 million resulted in the closing of five parks per [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] ($3 million). In addition, the state cut services at driver's license offices, closing most in several black-majority counties. This made voter registration more difficult, as the offices had offered both services.<ref>Mike Cason [http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/state_announces_to_close_becau.html#incart_river_home State to close 5 parks, cut back services at driver license offices] Alabama Media Group, September 30, 2015.</ref> As of 2018, the state of Alabama offers online voter registration.\n\nAlabama has a dynamic economy that has seen the automotive industry open large manufacturing plants from Mercedes-Benz in Tuscaloosa County to Hyundai Motors in Montgomery County.

The United States arranged for  [[Indian Removal]] after 1830, forcibly displacing most Southeast tribes to west of the Mississippi River to what was then called Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). These actions affected the Cherokee, Creek (Muscogee), and Chickasaw, among others. After this, European-American arrived in large numbers, bringing or buying African Americans in the domestic [[slave trade]].\n\nIn antebellum Alabama, wealthy planters created large cotton [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] based in the fertile central [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] of the upland region, which depended on the labor of enslaved [[African people|Africans]]. Tens of thousands of slaves were transported to and sold in the state by [[Atlantic slave trade|slave traders]] who purchased them in the [[Upper South]]. In the mountains and foothills, poorer whites practiced [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]]. By 1860 blacks (nearly all slaves) comprised 45 percent of the state's 964,201 people.\n\nThe state's wealthy planters considered slavery essential to their economy. As one of the largest slaveholding states, Alabama was among the first six states to secede. It declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] in January 1861 and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] in February. During the ensuing [[American Civil War]] [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama had moderate levels of warfare]]. The population suffered economic losses and hardships as a result of the war. Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] freed all enslaved people in Confederate states. The Southern capitulation in 1865 ended the Confederate state government. A decade of  [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] began, a controversial time that has a range of interpretation. Its biracial government established the first public schools and welfare institutions in the state.\n\nAfter the war, planters worked to get their vast cotton plantations back into production. African Americans chose to exert some independence as free tenant farmers and sharecroppers, rather than working in labor gangs. Wherever possible, African-American women left the fields. Small farms, which produced general crops before the war, turned to cotton as a cash crop. The market for cotton was overloaded, and prices dropped 50%.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/reconstruction/section3/section3_wfarmer.html America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414181748/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/reconstruction/section3/section3_wfarmer.html |date=2012-04-14 }}, University of Houston</ref>\n\nFor a half century after the Civil War, Alabama was a poor, heavily rural state, with an economy based on cotton; most farmers were tenant, sharecroppers or laborers who did not own land.   Reconstruction ended when [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrats]], calling themselves known as \"[[Redeemers]]\"  regained control of the state legislature by both legal and extralegal means (including violence and harassment). They established political and social dominance over African Americans. In 1901, Southern Democrats passed a state Constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised most African Americans]] (who in 1900 comprised more than 45 percent of the state's population), as well as tens of thousands of [[Poor White|poor whites]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Glenn Feldman.

Also in the region were the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Cherokee]], from a different family and cultural group.

They named the region as [[Spanish Florida|La Florida]], which extended to the southeast peninsular state now bearing the name.\n\nAlthough a member of [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]'s expedition of 1528 may have entered southern Alabama, the first fully documented visit was by explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]. In 1539 he made an arduous expedition along the [[Coosa River|Coosa]], [[Alabama River|Alabama]] and [[Tombigbee River|Tombigbee]] rivers.\n\nThe English also laid claims to the region north of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. [[Charles II of England]] included the territory of modern Alabama in the [[Province of Carolina]], with land granted to certain of his favorites by the charters of 1663 and 1665. English traders from Carolina frequented the valley of the [[Alabama River]] as early as 1687 to trade for deerskins with the Native American peoples.\n\n[[File:Mobile1725.jpg|thumb|left|1725 map of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama's first permanent European settlement.]]\nThe [[French (people)|French]] also colonized the region. In 1702 they founded a settlement on the [[Mobile River]] near its mouth, constructing ''[[Old Mobile Site|Fort Louis]].''  For the next nine years this was the French seat of government of New France, or ''La Louisiane'' ([[Louisiana]]). In 1711, they abandoned Fort Louis because of repeated flooding. Settlers rebuilt a fort on higher ground known as ''[[Fort Conde]]''. This was the start of what developed as present-day [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], the first permanent European settlement in Alabama. [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] was another early French settlement on the Gulf Coast, to the west in what is now Mississippi.\n\nThe French and the English contested the region, each attempting to forge strong alliances with Indian tribes. To strengthen their position, defend their Indian allies, and draw other tribes to them, the French established the military posts of ''[[Fort Toulouse]]'', near the junction of the Coosa and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers, and ''[[Fort Tombecbe]]'' on the Tombigbee River.\n\nThe French and the English engaged in competition for Indian trade in what is now the state of Alabama between roughly the 1690s and the 1750s, at which point the [[French and Indian War]] broke out. It was the North American front of the Seven Years' War between these two nations in Europe.  Though the French claimed the territory as their own and attempted to rule it from [[Fort Toulouse]], so as to engage in trade with the Indians, English traders based out of the Carolinas infiltrated the region, also engaging in trade. The Chickasaw frequently favored the English in this contest. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nOverall, during this time the English proved to be the better traders and colonizers. They operated independently, while the French government was more directly involved in its colonies. On this note [[Edmund Burke]] would later note that English colonists in America would owe their freedom more \"to [the Crown's] carelessness than to its design\". This was a policy referred to as \"salutary neglect\". The distance between the colonies and the home countries meant they could always operated with some freedom.<ref>William Garrott Brown, Albert James Pickett, ''A History of Alabama, for Use in Schools: Based as to Its Earlier Parts on the Work of Albert J.

In 1739, Oglethorpe visited the [[Creek Indians]] west of the [[Chattahoochee River]] and made a [[treaty]] with them.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]], which ended the [[Seven Years' War]] after France's defeat by Britain, resulted in France ceding its territories east of the Mississippi to Britain. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] came into undisputed control of the region between the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers, in terms of other European powers. Of course it had not consulted with any of the numerous indigenous peoples whom it nominally \"ruled.\" The portion of Alabama below the [[31st parallel north|31st parallel]] was considered a part of British [[West Florida]]. The British Crown defined the portion north of this line as part of the \"[[Illinois Country]]\"; the area west of the Appalachian Mountains was to be reserved for use by Native American tribes. European-American settlers were not supposed to encroach in that territory, but they soon did. In 1767, Britain expanded the province of West Florida northward to 32\u00b028'N latitude.\n\nMore than a decade later, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British informally ceded this West Florida region to Spain. By the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]], September 3, 1783, Great Britain formally ceded West Florida to Spain. By the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], signed the same day, Britain ceded to the newly established United States all of this province north of 31\u00b0N, thus laying the foundation for a long controversy.\n\n[[File:Mississippi Territory dark.gif|270px|thumb|Mississippi Territory changes 1798\u20131817.]]\nBy the [[Treaty of Madrid (1795)|Treaty of Madrid]] in 1795, Spain ceded to the United States the lands east of the Mississippi between 31\u00b0N and 32\u00b028'N. Three years later, in 1798, Congress organized this district as the [[Mississippi Territory]]. A strip of land 12 or 14 miles wide near the present northern boundary of Alabama and Mississippi was claimed by [[South Carolina]], as part of the eastern colonies' previous hopeful extensions to the west. In 1787, during constitutional negotiations, South Carolina ceded this claim to the federal government. Georgia likewise claimed all the lands between the 31st and [[35th parallel north|35th parallels]] from its present western boundary to the Mississippi River, and did not surrender its claim until 1802. Two years later, the boundaries of Mississippi Territory were extended so as to include all of the Georgia cession.\n\nIn 1812, Congress added the [[Mobile District]] of West Florida to the Mississippi Territory, claiming that it was included in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The following year, General [[James Wilkinson]] occupied the Mobile District with a military force. The Spanish did not resist. Thus the whole area of the present state of Alabama was taken under the jurisdiction of the United States. Several powerful Native American tribes still occupied most of the land, with some formal ownership recognized by treaty with the United States. Five of the major tribes became known as the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], as they had highly complex cultures and adopted some elements of European-American culture.\n\nIn 1817, the Mississippi Territory was divided. The western portion, which had attracted population more quickly, became the state of [[Mississippi]]. The eastern portion became the [[Alabama Territory]], with [[St. Stephens, Alabama|St. Stephens]] on the [[Tombigbee River]] as its temporary seat of government.\n\nConflict between the various tribes in Alabama and American settlers increased rapidly in the early 19th century because the Americans kept encroaching on Native American territories. The great [[Shawnee]] chief [[Tecumseh]] visited the region in 1811, seeking to forge an Indian alliance among these tribes to join his resistance in the Great Lakes area. With the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]], Britain encouraged Tecumseh's resistance movement, in the hope of expelling American settlers from west of the Appalachians. Several tribes were divided in opinion.\n\nThe Creek tribe fell to [[Creek war|civil war]] (1813-1814). Violence between Creeks and Americans escalated, culminating in the [[Fort Mims massacre]]. Full-scale war between the United States and the \"Red Stick\" Creeks began; they were the more traditional members of their society who resisted US encroachment. The Chickasaw, Choctaw, [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] and other Creek factions remained neutral to or allied with the United States during the war; they were highly decentralized in bands' alliances. Some warriors from among the bands served with American troops. Volunteer militias from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee marched into Alabama, fighting the Red Sticks.\n\nLater, federal troops became the main fighting force for the United States. General [[Andrew Jackson]] was the commander of the American forces during the Creek War and in the continuing effort against the British in the War of 1812. His leadership and military success during the wars made him a national hero. The [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] (August 9, 1814) ended the Creek War. By the terms of the treaty, the Creek, Red Sticks and neutrals alike, ceded about one-half of the present state of Alabama to the United States. Due to later cessions by the Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw in 1816, they retained only about one-quarter of their former territories in Alabama.\n\n==Early statehood==\nIn 1819, Alabama was admitted as the 22nd state to the Union. Its constitution provided for equal [[suffrage]] for white men, a standard it abandoned in its constitution of 1901, which reduced suffrage of poor whites and most blacks, disenfranchising tens of thousands of voters.<ref>This section is largely copied from {{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm, ed \"Alabama\"|title= The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: 11th edition|publisher=At the University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopdiabrit23chisgoog|year=1910|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopdiabrit23chisgoog/page/n482 463]}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first problems of the new state was finance. Since the amount of money in circulation was not sufficient to meet the demands of the increasing population, a system of state banks was instituted. State bonds were issued and public lands were sold to secure capital, and the notes of the banks, loaned on security, became a medium of exchange. Prospects of an income from the banks led the legislature of 1836 to abolish all taxation for state purposes. The [[Panic of 1837]] wiped out a large portion of the banks' assets, leaving the state poor. Next came revelations of grossly careless and corrupt management. In 1843 the banks were placed in liquidation. After disposing of all their available assets, the state assumed the remaining liabilities, for which it had pledged its faith and credit.<ref>{{cite book|author=Murray Rothbard|title=The Panic of 1819: Reactions and Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmH6BLCkBj4C&pg=PA81|year=1962|page=81|isbn=9781610163705}}</ref>\n\nIn 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] under the leadership of President Andrew Jackson, authorizing federal [[Indian removal|removal]] of southeastern tribes to west of the Mississippi River, including the Five Civilized Tribes of Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and [[Seminole]] (in Florida). In 1832, the national government provided for the removal of the Creek via the [[Treaty of Cusseta]]. Before the removal occurred between 1834 and 1837, the state legislature organized counties in the lands to be ceded, and European-American settlers flocked in before the Native Americans had left.<ref>{{cite book|author=John T.

Disagreements over whether a state could [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] a federal law caused a division within the Democratic party. About the same time the [[Whig party (United States)|Whig party]] emerged as an opposition party. It drew support from planters and townsmen, while the Democrats were strongest among poor farmers and Catholic communities (descendants of French and Spanish colonists) in the Mobile area. For some time, the Whigs were almost as numerous as the Democrats, but they never secured control of the state government. The States' Rights faction were in a minority; nevertheless, under their persistent leader, [[William L. Yancey]] (1814\u20131863), they prevailed upon the Democrats in 1848 to adopt their most radical views.<ref>Austin L. Venable, \"William L. Yancey's Transition from Unionism to State Rights.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 10.3 (1944): 331-342.</ref>\n\nDuring the agitation over the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would bar slavery from territory acquired from [[Mexico]] as a result of the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]] (1848), Yancey induced the [[Democratic State Convention]] of 1848 to adopt what was known as the \"[[Alabama Platform]]\". It declared that neither Congress nor the government of a territory had the right to interfere with slavery in a territory, that those who held opposite views were not Democrats, and that the Democrats of Alabama would not support a candidate for the presidency if he did not agree with them. This platform was endorsed by conventions in Florida and Virginia and by the legislatures of Georgia and Alabama.\n\nTensions related to slavery divided many state delegations in Congress, as this body tried to determine the futures of territories beyond the Mississippi River. Following the Congressional passage of the [[Compromise of 1850]], which assigned certain territories as slave or free, in Alabama people began to realign politically. The States' Rights faction, joined by many Democrats, founded the [[Southern Rights Party]], which demanded the repeal of the Compromise, advocated resistance to future encroachments, and prepared for secession. The Whigs were joined by the remaining Democrats and called themselves the \"Unionists\". The party unwillingly accepted the Compromise and denied that the Constitution provided for secession.\n\nSince the turn of the 19th century, development of large cotton plantations had taken place across the upland Black Belt after the invention of the [[cotton gin]] made short-staple cotton profitable. Cotton had added dramatically to the state's wealth. The owners' wealth depended on the labor of hundreds of thousands of enslaved African Americans, many initially transported in the domestic trade from the Upper South, which resulted in one million workers being relocated to the South. In other parts of the state, the soil supported only subsistence farming. Most of the [[yeoman]] farmers owned few or no slaves. By 1860 the investment and profits in cotton production resulted in planters holding 435,000 enslaved African Americans, who made up 45% of the state's population.\n\nAt the time of statehood, the early Alabama settlers adopted universal white suffrage. They were noted for a spirit of frontier democracy and egalitarianism, but this declined after the slave society developed.<ref>Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick, \"A Meaning for Turner's Frontier: Part II: The Southwest Frontier and New England.\" ''Political Science Quarterly'' 69.4 (1954): 565-602 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2145637 in JSTOR].</ref> J. Mills Thornton argues that Whigs worked for positive state action to benefit society as a whole, while the Democrats feared any increase of power in government or in state-sponsored institutions as central banks. Fierce political battles raged in Alabama on issues ranging from banking to the removal of the Creek Indians. Thornton suggested the overarching issue in the state was how to protect liberty and equality for white people. Fears that Northern agitators threatened their value system and slavery as the basis of their wealthy economy made voters ready to secede when [[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected in 1860.<ref>J. Mills Thornton, III, ''Politics and Power in a Slave Society: Alabama, 1800-1860'' (1978)</ref>\n\n==Secession and Civil War, 1861-1865==\n{{Main|Alabama in the American Civil War}}\n\nThe \"Unionists\" were successful in the elections of 1851 and 1852. Passage of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Bill]] and uncertainty about agitation against slavery led the State Democratic convention of 1856 to revive the \"Alabama Platform\". When the Democratic National Convention at [[Charleston, South Carolina]], failed to approve the \"Alabama Platform\" in 1860, the Alabama delegates, followed by those of the other \"cotton states\", withdrew. Upon the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], Governor [[Andrew B. Moore]], as previously instructed by the legislature, called a state convention. Many prominent men had opposed secession. In North Alabama, there was an attempt to organize a neutral state to be called [[Nickajack]]. With President Lincoln's call to arms in April 1861, most opposition to secession ended.\n\nOn January 11, 1861, the State of Alabama adopted the ordinances of secession<ref>Alabama Department of Archives and History, [http://archives.state.al.us/timeline/1861/const.html Ordinances and Constitution of the State of Alabama]</ref> from the Union (by a vote of 61-39).\n\nAlabama joined the [[Confederate States of America]], whose government was first organized at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] on February 4, 1861. The CSA set up its temporary capital in Montgomery and selected [[Jefferson Davis]] as president. In May 1861, the Confederate government abandoned Montgomery before the sickly season began and relocated to [[Richmond, Virginia]], the capital of that state.\n\n[[File:1861 Davis Inaugural.jpg|thumb|right|The inauguration of [[Jefferson Davis]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] on February 18, 1861.]]\nGovernor Moore energetically supported the Confederate war effort. Even before hostilities began, he seized Federal facilities, sent agents to buy rifles in the Northeast and scoured the state for weapons. Despite some resistance in the northern part of the state, Alabama joined the Confederate States of America (CSA). Congressman [[Williamson Robert Winfield Cobb|Williamson R. W. Cobb]] was a Unionist and pleaded for compromise. When he ran for the Confederate congress in 1861, he was defeated.  (In 1863, with [[war-weariness]] growing in Alabama, he was elected on a wave of antiwar sentiment.)\n\nSome idea of the current transportation patterns and severe internal logistic problems faced by the Confederacy can be seen by tracing Jefferson Davis' journey from his plantation in Mississippi to Montgomery. With few roads and railroads, he traveled by [[steamboat]] from his plantation on the Mississippi River down to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], where he boarded a train to [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. He took another train north to Grand Junction, then a third train east to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] and a fourth train south to the main hub at Atlanta, Georgia. He took another train to the Alabama border and a last one to Montgomery in the center of the state.\n\nAs the war proceeded, the Federals seized ports along the Mississippi River, burned trestles and railroad bridges and tore up track. The frail Confederate railroad system faltered and virtually collapsed for want of repairs and replacement parts.\n\nIn the early part of the Civil War, Alabama was not the scene of military operations. The state contributed about 120,000 men to the Confederate service, practically all the white male population capable of bearing arms. Most were recruited locally and served with men they knew, which built esprit and strengthened ties to home. Medical conditions were severe for all soldiers. About 15% of fatalities were from disease, more than the 10% from battle. Alabama had few well-equipped hospitals, but it had many women who volunteered to nurse the sick and wounded. Soldiers were poorly equipped, especially after 1863. Often they pillaged the dead for boots, belts, canteens, blankets, hats, shirts and pants. Uncounted thousands of slaves were impressed to work for Confederate troops; they took care of horses and equipment, cooked and did laundry, hauled supplies, and helped in field hospitals. Other slaves built defensive installations, especially those around Mobile. They graded roads, repaired railroads, drove supply wagons, and labored in iron mines, iron foundries and even in the munitions factories. The service of slaves was involuntary: their unpaid labor was impressed from their unpaid masters. About 10,000 slaves escaped and joined the Union army, along with 2,700 white men.\n\nThirty-nine Alabamians attained [[flag rank]], most notably Lieutenant General [[James Longstreet]] and Admiral [[Raphael Semmes]]. [[Josiah Gorgas]], who came to Alabama from Pennsylvania, was the chief of ordnance for the Confederacy. He located new munitions plants in [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], which employed 10,000 workers until the Union soldiers burned the factories down in 1865. Selma Arsenal made most of the Confederacy's ammunition. The Selma Naval Ordnance Works made artillery, turning out a cannon every five days. The Confederate Naval Yard built ships and was noted for launching the [[CSS Tennessee (1863)|CSS ''Tennessee'']] in 1863 to defend Mobile Bay. Selma's Confederate Nitre Works procured niter for the [[Nitre and Mining Bureau]] for gunpowder, from limestone caves. When supplies were low, it advertised for housewives to save the contents of their chamber pots\u2014as urine was a rich source of [[nitrogen]].\n\nIn 1863, Union forces secured a foothold in northern Alabama in spite of the opposition of General [[Nathan B. Forrest]]. From 1861, the Union blockade shut Mobile, and, in 1864, the outer defenses of Mobile were taken by a Union fleet; the city itself held out until April 1865.<ref>Rogers, ch 12</ref>\n\n===Losses===\nAlabama soldiers fought in hundreds of battles; the state's losses at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] were 1,750 dead plus more captured or wounded; the \"Alabama Brigade\" took 781 casualties. Governor [[Lewis E. Parsons]] in July 1865 made a preliminary estimate of losses. Nearly all the white men served, some 122,000 he said, of whom 35,000 died in the war and another 30,000 were seriously disabled. The next year Governor [[Robert M. Patton]] estimated that 20,000 veterans had returned home permanently disabled, and there were 20,000 widows and 60,000 orphans. With cotton prices low, the value of farms shrank, from $176 million in 1860 to only $64 million in 1870. The livestock supply shrank too, as the number of horses fell from 127,000 to 80,000, and mules from 111,000 to 76,000. The overall population remained the same\u2014the growth that might have been expected was neutralized by death and emigration.<ref>Walter Lynwood Fleming, ''Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama'' (1905) pp 251-4 [https://archive.org/details/civilwarreconstr00flemuoft  online edition]</ref>\n\n==Reconstruction, 1865-1875==\nAccording to the Presidential plan of reorganization, a provisional governor for Alabama was appointed in June 1865. A state convention met in September of the same year, and declared the ordinance of secession null and void and slavery abolished. A legislature and a governor were elected in November, and the legislature was at once recognized by President [[Andrew Johnson]], but not by Congress, which refused to seat the delegation. Johnson ordered the army to allow the inauguration of the governor after the legislature ratified the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in December, 1865. But the legislature's passage of [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] to control the [[freedmen]] who were flocking from the plantations to the towns, and its rejection of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to grant suffrage, intensified Congressional hostility to the Presidential plan.\n[[File:Kkk-carpetbagger-cartoon.jpg|thumb|350px|A cartoon threatening that the KKK will lynch scalawags (left) and carpetbaggers (right) on March 4, 1869, the day [[Horatio Seymour]], a Democrat, will supposedly become President.

The freedmen were enrolled as voters. Only whites who could swear the [[Ironclad oath]] could be voters; that is they had to swear they had never voluntarily supported the Confederacy. This provision was insisted upon by the whites in the northern hill counties so they could control local government. As a result, Republicans controlled 96 of the 100 seats in the state constitutional convention.<ref>Rogers et al. ''Alabama'' p 244-45</ref> The new Republican party, made up of freedmen, Union sympathizers ([[scalawags]]), and northerners who had settled in the South ([[carpetbaggers]]), took control two years after the war ended. The constitutional convention in November 1867 framed a constitution which conferred universal manhood suffrage and imposed the iron-clad oath, so that whites who had supported the Confederacy were temporarily prohibited from holding office. The Reconstruction Acts of Congress required every new constitution to be ratified by a majority of the legal voters of the state. Most whites boycotted the polls and the new constitution fell short. Congress enacted that a majority of the votes cast should be sufficient. Thus the constitution went into effect, the state was readmitted to the Union in June 1868, and a new governor and legislature were elected.\n\nMany whites resisted postwar changes, complaining that the Republican governments were notable for legislative extravagance and corruption. But the Republican biracial coalition created the first system of public education in the state, which would benefit poor white children as well as freedmen. They also created charitable public institutions, such as hospitals and orphanages, to benefit all citizens. The planters had not made public investment but kept their wealth for themselves. As the state tried to improve institutions and infrastructure for the future, the state debt and state taxes rose. The state endorsed railway bonds at the rate of $12,000 and $16,000 a mile until the state debt had increased from eight million to seventeen million dollars. The native whites united, peeled many Scalawags away from the Republican coalition, and elected a governor and a majority of the lower house of the legislature in 1870, in an election characterized by widespread violence and fraud. As the new administration was overall a failure, in 1872, voters re-elected Republicans.\n\nBy 1874, however, the power of the Republicans was broken, and Democrats regained power in all state offices. A commission appointed to examine the state debt found it to be $25,503,000; by compromise, it was reduced to $15,000,000. A new constitution was adopted in 1875, which omitted the guarantee of the previous constitution that no one should be denied suffrage on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude. Its provisions forbade the state to engage in [[internal improvements]] or to give its credit to any private enterprise, an anti-industrial stance that persisted and limited the state's progress for decades into the 20th century.<ref>Rogers et al. ''Alabama,'' p 247-58</ref>\n\nIn the South, the interpretation of the tumultuous 1860s has differed sharply by race. Americans often interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in white versus black using Baptist sermons in Alabama. White preachers expressed the view that:\n: God had chastised them and given them a special mission \u2013 to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, [[emancipation]] was a historical tragedy, and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.\nIn sharp contrast, black preachers interpreted the Civil War, emancipation and Reconstruction as:\n: God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations and conventions. These institutions offered self-help, racial uplift and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help them: God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Wilson Fallin Jr., ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp 52-53</ref>\n\n==Democratic politics and disfranchisement 1874-1901==\nAfter 1874, the Democratic party had constant control of the state administration. The Republican Party by then was chiefly supported by African Americans. Republicans held no local or state offices, but the party did have some federal patronage. It failed to make nominations for office in 1878 and 1880 and endorsed the ticket of the Greenback party in 1882.<ref>Rogers, et al. ''Alabama: The History of a Deep South State '' (1994) 288-342</ref><ref>Frances Roberts, \"William Manning Lowe and the Greenback Party in Alabama.\" ''[[Alabama Review]]'' 5 (1952): 100-21.</ref>\n\nThe development of mining and manufacturing was accompanied by economic distress among the farming classes, which found expression in the Jeffersonian Democratic party, organized in 1892. The regular Democratic ticket was elected and the new party was merged into the Populist party. In 1894, the Republicans united with the Populists, elected three congressional representatives, and secured control of many of the counties. They did not succeed in carrying the state. They Populist coalition had less success in the next campaigns. Partisanship became intense, and Democratic charges of corruption of the black electorate were matched by Republican and Populist accusations of fraud and violence by Democrats.<ref>William Warren Rogers, \"The Farmers Alliance in Alabama,\" ''Alabama Review' 15 (1962): 5-18.</ref>\n\nDespite opposition by Republicans and Populists, Democrats completed their dominance with passage of a new constitution in 1901 that restricted suffrage and effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites, through requirements for voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy tests]] and restrictive residency requirements. From 1900 to 1903, the number of white registered voters fell by more than 40,000, from 232,821 to 191,492, despite a growth in population. By 1941 a total of more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks. This was due mostly to effects of the cumulative poll tax.<ref>Rogers, et al. ''Alabama: The History of a Deep South State '' (1994) 343-54.</ref>\n\nThe damage to the African-American community was severe and pervasive, as nearly all its eligible citizens lost the ability to vote. In 1900 45% of Alabama's population were African American: 827,545 citizens.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.edu./collections/stats/histcensus/php/state/php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, accessed 15 Mar 2008</ref> In 1900 fourteen Black Belt counties (which were primarily African American) had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls. By June 1, 1903, the number of registered voters had dropped to 1,081. While [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas]] and [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes]] counties were each 75% black, between them only 103 African-American voters managed to register. In 1900 Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903 only 2,980 had managed to \"qualify\" to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were literate. The shut out was long-lasting. The effects of segregation suffered by African Americans were severe. At the end of WWII, for instance, in the black Collegeville community of Birmingham, only eleven voters in a population of 8,000 African Americans were deemed \"eligible\" to register to vote.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Disfranchisement also meant that blacks and poor whites could not serve on juries, so were subject to a justice system in which they had no part.\n\n==Progressive era 1900-1930==\nThe [[Progressive Movement]] in Alabama, while not as colorful or successful as in some other states, drew upon the energies of a rapidly growing middle class, and flourished from 1900 to the late 1920s.<ref>Sheldon Hackney, ''Populism to Progressivism in Alabama'' (1969), Covers 1892 1910</ref>  [[B. B. Comer]] (1848 \u2013 1927) was the state's most prominent progressive leader, especially during his term as governor (1907-1911). Middle-class reformers placed high on their agenda the regulation of railroads, and a better school system, with compulsory education and the prohibition of child labor.<ref>Rogers, et al. ''Alabama: The History of a Deep South State '' (1994) 355-75</ref> Comer sought 20 different railroad laws, to strengthen the railroad commission, reduce free passes handed out to grasping politicians, lobbying, and secret rebates to favored shippers. The Legislature approved his package, except for a provision that tried to forbid freight trains operating on Sundays. The result was a reduction in both freight and passenger rates. Railroads fought back vigorously in court, and in the arena of public opinion. The issue was fiercely debated for years, making Alabama laggard among the southern states in terms of controlling railroad rates.  Finally in 1914 a compromise was reached, in which the railroads accepted the reduced passenger rates, but were free to seek higher freight rates through the court system.<ref>James Fletcher Doster, ''Railroads in Alabama politics: 1875-1914'' (1957).</ref><ref>James F Doster, \"Comer, Smith and  Jones: Alabama's Railroad War,\" in Wiggins, ed., ''From Civil War to Civil Rights--Alabama, 1860-1960: An Anthology from the Alabama Review'' (1987) pp 221-30.</ref>\n\nProgressive reforms cost money, especially for the improved school system. Eliminating the inefficiencies of the tax collection system helped a bit. Reformers wanted to end the convict lease system, but it was producing a profit to the government of several hundred thousand dollars a year. That was too lucrative to abolish; however the progressives did move control over convict lease from the counties to a statewide system.  Finally the legislature increased statewide funding for the schools, and established the policy of at least one high school in every county; by 1911 half the counties operated public high schools for whites. Compulsory education was opposed by working-class families who wanted their children to earn money, and who distrusted the schooling the middle class was so insistent upon. But it finally passed in 1915; it was enforced for whites only and did not apply to farms. By 1910 Alabama still lagged with 62 percent of its children in school, compared to a national average of 71 percent.\n\nThe progressives worked hard to upgrade the hospital and public health system, with provisions to require the registration of births and deaths to provide the information needed. When the Rockefeller Foundation identified the hookworm as a critical element in draining energy out of Southern workers, Alabama discovered hookworm cases in every county, with rates as high as 60 percent. The progressive genius for organization and devotion to the public good was least controversial in the public health area and probably most successful there.<ref>Rogers et al. ''Alabama''pp 362\u201367</ref>  Prohibition was a favorite reform for Protestant churches across this entire country, and from the 1870s to the 1920s, Alabama passed a series of more restrictive laws that were demanded by the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) and other reform elements.<ref>Rogers et al.

[[Emmet O'Neal]], elected governor in 1910, made the commission system his favored reform, and secured its passage by the legislature in 1911. The cities of Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile quickly adopted the commission form<ref>Allen W.

Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy.  Chemical and structural constraints limited the quality of steel produced from Alabama's iron and coal. These materials did, however, combine to make ideal foundry iron. Because of low transportation and labor costs, Birmingham quickly became the largest and cheapest foundry iron-producing area. By 1915, twenty-five percent of the nation's foundry pig iron was produced in Birmingham.<ref>Ethel Armes and James R.

The rural-dominated legislature refused to redistrict state House and Senate seats from 1901 to the 1960s. In addition, the state legislature had a senate based on one for each county. The state legislative delegations controlled counties. This led to a stranglehold on the state by a white rural minority. The contemporary interests of urbanizing, industrial cities and tens of thousands of citizens were not adequately represented in the government.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary, accessed 10 Mar 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |date=2007-10-17 }}</ref> One result was that Jefferson County, home of Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state. It received back only 1/67th of the tax money, as the state legislature ensured taxes were distributed equally to each county regardless of population.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1940, tens of thousands of African Americans migrated out of Alabama in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to seek jobs, education for their children, and freedom from [[lynching]] in northern and midwestern cities, such as [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], and [[Cleveland]]. These cities had many industrial jobs, but the migrants also had to compete with new waves of European immigrants. The rate of population growth in Alabama dropped from 20.8% in 1900 and 16.9% in 1910, to 9.8% in 1920, reflecting the impact of the outmigration. Formal disenfranchisement was ended only after the mid-1960s after African Americans led the Civil Rights Movement and gaining Federal legislation to protect their voting and civil rights. But the state devised new ways to reduce their political power. By that time, African Americans comprised a smaller minority than at the turn of the century, and a majority in certain rural counties.\n\nA rapid pace of change across the country, especially in growing cities, combined with new waves of immigration and migration of rural whites and blacks to cities, all contributed to a volatile social environment and the rise of a second [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) in the South and Midwest after 1915. In many areas it represented itself as a fraternal group to give aid to a community. Feldman (1999) has shown that the second KKK was not a mere hate group; it showed a genuine desire for political and social reform on behalf of poor whites. For example, Alabama Klansmen such as [[Hugo Black]] were among the foremost advocates of better public schools, effective Prohibition enforcement, expanded road construction, and other \"progressive\" measures to benefit poor whites. By 1925, the Klan was a powerful political force in the state, as urban politicians such as [[J. Thomas Heflin]], [[David Bibb Graves]], and [[Hugo Black]] manipulated the KKK membership against the power of the \"Big Mule\" industrialists and especially the Black Belt planters who had long dominated the state.<ref>Feldman (1999)</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Democrat [[Bibb Graves]], a former chapter head, won the governor's office with KKK members' support. He led one of the most progressive administrations in the state's history, pushing for increased education funding, better public health, new highway construction, and pro-labor legislation. At the same time, KKK vigilantes---thinking they enjoyed governmental protection\u2014launched a wave of physical terror across Alabama in 1927, targeting both blacks and whites. The Republicans responded: The major newspapers kept up a steady, loud attack on the Klan as violent and unAmerican. Sheriffs cracked down on Klan violence, and a national scandal among Klan leaders in the 1920s turned many members away.  The state voted for Democrat [[Al Smith]] in 1928, although he was Roman Catholic (a target of the KKK), and the Klan's official membership plunged to under six thousand by 1930.\n\n==Civil Rights Movement and redistricting, 1945-1975==\n{{CRM in Alabama|state=uncollapsed}}\nEconomically, the major force in Alabama was the mechanization and consolidation of agriculture. Mechanical cotton pickers became available in the postwar era, reducing the need for many agricultural workers. They tended to move into the region's urban areas. Still, by 1963, only about a third of the state's cotton was picked by machine.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flynt|first1=Wayne|title=Poor But Proud|date=February 5, 2016|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=6913}}</ref> Diversification from cotton into soybeans, poultry and dairy products also drove more poor people off the land.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flynt|first1=Wayne|title=Poor But Proud|date=February 5, 2016|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=6973}}</ref> In the state's thirty-five Appalachian counties, twenty-one lost population between 1950 and 1960.

The [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] from 1955 to 1956 was one of the most significant African-American protests against the policy of racial segregation in the state. Although constituting a majority of bus passengers, African Americans were discriminated against in seating policy. The protest nearly brought the city bus system to bankruptcy and changes were negotiated. The legal challenge was settled in ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' (1956), a case in which the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]] found the segregation policy to be unconstitutional under Fourteenth Amendment provisions for equal treatment; it ordered that public transit in Alabama be desegregated.\n\nThe rural white minority's hold on the legislature continued, however, suppressing attempts by more progressive elements to modernize the state. A study in 1960 concluded that because of rural domination, \"A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> Given the legislature's control of the county governments, the rural interests had even more power. Legislators and others filed suit in the 1960s to secure redistricting and reapportionment. It took years and Federal court intervention to achieve the redistricting necessary to establishing \"[[one man, one vote]]\" representation, as a result of ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962) and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964). The court ruled that, in addition to the states having to redistrict to reflect decennial censuses in congressional districts, both houses of state governments had to be based on representation by population districts, rather than by geographic county as the state senate had been, as the senate's make-up prevented equal representation. These court decisions caused redistricting in many northern and western states as well as the South, where often rural interests had long dominated state legislatures and prevented reform.\n\nIn 1960 on the eve of important civil rights battles, 30% of Alabama's population was African American or 980,000.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1960 US Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=2007-08-23 }}, accessed 13 Mar 2008</ref>\n\nAs Birmingham was the center of industry and population in Alabama, in 1963 civil rights leaders chose to mount a campaign there for desegregation. Schools, restaurants and department stores were segregated; no African Americans were hired to work in the stores where they shopped or in the city government supported in part by their taxes. There were no African-American members of the police force. Despite segregation, African Americans had been advancing economically. But from 1947 to 1965, Birmingham suffered \"about 50 racially motivated bomb attacks.\"<ref name=\"bombings\"/> Independent groups affiliated with the [[KKK]] bombed transitional residential neighborhoods to discourage blacks' moving into them; in 19 cases, they bombed black churches with congregations active in civil rights, and the homes of their ministers.<ref name=\"bombings\">[http://www.al.com/specialreport/?bombing/97-min.html CHANDA TEMPLE and JEFF HANSEN, \"Ministers' homes, churches among bomb targets\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701091931/http://www.al.com/specialreport/?bombing%2F97-min.html |date=2015-07-01 }}, AL.com, 16 July 2000, accessed 3 February 2015</ref>)\n\nTo help with the campaign and secure national attention, the Rev. [[Fred Shuttlesworth]] invited members of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) to Birmingham to help change its leadership's policies. Non-violent action had produced good results in some other cities. The Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], Rev. [[Wyatt Tee Walker]], his executive director; and other leaders came to Birmingham to help.\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1963, national attention became riveted on Birmingham. The media covered the series of peaceful marches that the Birmingham police, headed by Police Commissioner [[Bull Connor]], attempted to divert and control. He invited high school students to join the marches, as King intended to fill the jails with nonviolent protesters to make a moral argument to the United States. Dramatic images of Birmingham police using police dogs and powerful streams of water against children protesters filled newspapers and television coverage, arousing national outrage. The [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] during a Sunday service, which killed four African-American girls, caused a national outcry and gained support for the civil rights cause in the state. [[16th Street Baptist Church]] had been a rallying point and staging area for civil rights activities in Birmingham prior to the bombing. Finally, Birmingham leaders King and Shuttlesworth agreed to end the marches when the businessmen's group committed to end segregation in stores and public facilities.\n\nBefore his November, 1963 assassination, President [[John F. Kennedy]] had supported civil rights legislation. In 1964 President [[Lyndon Johnson]] helped secure its passage and signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]]. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] in 1965 attracted national and international press and TV coverage. The nation was horrified to see peaceful protesters beaten as they entered the county. That year, Johnson helped achieve passage of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] to gain federal oversight and enforcement to ensure the ability of all citizens to vote.\n\nCourt challenges related to \"[[one man, one vote]]\" and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 finally provided the groundwork for federal court rulings. In 1972, the federal court required the legislature to create a statewide redistricting plan in order to correct the imbalances in representation in the legislature related to population patterns.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> Redistricting, together with federal oversight of voter registration and election practices, enabled hundreds of thousands of Alabama citizens, both white and black, to vote and participate for the first time in the political system.\n\n==1975-2000==\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Twenty-first century, 2000-present==\nIn 2015, state budget reductions of $83 million resulted in the closing of five parks per [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] ($3 million). In addition, the state cut services at driver's license offices, closing most in several black-majority counties. This made voter registration more difficult, as the offices had offered both services.<ref>Mike Cason [http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/state_announces_to_close_becau.html#incart_river_home State to close 5 parks, cut back services at driver license offices] Alabama Media Group, September 30, 2015.</ref> As of 2018, the state of Alabama offers online voter registration.\n\nAlabama has a dynamic economy that has seen the automotive industry open large manufacturing plants from Mercedes-Benz in Tuscaloosa County to Hyundai Motors in Montgomery County. Aerospace giant, Airbus, has a large manufacturing facility in Mobile County.\n\nHuntsville, in north Alabama's Tennessee River Valley, is the fastest growing metropolitan region of Alabama, that is home to one of the per capita most educated regions in the United States. Huntsville is home to NASA's rocket center and space camp.

After the ANZ Championship ended in 2016, the Mystics joined five other teams in the new ANZ Premiership\n\nHome games in the ANZ Premiership are usually played at [[Trusts Stadium]] in Waitakere, although some matches are played at the [[North Shore Events Centre]] and [[Vector Arena]]. The team uniform is primarily blue \u2013 consistent with traditional Auckland sporting colours \u2013 in addition to red and white. In 2018 the Mystics are coached by [[Helene Wilson]] and captained by veteran Silver Ferns defender [[Anna Harrison (netball player)|Anna Harrison]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Background===\nThe ANZ Championship was founded in 2007 as the new elite domestic netball competition in New Zealand and Australia. It replaced the [[National Bank Cup]] in New Zealand and the [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]] in Australia, which both played their final season in 2007. When the new trans-Tasman competition was announced, the competition was reported to feature five teams from each country. For the new competition, five New Zealand franchises were formed from amalgamations of National Bank Cup teams. A franchise based in Auckland was proposed early in the selection process.<ref name=NZH-Bull>{{cite news |last=Bull |first=Alastair |title=Ten-team trans-Tasman netball league revealed | newspaper =The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/4/story.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10428433 |date= 2007-03-12 |accessdate=2008-04-03}}</ref> The five New Zealand franchises were finalised and approved in May 2007, including one representing the northern regions of Northland and Auckland, formed as an amalgamation of the [[Northern Force]] and [[Auckland Diamonds]] from the National Bank Cup.<ref name=NZH-NZPA>{{cite news |author=NZPA |title=Nod to all five Tasman Trophy bids |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/4/story.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10438609 |date=2007-05-09 |accessdate = 2008-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe new northern franchise started interviewing coaches in August 2007 for the inaugural season in 2008.<ref name=stuff-marshall>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Jane |title=Hands-off pact by new franchises |newspaper=The Press |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/thepress/4164734a6429.html |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> As of September 2007, [[Yvonne Willering]], who had previously coached the Northern Force, had been confirmed as the coach for the new northern franchise.<ref name=stuff-marshall2>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Jane |title=Second tier players can star |newspaper=The Press |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/thepress/4210322a6429.html |date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> The name of the franchise had been confirmed by December that year as the \"Northern Mystics\"; the team signed [[LG Electronics]] as its naming sponsor, officially becoming the LG Northern Mystics.<ref name=LG>{{cite press release |title=Get ready for the something mystical from the North |publisher=LG Electronics |url=http://nz.lge.com/about/press.do?action=read&group_code=AB&list_code=PRE_MENU&webBbsId=30059&page=2&target=pressreleases_read.jsp |date=2007-12-07 |accessdate=2009-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===2008: Inaugural season===\nPlayer selection for New Zealand franchises was delayed due to ongoing negotiations between the New Zealand Players Association and [[Netball New Zealand]].<ref name=NZC-NZB>{{cite news |author=NZ City, NewstalkZB |title=Waiting game continues for Tasman comp |publisher=NZ City |url=http://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/article.aspx?id=79517&fm=newsmain,nrhl |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> The dispute over import players was a particular problem for the Mystics, since both the Northern Force and Auckland Diamonds had considerable numbers of Pacific Islander players.<ref name=Press-Marshall-dec>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Jane |title=Vagana slams import rule |newspaper=The Press |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/thepress/4321754a6429.html |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> The negotiations were settled on 22 December, allowing New Zealand franchises to start formally signing players.<ref name=NNZ-scoop>{{cite press release |title=Netball Agreement Finalised For ANZ Championship |publisher=Netball New Zealand |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0712/S00289.htm |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>\n\nMost of the Northern Mystics team for the 2008 season had been confirmed by the start of February,<ref name=NZB>{{cite news |title=Decision expected Monday on final Mystics player |publisher=NewstalkZB |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=131581 |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2009-02-26 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> with the exception of Vilimaina Davu, who as a [[Silver Ferns]]-ineligible player had to be approved by Netball New Zealand.

The Mystics gained Silver Ferns stalwarts [[Maria Tutaia]] and [[Joline Henry]] from the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic, as well as [[Althea Byfield]] (Jamaican international) from the Central Pulse and Jenny-May Coffin from retirement. The 2010 season was the Mystics' best finish in their short history, finishing at sixth place.

The Mystics were no longer have the worst record against the Australian teams after winning against the Thunderbirds in round 1 and the Fever in round 12. This means the Pulse are officially the New Zealand team with the worst record against the Australian teams.\n\n===2011 season===\nThe coaching staff of the Mystics was changed with head coach Te Aroha Keenan stepping down and last year's assistant coach Debbie Fuller taking over.<ref name=NZH-Fuller/> In addition, Jenny-May Coffin stepped up from her playing role to take the position of assistant coach for the Mystics.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Newstalk ZB |author2=ONE Sport |title=Coffin jumps from player to coach |publisher=TVNZ |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/netball-news/coffin-jumps-player-coach-3709500 |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}</ref> The Mystics have also successfully gained Silver Fern defender [[Anna Harrison (netball player)|Anna Harrison]] (n\u00e9e Scarlett) from volleyball, and in a major coup signed [[Megan Dehn]] after her attempts at gaining New Zealand residency for the [[Southern Steel]] were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news |last=Napier |first=Liam |title=Dehn in, Byfield out |publisher=Sportal.co.nz |url=http://sportal.co.nz/netball-news-display/dehn-in,-byfield-out-98632 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721105243/http://www.sportal.co.nz/netball-news-display/dehn-in,-byfield-out-98632 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-21 |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2010-11-13 }}</ref>\n\nIn rounds five and six, coach Debbie Fuller was due to have a baby. As a result, assistant coach Jenny May Coffin became head coach for the Mystics during that time. After the round-robin matches the Mystics finished in 4th place, qualifying for their first finals series. The Auckland team headed to Sydney to face the New South Wales Swifts in the minor semi-final, defeating the hosts in an upset victory. A second victory against the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic earned the Mystics a place in the 2011 grand final against the Queensland Firebirds in Brisbane. The undefeated Firebirds claimed victory on home soil and their first ANZ Championship, defeating the Mystics by 57\u201344.\n\n===2012 season===\n\n2012 saw few changes to the Mystics line-up. Import [[Megan Dehn]] retired from playing, and joined the coaching staff as a specialist coach for all Trans-Tasman games. She was replaced by English captain [[Jade Clarke]]. Ex [[Canterbury Tactix]] defender [[Charlotte Kight]] was signed to cover the loss of international player, [[Joline Henry]], who left to join the [[Central Pulse]]. 2011 temporary replacement player [[Portia Woodman]] was also signed.\n[[Gail Parata]] joined the franchise as an assistant coach.\n\nAfter an up and down round robin, the Northern Mystics finished second on the table, but lost the major semi final, and the preliminary final, to finish in 3rd position overall. In round 8 they beat the [[Melbourne Vixens]] to pick up just their third win on Australian soil. During that game they unveiled the infamous [[Harrison Hoist]].\n\n===2013 season===\n\nThe Mystics made several changes to the roster for the 2013 season, most notable being the signing of ex [[Silver Ferns]] coach, [[Ruth Aitken]], and Australian defender [[Julie Corletto]].<ref>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/7513232/Julie-Corletto-set-to-join-Northern-Mystics</ref> Corletto made to move to be closer to her husband [[Daryl Corletto]], who plays for the [[NZ Breakers]]. The Mystics have lost the services of captain [[Temepara George]] to retirement, and [[Jade Clarke]], as well as Auckland veteran [[Rachel Rasmussen]] to the [[Southern Steel]]. Several young development players have been signed in their place.\n\n===2014 season===\n\nThe Mystics made some quite successful changes to their 2013 lineup with the club signing form [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]] captain and current [[Silver Ferns]] vice-captain [[Laura Langman]] to the center court. From the [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]] they also signed [[Nadia Loveday]] and [[Jodi Tod-Elliot]].

The club was formed in 2007 as an amalgamation of two teams from the [[National Bank Cup]] \u2013 the [[Northern Force]] and the [[Auckland Diamonds]] \u2013 after the competition was retired that year. In 2008, the Mystics joined four other New Zealand franchises in the new ANZ Championship, representing the New Zealand regions of [[Northland Region|Northland]] and [[Auckland Region|Auckland]]. After the ANZ Championship ended in 2016, the Mystics joined five other teams in the new ANZ Premiership\n\nHome games in the ANZ Premiership are usually played at [[Trusts Stadium]] in Waitakere, although some matches are played at the [[North Shore Events Centre]] and [[Vector Arena]]. The team uniform is primarily blue \u2013 consistent with traditional Auckland sporting colours \u2013 in addition to red and white. In 2018 the Mystics are coached by [[Helene Wilson]] and captained by veteran Silver Ferns defender [[Anna Harrison (netball player)|Anna Harrison]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Background===\nThe ANZ Championship was founded in 2007 as the new elite domestic netball competition in New Zealand and Australia. It replaced the [[National Bank Cup]] in New Zealand and the [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]] in Australia, which both played their final season in 2007. When the new trans-Tasman competition was announced, the competition was reported to feature five teams from each country. For the new competition, five New Zealand franchises were formed from amalgamations of National Bank Cup teams. A franchise based in Auckland was proposed early in the selection process.<ref name=NZH-Bull>{{cite news |last=Bull |first=Alastair |title=Ten-team trans-Tasman netball league revealed | newspaper =The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/4/story.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10428433 |date= 2007-03-12 |accessdate=2008-04-03}}</ref> The five New Zealand franchises were finalised and approved in May 2007, including one representing the northern regions of Northland and Auckland, formed as an amalgamation of the [[Northern Force]] and [[Auckland Diamonds]] from the National Bank Cup.<ref name=NZH-NZPA>{{cite news |author=NZPA |title=Nod to all five Tasman Trophy bids |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/4/story.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10438609 |date=2007-05-09 |accessdate = 2008-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe new northern franchise started interviewing coaches in August 2007 for the inaugural season in 2008.<ref name=stuff-marshall>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Jane |title=Hands-off pact by new franchises |newspaper=The Press |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/thepress/4164734a6429.html |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> As of September 2007, [[Yvonne Willering]], who had previously coached the Northern Force, had been confirmed as the coach for the new northern franchise.<ref name=stuff-marshall2>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Jane |title=Second tier players can star |newspaper=The Press |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/thepress/4210322a6429.html |date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> The name of the franchise had been confirmed by December that year as the \"Northern Mystics\"; the team signed [[LG Electronics]] as its naming sponsor, officially becoming the LG Northern Mystics.<ref name=LG>{{cite press release |title=Get ready for the something mystical from the North |publisher=LG Electronics |url=http://nz.lge.com/about/press.do?action=read&group_code=AB&list_code=PRE_MENU&webBbsId=30059&page=2&target=pressreleases_read.jsp |date=2007-12-07 |accessdate=2009-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===2008: Inaugural season===\nPlayer selection for New Zealand franchises was delayed due to ongoing negotiations between the New Zealand Players Association and [[Netball New Zealand]].<ref name=NZC-NZB>{{cite news |author=NZ City, NewstalkZB |title=Waiting game continues for Tasman comp |publisher=NZ City |url=http://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/article.aspx?id=79517&fm=newsmain,nrhl |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> The dispute over import players was a particular problem for the Mystics, since both the Northern Force and Auckland Diamonds had considerable numbers of Pacific Islander players.<ref name=Press-Marshall-dec>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Jane |title=Vagana slams import rule |newspaper=The Press |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/thepress/4321754a6429.html |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> The negotiations were settled on 22 December, allowing New Zealand franchises to start formally signing players.<ref name=NNZ-scoop>{{cite press release |title=Netball Agreement Finalised For ANZ Championship |publisher=Netball New Zealand |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0712/S00289.htm |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>\n\nMost of the Northern Mystics team for the 2008 season had been confirmed by the start of February,<ref name=NZB>{{cite news |title=Decision expected Monday on final Mystics player |publisher=NewstalkZB |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=131581 |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2009-02-26 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> with the exception of Vilimaina Davu, who as a [[Silver Ferns]]-ineligible player had to be approved by Netball New Zealand.

The Mystics gained Silver Ferns stalwarts [[Maria Tutaia]] and [[Joline Henry]] from the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic, as well as [[Althea Byfield]] (Jamaican international) from the Central Pulse and Jenny-May Coffin from retirement. The 2010 season was the Mystics' best finish in their short history, finishing at sixth place.

The Mystics were no longer have the worst record against the Australian teams after winning against the Thunderbirds in round 1 and the Fever in round 12. This means the Pulse are officially the New Zealand team with the worst record against the Australian teams.\n\n===2011 season===\nThe coaching staff of the Mystics was changed with head coach Te Aroha Keenan stepping down and last year's assistant coach Debbie Fuller taking over.<ref name=NZH-Fuller/> In addition, Jenny-May Coffin stepped up from her playing role to take the position of assistant coach for the Mystics.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Newstalk ZB |author2=ONE Sport |title=Coffin jumps from player to coach |publisher=TVNZ |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/netball-news/coffin-jumps-player-coach-3709500 |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}</ref> The Mystics have also successfully gained Silver Fern defender [[Anna Harrison (netball player)|Anna Harrison]] (n\u00e9e Scarlett) from volleyball, and in a major coup signed [[Megan Dehn]] after her attempts at gaining New Zealand residency for the [[Southern Steel]] were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news |last=Napier |first=Liam |title=Dehn in, Byfield out |publisher=Sportal.co.nz |url=http://sportal.co.nz/netball-news-display/dehn-in,-byfield-out-98632 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721105243/http://www.sportal.co.nz/netball-news-display/dehn-in,-byfield-out-98632 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-21 |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2010-11-13 }}</ref>\n\nIn rounds five and six, coach Debbie Fuller was due to have a baby. As a result, assistant coach Jenny May Coffin became head coach for the Mystics during that time. After the round-robin matches the Mystics finished in 4th place, qualifying for their first finals series. The Auckland team headed to Sydney to face the New South Wales Swifts in the minor semi-final, defeating the hosts in an upset victory. A second victory against the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic earned the Mystics a place in the 2011 grand final against the Queensland Firebirds in Brisbane. The undefeated Firebirds claimed victory on home soil and their first ANZ Championship, defeating the Mystics by 57\u201344.\n\n===2012 season===\n\n2012 saw few changes to the Mystics line-up. Import [[Megan Dehn]] retired from playing, and joined the coaching staff as a specialist coach for all Trans-Tasman games. She was replaced by English captain [[Jade Clarke]]. Ex [[Canterbury Tactix]] defender [[Charlotte Kight]] was signed to cover the loss of international player, [[Joline Henry]], who left to join the [[Central Pulse]]. 2011 temporary replacement player [[Portia Woodman]] was also signed.\n[[Gail Parata]] joined the franchise as an assistant coach.\n\nAfter an up and down round robin, the Northern Mystics finished second on the table, but lost the major semi final, and the preliminary final, to finish in 3rd position overall. In round 8 they beat the [[Melbourne Vixens]] to pick up just their third win on Australian soil. During that game they unveiled the infamous [[Harrison Hoist]].\n\n===2013 season===\n\nThe Mystics made several changes to the roster for the 2013 season, most notable being the signing of ex [[Silver Ferns]] coach, [[Ruth Aitken]], and Australian defender [[Julie Corletto]].<ref>http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/7513232/Julie-Corletto-set-to-join-Northern-Mystics</ref> Corletto made to move to be closer to her husband [[Daryl Corletto]], who plays for the [[NZ Breakers]]. The Mystics have lost the services of captain [[Temepara George]] to retirement, and [[Jade Clarke]], as well as Auckland veteran [[Rachel Rasmussen]] to the [[Southern Steel]]. Several young development players have been signed in their place.\n\n===2014 season===\n\nThe Mystics made some quite successful changes to their 2013 lineup with the club signing form [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]] captain and current [[Silver Ferns]] vice-captain [[Laura Langman]] to the center court. From the [[Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic]] they also signed [[Nadia Loveday]] and [[Jodi Tod-Elliot]].

For economic reasons, it closed bureaus in [[Austin]], [[Miami]], and [[Chicago]] in 2006.<ref name=\"variety\" /><ref name=\"twp\" />\n\n==History==\nThe concept for ''People'' has been attributed to [[Andrew Heiskell]], Time Inc.'s chief executive officer at the time and the former publisher of the weekly [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine. The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm \"Grad Named Head of ''People en Espa\u00f1ol''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103091825/http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm |date=January 3, 2005 }}.

Due to its success, the frequency of ''People Stylewatch'' was increased to 10 times per year in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In spring 2017, People Stylewatch was rebranded as PeopleStyle.

The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm \"Grad Named Head of ''People en Espa\u00f1ol''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103091825/http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm |date=January 3, 2005 }}.

Due to its success, the frequency of ''People Stylewatch'' was increased to 10 times per year in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In spring 2017, People Stylewatch was rebranded as PeopleStyle.
