When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

distancing) includes [[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

It appeared as the fifth track of their third and final album, ''[[In Utero (album)|''In Utero'']]'', released in September 1993. The song title is a reference to the famous [[Seattle]] actress [[Frances Farmer]].  \n\n==Origin and recording==\n\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle\" was written in 1992 and first played in [[Dave Grohl]]'s basement. According to Grohl, he said \" \u201cWhen I heard \u2018Frances Farmer,\u2019 I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, there\u2019s going to be another record.\u201d<ref>{{cite news |last1=Beinstock |first1=Richard |title=No Apologies: All 102 Nirvana Songs Ranked |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/no-apologies-all-102-nirvana-songs-ranked-175683/frances-farmer-will-have-her-revenge-on-seattle-36275/ |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |work=Rolling Stone|date=8 April 2015}}</ref> It was first recorded in 1992 in two studio sessions. The first being at Seattle's Laundry Room studios in April of 1992 and the other at Seattle's Word of Mouth studios from October 25-26, 1992. Both versions of the recording were instrumental due to a lack of musical planning for the group. It was later re-recorded during their February 1993 sessions at Pachyderm Studios, Cannon Falls for their final album ''In Utero''.<ref name=\"LiveNirvana\">{{cite web |url=https://www.livenirvana.com/songguide/frances-farmer-will-have-her-revenge-on-seattle.html|title=Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\n|website=livenirvana.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe song title is a reference to [[Frances Farmer]], an actress from Seattle who was attacked by the press because of her political views and non-religious beliefs. Because of all the stress from the press, she became addicted to alcohol and drugs and was arrested multiple times. She was later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and depression in 1944 and was sent to a psychiatric hospital by her mother. Her mother and unforgiving judges continued to put Farmer in mental hospitals and institutions. Farmer claimed that she was raped almost every time she was confined. She was later diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]] due to her excessive smoking and died in 1970 at the age of 56.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crisafulli |first1=Chuck|title=Teen spirit : the stories behind every Nirvana song|date=1996|publisher=Omnibus|page=90}}</ref>\n\nCobain often compared himself to Farmer. In an interview with Micheal Azerrad, Cobain states \u201cI guess that\u2019s my way of letting the world know that bureaucracy is everywhere and it can happen to anybody and it\u2019s a really evil thing, the story of Frances Farmer is so sad and it can happen to anybody and it almost felt at a time that it was happening to us.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1= G.

It appeared as the fifth track of their third and final album, ''[[In Utero (album)|''In Utero'']]'', released in September 1993. The song title is a reference to the famous[[Seattle]] actress [[Frances Farmer]].  \n\n==Origin and recording==\n\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle\" was written in 1992 and first played in [[Dave Grohl]]'s basement. According to Grohl, he said \" \u201cWhen I heard \u2018Frances Farmer,\u2019 I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, there\u2019s going to be another record.\u201d<ref>{{cite news |last1=Beinstock |first1=Richard |title=No Apologies: All 102 Nirvana Songs Ranked |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/no-apologies-all-102-nirvana-songs-ranked-175683/frances-farmer-will-have-her-revenge-on-seattle-36275/ |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |work=Rolling Stone|date=8 April 2015}}</ref> It was first recorded in 1992 in two studio sessions. The first being at Seattle's Laundry Room studios in April of 1992 and the other at Seattle's Word of Mouth studios from October 25-26, 1992. Both versions of the recording were instrumental due to a lack of musical planning for the group. It was later re-recorded during their February 1993 sessions at Pachyderm Studios, Cannon Falls for their final album ''In Utero''.<ref name=\"LiveNirvana\">{{cite web |url=https://www.livenirvana.com/songguide/frances-farmer-will-have-her-revenge-on-seattle.html|title=Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\n|website=livenirvana.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe song title is a reference to [[Frances Farmer]], an actress from Seattle who was attacked by the press because of her political views and non-religious beliefs. Because of all the stress from the press, she became addicted to alcohol and drugs and was arrested multiple times. She was later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and depression in 1944 and was sent to a psychiatric hospital by her mother. Her mother and unforgiving judges continued to put Farmer in mental hospitals and institutions. Farmer claimed that she was raped almost every time she was confined. She was later diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]] due to her excessive smoking and died in 1970 at the age of 56.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crisafulli |first1=Chuck|title=Teen spirit : the stories behind every Nirvana song|date=1996|publisher=Omnibus|page=90}}</ref>\n\nCobain often compared himself to Farmer. In an interview with Micheal Azerrad, Cobain states \u201cI guess that\u2019s my way of letting the world know that bureaucracy is everywhere and it can happen to anybody and it\u2019s a really evil thing, the story of Frances Farmer is so sad and it can happen to anybody and it almost felt at a time that it was happening to us.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1= G.

Newcastle marched out of York on 6 December, and split his force of 6,000 into two; he took 4,000 infantry down the main York\u2013Tadcaster road to attack the town from the east, while sending a deputy, the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]], with a further 1,500 to circle around and trap the Parliamentarians by attacking from the north-west.\n\nNewcastle's infantry engaged the town on the morning of 7 December, but after some initial minor incursions, the battle settled into an exchange of [[musket]] fire. Newport's detachment never joined the battle. Fairfax was nevertheless forced to retreat overnight, as he was running short of gunpowder, and Newcastle occupied the town the following day. He subsequently garrisoned a number of nearby towns, and cut Fairfax off from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].\n\n==Background==\nIn December 1642, the [[First English Civil War]] had been running for four months, since [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had raised his banner in Nottingham and declared the Earl of Essex, and by extension [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], traitors.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|p=344\u2013348}}\n\n===State of the war in Yorkshire===\nEven before the formal start of the war, [[Yorkshire]] became a key area in the conflict. After King Charles I attempted to [[Five Members|arrest five members of parliament]] in January 1642, members of the [[gentry]] started openly taking sides and preparing for battle. [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]] seized [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]] for parliament the same month, and after fleeing London, the King established himself at [[York]] in March. The King twice attempted to take Hull in 1642 without success. Although Charles subsequently returned south, his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] (formally known as Queen Mary) had travelled to the [[Low Countries]] to acquire weapons and the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] was charged with ensuring her safe travel through the northeast when she returned.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=128\u2013133}} On the other side, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax]], was appointed as the commander of parliament's forces in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite odnb |id=9081 |title=Fairfax, Ferdinando, second Lord Fairfax of Cameron |last=Hopper |first=Andrew J. |year=2008 |origyear=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nIn response to requests from Yorkshire Royalists, Newcastle advanced into Yorkshire with around 8,000 men, defeating the Parliamentarians at the [[Battle of Piercebridge]], and established himself in [[York]] on 3 December.{{sfn|Hulse|2011}} Lord Fairfax had himself been leading a Parliamentarian army towards York, but when he received news of the Royalist victory at Piercebridge he stopped at [[Tadcaster]], around {{convert|10|miles}} south-west of York. Newcastle's advance had split the Parliamentarian forces, and shifted the balance of power in the county. He soon took the opportunity to march on Tadcaster and attempt to [[Defeat in detail|defeat the Parliamentarians in detail]].{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=133}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:William Cavendish, First Duke of Newcastle.jpg|thumb|right|The [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] led the Royalist force which captured Tadcaster.]]\nOn 7 December,{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=524}} Newcastle approached Tadcaster with two forces totalling around 6,000; he commanded the larger one himself, heading directly down the road from York to attack Tadcaster from the east. At the same time, he sent the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]] with 1,500 men to circle around through [[Wetherby]] and attack Fairfax from the north-west. In the mean time, Fairfax had been preparing Tadcaster's defences: he built a [[redoubt]] atop a hill by the [[River Wharfe]] overlooking the York road, and drew in additional troops, gathering between 900 and 1,500 soldiers in the town.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=524}} In the face of the large Royalist army, Fairfax and his commanders held a [[council of war]], and decided to withdraw from the town. However, by the time they had gathered their men to leave, fighting had broken out on the edge of town. The Royalist infantry was attacking the east side of town, still defended by the Parliamentarian rearguard. The attack meant that retreat was no longer possible, and Fairfax sent his men back to join the town's defence.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\nThe initial Royalist attack was thwarted, but more of Newcastle's infantry managed to break into the town and capture a house near the redoubt, isolating it from the bulk of the defensive garrison. A Parliamentarian counter-attack reclaimed the house, drove the Royalists back out of town, and set fire to some of the houses on the edge of the town to prevent the attackers occupying them. Both sides settled into their positions, and exchanged [[musket]] fire for the rest of the day. The planned second prong of Newcastle's attack, under Newport's command, never arrived. The historian David Cooke suggests that it was most likely due to his artillery slowing him down on the poor winter roads. The 18th-century historian [[Francis Drake (antiquary)|Francis Drake]] claimed that one of the Parliamentarian officers, [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]], forged a letter to Newport, purporting to be from Newcastle, ordering him to halt.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\nThe Parliamentarians, despite holding a defensible position, were running short of gunpowder, and decided to withdraw from the town overnight.

Newcastle marched out of York on 6 December, and split his force of 6,000 into two; he took 4,000 infantry down the main York\u2013Tadcaster road to attack the town from the east, while sending a deputy, the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]], with a further 1,500 to circle around and trap the Parliamentarians by attacking from the north-west.\n\nNewcastle's infantry engaged the town on the morning of 7 December, but after some initial minor incursions, the battle settled into an exchange of [[musket]] fire. Newport's detachment never joined the battle. Fairfax was nevertheless forced to retreat overnight, as he was running short of gunpowder, and Newcastle occupied the town the following day. He subsequently garrisoned a number of nearby towns, and cut Fairfax off from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].\n\n==Background==\nIn December 1642, the [[First English Civil War]] had been running for four months, since [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had raised his banner in Nottingham and declared the Earl of Essex, and by extension [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], traitors.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|p=344\u2013348}}\n\n===State of the war in Yorkshire===\nEven before the formal start of the war, [[Yorkshire]] became a key area in the conflict. After King Charles I attempted to [[Five Members|arrest five members of parliament]] in January 1642, members of the [[gentry]] started openly taking sides and preparing for battle. [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]] seized [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]] for parliament the same month, and after fleeing London, the King established himself at [[York]] in March. The King twice attempted to take Hull in 1642 without success. Although Charles subsequently returned south, his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] (formally known as Queen Mary) had travelled to the [[Low Countries]] to acquire weapons and the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] was charged with ensuring her safe travel through the northeast when she returned.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=128\u2013133}} On the other side, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax]], was appointed as the commander of parliament's forces in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite odnb |id=9081 |title=Fairfax, Ferdinando, second Lord Fairfax of Cameron |last=Hopper |first=Andrew J. |year=2008 |origyear=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nIn response to requests from Yorkshire Royalists, Newcastle advanced into Yorkshire with around 8,000 men, defeating the Parliamentarians at the [[Battle of Piercebridge]], and established himself in [[York]] on 3 December.{{sfn|Hulse|2011}} Lord Fairfax had himself been leading a Parliamentarian army towards York, but when he received news of the Royalist victory at Piercebridge he stopped at [[Tadcaster]], around {{convert|10|miles}} south-west of York. Newcastle's advance had split the Parliamentarian forces, and shifted the balance of power in the county. He soon took the opportunity to march on Tadcaster and attempt to [[Defeat in detail|defeat the Parliamentarians in detail]].{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=133}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:William Cavendish, First Duke of Newcastle.jpg|thumb|right|The [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] led the Royalist force which captured Tadcaster.]]\nOn 6 December,{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=524}} Newcastle approached Tadcaster with two forces totalling around 6,000; he commanded the larger one himself, heading directly down the road from York to attack Tadcaster from the east. At the same time, he sent the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]] with 1,500 men to circle around through [[Wetherby]] and attack Fairfax from the north-west. In the mean time, Fairfax had been preparing Tadcaster's defences: he built a [[redoubt]] atop a hill by the [[River Wharfe]] overlooking the York road, and drew in additional troops, gathering between 900 and 1,500 soldiers in the town.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=524}} In the face of the large Royalist army, Fairfax and his commanders held a [[council of war]], and decided to withdraw from the town. However, by the time they had gathered their men to leave, fighting had broken out on the edge of town. The Royalist infantry was attacking the east side of town, still defended by the Parliamentarian rearguard. The attack meant that retreat was no longer possible, and Fairfax sent his men back to join the town's defence.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\nThe initial Royalist attack was thwarted, but more of Newcastle's infantry managed to break into the town and capture a house near the redoubt, isolating it from the bulk of the defensive garrison. A Parliamentarian counter-attack reclaimed the house, drove the Royalists back out of town, and set fire to some of the houses on the edge of the town to prevent the attackers occupying them. Both sides settled into their positions, and exchanged [[musket]] fire for the rest of the day. The planned second prong of Newcastle's attack, under Newport's command, never arrived. The historian David Cooke suggests that it was most likely due to his artillery slowing him down on the poor winter roads. The 18th-century historian [[Francis Drake (antiquary)|Francis Drake]] claimed that one of the Parliamentarian officers, [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]], forged a letter to Newport, purporting to be from Newcastle, ordering him to halt.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\nThe Parliamentarians, despite holding a defensible position, were running short of gunpowder, and decided to withdraw from the town overnight. They split their force; Fairfax took his men to [[Selby]], and Hotham to [[Cawood]].{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the town had been vacated by the Parliamentarians, Newcastle advanced his forces into it on the morning of 8 December, subsequently garrisoning [[Pontefract Castle]] and a number of other towns in the area, cutting Fairfax off from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}} He sent [[Sir William Savile, 3rd Baronet|Sir William Savile]] with a detachment of 2,000 men to secure the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]] towns of Leeds, [[Wakefield]] and [[Bradford]].{{sfn|Firth|Cavendish|1886|p=32}} Savile took Leeds and Wakefield without a fight, but had to split off a portion of his force to attempt to capture Bradford on 18 December, where he was repelled.{{sfn|Lamplough|2019|p=118}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hNSEAgAAQBAJ |title=The Civil Wars Experienced: Britain and Ireland, 1638\u20131661 |last=Bennett |first=Martyn |year=2005 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London |isbn=0-203-98180-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/artshumanitiesth00edwa |chapter=The English Civil Wars |title=Arts and Humanities Through the Eras |volume=5: The Age of the Baroque and Enlightenment 1600\u20131800 |editor1-last=Bleiberg |editor1-first=Edward |editor2-last=Soergel |editor2-first=Philip |collaboration=true |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |year=2005 |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-787-65697-3 |ref=harv |chapter-url-access=registration }}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Cooke |first=David |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ehvOAwAAQBAJ |title=Battlefield Yorkshire: From the Romans to the English Civil Wars |location=Barnsley |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |year=2006 |isbn=1-84415-424-6}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hl4JAAAAQAAJ |title=The Life of William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle |last1=Firth |first1=C.

When disturbed, it can leave behind a thick blob of black ink as it speeds away by jet propulsion. It is [[nocturnal]] and spends the day semi-buried in soft sediment on the seabed. To submerge itself, it directs a stream of water at the sand to create a funnel-shaped depression, then it settles in the hollow and scoops sand over itself with a pair of arms, just leaving the eyes exposed.<ref name=Cephalopod/> While immobile, it folds its arms under its head.\n\n=== Feeding habits ===\nThe stubby squid has a hardened beak it uses to eat, its mouth is centered on the body and all tentacles connect at this point as well. It has adapted to a carnivorous diet by using a [[raptorial]] style of hunting. The squid will use its specialized eyes to locate the prey and then attack with its tentacles.<ref name=\":2\" /> More than 80% of their diet is shrimps but they also consume small [[crab]]s, [[mysida]], [[fish]] and other [[cephalopod]]s.<ref name=\"WallaWalla\" />\n\n== Reproduction ==\nBreeding takes place in late summer and autumn in deep water. The male will transfer the [[Spermatophore|spermataphores]] (bundles of sperm) into the female's mantle cavity with his hectocotylus, first left arm.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Rossia_pacifica/|title=Rossia pacifica|last=Alejandra Montes|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> The mature male and female die soon after breeding, having lived for about two years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4454580/stubby-squid-rossia-pacifica-spotted-on-sea-floor/|title=Yes, This Adorable Googly-Eyed Stubby Squid Is Real|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> The average female will deposit between twenty-five and fifty eggs in clusters, attaching them to the underside of stones, clams or seaweeds.

Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) researchers reported a sighting of a stubby squid even deeper in the ocean.<ref name=\":1\" /> In [[Puget Sound]] it is seen in winter in regions of sloping muddy sand away from strong currents at less than {{convert|300|m|0|abbr=on}} but moves into deeper water in the summer.<ref name=\"Cephalopod\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/Rpacifica.php|title=''Rossia pacifica'', Stubby squid|author=Anderson, Roland C.|work=The Cephalopod Page|accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> When found in coastal regions it has been typically reported in the sub-tidal zone (16\u2013370 m) and has been found at night swimming at shore in the [[intertidal zone]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://inverts.wallawalla.edu/Mollusca/Cephalopoda/Rossia_pacifica.html|title=Rossia pacifica|website=inverts.wallawalla.edu|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> It has been found to be able to live and survive in highly polluted urban west coast bay areas of the United States.\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe stubby squid usually rests on the seabed and moves around, either by movement of its fins or by expelling a jet of water from its body cavity through a movable funnel just below the head. When disturbed, it can leave behind a thick blob of black ink as it speeds away by jet propulsion. It is [[nocturnal]] and spends the day semi-buried in soft sediment on the seabed. To submerge itself, it directs a stream of water at the sand to create a funnel-shaped depression, then it settles in the hollow and scoops sand over itself with a pair of arms, just leaving the eyes exposed.<ref name=Cephalopod/> While immobile, it folds its arms under its head.\n\n=== Feeding habits ===\nThe stubby squid has a hardened beak it uses to eat, its mouth is centered on the body and all tentacles connect at this point as well. It has adapted to a carnivorous diet by using a raptorial style of hunting. The squid will use its specialized eyes to locate the prey and then attack with its tentacles.<ref name=\":2\" /> More than 80% of their diet is shrimps but they also consume small [[crab]]s, [[mysida]], [[fish]] and other [[cephalopod]]s.<ref name=\"WallaWalla\" />\n\n== Reproduction ==\nBreeding takes place in late summer and autumn in deep water. The male will transfer the [[Spermatophore|spermataphores]] (bundles of sperm) into the female's mantle cavity with his hectocotylus, first left arm.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Rossia_pacifica/|title=Rossia pacifica|last=Alejandra Montes|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> The mature male and female die soon after breeding, having lived for about two years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4454580/stubby-squid-rossia-pacifica-spotted-on-sea-floor/|title=Yes, This Adorable Googly-Eyed Stubby Squid Is Real|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> The average female will deposit between twenty-five and fifty eggs in clusters, attaching them to the underside of stones, clams or seaweeds. The capsules are creamy-white, hard and durable they take four to nine months to hatch and receive no additional care. The egg itself (4\u20135&nbsp;mm in diameter), is contained in a larger capsule (8&nbsp;mm by 15&nbsp;mm).<ref name=\":0\" /> The juveniles that emerge are miniature versions of the adults.<ref name=\"Cephalopod\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3819564}}\n\n[[Category:Bobtail squid]]\n[[Category:Molluscs of North America]]\n[[Category:Molluscs of the Pacific Ocean]]\n[[Category:Molluscs described in 1911]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Samuel Stillman Berry]]\n", "name_user": "Bluemin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFeeding habits:raptorial link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossia_pacifica"}
