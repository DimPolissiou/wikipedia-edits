''IEC'' for ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'' is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ''ASTM'' (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with [[ASTM International]]. ''yyyy'' and ''IS'' are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and, under some circumstances, may be left off the title of a published work.\n\n'''Technical reports'''\n: These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard,<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> such as references and explanations. The naming conventions for these are the same as for standards, except ''TR'' prepended instead of ''IS'' in the report's name.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC TR 17799:2000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management\n* ISO/TR 19033:2000 Technical product documentation \u2014 Metadata for construction documentation\n\n'''Technical and publicly available specifications'''\n: Technical specifications may be produced when \"the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard\". A publicly available specification is usually \"an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organization's technical reports.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation \u2014 Reference designation system \u2014 Part 1: General application rules\n* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles \u2014 Roof load carriers\n\n'''Technical corrigenda'''\n: ISO also sometimes issues \"technical corrigenda\" (where \"corrigenda\" is the plural of [[Erratum|corrigendum]]). These are amendments made to existing standards due to minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or limited-applicability extensions. They are generally issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review.<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/>\n\n'''ISO guides'''\n:These are meta-standards covering \"matters related to international standardization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> They are named using the format ''\"ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title\"''.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities \u2014 General vocabulary\n* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification\n\n===Document copyright===\nISO documents are copyrighted and ISO charges for most copies. It does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although they are useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before they become finalized as standards.

In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS), if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.<ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\nThe first step\u2014a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g.,&nbsp;SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] \u2013 ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g.,&nbsp;MPEG) usually make open request for proposals\u2014known as a \"call for proposals\". The first document that is produced, for example, for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model&nbsp;(VM) (previously also called a \"simulation and test model\"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft&nbsp;(WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard, but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes a committee draft&nbsp;(CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.\n\nThe committee draft becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes exceeds the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When consensus is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). Then the text is submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard&nbsp;(FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and if not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard&nbsp;(IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO central secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard.<ref name=\"about-mpeg\"/><ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\n== Products named after ISO ==\n\nOn occasion, the fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous, has led to common use of \"ISO\" to describe the product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are:\n* [[Disk images]] end in the [[file extension]] \"[[ISO image|ISO]]\" to signify that they are using the [[ISO&nbsp;9660]] standard file system as opposed to another file system\u2014hence Discs&nbsp;images commonly are referred to as \"ISOs\".\n* The sensitivity of a photographic film to light (its \"[[film speed]]\") is described by [[ISO&nbsp;6]], [[ISO&nbsp;2240]] and [[ISO&nbsp;5800]]. Hence, the speed of the film often is referred to by its ISO&nbsp;number.\n* As it was originally defined in ISO&nbsp;518, the flash [[hot shoe]] found on cameras often is called the \"ISO&nbsp;shoe\".\n* [[ISO 11783]], which is marketed as ISOBUS.\n* [[ISO 13216]], which is marketed as ISOFIX.\n\n== Criticism and laments ==\n\nWith the exception of a small number of isolated standards,<ref name=\"FreelyAvailableStandards\"/> normally ISO standards are not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee,<ref name=\"iso_shopFAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm |title=Shopping FAQs |publisher=ISO |url-status=live |archivedate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054552/http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm}}</ref> which has been seen by some as unaffordable by small [[Open-source model|open source]] projects.<ref name=\"oreilly2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html |title=Where to get ISO Standards on the Internet free |publisher=oreillynet.com |last=Jelliffe |first=Rick |quote=The lack of free online availability has effectively made ISO standard irrelevant to the (home/hacker section of the) Open Source community. |date=1 August 2007 |url-status=live |archivedate=24 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124060422/http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] fast-track procedures (\"Fast-track\" as used by [[Office Open XML|OOXML]] and \"PAS\" as used by [[OpenDocument]]) have garnered criticism in relation to the [[standardization of Office Open XML]] (ISO/IEC&nbsp;29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing convenor of [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] WG1, is quoted as saying:<ref name=\"jtc1_sc34_0940\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm |title=Report on WG1 activity for December 2007 Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1 in Kyoto |publisher=iso/jtc1 sc34 |url-status=live |archivedate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812081252/http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nI would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1\u2019s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.\n\nThe disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting \"standardization by corporation\".\n</blockquote>\n\nThe computer security entrepreneur and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] founder, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented on the [[Standardization of Office Open XML]] process by saying: \"I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process\", and alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that [[Microsoft]] had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers, and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML:<ref name=\"zdnet_2222\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |title=Ubuntu's Shuttleworth blames ISO for OOXML's win |publisher=ZDNet.com |date=1 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archivedate=4 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404052723/http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nWhen you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process...

The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis.

''IEC'' for ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'' is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ''ASTM'' (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with [[ASTM International]]. ''yyyy'' and ''IS'' are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and, under some circumstances, may be left off the title of a published work.\n\n'''Technical reports'''\n: These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard,<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> such as references and explanations. The naming conventions for these are the same as for standards, except ''TR'' prepended instead of ''IS'' in the report's name.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC TR 17799:2000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management\n* ISO/TR 19033:2000 Technical product documentation \u2014 Metadata for construction documentation\n\n'''Technical and publicly available specifications'''\n: Technical specifications may be produced when \"the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard\". A publicly available specification is usually \"an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organization's technical reports.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation \u2014 Reference designation system \u2014 Part 1: General application rules\n* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles \u2014 Roof load carriers\n\n'''Technical corrigenda'''\n: ISO also sometimes issues \"technical corrigenda\" (where \"corrigenda\" is the plural of [[Erratum|corrigendum]]). These are amendments made to existing standards due to minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or limited-applicability extensions. They are generally issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review.<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/>\n\n'''ISO guides'''\n:These are meta-standards covering \"matters related to international standardization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> They are named using the format ''\"ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title\"''.\n\nFor example:\n* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities \u2014 General vocabulary\n* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification\n\n===Document copyright===\nISO documents are copyrighted and ISO charges for most copies. It does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although they are useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before they become finalized as standards.

ISO/IEC directives also allow the so-called \"Fast-track procedure\". In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS), if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.<ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\nThe first step\u2014a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g.,&nbsp;SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] \u2013 ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g.,&nbsp;MPEG) usually make open request for proposals\u2014known as a \"call for proposals\". The first document that is produced, for example, for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model&nbsp;(VM) (previously also called a \"simulation and test model\"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft&nbsp;(WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard, but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes a committee draft&nbsp;(CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.\n\nThe committee draft becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes exceeds the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When consensus is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). Then the text is submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard&nbsp;(FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and if not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard&nbsp;(IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO central secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard.<ref name=\"about-mpeg\"/><ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\n== Products named after ISO ==\n\nOn occasion, the fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous, has led to common use of \"ISO\" to describe the product that conforms to a standard.

An opinion survey was conducted by the firm GfK Knowledge Networks to differentiate between the different attitudes towards gun control. There was a gun policy survey and a mental illness survey. Studies showed that over 85% of those questioned supported national background checks into the mental health records of citizens attempting to purchase a gun. More than 50% of people felt that those with mental health issues were more deviant and threatening than those who had good mental health. The study also found that there is large interest in contributing to mental health awareness as well as simply prohibiting those with mental illness from purchasing guns.

An opinion survey was conducted by the firm GfK Knowledge Networks to differentiate between the different attitudes towards gun control. There was a gun policy survey and a mental illness survey. Studies showed that over 85% of those questioned supported national background checks into the mental health records of citizens attempting to purchase a gun. More than 50% of people felt that those with mental health issues were more deviant and threatening than those who had good mental health. The study also found that there is large interest in contributing to mental health awareness as well as simply prohibiting those with mental illness from purchasing guns. Nearly two thirds of respondents supported greater government spending on mental health, with more than 60% of people believing this would reduce gun violence in the USA. (Colleen L.

Using the CSS display property, the container can be defined as either flex or inline-flex.\n\n===Flex item===\n:Any direct child element held within the flex container is considered a flex item. Any text within the container element is wrapped in an unknown flex item.\n\n===Axes===\n:Each flex box contains two axes: the main and cross axes. The '''main axis''' is the axis on which the items align with each other. The '''cross axis''' is perpendicular to the main axis.\n'''Flex-direction'''\n:Establishes main axis. Possible arguments: row (default), row-reverse, column, column-reverse.\n'''Justify-content'''\n:Determines how content gets placed on the main axis on the current line. Optional arguments: left, right, center, space-between, space-around.\n'''Align-items'''\n:Determines the default for how flex items get placed on the cross axis on each line.\n\n'''Align-content'''\n:Determines the default for how cross axis lines are aligned.\n\n'''Align-self'''\n:Determines how a single item is placed along the cross axis. This overrides any defaults set by align-items.\n\n===Directions===\n:The '''main-start/main-end''' sides determine where to start placing flex items within the flex container, starting from the main-start end and going to the main-end end. The '''cross-start/cross-end''' sides determine where flex lines get filled with flex items from cross-start to cross-end.\n'''Order'''\n:Places elements in groups and determines which order they are to be placed in within the container.\n'''Flex-flow'''\n:Shorthands flex-direction and flex-wrap to place the flex content.\n\n===Lines===\n:Flex items can either be placed on a singular line or on multiple lines as defined by the flex-wrap property, which controls both the direction of the cross axis and how lines stack within the container.\n\n===Dimensions===\n:'''Main size''' and '''cross size''' are essentially the height and width of the flex container, each dealing with the main and cross axes respectively.\n\n==Designate a flex box==\nDesignating an element as a flex element is relatively easy. All that is necessary is to set the display property to either flex or inline-flex as follows:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">display: flex;</syntaxhighlight>\n\nOr:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">display: inline-flex;</syntaxhighlight>\nBy setting the display to one of the two values above, an element becomes a flex container and its children flex items. Setting the display to flex makes the container a [[HTML_element#Block_elements|block-level element]], while setting the display to inline-flex makes the container an [[HTML_element#Inline_elements|inline-level element]].<ref>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes Using CSS flexible boxes \u2013 Web developer guide | MDN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Align to center ==\nOne of flexbox's advantages is the ability to easily align items within the container to the center of a page, both vertically and horizontally.<syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\">\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

The '''main axis''' is the axis on which the items align with each other. The '''cross axis''' is perpendicular to the main axis.\n'''Flex-direction'''\n:Establishes main axis. Possible arguments: row (default), row-reverse, column, column-reverse.\n'''Justify-content'''\n:Determines how content gets placed on the main axis on the current line. Optional arguments: left, right, center, space-between, space-around.\n'''Align-items'''\n:Determines the default for how flex items get placed on the cross axis on each line.\n\n'''Align-content'''\n:Determines the default for how cross axis lines are aligned.\n\n'''Align-self'''\n:Determines how a single item is placed along the cross axis. This overrides any defaults set by align-items.\n\n===Directions===\n:The '''main-start/main-end''' sides determine where to start placing flex items within the flex container, starting from the main-start end and going to the main-end end. The '''cross-start/cross-end''' sides determine where flex lines get filled with flex items from cross-start to cross-end.\n'''Order'''\n:Places elements in groups and determines which order they are to be placed in within the container.\n'''Flex-flow'''\n:Shorthands flex-direction and flex-wrap to place the flex content.\n\n===Lines===\n:Flex items can either be placed on a singular line or on multiple lines as defined by the flex-wrap property, which controls both the direction of the cross axis and how lines stack within the container.\n\n===Dimensions===\n:'''Main size''' and '''cross size''' are essentially the height and width of the flex container, each dealing with the main and cross axes respectively.\n\n==Designate a flex box==\nDesignating an element as a flex element is relatively easy. All that is necessary is to set the display property to either flex or inline-flex as follows:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">display: flex;</syntaxhighlight>\n\nOr:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"CSS\">display: inline-flex;</syntaxhighlight>\nBy setting the display to one of the two values above, an element becomes a flex container and its children flex items. Setting the display to flex makes the container a [[HTML_element#Block_elements|block-level element]], while setting the display to inline-flex makes the container an [[HTML_element#Inline_elements|inline-level element]].<ref>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes Using CSS flexible boxes \u2013 Web developer guide | MDN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Align to center ==\nOne of flexbox's advantages is the ability to easily align items within the container to the center of a page, both vertically and horizontally.<syntaxhighlight lang=\"css\">\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

These included the shared use of a 3.4-liter V6 engine which was the top of the line engine in both the Tacoma and T100. The V6 engine would serve as the base engine for the Tundra, while a second engine was added, a 4.7-liter V8, the first V8 for a Toyota pickup.\n\nPublicly introduced in May 1999 as a 2000 model, the Tundra prototypes and \"show trucks\" were initially known as T150s. However, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and automotive journalists described the name was too close to the market-leader [[Ford F-Series|Ford F-150]], and following a lawsuit by Ford, the production truck was renamed the Tundra.\n\n[[File:Toyota-Tundra-StepSide.jpg|left|thumb|Toyota Tundra stepside.]]\n\nThe Tundra was slightly larger than the T100, but still had the perception of being too small and car-like to pose a serious threat to the domestic pickup trucks. With a production capacity of 120,000, sales were double the rate of the T100. At its introduction, the Tundra had the highest initial vehicle sales for Toyota in its history. It was selected as ''[[Motor Trend]]'''s Truck of the Year award for 2000 and Best Full- Size Truck from ''[[Consumer Reports]]''. It was built in a new Toyota plant in Princeton, Indiana, with 65 percent domestic content.\n\nEngine choices available in the Tundra were a 24V 3.4-liter V6 engine that produced {{convert|190|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque and an LEV certified 32 valve 4.7-liter \"i-Force\" V8 engine that produced {{convert|245|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|315|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. A [[Toyota Racing Development]] (TRD) supercharger was already available for the 3.4-liter V6 (2000-2003 models) that bumped power to the {{convert|260|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} range and {{convert|260|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. TRD introduced a second supercharger for the V8 (2000-2003 models) engine late into its second year of production that increased to the mid {{convert|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} range and torque to the {{convert|400|lbft|0|abbr=on}} range. The V6 supercharger is still available, the V8 supercharger ended production once Toyota released the updated [[VVT-i]] equipped 4.7-liter engine.\n\n[[File:03-06 Toyota Tundra regular cab.jpg|left|thumb|2003-2006 Toyota Tundra regular cab]]\n\nThe grille was updated in 2002 (for the 2003 model year), along with a new Stepside bed available on Access Cab models. The Tundra Double Cab, also added to the lineup in 2004, was a crew cab with four rear-opening doors, with interior and exterior details copied from the [[Toyota Sequoia]]. Its bed was nearly {{convert|5|in|mm}} longer than the competing [[Honda Ridgeline]] or [[Ford F-150]]. It is also {{convert|13|in|mm}} longer, {{convert|3|in|mm}} taller, and {{convert|4|in|mm}} wider than the Regular and Access Cab versions, with a {{convert|12|in|mm}} longer wheelbase. A new engine was introduced in 2005: a 4.0-liter V6 rated at {{convert|236|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|266|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque, and the existing 4.7-liter V8 was updated with Toyota's VVT-i [[variable valve timing]] technology and was rated at {{convert|282|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|325|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque while the 2006 versions were rerated at {{convert|271|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|313|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] gave way to a 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] replaced the 4-speed. With a towing capacity of {{convert|6900|lb|0|abbr=on}} on the Double Cab and {{convert|7100|lb|0|abbr=on}} on Access Cab and Regular Cab models with a V8 engine, the Tundra still did not have enough power to compete with the heavier-duty offerings of the Big Three and Nissan.\n\nIn 2003, the T3 Special Edition was sold in conjunction with the release of the [[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines|Terminator 3]] movie. It included a TRD performance package, \"T3\" badging, blacked out grille and trim pieces, special 17-inch wheels and T3 limited interior trim. 650 were sold in the US as 4x2 and 200 were sold in Canada as 4x4.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 2006, the Darrell Waltrip Edition was marketed to honor the NASCAR driver and his participation in the NASCAR Truck Series. Only 2000 V8-powered Double Cab models were produced. The package included special badging and unique 18-inch wheels.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) rated the Tundra \"Good\" overall in their frontal offset crash test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=5 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Toyota Tundra |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2005-11-15 |accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref>  It was the first full-size pickup awarded a \"Good\" score, its then competitors from Ford and Dodge were rated \"Poor\" and in the case of GM's entry \"Marginal\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/news/iihs_crash_results.html |title=PickupTruck.Com - Toyota Tundra Triumphs in IIHS Full Size Pickup Truck Crash Tests |publisher=Pickuptrucks.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|XK50}}Second generation (XK50; 2007\u2013present)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation (XK50)\n| image = 2nd Toyota Tundra regular cab.jpg\n| production = November 2006 \u2013 present<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.toyotageorgetown.com/detailnews.asp?PRID=200 |title=Toyota Begins Tundra Production in San Antonio |publisher=Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky |date=2006-11-17 |accessdate=2015-09-04}}</ref>\n| model_years= 2007 \u2013 present\n| body_style = 2-door [[Pickup truck|Regular cab]]<br />4-door [[Double Cab]]<br />4-door [[Double cab|Crewmax]]\n| engine = 4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota GR engine#1GR-FE|1GR-FE]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] ([[VVT-i]])<br /> 236 horsepower (2007 - 2010)<br />\n4.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota GR engine#1GR-FE|1GR-FE]]'' V6 ([[Dual VVT-i]])<br /> 270 horsepower (2011 - 2013) <br />\n4.7&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota UZ engine#2UZ-FE|2UZ-FE]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (VVT-i)<br /> 276 horsepower (2007 - 2009) <br />\n4.6&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota UR engine#1UR-FE|1UR-FE]]'' V8 (VVT-i)<br /> 310 horsepower (2010 - present) <br />\n5.7&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota UR engine#3UR-FE|3UR-FE]]'' V8 ([[Dual VVT-i]])<br /> 381 horsepower (2007 - present)\n| wheelbase = Regular cab 6.5' box: 126.8 (3220 mm)<br />Regular cab 8' box/Double Cab 6.5' box/CrewMax 5.5' box: 145.7 (3700 mm)<br />Double Cab 8' box: 164.6 (4180 mm)\n| length = Regular cab 6.5' box: {{convert|209.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Regular cab 8' box/Double Cab 6.5' box/CrewMax 5.5' box: {{convert|228.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Double Cab 8' box: {{convert|247.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 5-speed automatic (A750E/F)<br />6-speed automatic ([[Toyota A transmission|AB60E/F]])<br />6-speed automatic (A760E/F)\n| height = Regular Cab 4WD: {{convert|76.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Regular Cab LB 4WD & Double Cab 4WD: {{convert|76.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />CrewMax 4WD: {{convert|76.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Regular & Double Cab 2WD: {{convert|75.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />CrewMax 2WD: {{convert|75.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| designer = Craig Kember (2003, 2004)<br />Matt Sperling (facelift: 2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matt-sperling/29/40b/191 |title=Matt Sperling |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=2015-09-04}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2007\u20132013===\nA larger Tundra was introduced at the February 2006 [[Chicago Auto Show]]. It used styling cues from the [[Toyota Tacoma]] along with some cues from the [[Toyota FTX]] concept truck (also designed by Craig Kember in 2003). The truck featured towing capacity of up to 10,000&nbsp;lb, and a payload capacity of over {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}}, a new 5.7-liter ''[[Toyota UR engine|3UR-FE]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] engine mated to a new 6-speed automatic transmission. The second generation Tundra had three engine options. The new 5.7-liter V8 that produces {{convert|381|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|401|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque, and the carry over 4.7-liter ''[[Toyota UZ engine|2UZ-FE]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] rated at {{convert|276|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|313|lb\u00b7ft|N.m}} of torque, as well as the previous 4.0-liter ''[[Toyota GR engine|1GR-FE]]'' [[V6]] rated at {{convert|236|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|266|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\n[[File:2012 Toyota Tundra -- NHTSA 1.jpg|left|thumb|2012 Tundra CrewMax]]\n\nWhen the new Tundra was first launched in January 2007, it was available in 31 configurations, which consisted of 3 bed lengths, 3 cab configurations, 3 wheelbases, and 2 transmissions. The new Double Cab replaces the previous generation's Access Cab, and the all new CrewMax replaces the previous generation's Double Cab, it is also built to compete with the [[Dodge Ram]] Mega Cab. The Double Cab and Regular Cab are available with a {{convert|6.5|ft|m|adj=on}} regular bed or an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} long bed, while the CrewMax is only available with a {{convert|5.5|ft|m|adj=on}} short bed. The Tundra also features a new 6-speed [[automatic transmission]] which can lock the torque converter in 5th and 6th gears with a [[manumatic|manual shift mode]] which is standard with the 5.7-liter, giving it a {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}} time of 6.3 seconds and a quarter mile time of 14.7 seconds.\n\nToyota made the new Tundra useful for many construction workers by including extra large door handles, deck rail system, integrated tow hitch, and head restraints that can fit a worker with a hardhat. The Tundra also includes as standard: an electronic automatic limited-slip differential (Auto LSD), Vehicle Stability Control, traction control, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist, anti-lock brakes and tailgate assist. However, its starting was more expensive than the Chevrolet Silverado Work Truck and the base Ford F-150.\n\nSome other changes Toyota included in the new Tundra are optional tow mirrors, a {{Convert|26.4|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}} fuel tank, available {{convert|22|in|mm|adj=on}} alloy wheels, [[backup camera]], [[Bluetooth]], large center console (big enough to fit a {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} laptop), extra-large disc brakes and calipers, and the aforementioned 6-speed sequential automatic transmission.\n\nAll 5.7-liter Tundras come equipped with a tow package which includes engine oil and transmission coolers, integrated trailer hitch, 4.30:1 axle ratio, and large braking hardware for increased fade resistance.  Equipped with the 5.7-liter V8 the Tundra has a maximum tow rating of {{convert|9000|-|10400|lbs|abbr=on|-2}} depending on body configuration.  Toyota began rating the Tundra under the [[SAE J2807]] protocol beginning in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2010/08/toyota-lowers-trailering-ratings-gains-credibility.html |title=Toyota Lowers Tundra Tow Ratings, Gains Credibility - PickupTrucks.com News |first=Mike |last=Levine |work=PickupTrucks.com |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}</ref>\n\n====Model year changes====\n*The 2008 model added 13 variations bringing the total to 44 model variants.

When designing the Texas plant, Toyota arranged for 21 key Tundra suppliers to set up factories on the same site to avoid logistical issues, however those suppliers are more vulnerable to a market downturn.

This is verified by the updated owners manual, visor instructions, and road tests in snow and ice in 4x4hi.

This recall involved 110,000 vehicles and followed a similar action for the Tacoma. Following the Tacoma voluntary recall Tundra owners began complaining of rust issues. In some cases, trucks were inspected by dealers and found to be unsafe to drive.  The dealers refused to let the owners take their vehicles without signing an affidavit that they had been informed that Toyota had declared their vehicles unsafe to drive.  Complaints were subsequently brought to [[WCVB-TV]] Channel 5 investigative reporter [[Susan Wornick]] and the story ran repeatedly in spring and fall 2009 prompting the NHTSA to begin an investigation. NHTSA was particularly concerned that owners reported the potential for the spare tire to drop from the vehicle without warning due to corrosion and they opened an investigation on October 6, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/defect/relatedDefectsSummary.cfm?RCL_ID=09V444000&defectIdlist=PE09049&ModuleType=Vehicles&type=VEHICLE. |title=Recalls Summary Safercar.gov NHTSA |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}</ref> Toyota recalled 2000-2001 Tundras, soon expanding it through 2003.

The Toyota recall includes 2004 to 2007 model year Sequoia full-size sport utility vehicles and 2004 to 2006 Tundra pickups sold in the U.S.\nA ball joint in the front suspension may wear out causing the vehicles to be difficult or sometimes impossible to steer.\nToyota reports that the defect may be the cause of 11 accidents resulting in six injuries.  This can cause the wheel to fall off the truck without any notice.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn May 2007, a Toyota spokesperson stated 20 camshaft failures occurred in Toyota's all-new 5.7 L ''[[Toyota UR engine|3UR-FE]]'' [[V8 engine|V-8]] engine. Toyota said the failures were the result of a flaw in the camshaft casting process, and the supplier of the camshafts has since fixed the error. In the event of a camshaft failure Toyota will either replace the engine and extend the warranty or repurchase the truck from the owner. Toyota originally intended to begin selling the 5.7-liter equipped Tundra during the northern hemisphere summer of 2007 but decided to rush the engine into production in order to match the November 2006 launch date. This decision was the result of product planners and dealers desire for the larger V8's availability at the initial sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonauto.com/complaints/toyota/toyota_tundra.htm |title=Toyota Tundra Recall Information - Toyota Recalls & Problems |publisher=Lemonauto.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>\n\nOn December 13, 2007, Toyota Motor Corp recalled 15,600 4x4 2007 model-year Tundras in the United States because a rear propeller shaft joint may fail. \"There is a possibility that a joint in the rear propeller shaft may have been improperly heat treated, resulting in insufficient hardness,\" Toyota said. Adding, \"This may cause a section of the rear propeller shaft to separate at the joint.\" There has been one reported case of abnormal noises in the affected vehicles. No accidents have been connected to the recall. Tundra owners will be notified beginning in late-December 2007 and are requested to contact their local Toyota dealer for inspection.

These included the shared use of a 3.4-liter V6 engine which was the top of the line engine in both the Tacoma and T100. The V6 engine would serve as the base engine for the Tundra, while a second engine was added, a 4.7-liter V8, the first V8 for a Toyota pickup.\n\nPublicly introduced in May 1999 as a 2000 model, the Tundra prototypes and \"show trucks\" were initially known as T150s. However, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and automotive journalists described the name was too close to the market-leader [[Ford F-Series|Ford F-150]], and following a lawsuit by Ford, the production truck was renamed the Tundra.\n\n[[File:Toyota-Tundra-StepSide.jpg|left|thumb|Toyota Tundra stepside.]]\n\nThe Tundra was slightly larger than the T100, but still had the perception of being too small and car-like to pose a serious threat to the domestic pickup trucks. With a production capacity of 120,000, sales were double the rate of the T100. At its introduction, the Tundra had the highest initial vehicle sales for Toyota in its history. It was selected as ''[[Motor Trend]]'''s Truck of the Year award for 2000 and Best Full- Size Truck from ''[[Consumer Reports]]''. It was built in a new Toyota plant in Princeton, Indiana, with 65 percent domestic content.\n\nEngine choices available in the Tundra were a 24V 3.4-liter V6 engine that produced {{convert|190|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque and an LEV certified 32 valve 4.7-liter \"i-Force\" V8 engine that produced {{convert|245|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|315|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. A [[Toyota Racing Development]] (TRD) supercharger was already available for the 3.4-liter V6 (2000-2003 models) that bumped power to the {{convert|260|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} range and {{convert|260|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. TRD introduced a second supercharger for the V8 (2000-2003 models) engine late into its second year of production that increased to the mid {{convert|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} range and torque to the {{convert|400|lbft|0|abbr=on}} range. The V6 supercharger is still available, the V8 supercharger ended production once Toyota released the updated [[VVT-i]] equipped 4.7-liter engine.\n\n[[File:03-06 Toyota Tundra regular cab.jpg|left|thumb|2003-2006 Toyota Tundra regular cab]]\n\nThe grille was updated in 2002 (for the 2003 model year), along with a new Stepside bed available on Access Cab models. The Tundra Double Cab, also added to the lineup in 2004, was a crew cab with four rear-opening doors, with interior and exterior details copied from the [[Toyota Sequoia]]. Its bed was nearly {{convert|5|in|mm}} longer than the competing [[Honda Ridgeline]] or [[Ford F-150]]. It is also {{convert|13|in|mm}} longer, {{convert|3|in|mm}} taller, and {{convert|4|in|mm}} wider than the Regular and Access Cab versions, with a {{convert|12|in|mm}} longer wheelbase. A new engine was introduced in 2005: a 4.0-liter V6 rated at {{convert|236|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|266|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque, and the existing 4.7-liter V8 was updated with Toyota's VVT-i [[variable valve timing]] technology and was rated at {{convert|282|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|325|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque while the 2006 versions were rerated at {{convert|271|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|313|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] gave way to a 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] replaced the 4-speed. With a towing capacity of {{convert|6900|lb|0|abbr=on}} on the Double Cab and {{convert|7100|lb|0|abbr=on}} on Access Cab and Regular Cab models with a V8 engine, the Tundra still did not have enough power to compete with the heavier-duty offerings of the Big Three and Nissan.\n\nIn 2003, the T3 Special Edition was sold in conjunction with the release of the [[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines|Terminator 3]] movie. It included a TRD performance package, \"T3\" badging, blacked out grille and trim pieces, special 17-inch wheels and T3 limited interior trim. 650 were sold in the US as 4x2 and 200 were sold in Canada as 4x4.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn 2006, the Darrell Waltrip Edition was marketed to honor the NASCAR driver and his participation in the NASCAR Truck Series. Only 2000 V8-powered Double Cab models were produced.

The truck featured towing capacity of up to 10,000&nbsp;lb, and a payload capacity of over {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}}, a new 5.7-liter ''[[Toyota UR engine|3UR-FE]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] engine mated to a new 6-speed automatic transmission. The second generation Tundra had three engine options. The new 5.7-liter V8 that produces {{convert|381|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|401|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque, and the carry over 4.7-liter ''[[Toyota UZ engine|2UZ-FE]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] rated at {{convert|276|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|313|lb\u00b7ft|N.m}} of torque, as well as the previous 4.0-liter ''[[Toyota GR engine|1GR-FE]]'' [[V6]] rated at {{convert|236|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|266|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\n[[File:2012 Toyota Tundra -- NHTSA 1.jpg|left|thumb|2012 Tundra CrewMax]]\n\nWhen the new Tundra was first launched in January 2007, it was available in 31 configurations, which consisted of 3 bed lengths, 3 cab configurations, 3 wheelbases, and 2 transmissions. The new Double Cab replaces the previous generation's Access Cab, and the all new CrewMax replaces the previous generation's Double Cab, it is also built to compete with the [[Dodge Ram]] Mega Cab. The Double Cab and Regular Cab are available with a {{convert|6.5|ft|m|adj=on}} regular bed or an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} long bed, while the CrewMax is only available with a {{convert|5.5|ft|m|adj=on}} short bed. The Tundra also features a new 6-speed [[automatic transmission]] which can lock the torque converter in 5th and 6th gears with a [[manumatic|manual shift mode]] which is standard with the 5.7-liter, giving it a {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}} time of 6.3 seconds and a quarter mile time of 14.7 seconds.\n\nToyota made the new Tundra useful for many construction workers by including extra large door handles, deck rail system, integrated tow hitch, and head restraints that can fit a worker with a hardhat. The Tundra also includes as standard: an electronic automatic limited-slip differential (Auto LSD), Vehicle Stability Control, traction control, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist, anti-lock brakes and tailgate assist. However, its starting was more expensive than the Chevrolet Silverado Work Truck and the base Ford F-150.\n\nSome other changes Toyota included in the new Tundra are optional tow mirrors, a {{Convert|26.4|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}} fuel tank, available {{convert|22|in|mm|adj=on}} alloy wheels, [[backup camera]], [[Bluetooth]], large center console (big enough to fit a {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} laptop), extra-large disc brakes and calipers, and the aforementioned 6-speed sequential automatic transmission.\n\nAll 5.7-liter Tundras come equipped with a tow package which includes engine oil and transmission coolers, integrated trailer hitch, 4.30:1 axle ratio, and large braking hardware for increased fade resistance.  Equipped with the 5.7-liter V8 the Tundra has a maximum tow rating of {{convert|9000|-|10400|lbs|abbr=on|-2}} depending on body configuration.  Toyota began rating the Tundra under the [[SAE J2807]] protocol beginning in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2010/08/toyota-lowers-trailering-ratings-gains-credibility.html |title=Toyota Lowers Tundra Tow Ratings, Gains Credibility - PickupTrucks.com News |first=Mike |last=Levine |work=PickupTrucks.com |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}</ref>\n\n====Model year changes====\n*The 2008 model added 13 variations bringing the total to 44 model variants.

While Super White carried over from 2015, Magnetic Gray (1G3) and Quicksand (4V6) were new. Quicksand was first featured on the FJ-S Cruiser Concept that Toyota and TRD USA used as a test bed for the early TRD Pro Series concept.

Combined, the two plants give Toyota a maximum capacity to produce 300,000 Tundra units annually or 100,000 units from the Indiana plant and another 200,000 units from the Texas plant. When designing the Texas plant, Toyota arranged for 21 key Tundra suppliers to set up factories on the same site to avoid logistical issues, however those suppliers are more vulnerable to a market downturn.

This is verified by the updated owners manual, visor instructions, and road tests in snow and ice in 4x4hi.

This recall involved 110,000 vehicles and followed a similar action for the Tacoma. Following the Tacoma voluntary recall Tundra owners began complaining of rust issues. In some cases, trucks were inspected by dealers and found to be unsafe to drive.  The dealers refused to let the owners take their vehicles without signing an affidavit that they had been informed that Toyota had declared their vehicles unsafe to drive.  Complaints were subsequently brought to [[WCVB-TV]] Channel 5 investigative reporter [[Susan Wornick]] and the story ran repeatedly in spring and fall 2009 prompting the NHTSA to begin an investigation. NHTSA was particularly concerned that owners reported the potential for the spare tire to drop from the vehicle without warning due to corrosion and they opened an investigation on October 6, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/defect/relatedDefectsSummary.cfm?RCL_ID=09V444000&defectIdlist=PE09049&ModuleType=Vehicles&type=VEHICLE. |title=Recalls Summary Safercar.gov NHTSA |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}</ref> Toyota recalled 2000-2001 Tundras, soon expanding it through 2003.

The Toyota recall includes 2004 to 2007 model year Sequoia full-size sport utility vehicles and 2004 to 2006 Tundra pickups sold in the U.S.\nA ball joint in the front suspension may wear out causing the vehicles to be difficult or sometimes impossible to steer.\nToyota reports that the defect may be the cause of 11 accidents resulting in six injuries.  This can cause the wheel to fall off the truck without any notice.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn May 2007, a Toyota spokesperson stated 20 camshaft failures occurred in Toyota's all-new 5.7 L ''[[Toyota UR engine|3UR-FE]]'' [[V8 engine|V-8]] engine. Toyota said the failures were the result of a flaw in the camshaft casting process, and the supplier of the camshafts has since fixed the error. In the event of a camshaft failure Toyota will either replace the engine and extend the warranty or repurchase the truck from the owner. Toyota originally intended to begin selling the 5.7-liter equipped Tundra during the northern hemisphere summer of 2007 but decided to rush the engine into production in order to match the November 2006 launch date. This decision was the result of product planners and dealers desire for the larger V8's availability at the initial sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonauto.com/complaints/toyota/toyota_tundra.htm |title=Toyota Tundra Recall Information - Toyota Recalls & Problems |publisher=Lemonauto.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>\n\nOn December 13, 2007, Toyota Motor Corp recalled 15,600 4x4 2007 model-year Tundras in the United States because a rear propeller shaft joint may fail. \"There is a possibility that a joint in the rear propeller shaft may have been improperly heat treated, resulting in insufficient hardness,\" Toyota said. Adding, \"This may cause a section of the rear propeller shaft to separate at the joint.\" There has been one reported case of abnormal noises in the affected vehicles. No accidents have been connected to the recall. Tundra owners will be notified beginning in late-December 2007 and are requested to contact their local Toyota dealer for inspection.

{"title_page": "Discrete element method", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2019}}{{distinguish|finite element method}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2019}}\nA '''discrete element method''' ('''DEM'''), also called a '''distinct element method''', is any of a family of [[numerical analysis|numerical]] methods for computing the motion and effect of a large number of small particles. Though DEM is very closely related to [[molecular dynamics]], the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees-of-freedom as well as stateful contact and often complicated geometries (including polyhedra). With advances in computing power and numerical algorithms for nearest neighbor sorting, it has become possible to numerically simulate millions of particles on a single processor. Today DEM is becoming widely accepted as an effective method of addressing engineering problems in granular and discontinuous materials, especially in granular flows, powder mechanics, and rock mechanics. Recently, the method was expanded into the [[Extended Discrete Element Method]] taking [[thermodynamics]] and coupling to [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] and [[Finite element method|FEM]] into account.\n\nDiscrete element methods are relatively computationally intensive, which limits either the length of a simulation or the number of particles. Several DEM codes, as do molecular dynamics codes, take advantage of parallel processing capabilities (shared or distributed systems) to scale up the number of particles or length of the simulation. An alternative to treating all particles separately is to average the physics across many particles and thereby treat the material as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]].  In the case of [[solid]]-like granular behavior as in [[soil mechanics]], the continuum approach usually treats the material as [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|elasto-plastic]] and models it with the [[finite element method]] or a [[Meshfree methods|mesh free method]].  In the case of liquid-like or gas-like granular flow, the continuum approach may treat the material as a [[fluid]] and use [[computational fluid dynamics]]. Drawbacks to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] of the granular scale physics, however, are well-documented and should be considered carefully before attempting to use a continuum approach.\n\n==The DEM family==\nThe various branches of the DEM family are the [[distinct element method]] proposed by [[Peter A. Cundall]] in 1971, the [[generalized discrete element method]] {{harv|Williams|Hocking|Mustoe|1985}}, the [[Discontinuous Deformation Analysis|discontinuous deformation analysis]] (DDA) {{harv|Shi|1992}} and the finite-discrete element method concurrently developed by several groups (e.g., [[Ante Munjiza|Munjiza]] and [[Roger Owen (mathematician)|Owen]]). The general method was originally developed by Cundall in 1971 to problems in rock mechanics. The theoretical basis of the method was established by Sir Isaac Newton in 1697<!-- 1967 is INCORRECT! --Aclariont Sept 25, 2009 (assumed a typo for now)-->. {{harvtxt|Williams|Hocking|Mustoe|1985}} showed that DEM could be viewed as a generalized finite element method. Its application to geomechanics problems is described in the book ''Numerical Methods in Rock Mechanics'' {{harv|Williams|Pande|Beer|1990}}. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd International Conferences on Discrete Element Methods have been a common point for researchers to publish advances in the method and its applications. Journal articles reviewing the state of the art have been published by Williams, [[Nenad Bicanic|Bicanic]], and [[Antonio Bobet|Bobet]] et al. (see below).  A comprehensive treatment of the combined Finite Element-Discrete Element Method is contained in the book ''The Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method''.<ref name=\"Munjiza 2004\">{{cite book |last1=Munjiza |first1=Ante |title=The Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method |date=2004 |publisher=Wiley |location=Chichester |isbn=978-0-470-84199-0}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cundall DEM.gif|thumb|upright=1|Discrete-element simulation with particles arranged after a photo of Peter A.

The forces which act on each particle are computed from the initial data and the relevant physical laws and contact models. Generally, a simulation consists of three parts: the initialization, explicit time-stepping, and post-processing. The time-stepping usually requires a nearest neighbor sorting step to reduce the number of possible contact pairs and decrease the computational requirements; this is often only performed periodically.\n\nThe following forces may have to be considered in macroscopic simulations:\n* [[friction]], when two particles touch each other;\n* [[contact plasticity]], or recoil, when two particles collide;\n* [[gravity]], the force of attraction between particles due to their mass, which is only relevant in astronomical simulations.\n* attractive potentials, such as [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]], [[adhesion]], [[liquid bridging]], [[electrostatic attraction]]. Note that, because of the overhead from determining nearest neighbor pairs, exact resolution of long-range, compared with particle size, forces can increase computational cost or require specialized algorithms to resolve these interactions.\n\nOn a molecular level, we may consider:\n* the [[Coulomb force]], the [[electrostatic]] attraction or repulsion of particles carrying [[electric charge]];\n* [[Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli repulsion]], when two atoms approach each other closely;\n* [[van der Waals force]].\n\nAll these forces are added up to find the total force acting on each particle. An [[numerical ordinary differential equations|integration method]] is employed to compute the change in the position and the velocity of each particle during a certain time step from [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Then, the new positions are used to compute the forces during the next step, and this [[program loop|loop]] is repeated until the simulation ends.\n\nTypical integration methods used in a discrete element method are:\n* the [[Verlet integration|Verlet algorithm]],\n* [[velocity Verlet]],\n* [[symplectic integrator]]s,\n* the [[leapfrog method]].\n\n==Long-range forces==\n\nWhen long-range forces (typically gravity or the Coulomb force) are taken into account, then the interaction between each pair of particles needs to be computed. Both the number of interactions and cost of computation [[quadratic growth|increase quadratically]] with the number of particles. This is not acceptable for simulations with large number of particles. A possible way to avoid this problem is to combine some particles, which are far away from the particle under consideration, into one pseudoparticle. Consider as an example the interaction between a star and a distant [[galaxy]]: The error arising from combining all the stars in the distant galaxy into one point mass is negligible. So-called tree algorithms are used to decide which particles can be combined into one pseudoparticle. These algorithms arrange all particles in a tree, a [[quadtree]] in the two-dimensional case and an [[octree]] in the three-dimensional case.\n\nHowever, simulations in molecular dynamics divide the space in which the simulation take place into cells. Particles leaving through one side of a cell are simply inserted at the other side (periodic [[boundary condition]]s); the same goes for the forces. The force is no longer taken into account after the so-called cut-off distance (usually half the length of a cell), so that a particle is not influenced by the mirror image of the same particle in the other side of the cell. One can now increase the number of particles by simply copying the cells.\n\nAlgorithms to deal with long-range force include:\n* [[Barnes\u2013Hut simulation]],\n* the [[fast multipole method]].\n\n==Combined finite-discrete element method==\n\nFollowing the work by Munjiza and Owen, the combined finite-discrete element method has been further developed to various irregular and deformable particles in many applications including pharmaceutical tableting,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=R.

Several research groups have independently developed simulation software that agrees well with experimental findings in a wide range of engineering applications, including adhesive powders, granular flow, and jointed rock masses.\n* DEM allows a more detailed study of the micro-dynamics of powder flows than is often possible using physical experiments. For example, the force networks formed in a granular media can be visualized using DEM. Such measurements are nearly impossible in experiments with small and many particles.\n\nDisadvantages\n* The maximum number of particles, and duration of a virtual simulation is limited by computational power. Typical flows contain billions of particles, but contemporary DEM simulations on large cluster computing resources have only recently been able to approach this scale for sufficiently long time (simulated time, not actual program execution time). \n* DEM is computationally demanding, which is the reason why it has not been so readily and widely adopted as continuum approaches in computational engineering sciences and industry.

Though DEM is very closely related to [[molecular dynamics]], the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees-of-freedom as well as stateful contact and often complicated geometries (including polyhedra). With advances in computing power and numerical algorithms for nearest neighbor sorting, it has become possible to numerically simulate millions of particles on a single processor. Today DEM is becoming widely accepted as an effective method of addressing engineering problems in granular and discontinuous materials, especially in granular flows, powder mechanics, and rock mechanics. Recently, the method was expanded into the [[Extended Discrete Element Method]] taking [[thermodynamics]] and coupling to [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] and [[Finite element method|FEM]] into account.\n\nDiscrete element methods are relatively computationally intensive, which limits either the length of a simulation or the number of particles. Several DEM codes, as do molecular dynamics codes, take advantage of parallel processing capabilities (shared or distributed systems) to scale up the number of particles or length of the simulation. An alternative to treating all particles separately is to average the physics across many particles and thereby treat the material as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]].  In the case of [[solid]]-like granular behavior as in [[soil mechanics]], the continuum approach usually treats the material as [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|elasto-plastic]] and models it with the [[finite element method]] or a [[Meshfree methods|mesh free method]].  In the case of liquid-like or gas-like granular flow, the continuum approach may treat the material as a [[fluid]] and use [[computational fluid dynamics]]. Drawbacks to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] of the granular scale physics, however, are well-documented and should be considered carefully before attempting to use a continuum approach.\n\n==The DEM family==\nThe various branches of the DEM family are the [[distinct element method]] proposed by [[Peter A. Cundall]] in 1971, the [[generalized discrete element method]] {{harv|Williams|Hocking|Mustoe|1985}}, the [[Discontinuous Deformation Analysis|discontinuous deformation analysis]] (DDA) {{harv|Shi|1992}} and the finite-discrete element method concurrently developed by several groups (e.g., [[Ante Munjiza|Munjiza]] and [[Roger Owen (mathematician)|Owen]]). The general method was originally developed by Cundall in 1971 to problems in rock mechanics. The theoretical basis of the method was established by Sir Isaac Newton in 1697<!-- 1967 is INCORRECT! --Aclariont Sept 25, 2009 (assumed a typo for now)-->. {{harvtxt|Williams|Hocking|Mustoe|1985}} showed that DEM could be viewed as a generalized finite element method. Its application to geomechanics problems is described in the book ''Numerical Methods in Rock Mechanics'' {{harv|Williams|Pande|Beer|1990}}. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd International Conferences on Discrete Element Methods have been a common point for researchers to publish advances in the method and its applications. Journal articles reviewing the state of the art have been published by Williams, [[Nenad Bicanic|Bicanic]], and [[Antonio Bobet|Bobet]] et al. (see below).  A comprehensive treatment of the combined Finite Element-Discrete Element Method is contained in the book ''The Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method''.<ref name=\"Munjiza 2004\">{{cite book |last1=Munjiza |first1=Ante |title=The Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method |date=2004 |publisher=Wiley |location=Chichester |isbn=978-0-470-84199-0}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cundall DEM.gif|thumb|upright=1|Discrete-element simulation with particles arranged after a photo of Peter A.

The forces which act on each particle are computed from the initial data and the relevant physical laws and contact models. Generally, a simulation consists of three parts: the initialization, explicit time-stepping, and post-processing. The time-stepping usually requires a nearest neighbor sorting step to reduce the number of possible contact pairs and decrease the computational requirements; this is often only performed periodically.\n\nThe following forces may have to be considered in macroscopic simulations:\n* [[friction]], when two particles touch each other;\n* [[contact plasticity]], or recoil, when two particles collide;\n* [[gravity]], the force of attraction between particles due to their mass, which is only relevant in astronomical simulations.\n* attractive potentials, such as [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]], [[adhesion]], [[liquid bridging]], [[electrostatic attraction]]. Note that, because of the overhead from determining nearest neighbor pairs, exact resolution of long-range, compared with particle size, forces can increase computational cost or require specialized algorithms to resolve these interactions.\n\nOn a molecular level, we may consider:\n* the [[Coulomb force]], the [[electrostatic]] attraction or repulsion of particles carrying [[electric charge]];\n* [[Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli repulsion]], when two atoms approach each other closely;\n* [[van der Waals force]].\n\nAll these forces are added up to find the total force acting on each particle. An [[numerical ordinary differential equations|integration method]] is employed to compute the change in the position and the velocity of each particle during a certain time step from [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Then, the new positions are used to compute the forces during the next step, and this [[program loop|loop]] is repeated until the simulation ends.\n\nTypical integration methods used in a discrete element method are:\n* the [[Verlet integration|Verlet algorithm]],\n* [[velocity Verlet]],\n* [[symplectic integrator]]s,\n* the [[leapfrog method]].\n\n==Long-range forces==\n\nWhen long-range forces (typically gravity or the Coulomb force) are taken into account, then the interaction between each pair of particles needs to be computed. Both the number of interactions and cost of computation [[quadratic growth|increase quadratically]] with the number of particles. This is not acceptable for simulations with large number of particles. A possible way to avoid this problem is to combine some particles, which are far away from the particle under consideration, into one pseudoparticle. Consider as an example the interaction between a star and a distant [[galaxy]]: The error arising from combining all the stars in the distant galaxy into one point mass is negligible. So-called tree algorithms are used to decide which particles can be combined into one pseudoparticle. These algorithms arrange all particles in a tree, a [[quadtree]] in the two-dimensional case and an [[octree]] in the three-dimensional case.\n\nHowever, simulations in molecular dynamics divide the space in which the simulation take place into cells. Particles leaving through one side of a cell are simply inserted at the other side (periodic [[boundary condition]]s); the same goes for the forces. The force is no longer taken into account after the so-called cut-off distance (usually half the length of a cell), so that a particle is not influenced by the mirror image of the same particle in the other side of the cell. One can now increase the number of particles by simply copying the cells.\n\nAlgorithms to deal with long-range force include:\n* [[Barnes\u2013Hut simulation]],\n* the [[fast multipole method]].\n\n==Combined finite-discrete element method==\n\nFollowing the work by Munjiza and Owen, the combined finite-discrete element method has been further developed to various irregular and deformable particles in many applications including pharmaceutical tableting,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=R.

Several research groups have independently developed simulation software that agrees well with experimental findings in a wide range of engineering applications, including adhesive powders, granular flow, and jointed rock masses.\n* DEM allows a more detailed study of the micro-dynamics of powder flows than is often possible using physical experiments. For example, the force networks formed in a granular media can be visualized using DEM. Such measurements are nearly impossible in experiments with small and many particles.\n\nDisadvantages\n* The maximum number of particles, and duration of a virtual simulation is limited by computational power. Typical flows contain billions of particles, but contemporary DEM simulations on large cluster computing resources have only recently been able to approach this scale for sufficiently long time (simulated time, not actual program execution time). \n* DEM is computationally demanding, which is the reason why it has not been so readily and widely adopted as continuum approaches in computational engineering sciences and industry.

For retinal prostheses, which are the most prevalent visual prosthetic under development (due to ease of access to the retina among other considerations), patients with vision loss due to degeneration of [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] ([[retinitis pigmentosa]], [[choroideremia]], geographic atrophy macular degeneration) are the best candidate for treatment.

Images are projected onto healthy areas of the central retina, outside the degenerated [[macula]], and is enlarged to reduce the effect the blind spot has on central vision. 2.2x or 2.7x magnification strengths make it possible to see or discern the central vision object of interest while the other eye is used for peripheral vision because the eye that has the implant will have limited peripheral vision as a side effect. Unlike a telescope which would be hand-held, the implant moves with the eye which is the main advantage. Patients using the device may however still need glasses for optimal vision and for close work. Before surgery, patients should first try out a hand-held telescope to see if they would benefit from image enlargement. One of the main drawbacks is that it cannot be used for patients who have had [[cataract surgery]] as the [[intraocular lens]] would obstruct insertion of the telescope. It also requires a large incision in the [[cornea]] to insert.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lipshitz|first=Isaac|title=Implantable Telescope Technology|url=http://www.centrasight.com/centrasight_technology|publisher=VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nA [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane systematic review]] seeking to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the implantable miniature telescope for patients with late or advanced age-related macular degeneration found only one ongoing study evaluating the OriLens intraocular telescope, with results expected in 2020.<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{cite journal | author=Gupta A, Lam J, Custis P, Munz S, Fong D, Koster M | title=Implantable miniature telescope (IMT) for vision loss due to end-stage age-related macular degeneration | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume= 5| issue=5 | pages=CD011140 | date=2018 | pmid=29847689 | pmc=6022289 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011140.pub2}}</ref>\n\n===T\u00fcbingen MPDA Project Alpha IMS===\nA Southern German team led by the University Eye Hospital in T\u00fcbingen, was formed in 1995 by Eberhart Zrenner to develop a subretinal prosthesis.\nThe chip is located behind the [[retina]] and utilizes microphotodiode arrays (MPDA) which collect incident light and transform it into electrical current stimulating the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s.\nAs natural [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are far more efficient than [[photodiode]]s, visible light is not powerful enough to stimulate the MPDA. Therefore, an external power supply is used to enhance the stimulation current. The German team commenced in vivo experiments in 2000, when evoked cortical potentials were measured from Yucat\u00e1n micropigs and rabbits. At 14 months post implantation, the implant and retina surrounding it were examined and there were no noticeable changes to anatomical integrity.

BVA was a consortium of some of Australia's leading universities and research institutes, and funded by the Australian Research Council from 2010, it ceased operations on 31 December 2016. The members of the consortium consisted of [[Bionics Institute]], [[University of New South Wales|UNSW Sydney]], Data 61 [[CSIRO|CSRIO]], Center for Eye Research Australia (CERA), and [[University of Melbourne|The University of Melbourne]]. There were many more partners as well. The Australian Federal Government awarded a $42 million ARC grant to Bionic Vision Australia to develop bionic vision technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bionicvision.org.au/|title=About BVA|website=Bionicvision|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nWhile the BVA consortium was still together, the team was led by Professor Anthony Burkitt, and they were developing two retinal prostheses. One known as The Wide-View device, that combined novel technologies with materials that had been successfully used in other clinical implants. This approach incorporated a microchip with 98 stimulating electrodes and aimed to provide increased mobility for patients to help them move safely in their environment. This implant would be placed in the suprachoroidal space. Researchers expected the first patient tests to begin with this device in 2013, it is currently unknown whether full trials were conducted, but at least one woman named Dianne Ashworth was implanted with the device, and was able to read letters and numbers using it.,<ref>{{Citation|title=Dianne Ashworth 12 months on, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQEZiAuJ_AE|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> she later went on to write a book titled \"I Spy With My Bionic Eye\", about her life, vision loss, and being the first person to be implanted with the BVA, Bioinc Eye device.\n\nBVA was also concurrently developing the High-Acuity device, which incorporated a number of new technologies to bring together a microchip and an implant with 1024 electrodes. The device aimed to provide functional central vision to assist with tasks such as face recognition and reading large print. This high-acuity implant would be inserted epiretinally. Patient tests were planned for this device in 2014 once preclinical testing had been completed, it is unknown whether these trials ever took place.\n\nPatients with [[retinitis pigmentosa]] were to be the first to participate in the studies, followed by age-related macular degeneration.  Each prototype consisted of a camera, attached to a pair of glasses which sent the signal to the implanted microchip, where it was converted into electrical impulses to stimulate the remaining healthy neurons in the retina. This information was then passed on to the optic nerve and the vision processing centres of the brain.\n\nOn January 2, 2019, BVT released positive results from a set of trials on four Australians using a new version of the device. Older versions of the device were only designed to be used temporarily, but the new design allowed the technology to be used constantly, and for the first time outside the lab, even to be taken home. More implants are to be administered throughout 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=Channel 9 BVT|url=https://www.facebook.com/BionicVisionTechnologies/videos/1541714469305476/|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fact sheets dated March, 2019, on BVT's website, they expect the device to obtain market approval in 3 to 5 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bionicvis.com/fact-sheets/|title=Fact Sheets {{!}} Bionic Vision Technologies|website=bionicvis.com|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\n===Dobelle Eye===\n{{Main|William H.

Images are projected onto healthy areas of the central retina, outside the degenerated [[macula]], and is enlarged to reduce the effect the blind spot has on central vision. 2.2x or 2.7x magnification strengths make it possible to see or discern the central vision object of interest while the other eye is used for peripheral vision because the eye that has the implant will have limited peripheral vision as a side effect. Unlike a telescope which would be hand-held, the implant moves with the eye which is the main advantage. Patients using the device may however still need glasses for optimal vision and for close work. Before surgery, patients should first try out a hand-held telescope to see if they would benefit from image enlargement. One of the main drawbacks is that it cannot be used for patients who have had [[cataract surgery]] as the [[intraocular lens]] would obstruct insertion of the telescope. It also requires a large incision in the [[cornea]] to insert.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lipshitz|first=Isaac|title=Implantable Telescope Technology|url=http://www.centrasight.com/centrasight_technology|publisher=VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nA [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane systematic review]] seeking to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the implantable miniature telescope for patients with late or advanced age-related macular degeneration found only one ongoing study evaluating the OriLens intraocular telescope, with results expected in 2020.<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{cite journal | author=Gupta A, Lam J, Custis P, Munz S, Fong D, Koster M | title=Implantable miniature telescope (IMT) for vision loss due to end-stage age-related macular degeneration | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume= 5| issue=5 | pages=CD011140 | date=2018 | pmid=29847689 | pmc=6022289 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011140.pub2}}</ref>\n\n===T\u00fcbingen MPDA Project Alpha IMS===\nA Southern German team led by the University Eye Hospital in T\u00fcbingen, was formed in 1995 by Eberhart Zrenner to develop a subretinal prosthesis.\nThe chip is located behind the [[retina]] and utilizes microphotodiode arrays (MPDA) which collect incident light and transform it into electrical current stimulating the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s.\nAs natural [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are far more efficient than [[photodiode]]s, visible light is not powerful enough to stimulate the MPDA. Therefore, an external power supply is used to enhance the stimulation current. The German team commenced in vivo experiments in 2000, when evoked cortical potentials were measured from Yucat\u00e1n micropigs and rabbits. At 14 months post implantation, the implant and retina surrounding it were examined and there were no noticeable changes to anatomical integrity. The implants were successful in producing evoked cortical potentials in half of the animals tested. The thresholds identified in this study were similar to those required in epiretinal stimulation.\nLater reports from this group concern the results of a clinical pilot study on 11 participants suffering from [[Retinitis pigmentosa|RP]].

BVA was a consortium of some of Australia's leading universities and research institutes, and funded by the Australian Research Council from 2010, it ceased operations on 31 December 2016. The members of the consortium consisted of [[Bionics Institute]], [[University of New South Wales|UNSW Sydney]], Data 61 [[CSIRO|CSRIO]], Center for Eye Research Australia (CERA), and [[University of Melbourne|The University of Melbourne]]. There were many more partners as well. The Australian Federal Government awarded a $42 million ARC grant to Bionic Vision Australia to develop bionic vision technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bionicvision.org.au/|title=About BVA|website=Bionicvision|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nWhile the BVA consortium was still together, the team was led by Professor Anthony Burkitt, and they were developing two retinal prostheses. One known as The Wide-View device, that combined novel technologies with materials that had been successfully used in other clinical implants. This approach incorporated a microchip with 98 stimulating electrodes and aimed to provide increased mobility for patients to help them move safely in their environment. This implant would be placed in the suprachoroidal space. Researchers expected the first patient tests to begin with this device in 2013, it is currently unknown whether full trials were conducted, but at least one woman named Dianne Ashworth was implanted with the device, and was able to read letters and numbers using it.,<ref>{{Citation|title=Dianne Ashworth 12 months on, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQEZiAuJ_AE|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> she later went on to write a book titled \"I Spy With My Bionic Eye\", about her life, vision loss, and being the first person to be implanted with the BVA, Bioinc Eye device.\n\nBVA was also concurrently developing the High-Acuity device, which incorporated a number of new technologies to bring together a microchip and an implant with 1024 electrodes. The device aimed to provide functional central vision to assist with tasks such as face recognition and reading large print. This high-acuity implant would be inserted epiretinally. Patient tests were planned for this device in 2014 once preclinical testing had been completed, it is unknown whether these trials ever took place.\n\nPatients with [[retinitis pigmentosa]] were to be the first to participate in the studies, followed by age-related macular degeneration.  Each prototype consisted of a camera, attached to a pair of glasses which sent the signal to the implanted microchip, where it was converted into electrical impulses to stimulate the remaining healthy neurons in the retina. This information was then passed on to the optic nerve and the vision processing centres of the brain.\n\nOn January 2, 2019, BVT released positive results from a set of trials on four Australians using a new version of the device. Older versions of the device were only designed to be used temporarily, but the new design allowed the technology to be used constantly, and for the first time outside the lab, even to be taken home. More implants are to be administered throughout 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=Channel 9 BVT|url=https://www.facebook.com/BionicVisionTechnologies/videos/1541714469305476/|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fact sheets dated March, 2019, on BVT's website, they expect the device to obtain market approval in 3 to 5 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bionicvis.com/fact-sheets/|title=Fact Sheets {{!}} Bionic Vision Technologies|website=bionicvis.com|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\n===Dobelle Eye===\n{{Main|William H.

The ten-episode season was broadcast on Monday nights in the United States on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], excluding the pilot episode which aired on a Sunday. A [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''Better Call Saul'' was created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]], both of whom also worked on ''Breaking Bad''.\n\nThe season takes place in 2002, six years prior to the events in ''Breaking Bad'', excluding the opening scene in the pilot where Saul (under his \"Gene Takavic\" alias) works at a [[Omaha]] [[Cinnabon]], and features [[Bob Odenkirk]] reprising his role from ''Breaking Bad'' as James Morgan \"Jimmy\" McGill, who later becomes known as [[Saul Goodman]] from the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]] onwards. Jimmy is a struggling lawyer looking after his successful brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]], who allegedly suffers from [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]]. [[Jonathan Banks]] also reprises his role as [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], a former [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia police officer]] who works independently as a parking lot attendant, and later as a [[private investigator]] and \"[[cleaner (crime)|cleaner]]\".\n\nThe first season of ''Better Call Saul'' received critical acclaim, with many considering it to be a worthy successor to ''Breaking Bad'', and six nominations for the [[67th Primetime Emmy Awards]], including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]].\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBy July 2013, the series had yet to be [[green-light|greenlit]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Molloy |first=Tim |url=https://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/breaking-bad-creator-vince-gilligan-saul-goodman-spinoff-moving-full-speed-ahead-101091 |title=''Breaking Bad'' Creator Vince Gilligan: Saul Goodman Spinoff Moving 'Full Speed Ahead' |publisher=The Wrap |date=July 2, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209035421/http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/breaking-bad-creator-vince-gilligan-saul-goodman-spinoff-moving-full-speed-ahead-101091/ |archive-date=December 9, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Netflix]] was one of many interested distributors, but ultimately a deal was made between AMC and ''Breaking Bad'' production company [[Sony Pictures Television]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breaking-bad-spinoff-how-amc-630464 |title=How AMC Almost Lost ''Breaking Bad'' Spinoff ''Better Call Saul'' to Netflix |last1=Guthrie |first1=Melissa |last2=Rose |first2=Lacey |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 18, 2013 |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315112543/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breaking-bad-spinoff-how-amc-630464 |archive-date=March 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gilligan and Gould serve as co-[[showrunner]]s and Gilligan directed the pilot episode.<ref name=numbers>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/19/amc-releases-first-photo-from-better-call-saul/275154/ |title='Better Call Saul' Renewed for Second Season by AMC; First Season Pushed Back to 2015 |last=Kondolojy |first=Amanda |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=June 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519145525/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/19/amc-releases-first-photo-from-better-call-saul/275154/ |archive-date=May 19, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Former ''Breaking Bad'' writers [[Thomas Schnauz]] and [[Gennifer Hutchison]] joined the writing staff, with Schnauz serving as co-executive producer and Hutchison as supervising producer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/breaking-bad-writers-join-better-call-saul-staff-1200981189/ |title='Breaking Bad' Writers Join 'Better Call Saul' Staff |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |work=Variety |date=December 20, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191205094140/https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/breaking-bad-writers-join-better-call-saul-staff-1200981189/ |archive-date=December 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Also on the writing staff are [[Bradley Paul]], and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]], who was a writer's assistant on ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Bob Odenkirk]] stars as lawyer/con-man Jimmy McGill (originally known as [[Saul Goodman]] in ''Breaking Bad'').

He attempts to convince Craig and Betsy Kettleman to retain him in an embezzlement case. Jimmy cares for his brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]], who is semi-reclusive and believes he has [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]]. Jimmy confronts [[Howard Hamlin]] of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), the firm where Chuck is a partner. Howard attempts to buy Chuck out cheaply, but Jimmy demands HHM pay Chuck for his partnership's full value. The Kettlemans hire HHM, so Jimmy sets up a phony vehicle-pedestrian accident for Betsy, intending to arrive shortly afterwards and assist her, which will allow him to make another pitch to represent the Kettlemans on the embezzlement charge. Jimmy's accomplices, twins Lars and Cal, accidentally target the wrong car, which is driven by [[Tuco Salamanca]]'s grandmother. The twins attempt to get her to pay and follow her into her house.

Tuco doesn't believe Jimmy is a lawyer and is about to kill him, so Jimmy claims he's an FBI agent. [[Nacho Varga|Nacho]] doesn't believe ''that'' story, so Jimmy confirms that he is actually a lawyer. Tuco releases him, and Jimmy talks Tuco out of killing the twins, suggesting that he break one leg on each as revenge for involving and disrespecting Tuco's grandmother and as a warning to keep quiet.

In 2002, Jimmy still hopes to get the Kettlemans to drop HHM and hire him to represent them in the embezzlement case. Nacho conducts surveillance of the Kettlemans, so Jimmy calls from a pay phone and uses a disguised voice to warn them. They look outside and see Nacho's van. The next day, when Jimmy arrives, the police inform him that the Kettlemans have been kidnapped. A neighbor reports seeing Nacho's van, so he is arrested. Nacho accuses Jimmy of setting him up and threatens to kill him, unless he proves Nacho's innocence. Jimmy comes to believe that the Kettlemans staged the kidnapping and attempts to prove it.

Jimmy gets Nacho released from jail, but Nacho deduces that Jimmy tipped off the Kettlemans and warns him about \"consequences\", to which Jimmy replies that Nacho was so careless that he was recognized while doing surveillance, so if anything had happened to the Kettlemans, he would have been suspected. Jimmy uses his windfall to imitate Howard on a billboard for his law firm, which mimicks HHM's logo. Howard sends Jimmy a cease and desist order, forcing the billboard's removal. Jimmy tries to generate sympathetic media coverage, then stages the phony rescue of a billboard worker. To Howard's disgust, Jimmy's stunt generates positive stories about Jimmy and new clients. Jimmy makes his daily trip to Chuck's to drop off groceries and newspapers, but removes the local paper from Chuck's stack.

The doctor wants Jimmy to have Chuck committed to a mental institution, but Jimmy declines and takes Chuck home. Jimmy's newfound fame attracts less than promising clients, including one who wants to secede from the United States, until he meets an elderly woman who wants him to prepare a will. Her bequests consist almost entirely of leaving her [[Hummel figurine]]s to various friends and family members, but she pays in cash, and Jimmy's rapport with her causes Kim to suggest that he should specialize in elder law.

Mike learns Stacey called police after she found money Matt hid in a suitcase.  Mike tells Stacey Matt was a clean cop in a precinct of corruption that included Mike.  Matt refused to participate and Mike counseled him to do it for his own safety, but Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear that he might turn them in.  In another flashback, Mike breaks into a police car outside a bar, then drinks heavily inside and tells two cops he knows what they did. When he leaves, the cops give him a ride and take his gun.

Hamlin is eager to take it but wants to prevent Jimmy's participation by buying him off with a small [[of counsel]] fee and a percentage of the judgment. Jimmy refuses and later discovers Chuck braved his electromagnetic hypersensitivity symptoms to make a pre-meeting phone call to Howard, in which he asked Howard to prevent Jimmy's participation.  Chuck admits he has never regarded Jimmy as a peer, owing to his conman's past and unconventional legal training, also admitting it was he who insisted HHM not hire Jimmy back when he passed the bar exam.

The ten-episode season was broadcast on Monday nights in the United States on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], excluding the pilot episode which aired on a Sunday. A [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''Better Call Saul'' was created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]], both of whom also worked on ''Breaking Bad''.\n\nThe season takes place in 2002, six years prior to the events in ''Breaking Bad'', excluding the opening scene in the pilot where Saul (under his \"Gene Takavic\" alias) works at a [[Omaha]] [[Cinnabon]], and features [[Bob Odenkirk]] reprising his role from ''Breaking Bad'' as James Morgan \"Jimmy\" McGill, who later becomes known as [[Saul Goodman]] from the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]] onwards. Jimmy is a struggling lawyer looking after his successful brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]], who allegedly suffers from [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]]. [[Jonathan Banks]] also reprises his role as [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], a former [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia police officer]] who works independently as a parking lot attendant, and later as a [[private investigator]] and \"[[cleaner (crime)|cleaner]]\".\n\nThe first season of ''Better Call Saul'' received critical acclaim, with many considering it to be a worthy successor to ''Breaking Bad'', and six nominations for the [[67th Primetime Emmy Awards]], including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]].\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBy July 2013, the series had yet to be [[green-light|greenlit]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Molloy |first=Tim |url=https://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/breaking-bad-creator-vince-gilligan-saul-goodman-spinoff-moving-full-speed-ahead-101091 |title=''Breaking Bad'' Creator Vince Gilligan: Saul Goodman Spinoff Moving 'Full Speed Ahead' |publisher=The Wrap |date=July 2, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209035421/http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/breaking-bad-creator-vince-gilligan-saul-goodman-spinoff-moving-full-speed-ahead-101091/ |archive-date=December 9, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Netflix]] was one of many interested distributors, but ultimately a deal was made between AMC and ''Breaking Bad'' production company [[Sony Pictures Television]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breaking-bad-spinoff-how-amc-630464 |title=How AMC Almost Lost ''Breaking Bad'' Spinoff ''Better Call Saul'' to Netflix |last1=Guthrie |first1=Melissa |last2=Rose |first2=Lacey |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 18, 2013 |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315112543/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breaking-bad-spinoff-how-amc-630464 |archive-date=March 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gilligan and Gould serve as co-[[showrunner]]s and Gilligan directed the pilot episode.<ref name=numbers>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/19/amc-releases-first-photo-from-better-call-saul/275154/ |title='Better Call Saul' Renewed for Second Season by AMC; First Season Pushed Back to 2015 |last=Kondolojy |first=Amanda |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=June 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519145525/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/19/amc-releases-first-photo-from-better-call-saul/275154/ |archive-date=May 19, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Former ''Breaking Bad'' writers [[Thomas Schnauz]] and [[Gennifer Hutchison]] joined the writing staff, with Schnauz serving as co-executive producer and Hutchison as supervising producer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/breaking-bad-writers-join-better-call-saul-staff-1200981189/ |title='Breaking Bad' Writers Join 'Better Call Saul' Staff |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |work=Variety |date=December 20, 2013 |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191205094140/https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/breaking-bad-writers-join-better-call-saul-staff-1200981189/ |archive-date=December 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Also on the writing staff are [[Bradley Paul]], and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]], who was a writer's assistant on ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Bob Odenkirk]] stars as lawyer/con-man Jimmy McGill (originally known as [[Saul Goodman]] in ''Breaking Bad'').

Jimmy cares for his brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]], who is semi-reclusive and believes he has [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]]. Jimmy confronts [[Howard Hamlin]] of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), the firm where Chuck is a partner. Howard attempts to buy Chuck out cheaply, but Jimmy demands HHM pay Chuck for his partnership's full value. The Kettlemans hire HHM, so Jimmy sets up a phony vehicle-pedestrian accident for Betsy, intending to arrive shortly afterwards and assist her, which will allow him to make another pitch to represent the Kettlemans on the embezzlement charge. Jimmy's accomplices, twins Lars and Cal, accidentally target the wrong car, which is driven by [[Tuco Salamanca]]'s grandmother. The twins attempt to get her to pay and follow her into her house.

Tuco doesn't believe Jimmy is a lawyer and is about to kill him, so Jimmy claims he's an FBI agent. [[Nacho Varga|Nacho]] doesn't believe ''that'' story so Jimmy confirms that he is actually a lawyer. Tuco orders him released and Jimmy talks Tuco out of killing the twins, suggesting he break one leg on each as revenge for involving Tuco's grandmother in the scam and as a warning to keep quiet.

In 2002, Jimmy still hopes to get the Kettlemans to drop HHM and hire him to represent them in the embezzlement case. Nacho conducts surveillance of the Kettlemans, so Jimmy calls from a pay phone and uses a disguised voice to warn them they're in danger. They look outside and see Nacho's van, and when Jimmy arrives, the Kettleman house appears to have been hurriedly vacated. The police inform him the Kettlemans have been kidnapped.  A neighbor reports seeing Nacho's van, so he's arrested.  Nacho accuses Jimmy of tipping off the Kettlemans and threatens to kill him unless he proves Nacho's innocence.

Jimmy gets Nacho released from jail, but Nacho deduces that Jimmy tipped off the Kettlemans and warns him about \"consequences\", to which Jimmy replies that Nacho was so careless he was recognized while doing surveillance, so if anything had happened to the Kettlemans, he would have been suspected.  Jimmy uses his windfall to imitate Howard on a billboard for his law firm, which mimicks HHM's logo. Howard obtains a cease and desist order, forcing the billboard's removal. Jimmy tries to generate sympathetic media coverage, then stages the phony rescue of a billboard worker. To Howard's disgust, Jimmy's stunt generates positive stories about Jimmy and generates new clients.

The doctor advises Jimmy that Chuck's \"disease\" is psychosomatic, based on a surreptitious test she performed at Chuck's bedside.  Jimmy's newfound fame attracts less than promising clients, including one who wants to secede from the United States, until he meets an elderly woman who wants him to prepare a will.  Her bequests consist almost entirely of leaving her [[Hummel figurine]]s to various friends and family members, but she pays in cash and Jimmy's rapport with her causes Kim to suggest that he should specialize in elder law. Jimmy begins promoting himself at a nursing home, including clothing patterned after the titular character of the TV series ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]''.  Mike is visited at home by several Philadelphia police officers.

Matt refused to participate and Mike counseled him to do it for his own safety, but Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear that he might turn them in.

The church has an [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] governance. Believers Eastern Church is an \"Ancient-Future Church\"<ref>https://www.bec.org/</ref> and as such, is considered by some to be heretical.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebereancall.org/content/ancient-future-heresies|title=Ancient-Future Heresies|website=thebereancall.org|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> The church holds Christ as the head of the Church (Col 1:18); hence it is governed by a committee of Bishops, the Synod, with one central Bishop holding the honorary title of \"[[Prima inter pares|first among equals]]\". Believers Eastern Church is administratively based in the state of [[Kerala]] in southwestern [[India]]. In 2015, the church reported it was re-organized into 33 [[Diocese|dioceses]]; a decrease from the 36 [[Diocese|dioceses]] reported by Smith in 2009. According to Believers Eastern Church, its membership consists of more than 3.5 million people in 10 countries speaking a hundred languages. The Church currently has 30 Bishops, and the current [[Presiding bishop|Metropolitan Bishop]] is Yohannan<ref>https://www.bec.org/athanasius-yohan/</ref>. Bishops and ordained clergy are required to vow allegiance and submission to the metropolitan (currently Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan) and all of his successors. <ref>http://www.gfadiaspora.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pats-ordination-with-no-last-names.pdf</ref>\n\n===Print and radio===\n\nK.

Yohannan's belief in the efficiency and efficacy of \u201cnational missionaries\u201d, or missionaries that are native to the nation or culture being served. The organization\u2019s primary mission fields are those people that live in the \u201c10/40 Window\u201d, referring to longitudinal coordinates consisting of areas in west Africa, India and east Asia.<ref name=\"Bergunder\"/>\n[[File:KP Yohannan Visits Slum.jpg|left|thumb|K.P. Yohannan visiting slum in India|255x255px]]\nK. P. Yohannan credits his early work in his native India as inspiration for his focus on the poor and underserved in this region. He states: \u201cIn my head I knew all the answers, and Bible became the tool of the trade for me that I would use to teach and preach and I was doing very well. People liked my sermons, but finally I said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m not the same person I was when the Lord called me to serve Him. I\u2019m not the same person that I was that walked on the streets of North India weeping over the lost and perishing millions and stayed up all night praying and weeping over a world map. The Lord was gracious enough to talk to us very lovingly, and I realized that he wanted me to go back to America and speak to the \u2018Body of Christ\u2019 about the possibility of seeing countries like India, Burma and Bhutan, turn to Christ if only they would become unselfish in praying and helping these brothers by becoming senders.\u201d<ref name=ASSIST/>\n\nFrom its inception, Gospel for Asia has held to K.P. Yohannan's conviction of the use of national missionaries. The ministry discourages direct missions from outside countries or people-groups, but rather trains and equips missionaries from within distinct cultures. In order to accomplish this, Gospel for Asia claims to have over 56 Bible schools in 10 countries, training over 9000 ministers. In all, [[Gospel for Asia]] claims to have trained over 16,000 national missionaries.<ref name=Liberty>Houston, Rickey.

Believers Eastern Church is an \"Ancient-Future Church\"<ref>https://www.bec.org/</ref> and as such, is considered by some to be heretical.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebereancall.org/content/ancient-future-heresies|title=Ancient-Future Heresies|website=thebereancall.org|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> The church holds Christ as the head of the Church (Col 1:18); hence it is governed by a committee of Bishops, the Synod, with one central Bishop holding the honorary title of \"[[Prima inter pares|first among equals]]\". Believers Eastern Church is administratively based in the state of [[Kerala]] in southwestern [[India]]. In 2015, the church reported it was re-organized into 33 [[Diocese|dioceses]]; a decrease from the 36 [[Diocese|dioceses]] reported by Smith in 2009. According to Believers Eastern Church, its membership consists of more than 3.5 million people in 10 countries speaking a hundred languages. The Church currently has 30 Bishops, and the current [[Presiding bishop|Metropolitan Bishop]] is Yohannan<ref>https://www.bec.org/athanasius-yohan/</ref>. Bishops and ordained clergy are required to vow allegiance and submission to the metropolitan (currently Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan) and all of his successors. <ref>http://www.gfadiaspora.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pats-ordination-with-no-last-names.pdf</ref>\n\n===Print and radio===\n\nK.

Yohannan's belief in the efficiency and efficacy of \u201cnational missionaries\u201d, or missionaries that are native to the nation or culture being served. The organization\u2019s primary mission fields are those people that live in the \u201c10/40 Window\u201d, referring to longitudinal coordinates consisting of areas in west Africa, India and east Asia.<ref name=\"Bergunder\"/>\n[[File:KP Yohannan Visits Slum.jpg|left|thumb|K.P. Yohannan visiting slum in India|255x255px]]\nK. P. Yohannan credits his early work in his native India as inspiration for his focus on the poor and underserved in this region. He states: \u201cIn my head I knew all the answers, and Bible became the tool of the trade for me that I would use to teach and preach and I was doing very well. People liked my sermons, but finally I said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m not the same person I was when the Lord called me to serve Him. I\u2019m not the same person that I was that walked on the streets of North India weeping over the lost and perishing millions and stayed up all night praying and weeping over a world map. The Lord was gracious enough to talk to us very lovingly, and I realized that he wanted me to go back to America and speak to the \u2018Body of Christ\u2019 about the possibility of seeing countries like India, Burma and Bhutan, turn to Christ if only they would become unselfish in praying and helping these brothers by becoming senders.\u201d<ref name=ASSIST/>\n\nFrom its inception, Gospel for Asia has held to K.P. Yohannan's conviction of the use of national missionaries. The ministry discourages direct missions from outside countries or people-groups, but rather trains and equips missionaries from within distinct cultures. In order to accomplish this, Gospel for Asia claims to have over 56 Bible schools in 10 countries, training over 9000 ministers. In all, [[Gospel for Asia]] claims to have trained over 16,000 national missionaries.<ref name=Liberty>Houston, Rickey.

It was released on November 16, 1999, by [[Aftermath Entertainment]] as the follow-up to his 1992 debut album ''[[The Chronic]]''. The album was produced mainly by Dr. Dre and [[Melvin \"Mel-Man\" Bradford|Mel-Man]], as well as [[Lord Finesse]], and features several [[guest appearance|guest contributions]] from fellow American [[rapper]]s such as [[The D.O.C.]], [[Hittman]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Kurupt]], [[Xzibit]], [[Eminem]], and [[Nate Dogg]]. ''2001'' exhibits an expansion on Dre's debut [[G-funk]] sound and contains [[gangsta rap]] themes such as violence, promiscuity, drug use, street gangs, sex and crime.\n\nThe album debuted at number 2 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 550,000 copies in its first week. It produced 3 singles that attained chart success and has been certified [[RIAA certification|6\u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]; as of August 2015 the album has sold 7,800,000 copies in the United States. ''2001'' received generally positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the music although some found the lyrics objectionable.\n\n==Title==\nThe album was initially titled ''Chronic 2000'' until [[Priority Records]], who had become [[Death Row Records]]' new distributor decided in cohesiveness with Death Row's founder and then-CEO [[Suge Knight]] to call their compilation album ''Chronic 2000''. Death Row owned the trademark for ''The Chronic'' as did [[Interscope Records]] who previously distributed Death Row. Knight was tipped off about the name of Dr. Dre's album since notification of the trademark use was required by his label [[Aftermath Records]]. When Aftermath found out that Priority and Death Row planned to use the same name for their album, Dre sought legal action. According to his lawyer Howard King, \"both sides agreed that we'd allow the other to use the title, and then let the public decide which one they preferred\".<ref name=\"Dr. Dre's War On Chronic\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dr-dres-war-on-chronic-19990721|title=Dr. Dre's War On Chronic|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''Chronic 2000'', they announced that Dr. Dre's album would now be named ''Chronic 2001''. Shortly after, Interscope began a big budget promotional campaign for ''Chronic 2001''. At this point, Priority decided not to honor the original agreement and threatened to sue Dre if the ''Chronic'' trademark were to be used in any capacity. Dre eventually decided to release the album as simply ''2001''.<ref name=\"Dr. Dre's War On Chronic\"/>\n\n==Background==\nIn an interview with ''The New York Times'', Dr. Dre spoke about his motivation to record the album and how he felt that he had to prove himself to fans and media again after doubts arose over his production and rapping ability. These doubts came from the fact that he had not released a solo studio album since ''[[The Chronic]]'' (1992). He stated:\n\n{{quote|For the last couple of years, there's been a lot of talk out on the streets about whether or not I can still hold my own, whether or not I'm still good at producing. That was the ultimate motivation for me. Magazines, word of mouth and rap tabloids were saying I didn't have it any more. What more do I need to do? How many platinum records have I made? O.K., here's the album \u2013 now what do you have to say?<ref name=NYTimes-The-Street-Talk/>}}\n\nThe album was intended to be released as a [[mixtape]]; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, \"Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs.\"<ref name=NYTimes-The-Street-Talk/> Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented \"I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of [[dark comedy]] here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously.\"<ref name=NYTimes-The-Street-Talk/>\n\n==Recording==\nSome of the lyrics on the album used by Dre have been noted to be penned by several ghostwriters.

[[AllMusic]] writer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted that Dr. Dre had expanded on the [[G-funk]] beats on his previous album, ''The Chronic'', and stated, \"He's pushed himself hard, finding new variations in the formula by adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae, resulting in fairly interesting recontextualizations\" and went on to say, \"Sonically, this is first-rate, straight-up gangsta.\"<ref name=AMG/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Tom Sinclair depicted the album as \"Chilly keyboard motifs gliding across gut-punching bass lines, strings and synths swooping in and out of the mix, naggingly familiar guitar licks providing visceral punctuation\".<ref name=EW/> ''[[NME]]'' described the production as \"patented tectonic funk beats and mournful atmospherics\".<ref name=NME/> ''PopMatters'' praised the production, stating that \"the hip-hop rhythms are catchy, sometimes in your face, sometimes subtle, but always a fine backdrop for the power of Dre's voice.\"<ref name=PopMatters/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' mentioned that the beats were \"lean and immaculate, each one a pithy combination of beat, rap, melody and strategic silences\".<ref name=NYTimes>Jon Pareles (November 14, 1999).

[[Dr. Dre]]. It was released on November 16, 1999, by [[Aftermath Entertainment]] as the follow-up to his 1992 debut album ''[[The Chronic]]''. The album was produced mainly by Dr. Dre and [[Melvin \"Mel-Man\" Bradford|Mel-Man]], as well as [[Lord Finesse]], and features several [[guest appearance|guest contributions]] from fellow American [[rapper]]s such as [[The D.O.C.]], [[Hittman]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Kurupt]], [[Xzibit]], [[Eminem]], and [[Nate Dogg]]. ''2001'' exhibits an expansion on Dre's debut [[G-funk]] sound and contains [[gangsta rap]] themes such as violence, promiscuity, drug use, street gangs, sex and crime.\n\nThe album debuted at number 2 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 550,000 copies in its first week. It produced 3 singles that attained chart success and has been certified [[RIAA certification|6\u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]; as of August 2015 the album has sold 7,800,000 copies in the United States. ''2001'' received generally positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the music although some found the lyrics objectionable.\n\n==Title==\nThe album was initially titled ''Chronic 2000'' until [[Priority Records]], who had become [[Death Row Records]]' new distributor decided in cohesiveness with Death Row's founder and then-CEO [[Suge Knight]] to call their compilation album ''Chronic 2000''. Death Row owned the trademark for ''The Chronic'' as did [[Interscope Records]] who previously distributed Death Row. Knight was tipped off about the name of Dr. Dre's album since notification of the trademark use was required by his label [[Aftermath Records]]. When Aftermath found out that Priority and Death Row planned to use the same name for their album, Dre sought legal action. According to his lawyer Howard King, \"both sides agreed that we'd allow the other to use the title, and then let the public decide which one they preferred\".<ref name=\"Dr. Dre's War On Chronic\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dr-dres-war-on-chronic-19990721|title=Dr. Dre's War On Chronic|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''Chronic 2000'', they announced that Dr. Dre's album would now be named ''Chronic 2001''. Shortly after, Interscope began a big budget promotional campaign for ''Chronic 2001''. At this point, Priority decided not to honor the original agreement and threatened to sue Dre if the ''Chronic'' trademark were to be used in any capacity. Dre eventually decided to release the album as simply ''2001''.<ref name=\"Dr. Dre's War On Chronic\"/>\n\n==Background==\nIn an interview with ''The New York Times'', Dr. Dre spoke about his motivation to record the album and how he felt that he had to prove himself to fans and media again after doubts arose over his production and rapping ability. These doubts came from the fact that he had not released a solo studio album since ''[[The Chronic]]'' (1992). He stated:\n\n{{quote|For the last couple of years, there's been a lot of talk out on the streets about whether or not I can still hold my own, whether or not I'm still good at producing. That was the ultimate motivation for me. Magazines, word of mouth and rap tabloids were saying I didn't have it any more. What more do I need to do? How many platinum records have I made? O.K., here's the album \u2013 now what do you have to say?<ref name=NYTimes-The-Street-Talk/>}}\n\nThe album was intended to be released as a [[mixtape]]; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, \"Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs.\"<ref name=NYTimes-The-Street-Talk/> Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented \"I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of [[dark comedy]] here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously.\"<ref name=NYTimes-The-Street-Talk/>\n\n==Recording==\nSome of the lyrics on the album used by Dre have been noted to be penned by several ghostwriters.

[[AllMusic]] writer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted that Dr. Dre had expanded on the [[G-funk]] beats on his previous album, ''The Chronic'', and stated, \"He's pushed himself hard, finding new variations in the formula by adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae, resulting in fairly interesting recontextualizations\" and went on to say, \"Sonically, this is first-rate, straight-up gangsta.\"<ref name=AMG/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Tom Sinclair depicted the album as \"Chilly keyboard motifs gliding across gut-punching bass lines, strings and synths swooping in and out of the mix, naggingly familiar guitar licks providing visceral punctuation\".<ref name=EW/> ''[[NME]]'' described the production as \"patented tectonic funk beats and mournful atmospherics\".<ref name=NME/> ''PopMatters'' praised the production, stating that \"the hip-hop rhythms are catchy, sometimes in your face, sometimes subtle, but always a fine backdrop for the power of Dre's voice.\"<ref name=PopMatters/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' mentioned that the beats were \"lean and immaculate, each one a pithy combination of beat, rap, melody and strategic silences\".<ref name=NYTimes>Jon Pareles (November 14, 1999).

They include many themes associated with gangsta rap, such as violence, promiscuity, street gangs, drive-by shootings, crime and drug usage. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the only subject matter on the album was \"violence, drugs, pussy, bitches, dope, guns, and gangsters\" and that these themes have become repetitive and unchanged in the last ten years.<ref name=AMG/> Critics noted that Dr. Dre had differed from his effort to \"clean-up his act\" which he tried to establish with his 1996 single, \"[[Been There, Done That (Dr. Dre song)|Been There, Done That]]\" from ''[[Dr. Dre Presents...The Aftermath]]''.<ref name=NYTimes-The-Street-Talk>Jon Pareles (November 14, 1999).
