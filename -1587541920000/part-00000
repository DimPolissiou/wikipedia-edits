He is known for his roles as Gaear Grimsrud in ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' (1996) and [[List of Prison Break characters#John Abruzzi|John Abruzzi]] on ''[[Prison Break]]'' (2005\u20132007). He also appeared in the films ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997), ''[[Playing God (1997 film)|Playing God]]'' (1997), ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' (1998), ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'' (2000), ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' (2002), ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003), ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' (2005), ''[[22 Jump Street]]'' (2014) and the video games ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' (2014), ''[[Until Dawn]]'' (2015) and ''[[Destiny 2]]'' (2017).\n\n==Early life==\n<!-- NOTE! His birthplace and the names of his parents as listed on most news sites are wrong, according to THE most authoritative source the Swedish government population registry.\nSo don't add his parents' names, and don't change \"Ingvar\" to \"Invar\". See talk page section \"Place of birth\". -->Stormare was born in [[Kumla]] in [[\u00d6rebro County]] Sweden, but soon after his family moved to [[Arbr\u00e5]], [[G\u00e4vleborg County]]. He changed his surname when he discovered that he shared it with a senior student at an acting academy. Like \"storm\" (a word which has the same meaning in Swedish and English), \"stormare\" is a Swedish word, meaning \"stormer\". Before settling on \"Stormare\", he briefly contemplated changing his name to \"Retep Mrots\", which is simply \"Peter Storm\" backwards.<ref>[https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2024&artikel=4683234 Mrots Retep \u00e4r i studion! (''in Swedish'')], ''Sveriges Radio''</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nStormare began his career with the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], to which he belonged for 11 years. During this period he was a favorite of famous Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, who had stopped making movies but still directed plays for Royal Dramatic Theatre. Stormare played, for example, the title role in Hamlet and Jean in Miss Julie, both directed by Ingmar Bergman. \nIn 1992, he took a leading position as associate [[artistic director]] at the Tokyo Globe Theatre, and made a name for himself through various Shakespeare performances, including ''[[Hamlet]]''. Four years later, he moved to New York City and mainly took part in English-language productions there. He played [[Carl Hamilton (fictional character)|Carl Hamilton]], a fictional Swedish [[secret agent]].

However, even this term often encompasses large suburban regions often greater than {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|-3}}, sometimes only the urban core whereas the agglomeration overtake the city limits. Thus, the \"urban core\" would be roughly comparable to the American term \"city limit\", the \"sh\u00ec q\u016b or urban area\" would be roughly comparable to \"metropolitan area\", and the

According to the Demographic research group in 2017, there are 102 Chinese cities with over 1 million people in the \"urban area\", as defined by the group's methodology.<ref name=\"demographia\">{{cite news|title=More than 100 Chinese cities now above 1 million people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/20/china-100-cities-populations-bigger-liverpool|publisher=Guardian|date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Definition and classification==\nAccording to the [[administrative divisions of China]], there are three levels of cities, namely [[direct-administered municipalities of China|direct-administered municipalities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u76f4\u8f96\u5e02}}), [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02}}), and [[county-level city|county-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u53bf\u7ea7\u5e02}}). The [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a}}) of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] and the [[free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled]] by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] are not included in this administrative classification.\n\nMunicipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a \"city\" in the strictest sense of the term, but instead an administrative unit comprising, typically, both an urban core (''a city in the strict sense'') and surrounding [[rural area|rural]] or less-urbanized areas usually many times the size of the central, built-up core.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=L.|last2=Zhao|first2=Simon X. B.|date=June 1998|title=Re-examining China's \u201cUrban\u201d Concept and the Level of Urbanization|journal=The China Quarterly|language=en|volume=154|pages=330\u2013381|doi=10.1017/S030574100000206X}}</ref>\n\nPrefecture-level cities nearly always contain multiple [[counties of China|counties]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u53bf}}), [[county-level city|county-level cities]], and other such sub-divisions. To distinguish a prefecture-level city from its actual urban area (''city in the strict sense''), the term \"{{lang|zh-hans|\u5e02\u533a}}\" (''sh\u00ec q\u016b''; \"urban area\") is used. However, even this term often encompasses large suburban regions often greater than {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|-3}}, sometimes only the urban core whereas the agglomeration overtake the city limits. Thus, the \"urban core\" would be roughly comparable to the American term \"city limit\", the \"sh\u00ec q\u016b or urban area\" would be roughly comparable to \"metropolitan area\", and the municipality is a political designation defining regions under control of a municipal government, which has no comparable designation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== List of major cities by

A carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres across Ontario. At the centres, highly-skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test mixes the sample with a test kit containing chemicals designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between two temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 12 to 24 hours.\n\nIn early April, Ontario has contracted Spartan Bioscience Inc. from Ottawa to supply it with virus-RNA testing systems that process a single swab sample in 30 to 60 minutes <ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/13/ontario-orders-close-to-one-million-spartan-bioscience-portable-covid-19-test-kits.html|title=Ontario orders close to one million Spartan Bioscience portable COVID-19 test kits}} </ref>. The contract was for 900,000 swab test kits, whereas the number of machines has not been disclosed. While these machines cannot process many samples in total, they have the advantage of being small and easy to use. Thus, they can be used to provide rapid results at the point-of-care. They are expected to be useful at border crossings, isolated communities, prisons, and care homes.\n\n==== Serology tests ====\nOntario is performing experiments testing the performance of blood tests that look for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus <ref> {{cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2020/04/20/covid-19-community-spread-in-ontario-has-likely-reached-its-peak-new-modelling-shows/|title=COVID-19 community spread in Ontario has likely reached its peak, new modelling shows}}</ref>. Antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these tests are not well-suited for detecting a current infection. However, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the past.\n\n=== Testing Facilities ===\n\nPublic Health Ontario has six testing laboratories to which samples can be sent. The main laboratory is the top four floors of MaRS Centre in downtown Toronto <ref> {{cite web| url=https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/canada/2020/04/10/a-virtual-tour-of-a-public-health-ontario-lab-ramping-up-its-covid-19-testing.html?fbclid=IwAR09umcjbDihhlDeBgrtnnU9lD5ts73VIcN0N6_55XSC4Cwv5M6Nb0QAREU| title=A virtual tour of a Public Health Ontario lab ramping up its COVID-19 testing}} </ref>.

In addition to the six public health labs, this includes 10 hospital networks and three private lab networks, including Dynacare and LifeLabs <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/04/how-ontario-turned-the-tide-on-a-huge-backlog-of-covid-19-tests.html|title=How Ontario turned the tide on a huge backlog of COVID-19 tests}}</ref>.\n\n=== Testing Access ===\nAccess to testing is set by Public Health Ontario who publishes a guidance document that defines the conditions for an individual to be tested<ref> {{Cite web|url=www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/2019_covid_testing_guidance.pdf}}</ref>. Conditions have included close contact with a test-confirmed case, recent travel, admission to hospital for serious symptoms, healthcare worker, longterm care home resident, etc.  The set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from January to April 2020, at times reducing access and at other times increasing access to testing <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw}}</ref>. Starting in March, various public health units across the province have opened assessment centres, which members of the public can visit if directed by a health professional. This diverts potentially infected people from hospitals and doctors' offices. If warranted, the centre will collect a swab from a visitor for testing. Swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public health officials, for example, at longterm care homes.\n\nSince many cases are not tested, the number of test-confirmed cases, which are the infection numbers reported by the Ontario government, should not be misconstrued as the actual number of infections, which have been estimated to be a factor of 20 to 100 higher \n<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/stay-home-covid-19-spreading-in-community-100s-could-be-infected-says-ottawas-medical-officer-of-health/|title=STAY HOME: COVID-19 spreading in the community, 100s could be infected, says Ottawa's medical officer of health}}</ref>. Unlike some countries, the number of suspected or probable infections is not reported by the Ontario government.\n\n=== Testing Performance ===\nThe bar chart to the right shows the number of tests performed per day, the daily backlog, and the percentage of positive tests in Ontario for March and April 2020. The WHO advises to test every suspected case. Positive test rates above 10% indicate that the testing is too targeted and the number of test-confirmed cases will not accurately indicate the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population. This 10% limit was exceeded on multiple days in early April. Since a relatively limited number of cases are tested, the actual number of cases will be much higher than the test-confirmed numbers.\n\n[[File:COVID-19 Ontario Testing Rates.png|thumb|The COVID-19 testing rates in Ontario from March to April 2020, Source:[https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario|data.ontario.ca]]] \n\nIn late March and April, Ontario was performing the lowest number of tests per capita of all the provinces <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid19-test-ontario-waiting-lab-results-coronavirus-1.5510644}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw}} </ref> but had high testing numbers compared to most western countries (see [[Template:COVID-19 testing by country subdivision]]).\n\nOn April 15, polling firms, Forum Research and Mainstreet Research, released results of a survey conducted on April 11 and 12 about COVID-19 prevalence and testing.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/one-fifth-of-ontario-households-have-one-or-more-symptoms-of-covid-19/ |title= COVID-19 Symptom Study - Ontario}}</ref> Of the 5,045 respondents, 19% of households contained someone who had at least one symptom and in 8% of households someone had a key symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath). Only 2% of households contained someone who had been tested.\n\n=== Testing Capacity ===\nSince January 2020, Ontario has been increasing its capacity to perform testing based on RT-PCR. Various factors have impeded this increase, including shortages of [[reagent]] chemicals for the RT-PCR machines and shortages of validated swabs. To tackle these challenges, labs have adapted. In particular, RT-PCR machines from multiple manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different sets of chemicals.  New suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly. Returning tests results to individuals is automated with an online portal <ref> {{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6773258/coronavirus-ontario-online-test-results-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus: Ontario announces online portal to check COVID-19 test results}}</ref>.\n\n==== Testing Capacity Projections ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[World Health Organization]] says that jurisdictions should aim to test every suspected case of COVID-19<ref name=\"auto1\"> {{Cite web| url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331509/WHO-COVID-19-lab_testing-2020.1-eng.pdf| title=Laboratory testing strategy recommendations for COVID-19, Interim Guidance 21 March 2020}}</ref>. \n\n=== Types of Tests ===\n==== Virus-RNA tests ====\nAs of April 2020, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in Ontario is conducted using a method called [[RT-PCR]]. A carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres across Ontario. At the centres, highly-skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test mixes the sample with a test kit containing chemicals designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between two temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 12 to 24 hours.\n\nIn early April, Ontario has contracted Spartan Bioscience Inc. from Ottawa to supply it with virus-RNA testing systems that process a single swab sample in 30 to 60 minutes <ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/13/ontario-orders-close-to-one-million-spartan-bioscience-portable-covid-19-test-kits.html|title=Ontario orders close to one million Spartan Bioscience portable COVID-19 test kits}} </ref>. The contract was for 900,000 swab test kits, whereas the number of machines has not been disclosed. While these machines cannot process many samples in total, they have the advantage of being small and easy to use. Thus, they can be used to provide rapid results at the point-of-care. They are expected to be useful at border crossings, isolated communities, prisons, and care homes.\n\n==== Serology tests ====\nOntario is performing experiments testing the performance of blood tests that look for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus <ref> {{cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2020/04/20/covid-19-community-spread-in-ontario-has-likely-reached-its-peak-new-modelling-shows/|title=COVID-19 community spread in Ontario has likely reached its peak, new modelling shows}}</ref>. Antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these tests are not well-suited for detecting a current infection. However, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the past.\n\n=== Testing Facilities ===\n\nPublic Health Ontario has six testing laboratories to which samples can be sent. The main laboratory is the top four floors of MaRS Centre in downtown Toronto <ref> {{cite web| url=https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/canada/2020/04/10/a-virtual-tour-of-a-public-health-ontario-lab-ramping-up-its-covid-19-testing.html?fbclid=IwAR09umcjbDihhlDeBgrtnnU9lD5ts73VIcN0N6_55XSC4Cwv5M6Nb0QAREU| title=A virtual tour of a Public Health Ontario lab ramping up its COVID-19 testing}} </ref>.

In addition to the six public health labs, this includes 10 hospital networks and three private lab networks, including Dynacare and LifeLabs <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/04/how-ontario-turned-the-tide-on-a-huge-backlog-of-covid-19-tests.html|title=How Ontario turned the tide on a huge backlog of COVID-19 tests}}</ref>.\n\n=== Testing Access ===\nAccess to testing is set by Public Health Ontario who publishes a guidance document that defines the conditions for an individual to be tested<ref> {{Cite web|url=www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/2019_covid_testing_guidance.pdf}}</ref>. Conditions have included close contact with a test-confirmed case, recent travel, admission to hospital for serious symptoms, healthcare worker, longterm care home resident, etc.  The set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from January to April 2020, at times reducing access and at other times increasing access to testing <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw}}</ref>. Starting in March, various public health units across the province have opened assessment centres, which members of the public can visit if directed by a health professional. This diverts potentially infected people from hospitals and doctors' offices. If warranted, the centre will collect a swab from a visitor for testing. Swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public health officials, for example, at longterm care homes.\n\nSince many cases are not tested, the number of test-confirmed cases, which are the infection numbers reported by the Ontario government, should not be misconstrued as the actual number of infections, which have been estimated to be a factor of 20 to 100 higher \n<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/stay-home-covid-19-spreading-in-community-100s-could-be-infected-says-ottawas-medical-officer-of-health/|title=STAY HOME: COVID-19 spreading in the community, 100s could be infected, says Ottawa's medical officer of health}}</ref>. Unlike some countries, the number of suspected or probable infections is not reported by the Ontario government.\n\n=== Testing Performance ===\nThe bar chart to the right shows the number of tests performed per day, the daily backlog, and the percentage of positive tests in Ontario for March and April 2020. The WHO advises to test every suspected case. Positive test rates above 10% indicate that the testing is too targeted and the number of test-confirmed cases will not accurately indicate the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population. This 10% limit was exceeded on multiple days in early April. Since a relatively limited number of cases are tested, the actual number of cases will be much higher than the test-confirmed numbers.\n\n[[File:COVID-19 Ontario Testing Rates.png|thumb|The COVID-19 testing rates in Ontario from March to April 2020, Source:[https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario|data.ontario.ca]]] \n\nIn late March and April, Ontario was performing the lowest number of tests per capita of all the provinces <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid19-test-ontario-waiting-lab-results-coronavirus-1.5510644}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw}} </ref> but had high testing numbers compared to most western countries (see [[Template:COVID-19 testing by country subdivision]]).\n\nOn April 15, polling firms, Forum Research and Mainstreet Research, released results of a survey conducted on April 11 and 12 about COVID-19 prevalence and testing.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/one-fifth-of-ontario-households-have-one-or-more-symptoms-of-covid-19/ |title= COVID-19 Symptom Study - Ontario}}</ref> Of the 5,045 respondents, 19% of households contained someone who had at least one symptom and in 8% of households someone had a key symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath). Only 2% of households contained someone who had been tested.\n\n=== Testing Capacity ===\nSince January 2020, Ontario has been increasing its capacity to perform testing based on RT-PCR. Various factors have impeded this increase, including shortages of [[reagent]] chemicals for the RT-PCR machines and shortages of validated swabs. To tackle these challenges, labs have adapted. In particular, RT-PCR machines from multiple manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different sets of chemicals.  New suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly. Returning tests results to individuals is automated with an online portal <ref> {{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6773258/coronavirus-ontario-online-test-results-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus: Ontario announces online portal to check COVID-19 test results}}</ref>.\n\n==== Testing Capacity Projections ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
