Today, it is considered a cult classic that was underrated at the time of its release. Originally planned to be made as a bilingual, in Tamil and in Malayalam, the film released first in Tamil only, while the Malayalam version, '''''Raakilipattu''''', as well as the dubbed Hindi version, ''Friendship'', released seven years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354922/releaseinfo#akas|title=Snegithiye|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/malayalam/article/28481.html|title=IndiaGlitz - Howzzat?

They stay up late, break rules and wreak havoc at their hostel much to their lecturers' annoyance. They also form a rivalry against Gita ([[Ishita Arun]]), the college queen bee. Malathi ([[Lakshmi]]), Radhika's aunt, wants her niece to complete her studies so that she can take over her late parents' multi-million business. In order to straighten Radhika out, Malathi arranges for her to get married.\n\nAt this point, Vani and Radhika are introduced to Gayathri ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), a fiercely independent and strong police officer and an alumnus of their college. During at an event at the college, Gayathri explains how women in their country lose their independence and livelihood after getting married. Convinced that they should avoid marriage as much as possible, Vani and Radhika pretend that Radhika has a boyfriend from overseas named Ramesh in order to avoid Malathi from arranging anymore suitors. However, this fantasy takes on a whole new meaning when an actual person named Ramesh ([[Major Ravi]]) calls and sends Radhika letters claiming to be her boyfriend. To end this nuisance, Vani and Radhika invite Ramesh to their hostel during the college dance program and hand over the impostor to the police. Vani instructs Radhika to bring her aunt's guns for their safety.\n\nHowever, a mysterious shooter kills Ramesh before the girls can confront him. Fearing that suspicion will fall on them, they decide to dispose of the body by hiding it in the air ventilator. Unexpectedly, the body slides down the vent and lands on the auditorium stage in the middle of a performance. Gayathri, who is the guest of honour at the event, takes charge of the case. She finds Radhika's necklace on the body and the two girls are brought to help with the investigation. At the police station, an old woman shows up claiming that Ramesh is her son and he has gone missing. Knowing that their story will be difficult to believe, Vani and Radhika escape police custody and hide out at an abandoned mansion in the outskirts of the city.\n\nRealizing that they are now the prime suspects of Ramesh's murder, they decide to find the real killer before Gayathri catches up on them. Vasu suspects Malathi of framing them in order to inherit her family's wealth. When Vani and Radhika finally seize the chance to meet her, Malathi explains that she had known all along that the girls have been fooling her. The young man who was pretending to be Ramesh is actually the son of a family friend named Vikram, whom Malathi planned to marry Radhika off to.\n\nThrough their college friends, the girls discover that Gita had gone missing on that fateful night. Through much difficulty, the girls find Gita hiding at a border town in. However, Gita reveals that she too is on the run from Gayathri because she had witnessed Gayathri killing Vikram that night. On the night of murder, she returned to hostel to take medications, witnessed the murder and fled from the scene as Gayathri will use her influence to cover up her crime. Unfortunately, Gayathri manages to catch up on the trio. However, the woman pretending to be Ramesh's mother from earlier turns out to be a CBI officer who has been investigating Gayathri and knows the girls were not responsible for Vikram's murder.\n\nBecause of her mental stress, Gayathri ends up going insane. The CBI officer then reveals that Gayathri murdered Vikram to avenge her sister's paralysis because Vikram raped her after Gayathri found out he was a womanizer and stopped her sister from dating him. To escape justice, she had to frame Vani and Radhika as the murderers. The film concludes with Gayathri institutionalized at a mental asylum where the three girls, now close friends, paying her a visit.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Jyothika Saravanan|Jyothika]] as Vani Subramaniam (Vasu) / Josephine (Josootty) (Voice dubbed by [[Savitha Reddy]] in Tamil and [[Bhagyalakshmi]] in Malayalam)\n* [[Sharbani Mukherjee]] as Radhika (Voice dubbed by [[Sreeja Ravi]])\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as ACP Gayathri (Voice dubbed by [[Saritha]] in Tamil and [[Ambili]] in Malayalam)                    \n* [[Ishita Arun]] as Geetha\n* [[Shweta Menon]] as police officer Jayshree\n* [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Malathi(voice Dubbed By Anandavaly)\n* [[K.

Priyadarshan heard about the film and asked producer Mukesh Mehta to see it and decide whether he would like to produce the movie and thus Mehta went to Bombay, saw the film and liked it. However the producer reiterated that they have taken only the main thread from the Marathi story with the rest of the film, its sub-plots and the treatment are completely different from the original. Initially, it was planned as a Malayalam film with a cast familiar to the Kerala audience. But as Priyadarshan's excitement over the project grew, the canvas got wider and the producer decided to look for a bigger audience.

They stay up late, break rules and wreak havoc at their hostel much to their lecturers' annoyance. They also form a rivalry against Gita ([[Ishita Arun]]), the college queen bee. Malathi ([[Lakshmi]]), Radhika's aunt, wants her niece to complete her studies so that she can take over her late parents' multi-million business. In order to straighten Radhika out, Malathi arranges for her to get married.\n\nAt this point, Vani and Radhika are introduced to Gayathri ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), a fiercely independent and strong police officer and an alumnus of their college. During at an event at the college, Gayathri explains how women in their country lose their independence and livelihood after getting married. Convinced that they should avoid marriage as much as possible, Vani and Radhika pretend that Radhika has a boyfriend from overseas named Ramesh in order to avoid Malathi from arranging anymore suitors. However, this fantasy takes on a whole new meaning when an actual person named Ramesh ([[Major Ravi]]) calls and sends Radhika letters claiming to be her boyfriend. To end this nuisance, Vani and Radhika invite Ramesh to their hostel during the college dance program and hand over the impostor to the police. Vani instructs Radhika to bring her aunt's guns for their safety.\n\nHowever, a mysterious shooter kills Ramesh before the girls can confront him. Fearing that suspicion will fall on them, they decide to dispose of the body by hiding it in the air ventilator. Unexpectedly, the body slides down the vent and lands on the auditorium stage in the middle of a performance. Gayathri, who is the guest of honour at the event, takes charge of the case. She finds Radhika's necklace on the body and the two girls are brought to help with the investigation. At the police station, an old woman shows up claiming that Ramesh is her son and he has gone missing. Knowing that their story will be difficult to believe, Vani and Radhika escape police custody and hide out at an abandoned mansion in the outskirts of the city.\n\nRealizing that they are now the prime suspects of Ramesh's murder, they decide to find the real killer before Gayathri catches up on them. Vasu suspects Malathi of framing them in order to inherit her family's wealth. When Vani and Radhika finally seize the chance to meet her, Malathi explains that she had known all along that the girls have been fooling her. The young man who was pretending to be Ramesh is actually the son of a family friend named Vikram, whom Malathi planned to marry Radhika off to.\n\nThrough their college friends, the girls discover that Gita had gone missing on that fateful night. Through much difficulty, the girls find Gita hiding at a border town in. However, Gita reveals that she too is on the run from Gayathri because she had witnessed Gayathri killing Vikram that night. On the night of murder, she returned to hostel to take medications, witnessed the murder and fled from the scene as Gayathri will use her influence to cover up her crime. Unfortunately, Gayathri manages to catch up on the trio. However, the woman pretending to be Ramesh's mother from earlier turns out to be a CBI officer who has been investigating Gayathri and knows the girls were not responsible for Vikram's murder.\n\nBecause of her mental stress, Gayathri ends up going insane. The CBI officer then reveals that Gayathri murdered Vikram to avenge her sister's paralysis because Vikram raped her after Gayathri found out he was a womanizer and stopped her sister from dating him. To escape justice, she had to frame Vani and Radhika as the murderers. The film concludes with Gayathri institutionalized at a mental asylum where the three girls, now close friends, paying her a visit.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Jyothika Saravanan|Jyothika]] as Vani Subramaniam (Vasu) / Josephine (Josootty) (Voice dubbed by [[Savitha Reddy]] in Tamil and [[Bhagyalakshmi]] in Malayalam)\n* [[Sharbani Mukherjee]] as Radhika (Voice dubbed by [[Sreeja Ravi]])\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as ACP Gayathri (Voice dubbed by [[Saritha]] in Tamil and [[Ambili]] in Malayalam)                    \n* [[Ishita Arun]] as Geetha\n* [[Shweta Menon]] as police officer Jayshree\n* [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Malathi(voice Dubbed By Anandavaly)\n* [[K.

[[Lake Norman]] on the [[Catawba River]] is {{convert|3|to|8|mi|0}} west of the town center.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Mooresville has a total area of {{convert|54.3|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|54.2|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.1|km2|order=flip|2}}, or 0.24%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe area that would develop into the town of Mooresville was originally settled by English, German, and Scot-Irish families who moved into the area from nearby [[Rowan County, North Carolina|Rowan County]], as well as from [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and elsewhere. Many were seeking new lands on which to establish farms. Many of the early families such as the Wilsons, Davidsons, Cowans, Sherrills, Torrances, and others came to the area as early as the mid-1700s. They formed small communities that eventually grew into the community known as \"Deep Well\", which took its name from a large natural well that was found in the area.\n\nMany of these families established large farms, primarily of cotton, which grew into small plantations by the 1850s. Major Rufus Reid was the most prominent planter in the area, enslaving 81 African Americans on over {{convert|2000|acre}} of land. His property was known as [[Mount Mourne Plantation]], named after the [[Mourne Mountains]] of [[County Down]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. Several other historic plantation homes are set in the area as well, including the [[Johnson-Neel House]], the [[Cornelius House (Mooresville, North Carolina)|Cornelius House]], Forest Dell Plantation, and the colonial era Belmont Plantation.\n\nIn 1856, a railroad was placed on a ridge that crossed the land of a local farmer by the name of [[John Franklin Moore]]. A small scale planter, Moore set up a depot on his land, and encouraged others to help establish a small village on the location in the late 1850s. The little village, known as \"Moore's Siding\", was born. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] hampered developments, with the railroad tracks being removed to aid the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] efforts in Virginia. After the war, the tracks were returned, and Moore's Siding slowly began to prosper.\n\nShortly after the Civil War, John Franklin Moore saw the need for the village to incorporate into a town. The town was incorporated as Mooresville in 1873. Moore helped to establish the first brick factory in Mooresville, and built some of the first brick buildings on Main Street. He died in 1877, and his wife, Rachel Summrow Moore, continued the development of the town.\n\nIn 1883 the railroad lines were run back through the town with the addition of a new depot.<ref>Town of Mooresville Board of Commissioner Minutes, Book 1, Mooresville, 1875</ref> The railroad brought growth to the town, which continued with the addition of the first water plant in the early 1890s, the establishment of a library in 1899, a phone company in 1893 and the first of many textile mills in 1900.<ref>Mooresville, North Carolina - the early years, First Edition, Mooresville, 1967.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, artist Alicia Weincek painted the mural ''North Carolina Cotton Industry'' in the town's post office, having won a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] competition for the commissioned work. \n \nThe Mooresville Moors were a [[minor league baseball]] team who played in the Class D North Carolina State League from 1937 to 1942. The league ceased operations for two seasons due to World War II but was reorganized in 1945.\n\n[[Selma Burke]], a prominent sculptor during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] who was born and raised in Mooresville, created the bust of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for the [[Four Freedoms]] plaque on the [[Recorder of Deeds]] building in Washington, D.C. The bust would later be used for the image on the [[United States dime]].\n\nOn December 11, 2014, [[Duke Energy]], to repair a rusted, leaking pipe, received approval from North Carolina to dump [[coal ash]] (containing [[arsenic]], [[lead]], [[thallium]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], among other [[heavy metals]]) from the [[Marshall Steam Station]] {{convert|10|mi|0}} west of Mooresville into Lake Norman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hickoryrecord.com/news/duke-to-repair-leaky-pipe-at-coal-ash-dump-in/article_2bd33b10-8185-11e4-989c-e347c5127e28.html|title=Duke to repair leaky pipe at coal ash dump in Catawba County|work=HDR - Hickory Daily Record|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn October 3, 2015, Duke reported that a [[sinkhole]] had formed at the base of the Marshall Steam Station dam on Lake Norman.

[[Lake Norman]] on the [[Catawba River]] is {{convert|3|to|8|mi|0}} west of the town center.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Mooresville has a total area of {{convert|54.3|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|54.2|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.1|km2|order=flip|2}}, or 0.24%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe area that would develop into the town of Mooresville was originally settled by English, German, and Scot-Irish families who moved into the area from nearby [[Rowan County, North Carolina|Rowan County]], as well as from [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and elsewhere. Many were seeking new lands on which to establish farms. Many of the early families such as the Wilsons, Davidsons, Cowans, Sherrills, Torrances, and others came to the area as early as the mid-1700s. They formed small communities that eventually grew into the community known as \"Deep Well\", which took its name from a large natural well that was found in the area.\n\nMany of these families established large farms, primarily of cotton, which grew into small plantations by the 1850s. Major Rufus Reid was the most prominent planter in the area, enslaving 81 African Americans on over {{convert|2000|acre}} of land. His property was known as [[Mount Mourne Plantation]], named after the [[Mourne Mountains]] of [[County Down]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. Several other historic plantation homes are set in the area as well, including the [[Johnson-Neel House]], the [[Cornelius House (Mooresville, North Carolina)|Cornelius House]], Forest Dell Plantation, and the colonial era Belmont Plantation.\n\nIn 1856, a railroad was placed on a ridge that crossed the land of a local farmer by the name of [[John Franklin Moore]]. A small scale planter, Moore set up a depot on his land, and encouraged others to help establish a small village on the location in the late 1850s. The little village, known as \"Moore's Siding\", was born. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] hampered developments, with the railroad tracks being removed to aid the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] efforts in Virginia. After the war, the tracks were returned, and Moore's Siding slowly began to prosper.\n\nShortly after the Civil War, John Franklin Moore saw the need for the village to incorporate into a town. The town was incorporated as Mooresville in 1873. Moore helped to establish the first brick factory in Mooresville, and built some of the first brick buildings on Main Street. He died in 1877, and his wife, Rachel Summrow Moore, continued the development of the town.\n\nIn 1883 the railroad lines were run back through the town with the addition of a new depot.<ref>Town of Mooresville Board of Commissioner Minutes, Book 1, Mooresville, 1875</ref> The railroad brought growth to the town, which continued with the addition of the first water plant in the early 1890s, the establishment of a library in 1899, a phone company in 1893 and the first of many textile mills in 1900.<ref>Mooresville, North Carolina - the early years, First Edition, Mooresville, 1967.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, artist Alicia Weincek painted the mural ''North Carolina Cotton Industry'' in the town's post office, having won a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] competition for the commissioned work. \n \nThe Mooresville Moors were a [[minor league baseball]] team who played in the Class D North Carolina State League from 1937 to 1942. The league ceased operations for two seasons due to World War II but was reorganized in 1945.\n\n[[Selma Burke]], a prominent sculptor during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] who was born and raised in Mooresville, created the bust of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for the [[Four Freedoms]] plaque on the [[Recorder of Deeds]] building in Washington, D.C. The bust would later be used for the image on the [[United States dime]].\n\nOn December 11, 2014, [[Duke Energy]], to repair a rusted, leaking pipe, received approval from North Carolina to dump [[coal ash]] (containing [[arsenic]], [[lead]], [[thallium]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], among other [[heavy metals]]) from the [[Marshall Steam Station]] {{convert|10|mi|0}} west of Mooresville into Lake Norman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hickoryrecord.com/news/duke-to-repair-leaky-pipe-at-coal-ash-dump-in/article_2bd33b10-8185-11e4-989c-e347c5127e28.html|title=Duke to repair leaky pipe at coal ash dump in Catawba County|work=HDR - Hickory Daily Record|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn October 3, 2015, Duke reported that a [[sinkhole]] had formed at the base of the Marshall Steam Station dam on Lake Norman.
