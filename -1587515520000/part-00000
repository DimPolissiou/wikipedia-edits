{"title_page": "Kilnavert", "text_new": "'''Kilnavert''' ({{Irish derived place name|Cill na bhFeart|The Church of the Tumuli}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The present local pronunciation is ''Killnavart'' but up to the 1870s the local pronunciation was ''Kilfertin''.[[File:St Patrick&#039;s church, Kildallon, Co. Cavan - geograph.org.uk - 1385727.jpg|thumb|St Patrick&#039;s church, Kildallon, Co. Cavan - geograph.org.uk - 1385727]]\n\n==Geography==\n\nKilnavert is bounded on the north by [[Lissanover]] and [[Killycluggin]] townlands, on the west by [[Gortnaleck]] and [[Camagh]] townlands, on the south by [[Derrycassan]] townland and on the east by [[Corran, County Cavan]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Camagh Lough, a gravel pit, a wood, streams, a spring well and dug wells. Kilnavert is traversed by the national secondary [[R205 road (Ireland)]], minor roads, rural lanes and the disused [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]]. The townland covers 188 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe reason for the Irish name Cill na bhFeart meaning ''The Church of the Tumuli'', is that there is a Roman Catholic church and eight prehistoric monuments in the townland, including 3 barrows ([[Tumulus]]), 3 standing stones, 1 wedge tomb and 1 stone circle.<ref name=\"templeport1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/magh-slecht-dara-fort/plain-of-blood.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Plain of Blood : A Study of the Ritual Landscape of Magh Slecht, Co. Cavan |author=Kevin White |website=Templeport.ie |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nKilnavert is intimately associated with [[Saint Patrick]] and his overthrow of the idol [[Crom Cruach]] in [[Magh Sl\u00e9cht]]. Kilnavert was originally named Fossa Sl\u00e9cht or Rath Sl\u00e9cht and was the first Christian church founded in [[County Cavan]] by [[Saint Patrick]]. [[T\u00edrech\u00e1n]]'s Memoir written c.680 A.D.<ref>[Bury, J.B. (1902) ''T\u00edrech\u00e1n's Memoir of St. Patrick'']</ref> states-\n\n''Patrick however, sending Methbrain, a foreign kinsman of Patrick's, to Fossam Sl\u00e9cht, who told wonders of God.''\n\nThe 9th century [[Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii]], p.&nbsp;93, states- ''Patrick founded a church in that stead, namely, Domnach Maighe Sleacht, and left therein Mabran [whose cognomen is] Barbarus Patricii, a relative of his and a prophet. And there is Patrick's well, wherein he baptized many. Then Patrick went into the province of Connaught by Snam da En over the Shannon''.\n \nMethbrain, also known as [[Banban the Wise]] was the first Christian priest of Templeport.\n\nKilnavert is mentioned several times in the 14th century Book of Magauran.<ref>{{Citation |author= L. McKenna |title=The Book of Magauran |year=1947 |ref=BM}}</ref>\n\nFor example-\n\nPoem 21, stanza 18, written c.1338 refers to Saint Patrick at Kilnavert-\n\n''One day when Patrick lay to rest at fair soft-grassed Chill Fhearta, this vision, so consoling to us, was given to his prophetic eye......''\n\nPoem 2, Stanza 36 written c.1291\n\n''Achadh Fearta, home of stout heroes, where the tombs of our forebears lie side by side. Its name comes from the tombs of the noble Gaoidhil being placed unceasingly on that stone-strewn plain.''\n\nSince the 5th century, Kilnavert has formed part of the church lands belonging to Kilnavert Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then in 1609 granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nOn 26 October 1579 [[Pope Gregory XIII]] asked [[Richard Brady]], the [[Bishop of Ardagh]] to settle a dispute where the parish priest of Templeport, Fergal Magauran, claimed the chapel of ''Cillfert'' was usurped by nobles.<ref>Vatican Archives, Dataria Apostolica, Minutae Brevium Lateranensium, n. 20099.</ref>\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the church lands of Kilfert to consist of two polls of land at a yearly value of 2 shillings''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GuNaAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA71&dq=Kilfert&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOv8vT2LrdAhVLIMAKHUQjD_gQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=Kilfert&f=false|title=Monasticon Hibernicum: or, a history of the abbeys, priories, and other religious houses in Ireland; interspersed with memoirs of their several founders and benefactors, and of their abbots and other superiors, to the time of their final suppression: Likewise, an account of the manner in which the possessions belonging to those foundations were disposed of, and the present state of their ruins, collected from english, irish, and foreign historians, records, and other authentic documents, and from many curious and valuable manuscripts.

A bad time it was for priests and papists; yet, notwithstanding, Cormac and Charles rode on Sunday mornings to '''Killnavart''', to hear Mass, a distance of some ten or twelve miles; and, having come there, they attached their horses by their bridle-reins to the branches of trees near the chapel. Baron MacGauran was then Earl of Tullaghagh, and heard Mass at '''Killnavart'''. He observed the two strange young men at Mass, and their horses tied by their bridles to trees near the chapel; he enquired to whom the horses belonged, and where the owners were from. Having been informed on those points, the Baron invited the young men to dinner on the following Sunday; and soon afterwards proffered them a residence in the neighbourhood of Ballymagauran, and they willingly accepted the invitation. Almost immediately afterwards Cormac Dolan, the elder son, married a near relative of the Baron,\u2014the daughter of Terence MacGauran, who was better known as Trealach Caoch or \"Blind Terry,\" in consequence of his being squint-eyed. But the Baron's hospitality and Dolan's marriage became a great misfortune to both parties.''\n''In due time after the marriage a son was born to Cormac Dolan; about the same time another child was born for Baron MacGauran, who claimed that his relative Cormac Dolan's wife and daughter of Blind Terry should nurse his (the Baron's) child. Bryan Dolan took this demand as a great insult: he instructed his daughter-in-law to say that he had not come so low that she should become a \"hippin-washer\" to any man. This message enraged the Baron to madness; he at once rode to Dolan's house, called for the old man, whom he seized by the hair of the head and dragged him by the horse's side at full gallop, and threw him dead on the road. The sons Cormac and Charles seeing the Baron gallop furiously to their house, and immediately galloping back dragging something by his horse's side, one said to the other \"the Baron is dragging something after him;\" the other exclaimed with an oath \"it is my father,\" and, snapping up a gun that lay near, he rushed to the road and shot the Baron dead on the spot. Old Dolan and the Baron were just buried when the relatives and retainers of the Baron came at night, broke into Dolan's dwelling, and killed the brothers Cormac and Charles. Cormac's wife exclaimed, were there none of the friends of Blind Terry there? They spared her and her child, whose name was Rodger, and reared him up as one of themselves.''\n\nThe Baron MacGauran referred to was probably the chief of the McGovern Clan, [[Tomas \u00d3g M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]], who lived in [[Ballymagauran]] and who received a pardon on 19 January 1586 from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], ''Thomas oge m'Brien m'Thomas Magawran, of Magawranstowne'', for fighting against the Queen's forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofdeputyke1416irel/reportofdeputyke1416irel_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"The ... report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records in Ireland / presented to both houses of the Parliament by command of Her Majesty\" |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Kilfart''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf |title=Map of Tullyhaw, County Cavan |format=PDF |website=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html |title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map |website=Templeport.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as ''Kilfart''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Kilfert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 |title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project |website=Downsurvey.tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Killfert''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan|title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project|website=downsurvey.tcd.ie}}</ref>\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Kilfart''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Kilfort'' which map meant the land was still belonging to the Anglican Church of Ireland.

Kilnavert was originally named Fossa Sl\u00e9cht or Rath Sl\u00e9cht and was the first Christian church founded in [[County Cavan]] by [[Saint Patrick]].

(1902) ''T\u00edrech\u00e1n's Memoir of St. Patrick'']</ref> states-\n\n''Patrick however, sending Methbrain, a foreign kinsman of Patrick's, to Fossam Sl\u00e9cht, who told wonders of God.''\n\nThe 9th century [[Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii]], p.&nbsp;93, states- ''Patrick founded a church in that stead, namely, Domnach Maighe Sleacht, and left therein Mabran [whose cognomen is] Barbarus Patricii, a relative of his and a prophet. And there is Patrick's well, wherein he baptized many. Then Patrick went into the province of Connaught by Snam da En over the Shannon''.\n \nMethbrain, also known as [[Banban the Wise]] was the first Christian priest of Templeport.\n\nKilnavert is mentioned several times in the 14th century Book of Magauran.<ref>{{Citation |author= L.

Its name comes from the tombs of the noble Gaoidhil being placed unceasingly on that stone-strewn plain.''\n\nSince the 5th century, Kilnavert has formed part of the church lands belonging to Kilnavert Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then in 1609 granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nOn 26 October 1579 [[Pope Gregory XIII]] asked [[Richard Brady]], the [[Bishop of Ardagh]] to settle a dispute where the parish priest of Templeport, Fergal Magauran, claimed the chapel of ''Cillfert'' was usurped by nobles.<ref>Vatican Archives, Dataria Apostolica, Minutae Brevium Lateranensium, n. 20099.</ref>\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the church lands of Kilfert to consist of two polls of land at a yearly value of 2 shillings''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GuNaAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA71&dq=Kilfert&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOv8vT2LrdAhVLIMAKHUQjD_gQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&q=Kilfert&f=false|title=Monasticon Hibernicum: or, a history of the abbeys, priories, and other religious houses in Ireland; interspersed with memoirs of their several founders and benefactors, and of their abbots and other superiors, to the time of their final suppression: Likewise, an account of the manner in which the possessions belonging to those foundations were disposed of, and the present state of their ruins, collected from english, irish, and foreign historians, records, and other authentic documents, and from many curious and valuable manuscripts.

A bad time it was for priests and papists; yet, notwithstanding, Cormac and Charles rode on Sunday mornings to '''Killnavart''', to hear Mass, a distance of some ten or twelve miles; and, having come there, they attached their horses by their bridle-reins to the branches of trees near the chapel. Baron MacGauran was then Earl of Tullaghagh, and heard Mass at '''Killnavart'''. He observed the two strange young men at Mass, and their horses tied by their bridles to trees near the chapel; he enquired to whom the horses belonged, and where the owners were from. Having been informed on those points, the Baron invited the young men to dinner on the following Sunday; and soon afterwards proffered them a residence in the neighbourhood of Ballymagauran, and they willingly accepted the invitation. Almost immediately afterwards Cormac Dolan, the elder son, married a near relative of the Baron,\u2014the daughter of Terence MacGauran, who was better known as Trealach Caoch or \"Blind Terry,\" in consequence of his being squint-eyed. But the Baron's hospitality and Dolan's marriage became a great misfortune to both parties.''\n''In due time after the marriage a son was born to Cormac Dolan; about the same time another child was born for Baron MacGauran, who claimed that his relative Cormac Dolan's wife and daughter of Blind Terry should nurse his (the Baron's) child. Bryan Dolan took this demand as a great insult: he instructed his daughter-in-law to say that he had not come so low that she should become a \"hippin-washer\" to any man. This message enraged the Baron to madness; he at once rode to Dolan's house, called for the old man, whom he seized by the hair of the head and dragged him by the horse's side at full gallop, and threw him dead on the road. The sons Cormac and Charles seeing the Baron gallop furiously to their house, and immediately galloping back dragging something by his horse's side, one said to the other \"the Baron is dragging something after him;\" the other exclaimed with an oath \"it is my father,\" and, snapping up a gun that lay near, he rushed to the road and shot the Baron dead on the spot. Old Dolan and the Baron were just buried when the relatives and retainers of the Baron came at night, broke into Dolan's dwelling, and killed the brothers Cormac and Charles. Cormac's wife exclaimed, were there none of the friends of Blind Terry there? They spared her and her child, whose name was Rodger, and reared him up as one of themselves.''\n\nThe Baron MacGauran referred to was probably the chief of the McGovern Clan, [[Tomas \u00d3g M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]], who lived in [[Ballymagauran]] and who received a pardon on 19 January 1586 from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], ''Thomas oge m'Brien m'Thomas Magawran, of Magawranstowne'', for fighting against the Queen's forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofdeputyke1416irel/reportofdeputyke1416irel_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"The ... report of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records in Ireland / presented to both houses of the Parliament by command of Her Majesty\" |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Kilfart''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf |title=Map of Tullyhaw, County Cavan |format=PDF |website=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html |title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map |website=Templeport.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as ''Kilfart''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Kilfert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 |title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project |website=Downsurvey.tcd.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Killfert''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan|title=Down Survey Maps &#124; The Down Survey Project|website=downsurvey.tcd.ie}}</ref>\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Kilfart''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Kilfort'' which map meant the land was still belonging to the Anglican Church of Ireland.

Calheta was founded in 1430; the parish, of the same name (which is the central part of the municipality) is one of the oldest parishes on the island of Madeira, and one of the first to be explored by the early settlers. It was the area selected by [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]] (the island's discoverer) as a grant to his son and his wife, Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara and Beatriz Gon\u00e7alves.\n\nThe village became a town 72 years after its foundation, on 1 July 1502, after a royal [[foral]] (charter) was granted by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. The region was primarily settled by noblemen and knights, influencing the toponymic names that appeared in many of its localities: such as ''Lombo do Doutor'' and ''Lombo do Atouguia''. In 1502, Jo\u00e3o de Fran\u00e7a  constructed the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a ({{lang-en|Our Lady of Grace}}), which was to be the basis for the new parish of Calheta,  founding the first and oldest institutions of the parish. Similarly, the Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia was established in 1535, to serve the elderly and provide healthcare for the local residents.\n\nThe parish of [[Prazeres, Madeira|Prazeres]], which was an ecclesiastical component of [[Estreito da Calheta]] was dismembered in 1733, becoming an autonomous clergy on 12 November (which was later followed by the first cornerstone of the Church of Prazeres, in 1751). The Liberal revolution resulted in the incorporation of Calheta as municipality in 1835. Similarly, the parish of Ponta do Pargo, after several years being part of the municipality of Porto Moniz (between 1835 and 1849), began to function as an administrative unit of the municipality of Calheta after the latter municipal seat was disincorporated. The restoration of Porto Moniz in 1855, resulted in the parishes reincorporation within the borders of Porto Moniz. By law, on 26 June 1871, was reintegrated into Ponta do Pargo.\n\nTrist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira Bettencourt da C\u00e2mara, was granted the title of Baron of  [[Jardim do Mar]]: his was a proprietor and later the director of the ''Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias'' in Funchal. In one of the last events of the monarchy of Portugal affecting Calheta, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and Queen [[Am\u00e9lie of Orl\u00e9ans]] visited the village of Calheta, travelling to Raba\u00e7al, during their trip to Madeira.

There are four main primary schools offering instruction for children: ''EB1 Ladeira e Lamaceiros'' and ''EB1 Lombo do Guin\u00e9'' (both in Arco da Calheta), ''EB1 Lombo do Atouguia'' and ''EB1 Calheta'', ''EB1 Estreito da Calheta'',  as well as the kindergarten, ''JI Apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o da Estrela'' run by catholic nuns (in Calheta). In the parish of Ponta do Pargo, Maria Am\u00e9lia de Sousa, provided educational instruction, at the primary level, for many of the children of the western coast of Calheta, lasting 70 years.

Calheta was founded in 1430; the parish, of the same name (which is the central part of the municipality) is one of the oldest parishes on the island of Madeira, and one of the first to be explored by the early settlers. It was the area selected by [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]] (the island's discoverer) as a grant to his son and his wife, Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara and Beatriz Gon\u00e7alves.\n\nThe village became a town 72 years after its foundation, on 1 July 1502, after a royal [[foral]] (charter) was granted by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. The region was primarily settled by noblemen and knights, influencing the toponymic names that appeared in many of its localities: such as ''Lombo do Doutor'' and ''Lombo do Atouguia''. In 1502, Jo\u00e3o de Fran\u00e7a  constructed the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a ({{lang-en|Our Lady of Grace}}), which was to be the basis for the new parish of Calheta,  founding the first and oldest institutions of the parish. Similarly, the Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia was established in 1535, to serve the elderly and provide healthcare for the local residents.\n\nThe parish of [[Prazeres, Madeira|Prazeres]], which was an ecclesiastical component of [[Estreito da Calheta]] was dismembered in 1733, becoming an autonomous clergy on 12 November (which was later followed by the first cornerstone of the Church of Prazeres, in 1751). The Liberal revolution resulted in the incorporation of Calheta as municipality in 1835. Similarly, the parish of Ponta do Pargo, after several years being part of the municipality of Porto Moniz (between 1835 and 1849), began to function as an administrative unit of the municipality of Calheta after the latter municipal seat was disincorporated. The restoration of Porto Moniz in 1855, resulted in the parishes reincorporation within the borders of Porto Moniz. By law, on 26 June 1871, was reintegrated into Ponta do Pargo.\n\nTrist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira Bettencourt da C\u00e2mara, was granted the title of Baron of  [[Jardim do Mar]]: his was a proprietor and later the director of the ''Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias'' in Funchal.

Three survived the shipwreck (Jo\u00e3o Redondo or Rodolfo, Jo\u00e3o Valim and ship's captain Diogo Vaz Dourado), and were guided to safety by the ship's dog, to a small bay. The dog was named ''\"Nesquim\"'', and the small bay became known as the ''\"Calheta de Nesquim\"'' (''small bay of Nesquim''). As the story goes, Nesquim had originally survived the tempest by jumping to safety onto a natural dyke along the coast, called ''Morric\u00e3o''. It was this legendary story, that inspired the heraldry of the parish, which includes a dog, to represent Nesquim, the \"discoverer\" of the small bay.\n\nBy 1680, a religious parish of ''S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o da Calheta'' had already existed for some time (although the date of the community's settlement remains unclear). The construction of the parochial church began on 8 July 1851, and concluded with its consecration on 7 September 1856; it was constructed on the ruins of the older chapel (that had existed since the 15th Century). It was the parish priest, Father Ant\u00f3nio Silveira de \u00c1vila, who had lived in Calheta de Nesquim for many years that had originally promoted the construction of the church.\n\nIt was Father Manuel Alvernaz, a citizen of Prainha do Norte, who help found the ''Cooperativa Progresso Calhetense'' a benevolent group dedicated to economic growth and assisting their members in the eastern municipality, and parish.  It constructed a building to produce many of the local goods for export, including ceramics, pottery and local metal-works. \nAround 1925 a small boat was built by one of its members, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Furtado Simas (better known as Master Manuel Bentes) a resident of [[Santo Amaro (S\u00e3o Roque do Pico)|Santo Amaro]], and sentimentally referred to as ''a Rainha das Lanchas'' (Queen of Launches), but christened '''''Calheta''''' in honor of the peoples of the Cooperative. In 1931, the little launch was sold to the municipality of [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]], and later incorporated into the fleet of Transma\u00e7or (the Azorean Maritime Transport company), where it ended its days making regular scheduled trips between Madalena and Horta.  Until then it was responsible for transporting people and goods between [[Pico Island|Pico]], [[Faial Island|Faial]], [[S\u00e3o Jorge Island|S\u00e3o Jorge]] and [[Terceira]], under the command of Jo\u00e3o do Jos\u00e9 Goulart (and his mates Jo\u00e3o da Antonica, of [[Piedade (Lajes do Pico)|Piedade]] and Francisco Goulart of [[Santa Cruz da Graciosa|Santa Cruz]].  Around 1927, Father Manuel Alvernaz became the confessor in [[Santa Cruz da Graciosa]], and left the Cooperative, starting a slow decline that would finally see it close down in the following years.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Zona de Lazer do Portinho, portinho, vista parcial, Calheta de Nesquim, concelho das Lajes do Pico, ilha do Pico, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The rocky-outcroppings that act as a barrier along the coast of Nesquim]]\nCalheta de Nesquim is situated in the southwest coast of Pico, 18 kilometers from the municipal seat of [[Lajes do Pico]], and connected to the parishes of [[Piedade (Lajes do Pico)]] and [[Ribeiras]] by the Regional E.R.1-1\u00aa motorway.\n\nIts heart is the town of the same name, and is covered in dense vegetation in the interior and rugged cliffs to along the coast, extending to smaller hamlets: Foros, Cruz da Calheta, Jogo da Bola, Fetais, Canada da Sa\u00fade, Canadas, Terreiro and Feteira. The old ''ramal'' was adapted for transit in 1942 (inaugurated on May 22), and accesses the center of the village (referred to as Terreiro) where the main church, the port and Polivalente (the multi-purpose civic center), as well most commercial businesses are located.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo da calheta de Nesquim, Lages do Pico, ilha do Pico, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|thumb|235px|The traditional ''imp\u00e9rio'' dedicated to the Holy Spirit, site of religious feasts and central to annual celebrations]]\nThe civil parish has undertaken several projects to attract tourist dollars, in this mainly agriculture and fishing community.

They include the religious festivals of: the Feast Day of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (celebrated on the 24 January), S\u00e3o Pedro Gon\u00e7alves (January 31), the festival of Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima (on the Sunday closest to the 13th of May), the Feast of Bom Jesus (August 6) and semi-secular festival of S\u00e3o Martinho (with traditional festivities on 11, 13 and 14 November).  In addition, the ubiquitous religious celebration of the Holy Spirit, occurs at Calheta de Nesquim's imp\u00e9rio and chapel during the Sunday and Monday of Pentecosts. In addition, the community also has a festival of band music supported by the local ''Filarm\u00f3nica'' from 9\u201311 July, not to mention the '''Festa da Cabra e Cavala''' (literally, the \"festival of the goat and mackerel\") on August 7-8th.\n\nThe '''Sociedade Filarm\u00f3nica Lira Fraternal Calhetense''' was formed in 1888, from a small group of Republicans, that included the teacher Manuel Pereira Gomes, who organized a group of fourteen musicians that played until around 1910. After a period of inactivity, a new band was established  during the 1920s by a group of youth supported by Father Louren\u00e7o of Ribeirinha (then parish priest). In 1930 the Lira Fraternal Calhetense returned, this time under the directorship of Greg\u00f3rio Reis, until he left to form the '''Uni\u00e3o Musical Calhetense''' beginning a rivalry between the established bands in 1934. Some families stopped talking to each other, friends parted ways, as the distinction between the '''Musica Nova''' (the \"new music\"), of the ''Uni\u00e3o Musical'', and the '''Musica Velha''' (\"old music\") of the traditionalist Lira Fraternal Calhetense. This rivalry would remain bitter as the Lira Fraternal Calhetense was directed by Jo\u00e3o \u00c1vial de Melo, and would persist until the 1940s when few musicians and financial difficulties would force the integration of both bands. Over the years many musicians and band directors would flow into and out of the Fraternal Calhetense, but none of the antagonisms from the mid-century would persist.\n\nAnnually, the '''Festa da Lira Fraternal Calhetense''' on the second weekend of July, is a consequence of the elevated stature of this institution to the community.  It brings other musical groups from around the island, as well as abroad, for a couple days of concerts.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n[[File:Capit\u00e3o Anselmo da Silveira da Silva, calheta de Nesquim, Lages do Pico, ilha do Pico, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|thumb|170px|A bust of the entrepreneur Anselmo Silveira da Silva in the parish's main square]] \n* Anselmo Silveira da Silva (1833\u20131912), commonly referred to as ''\u201cCapit\u00e3o Anselmo\u201d'', was a whaler and entrepreneur, building a minor whaling provisioning facility in Calheta de Nesquim with partners Samuel Dabney and George Oliver;\n* J\u00falio Carias - parish doctor;\n* Jo\u00e3o Flores - artisan, specializing in whale bone sculptures;\n* Manuel Serafim - musician and music teacher;\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Dias de Melo]] (8 April 1925 - [[S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 (Ponta Delgada)|S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9]]; 24 September 2008), author, noted for many of his writings on whaling, emigration and Azorean life, that included ''\"Toadas do Mar e da Terra\"'', ''\"Pedras Negras\"'', ''\"Mar Rubro\"'' and ''\"Mar Pla Proa\"''.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n;Source\n* {{cite book |last=Goulart |first=A. |author2=Goulart Quaresma |title=Maresias: Constru\u00e7\u00e3o Naval do Pico |volume=III |publisher=S.L. |year=2001 |pages=122}}\n* {{cite book | editor-last =  Soares| editor-first = T. |author=Students of the Curso de Malhas e Bordados |title=Calheta de Ontem e de Hoje |publisher=Junta Freguesia de Calheta de Nesquim |year=1995}}\n* {{cite book |last=Monterey |first=Guido de |title=Ilha do Pico  Majestade dos A\u00e7ores |language=Portuguese |publisher=Zambra |year=1978}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Parishes of Lajes do Pico]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Portuguese subdivision\n| type                    = parish\n| name                    = Calheta de Nesquim\n| image_skyline           = Porto piscat\u00f3rio de calheta de Nesquim, Lages do Pico, ilha do Pico, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG\n| image_caption           = The fishing port and coastal perspective of Calheta de Nesquim, with the parish church dedicated to [[Saint Sebastian|S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o]]\n| image_flag              = \n| image_shield            = LGP-calhetanesquim.png\n| region                  = Azores\n| island                  = [[Pico Island|Pico]]\n| municipality            = [[Lajes do Pico]]\n| image_map               = Locator map AZO PIC Calheta de Nesquim.svg\n| map_caption             = Location of the [[freguesia|civil parish]] of Calheta de Nesquim, within the municipality of Lajes do Pico, on the island of Pico\n| coordinates             = {{coord|38|25|17|N|28|5|43|W|display=inline,title}}\n| established_date        = Settlement: 15th century<br>Parish: [[floruit|fl.]] 1680\n| area_total_km2          = 13.81\n| elevation_m             = 420\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_total        = 343\n| postal_code             = 9930-057\n| area_code               = \n| patron                  = [[Saint Sebastian|S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o]]\n| website                 = {{url|http://www.calhetadenesquim.freguesias.pt/}}\n<!-- | footnotes               = Geographic detail from CAOP (2010)<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/cadastro/caop/download/Areas_Freg_Mun_Dist_CAOP2010.zip |title=Carta Administrativa Oficial de Portugal |publisher=Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Portugu\u00eas |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |accessdate=1 July 2011 |year=2010 |editor=IGP |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521174146/http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/cadastro/caop/download/Areas_Freg_Mun_Dist_CAOP2010.zip |archivedate=21 May 2011 }}</ref> produced by Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Portugu\u00eas (IGP) -->\n}}\n'''Calheta de Nesquim''' is a [[freguesia|civil parish]], along the southern coast of the municipality of [[Lajes do Pico]], in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Azores]].

Three survived the shipwreck (Jo\u00e3o Redondo or Rodolfo, Jo\u00e3o Valim and ship's captain Diogo Vaz Dourado), and were guided to safety by the ship's dog, to a small bay. The dog was named ''\"Nesquim\"'', and the small bay became known as the ''\"Calheta de Nesquim\"'' (''small bay of Nesquim''). As the story goes, Nesquim had originally survived the tempest by jumping to safety onto a natural dyke along the coast, called ''Morric\u00e3o''. It was this legendary story, that inspired the heraldry of the parish, which includes a dog, to represent Nesquim, the \"discoverer\" of the small bay.\n\nBy 1680, a religious parish of ''S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o da Calheta'' had already existed for some time (although the date of the community's settlement remains unclear). The construction of the parochial church began on 8 July 1851, and concluded with its consecration on 7 September 1856; it was constructed on the ruins of the older chapel (that had existed since the 15th Century). It was the parish priest, Father Ant\u00f3nio Silveira de \u00c1vila, who had lived in Calheta de Nesquim for many years that had originally promoted the construction of the church.\n\nIt was Father Manuel Alvernaz, a citizen of Prainha do Norte, who help found the ''Cooperativa Progresso Calhetense'' a benevolent group dedicated to economic growth and assisting their members in the eastern municipality, and parish.  It constructed a building to produce many of the local goods for export, including ceramics, pottery and local metal-works. \nAround 1925 a small boat was built by one of its members, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Furtado Simas (better known as Master Manuel Bentes) a resident of [[Santo Amaro (S\u00e3o Roque do Pico)|Santo Amaro]], and sentimentally referred to as ''a Rainha das Lanchas'' (Queen of Launches), but christened '''''Calheta''''' in honor of the peoples of the Cooperative. In 1931, the little launch was sold to the municipality of [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]], and later incorporated into the fleet of Transma\u00e7or (the Azorean Maritime Transport company), where it ended its days making regular scheduled trips between Madalena and Horta.  Until then it was responsible for transporting people and goods between [[Pico Island|Pico]], [[Faial Island|Faial]], [[S\u00e3o Jorge Island|S\u00e3o Jorge]] and [[Terceira]], under the command of Jo\u00e3o do Jos\u00e9 Goulart (and his mates Jo\u00e3o da Antonica, of [[Piedade (Lajes do Pico)|Piedade]] and Francisco Goulart of [[Santa Cruz da Graciosa|Santa Cruz]].  Around 1927, Father Manuel Alvernaz became the confessor in [[Santa Cruz da Graciosa]], and left the Cooperative, starting a slow decline that would finally see it close down in the following years.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Zona de Lazer do Portinho, portinho, vista parcial, Calheta de Nesquim, concelho das Lajes do Pico, ilha do Pico, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The rocky-outcroppings that act as a barrier along the coast of Nesquim]]\nCalheta de Nesquim is situated in the southwest coast of Pico, 18 kilometers from the municipal seat of [[Lajes do Pico]], and connected to the parishes of [[Piedade (Lajes do Pico)]] and [[Ribeiras]] by the Regional E.R.1-1\u00aa motorway.\n\nIts heart is the town of the same name, and is covered in dense vegetation in the interior and rugged cliffs to along the coast, extending to smaller hamlets: Foros, Cruz da Calheta, Jogo da Bola, Fetais, Canada da Sa\u00fade, Canadas, Terreiro and Feteira. The old ''ramal'' was adapted for transit in 1942 (inaugurated on May 22), and accesses the center of the village (referred to as Terreiro) where the main church, the port and Polivalente (the multi-purpose civic center), as well most commercial businesses are located.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo da calheta de Nesquim, Lages do Pico, ilha do Pico, A\u00e7ores, Portugal.JPG|thumb|235px|The traditional ''imp\u00e9rio'' dedicated to the Holy Spirit, site of religious feasts and central to annual celebrations]]\nThe civil parish has undertaken several projects to attract tourist dollars, in this mainly agriculture and fishing community.

They include the religious festivals of: the Feast Day of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (celebrated on the 24 January), S\u00e3o Pedro Gon\u00e7alves (January 31), the festival of Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima (on the Sunday closest to the 13th of May), the Feast of Bom Jesus (August 6) and semi-secular festival of S\u00e3o Martinho (with traditional festivities on 11, 13 and 14 November).  In addition, the ubiquitous religious celebration of the Holy Spirit, occurs at Calheta de Nesquim's imp\u00e9rio and chapel during the Sunday and Monday of Pentecosts. In addition, the community also has a festival of band music supported by the local ''Filarm\u00f3nica'' from 9\u201311 July, not to mention the '''Festa da Cabra e Cavala''' (literally, the \"festival of the goat and mackerel\") on August 7-8th.\n\nThe '''Sociedade Filarm\u00f3nica Lira Fraternal Calhetense''' was formed in 1888, from a small group of Republicans, that included the teacher Manuel Pereira Gomes, who organized a group of fourteen musicians that played until around 1910. After a period of inactivity, a new band was established  during the 1920s by a group of youth supported by Father Louren\u00e7o of Ribeirinha (then parish priest). In 1930 the Lira Fraternal Calhetense returned, this time under the directorship of Greg\u00f3rio Reis, until he left to form the '''Uni\u00e3o Musical Calhetense''' beginning a rivalry between the established bands in 1934. Some families stopped talking to each other, friends parted ways, as the distinction between the '''Musica Nova''' (the \"new music\"), of the ''Uni\u00e3o Musical'', and the '''Musica Velha''' (\"old music\") of the traditionalist Lira Fraternal Calhetense. This rivalry would remain bitter as the Lira Fraternal Calhetense was directed by Jo\u00e3o \u00c1vial de Melo, and would persist until the 1940s when few musicians and financial difficulties would force the integration of both bands. Over the years many musicians and band directors would flow into and out of the Fraternal Calhetense, but none of the antagonisms from the mid-century would persist.\n\nAnnually, the '''Festa da Lira Fraternal Calhetense''' on the second weekend of July, is a consequence of the elevated stature of this institution to the community.
