It was part of a large expanse of woodland called Hornsey Wood that was cut further and further back for use as grazing land during the Middle Ages. In the mid-18th century a [[tea room]] had opened on the knoll of land on which Finsbury Park is situated. Londoners would travel north to escape the smoke of the capital and enjoy the last remains of the old Hornsey Wood. Around 1800 the tea rooms were developed into a larger building which became known as the Hornsey Wood House/Tavern. A lake was also created on the top of the knoll with water pumped up from the nearby [[New River (England)|New River]]. There was boating, a shooting and archery range, and probably [[cock fighting]] and other blood sports. The Hornsey Wood Tavern was demolished in the process of making the area into a park, but the lake was enlarged. Once the park had opened, a pub across the road from its eastern entrance along [[Seven Sisters Road]] called itself the Hornsey Wood Tavern after the original.

The present-day site of Finsbury Park was one of four suggestions for the location of a park.<ref>''The Times'', 9 August 1869</ref>\n\nOriginally to be named [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]] Park,<ref name=AParkForFinsbury /> the first plans were drawn up in 1850.<ref name=HistoricEngland /> Renamed Finsbury Park, plans for the park's creation were ratified by an Act of Parliament in 1857.<ref name=ParksAndGardens /> Despite some local opposition, the park was opened in 1869.\n\n===During the wars===\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] the park was known as a location for pacifist meetings.<ref name=IWM>{{cite av media notes|title=War Office Official Topical Budget|date=May 1918|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1060023185|quote=Newsreel item on the break-up of a pacifist meeting in Finsbury Park, London|publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the park was used as military training grounds and also hosted [[anti-aircraft gun]]s.<ref name=\"Edgerton2011\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Edgerton|title=Britains War Machine: Weapons, Resources, and Experts in the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKZC256tZ0IC&pg=PT30|date=9 August 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-991150-9|pages=30}}</ref>\n\n===Regeneration===\n\nThrough the late 20th Century the park began to fall into a state of disrepair with most of the original features gone by the 1980s.

Most notably, the word \"Power\" was dropped from all product lines.  During the Keynote address at Macworld in 2006, where the first Intel-based Macs, the iMac and MacBook Pro, were announced, Steve Jobs remarked that the new naming schemes for their products reflected their desire to have \"Mac\" in the name of all of their computers, and because they were \"done with power.\" This was in reference to the fact that the previous PowerPC G5 processors were not energy efficient, and therefore used far too much power to be used in any portable Macs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It was based on Novell's next in-development version of DR&nbsp;DOS with its pre-emptive multitasker, which provided a hybrid 32-bit/16-bit core system similar in architecture to Windows 3.1 in 386 Enhanced Mode, but without a GUI. The ported System 7.1 ran on top of this environment. While the project was successful with running pre-beta versions it was stopped in 1993 after management and strategy changes. The core system (but without the Star Trek-specific components) was later released as part of Novell DOS 7.\n\nThe Macintosh line underwent a similar transition between 1994 and about 1996, when Apple [[Apple PowerPC transition|switched]] from Motorola's [[68k]] series of chips to [[IBM]]/Motorola [[PowerPC]] processors, developed jointly by Motorola,  Apple, and IBM. This took several years, during which Apple produced versions of the [[classic Mac OS]] that could run on either platform, introduced fairly low-level emulation of the 68k architecture by the PowerPC models, and encouraged third-party developers to release [[fat binary|fat binaries]] that could run natively on either architecture.\n\nApple later transitioned the Macintosh from the earlier [[classic Mac OS]] to [[Mac OS X]]. This transition also took a number of years, and was facilitated by the inclusion of [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]], an environment in which an instance of [[Mac OS 9]] could be run, permitting the execution of programs that had not been ported to Mac OS X, as well as the introduction of [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] for Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, allowing programs to run natively on either system.\n\nJobs revealed at the 2005 WWDC that every version of Mac OS X had been secretly developed and compiled for Intel processors (as well as PowerPC) as they were developed; the [[cross-platform|portability]] of its predecessor [[NeXTSTEP]] had been maintained. It is not publicly known whether Apple maintains current builds for any other architectures although the related [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] runs on the [[iPhone]]'s [[ARM architecture]].\n\n==Reasons==\n[[File:Steve Jobs Presentation 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Steve Jobs reveals Mac OS X running on [[Pentium 4]] hardware.]]\nSteve Jobs stated that Apple's primary motivation for the transition was their disappointment with the progress of IBM's development of PowerPC technology, and their greater faith in Intel to meet Apple's needs. In particular, he cited the [[performance per watt]] projections in the [[Technology roadmapping|roadmap]] provided by Intel.<ref name=\"macworld.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1046961/intelvsamd.html|title=Analysis: Why Apple picked Intel over AMD|date=September 15, 2005|website=Macworld}}</ref> This is an especially important consideration in laptop design, which affects the hours of use per battery charge.\n\nIn June 2003, Jobs had introduced Macs based on the [[PowerPC 970|PowerPC G5]] processor and promised that within a year, the [[clock speed]] of the part would be up to 3 [[Gigahertz|GHz]]. Two years later, 3&nbsp;GHz G5s were still not available, and rumors continued that IBM's low yields on the [[POWER4]]-derived chip were to blame. Further, the heat produced by the chip proved an obstacle to deploying it in a [[laptop]] computer, which had become the fastest growing segment of the [[personal computer]] industry.\n\nSome observers were surprised that Apple had not made a deal with [[AMD]], which had in recent years become a strong competitor to Intel. AMD had recently released its competitive 64-bit [[Opteron]] platform,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2664991/amd-s-profits-grow-on-opteron--flash-memory.html|title=AMD's profits grow on Opteron, flash memory|first=Tom|last=Krazit|date=April 15, 2004|website=InfoWorld}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/index.en.html|title=Debian -- AMD64 Port|website=www.debian.org}}</ref> and by moving straight to [[x86-64]] Apple would have had one less architecture transition. Analysts have speculated that AMD's lack of low-power designs at the time were behind the decision to go with Intel.<ref name=\"macworld.com\"/> However, in 2011, Apple investigated using AMD\u2019s low power [[AMD Fusion#Llano .2832.C2.A0nm.29 2|Llano APU]] for the [[MacBook Air]], but eventually opted for Intel due to AMD's potential inability to supply enough Llano processors to meet demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://semiaccurate.com/2011/11/17/apple-macbook-air-with-amd-processor-dead/ |title=Exclusive: Apple MacBook Air with AMD processor dead |date=2011-11-17 |publisher=[[SemiAccurate]]}}</ref>\n\n==Benefits==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\nAdvocates of the transition pointed out the potential for the new Intel Mac systems to run four classes of software at native speeds: Mac OS X binaries, [[Java (programming language)|Java]]/[[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] applications, [[Unix]] applications, and [[Win32]]/x86 applications.\n\nOriginally, [[emulator|emulation]] software such as [[DOSBox]] or [[Microsoft Virtual PC]] was required to run x86 software on the Macintosh. Such software could now enjoy much more success with near-native performance through [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]], such as is currently being done by [[Parallels Desktop for Mac]] and [[VMware Fusion]]. For those customers wishing to achieve a more conventional environment, a [[Multi boot|dual boot]] solution is possible on an x86 Apple device using [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] software (which includes Windows drivers for Mac hardware). Some third-party partitioning options can even provide triple, or even quadruple boot.\n\nAlthough most games depend on the use of [[DirectX]] [[Application programming interface|API]]s not available on Mac OS X (on either processor type), it should be easier to port OS-independent code, such as [[OpenGL]], now that developers no longer have to resolve [[endianness|endian]], and other [[Instruction set|ISA]] dependency issues associated with moving from x86 to PowerPC.\n\n==Drawbacks==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}\n===Reaction to the change===\n\nThe announcement of Apple's intention to switch to Intel-based Macs caused concern because [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], the PowerPC dynamic translator, when first announced, emulated a [[PowerPC G3|G3]] at only 60\u201380% of a similarly powered CPU's clock speed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Apart from this, [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]], the [[Mac OS 9]] virtualization for Mac OS X, was not ported to the x86 architecture, leaving the new Intel-powered Macs incompatible with original Mac OS applications without a proper third-party PowerPC emulator.\n\nThe performance of Intel's [[chipset]]s was a concern{{By whom|date=February 2020}}, along with the x86 architecture itself, and whether it would affect system performance and application quality. Other problems include [[endianness]] and reduced floating point performance in real world applications relative to equivalent or contemporary PowerPC processors.\n\nIt was also feared{{By whom|date=February 2020}} that it may be possible for Windows and Windows applications to run natively on Mac hardware, possibly killing off Mac OS X and/or applications developed for it. There was concern that the early announcement of the change would cause an [[Osborne effect]], and there was the possibility that Intel could force Apple to use the [[Intel Inside]] branding. In addition, Apple had nurtured a feeling of animosity toward Intel among its loyal base. It would take time and money to convince Apple's most loyal customers that Intel was acceptable.\n\nThere were also fears that Intel, which took part in the development and implementation of the [[USB]], would force Apple to drop all development and support of its [[FireWire]] serial bus on all Intel Macs. This did not occur, as FireWire ports continued to be included on all Macs, except certain notebook configurations beginning with the [[MacBook Air]] in 2008, until being replaced by the faster [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] port.\n\nMany of these fears were put to rest at Macworld 2006 with the arrival of the first Intel-based Macs. [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] was improved to offer much faster speeds than originally demonstrated (though benchmarks suggest that PowerPC code still does not perform as well under emulation on a Core Duo iMac as it does on a G5 iMac<ref>Anandtech, January 30, 2006: [http://www.anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2685 Apple Makes the Switch: iMac G5 vs. iMac Core Duo]</ref>). Intel's Core Duo CPUs perform nearly as well as the most powerful [[Power Mac G5]] towers.\n\nApplications native to both PPC and Intel-based Macs such as Safari web browser were found to perform better on the Intel-based Mac than on the PPC-based Mac. However, [[classic Mac OS]] applications will not run directly on Intel Macs. Pre-Mac OS X applications can only be run on Intel Macs by using [[emulator]]s such as [[vMac]], [[Basilisk II]], and [[SheepShaver]], though the lack of stability of these emulators severely limits their functionality.\n\nFears of an [[Osborne effect]] were dismissed after sales of Macs for the Christmas 2005 quarter saw an increase over the previous Christmas. Unlike Windows-based PC counterparts \"Intel Inside\" stickers have never been included on any Apple product.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2007/08/apple-fan-frenz/ | work=Wired | first=Charlie | last=Sorrel | title=Apple Fan Frenzy: Stickergate | date=August 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware-oriented===\nThere were questions over the extent to which Apple would retain control over the non-processor components of the system design. Apple is traditionally a systems builder, and some feared that Apple's [[industrial design]] philosophy may be affected if the company switched to commodity parts. Others noted that Apple has slowly been switching to standard parts since the introduction of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] Power Mac in 1995, and said that using a non-Apple chipset in itself would not harm the Mac's image.\n\nIntel Macs employ a different Intel technology for [[firmware]], [[Extensible Firmware Interface]], not the [[Open Firmware]] Apple had been using. EFI removes the traditional PC reliance on the [[BIOS]] while providing more functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/universal_binary/universal_binary_diffs/chapter_3_section_10.html|title=Apple's transition documentation: Extensible Firmware Interface}}</ref>\n\nThe use of the x86 architecture allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, and opens the possibility of using the [[Wine package]] to run Windows executables directly. Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since [[Mac OS X]] users can use a [[dual boot|dual-boot]] setup or a Wine variant (such as [[CrossOver Mac]] or [[Darwine]]) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could be a boon to [[Apple Switch ad campaign|switchers]], since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of [[Mac OS X]] being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/05/06/08/apple_vp_says_mac_os_x_wont_run_on_other_pcs|title=Apple VP says Mac OS X won\\'t run on other PCs|website=AppleInsider}}</ref> The [[OSx86]] Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the [[Extensible Firmware Interface]], it would not be run on Intel-based Macs.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Engadget]]|date=January 11, 2006|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/01/11/no-xp-on-intel-macs-but-vista-is-good-to-go/|title=New Macs not XP friendly, but Vista is good to go|first=Marc|last=Perton}}</ref> Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest<ref name=onmac>{{cite web|website=Onmac.net|date=March 16, 2006|url=http://onmac.net/|title=Windows XP on an Intel Mac}}</ref> resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that [[Windows Vista]] will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.\n\nIntel was seen among the Mac community as a purveyor of hot-running chips (especially the [[Pentium 4]]). Apple themselves mocked the Pentium range in their \"Toasted [[Cleanroom suit|Bunnies]]\" advertisements of the late 1990s. However, the [[Pentium M]] chips, which were designed for laptop use, run much cooler than the Pentium 4. Apple claimed the then-new Intel Core chips, which are based on the Pentium M microarchitecture, would have dramatically better performance per watt than the PowerPC G4 and G5.\n\nFinally, the relative quality of the x86 architecture has been discussed. Critics of the switch say that x86 was a poor choice because of its lack of [[hardware register]]s compared to the PowerPC, and the lack of [[AltiVec]] (also known as [[Velocity Engine]]). Proponents have responded by saying that the x86 architecture has evolved greatly since the original 8086 was introduced, and that CPUs in general have combined [[RISC]] and [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] philosophies in their internal designs for some time, making the distinction obsolete. They also point out that improved [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] could equal [[AltiVec]], and that most programmers rarely deal with x86's peculiarities because the [[compiler]] does the work.\n\nThe PowerPC G5 was a 64-bit design, although very few applications made use of the increased address space. In contrast the original Core Solo and Core Duo chips were [[32-bit]]. On August 7, 2006, Apple released the [[Mac Pro]] and Intel-based [[Xserve]], introducing Intel 64 (Intel's implementation of [[x86-64]]) architecture into the lineup through the use of the [[Xeon]] processor. By August 7, 2007, all other computers in Apple's product line had been updated with the 64-bit Core 2 Duo; all subsequent Macs have had 64-bit processors.\n\nWhile the current benchmarks comparing Core Duo to Core 2 Duo processors show very little difference when running in 32 bit, the 64 bit edge has become more of an issue with the release of [[Mac OS X v10.6]] (Snow Leopard), and now users can dual boot Windows 7 in full 64-bit mode.{{Update inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Existing PowerPC applications===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Universal Binary Logo.png|thumb|right|125px|The Universal badge indicates software that will run at full speed on both PPC and Intel Macs.]]  -->Java applications (that do not rely on [[Java Native Interface]]), some [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]] [[Widget (computing)|Widgets]], and [[Scripting programming language|scripts]] that execute inside an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] all work immediately on both processors and are immune to changes.\n\nIn [[Mac OS X v10.4|Mac OS X 10.4]] to [[Mac OS X v10.6|Mac OS X 10.6]], PowerPC applications that cannot be migrated ran inside a PowerPC [[Binary translation|dynamic translator]] on Intel called \"[[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]].\" Rosetta is an instruction translator comparable to the 68k emulator that allows PowerPC Macintoshes to run pre-PowerPC code, rather than a virtual system like [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]]; it does not require a second operating system to be loaded as a subsystem before the application can work. It was originally limited to a [[PowerPC G3|G3]] instruction set, but later supported [[AltiVec]] and the [[PowerPC G4|G4]] instruction set, leaving only the [[PowerPC G5|G5]] additions unsupported. Rosetta was discontinued in [[Mac OS X v10.7|Mac OS X 10.7]] and is no longer available.\n\nAltiVec itself has been encapsulated since [[Mac OS X v10.3|Mac OS 10.3]] by a vectorization library; this library uses AltiVec on the PowerPC and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] (or equivalent regular instructions) on x86.\n\nA new version of [[Xcode]] was released that supported the generation of [[Universal Binaries]] for Intel and PowerPC, the new system's equivalent of the earlier 68k-PowerPC [[fat binary|fat binaries]]. [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] applications can be ported simply by recompiling them and checking for endianness problems. [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] applications required some additional tuning, but not of the complexity of the transition from Mac OS 9. Applications written using [[Metrowerks]] [[CodeWarrior]] suite had to be modified; those that use [[PowerPlant]] required further code changes, described by Apple and Metrowerks.\n\n[[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] is not supported on the x86 architecture. This means that pre-Mac OS X software does not run on Mac OS X out of the box, to which some users running older applications (such as [[QuarkXPress]] 4 and 5) objected.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} However, third-party emulators, such as [[Mini vMac]], [[Basilisk II]], and [[SheepShaver]], have been ported to Intel-based Macs, allowing some pre-Mac OS X software to run.\n\n==See also==\n* [[OSx86]]\n* [[Star Trek project]]\n\n==References==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

Most notably, the word \"Power\" was dropped from all product lines.  During the Keynote address at Macworld in 2006, where the first Intel-based Macs, the iMac and MacBook Pro, were announced, Steve Jobs remarked that the new naming schemes for their products reflected their desire to have \"Mac\" in the name of all of their computers, and because they were \"done with power.\" This was in reference to the fact that the previous PowerPC G5 processors were not energy efficient, and therefore used far too much power to be used in any portable Macs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It was based on Novell's next in-development version of DR&nbsp;DOS with its pre-emptive multitasker, which provided a hybrid 32-bit/16-bit core system similar in architecture to Windows 3.1 in 386 Enhanced Mode, but without a GUI. The ported System 7.1 ran on top of this environment. While the project was successful with running pre-beta versions it was stopped in 1993 after management and strategy changes. The core system (but without the Star Trek-specific components) was later released as part of Novell DOS 7.\n\nThe Macintosh line underwent a similar transition between 1994 and about 1996, when Apple [[Apple PowerPC transition|switched]] from Motorola's [[68k]] series of chips to [[IBM]]/Motorola [[PowerPC]] processors, developed jointly by Motorola,  Apple, and IBM. This took several years, during which Apple produced versions of the [[classic Mac OS]] that could run on either platform, introduced fairly low-level emulation of the 68k architecture by the PowerPC models, and encouraged third-party developers to release [[fat binary|fat binaries]] that could run natively on either architecture.\n\nApple later transitioned the Macintosh from the earlier [[classic Mac OS]] to [[Mac OS X]]. This transition also took a number of years, and was facilitated by the inclusion of [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]], an environment in which an instance of [[Mac OS 9]] could be run, permitting the execution of programs that had not been ported to Mac OS X, as well as the introduction of [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] for Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, allowing programs to run natively on either system.\n\nJobs revealed at the 2005 WWDC that every version of Mac OS X had been secretly developed and compiled for Intel processors (as well as PowerPC) as they were developed; the [[cross-platform|portability]] of its predecessor [[NeXTSTEP]] had been maintained. It is not publicly known whether Apple maintains current builds for any other architectures although the related [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] runs on the [[iPhone]]'s [[ARM architecture]].\n\n==Reasons==\n[[File:Steve Jobs Presentation 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Steve Jobs reveals Mac OS X running on [[Pentium 4]] hardware.]]\nSteve Jobs stated that Apple's primary motivation for the transition was their disappointment with the progress of IBM's development of PowerPC technology, and their greater faith in Intel to meet Apple's needs. In particular, he cited the [[performance per watt]] projections in the [[Technology roadmapping|roadmap]] provided by Intel.<ref name=\"macworld.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1046961/intelvsamd.html|title=Analysis: Why Apple picked Intel over AMD|date=September 15, 2005|website=Macworld}}</ref> This is an especially important consideration in laptop design, which affects the hours of use per battery charge.\n\nIn June 2003, Jobs had introduced Macs based on the [[PowerPC 970|PowerPC G5]] processor and promised that within a year, the [[clock speed]] of the part would be up to 3 [[Gigahertz|GHz]]. Two years later, 3&nbsp;GHz G5s were still not available, and rumors continued that IBM's low yields on the [[POWER4]]-derived chip were to blame. Further, the heat produced by the chip proved an obstacle to deploying it in a [[laptop]] computer, which had become the fastest growing segment of the [[personal computer]] industry.\n\nSome observers were surprised that Apple had not made a deal with [[AMD]], which had in recent years become a strong competitor to Intel. AMD had recently released its competitive 64-bit [[Opteron]] platform,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2664991/amd-s-profits-grow-on-opteron--flash-memory.html|title=AMD's profits grow on Opteron, flash memory|first=Tom|last=Krazit|date=April 15, 2004|website=InfoWorld}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/index.en.html|title=Debian -- AMD64 Port|website=www.debian.org}}</ref> and by moving straight to [[x86-64]] Apple would have had one less architecture transition. Analysts have speculated that AMD's lack of low-power designs at the time were behind the decision to go with Intel.<ref name=\"macworld.com\"/> However, in 2011, Apple investigated using AMD\u2019s low power [[AMD Fusion#Llano .2832.C2.A0nm.29 2|Llano APU]] for the [[MacBook Air]], but eventually opted for Intel due to AMD's potential inability to supply enough Llano processors to meet demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://semiaccurate.com/2011/11/17/apple-macbook-air-with-amd-processor-dead/ |title=Exclusive: Apple MacBook Air with AMD processor dead |date=2011-11-17 |publisher=[[SemiAccurate]]}}</ref>\n\n==Benefits==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\nAdvocates of the transition pointed out the potential for the new Intel Mac systems to run four classes of software at native speeds: Mac OS X binaries, [[Java (programming language)|Java]]/[[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] applications, [[Unix]] applications, and [[Win32]]/x86 applications.\n\nOriginally, [[emulator|emulation]] software such as [[DOSBox]] or [[Microsoft Virtual PC]] was required to run x86 software on the Macintosh. Such software could now enjoy much more success with near-native performance through [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]], such as is currently being done by [[Parallels Desktop for Mac]] and [[VMware Fusion]]. For those customers wishing to achieve a more conventional environment, a [[Multi boot|dual boot]] solution is possible on an x86 Apple device using [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] software (which includes Windows drivers for Mac hardware). Some third-party partitioning options can even provide triple, or even quadruple boot.\n\nAlthough most games depend on the use of [[DirectX]] [[Application programming interface|API]]s not available on Mac OS X (on either processor type), it should be easier to port OS-independent code, such as [[OpenGL]], now that developers no longer have to resolve [[endianness|endian]], and other [[Instruction set|ISA]] dependency issues associated with moving from x86 to PowerPC.\n\n==Drawbacks==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}\n===Reaction to the change===\n\nThe announcement of Apple's intention to switch to Intel-based Macs caused concern because [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], the PowerPC dynamic translator, when first announced, emulated a [[PowerPC G3|G3]] at only 60-80% of a similarly powered CPU's clock speed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Apart from this, [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]], the [[Mac OS 9]] virtualization for Mac OS X, was not ported to the x86 architecture, leaving the new Intel-powered Macs incompatible with original Mac OS applications without a proper third-party PowerPC emulator.\n\nThe performance of Intel's [[chipset]]s was a concern{{By whom|date=February 2020}}, along with the x86 architecture itself, and whether it would affect system performance and application quality. Other problems include [[endianness]] and reduced floating point performance in real world applications relative to equivalent or contemporary PowerPC processors.\n\nIt was also feared{{By whom|date=February 2020}} that it may be possible for Windows and Windows applications to run natively on Mac hardware, possibly killing off Mac OS X and/or applications developed for it. There was concern that the early announcement of the change would cause an [[Osborne effect]], and there was the possibility that Intel could force Apple to use the [[Intel Inside]] branding. In addition, Apple had nurtured a feeling of animosity toward Intel among its loyal base. It would take time and money to convince Apple's most loyal customers that Intel was acceptable.\n\nThere were also fears that Intel, which took part in the development and implementation of the [[USB]], would force Apple to drop all development and support of its [[FireWire]] serial bus on all Intel Macs. This did not occur, as FireWire ports continued to be included on all Macs, except certain notebook configurations beginning with the [[MacBook Air]] in 2008, until being replaced by the faster [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] port.\n\nMany of these fears were put to rest at Macworld 2006 with the arrival of the first Intel-based Macs. [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] was improved to offer much faster speeds than originally demonstrated (though benchmarks suggest that PowerPC code still does not perform as well under emulation on a Core Duo iMac as it does on a G5 iMac<ref>Anandtech, January 30, 2006: [http://www.anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2685 Apple Makes the Switch: iMac G5 vs. iMac Core Duo]</ref>). Intel's Core Duo CPUs perform nearly as well as the most powerful [[Power Mac G5]] towers.\n\nApplications native to both PPC and Intel-based Macs such as Safari web browser were found to perform better on the Intel-based Mac than on the PPC-based Mac. However, [[classic Mac OS]] applications will not run directly on Intel Macs. Pre-Mac OS X applications can only be run on Intel Macs by using [[emulator]]s such as [[vMac]], [[Basilisk II]], and [[SheepShaver]], though the lack of stability of these emulators severely limits their functionality.\n\nFears of an [[Osborne effect]] were dismissed after sales of Macs for the Christmas 2005 quarter saw an increase over the previous Christmas. Unlike Windows-based PC counterparts \"Intel Inside\" stickers have never been included on any Apple product.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2007/08/apple-fan-frenz/ | work=Wired | first=Charlie | last=Sorrel | title=Apple Fan Frenzy: Stickergate | date=August 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware-oriented===\nThere were questions over the extent to which Apple would retain control over the non-processor components of the system design. Apple is traditionally a systems builder, and some feared that Apple's [[industrial design]] philosophy may be affected if the company switched to commodity parts. Others noted that Apple has slowly been switching to standard parts since the introduction of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] Power Mac in 1995, and said that using a non-Apple chipset in itself would not harm the Mac's image.\n\nIntel Macs employ a different Intel technology for [[firmware]], [[Extensible Firmware Interface]], not the [[Open Firmware]] Apple had been using. EFI removes the traditional PC reliance on the [[BIOS]] while providing more functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/universal_binary/universal_binary_diffs/chapter_3_section_10.html|title=Apple's transition documentation: Extensible Firmware Interface}}</ref>\n\nThe use of the x86 architecture allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, and opens the possibility of using the [[Wine package]] to run Windows executables directly. Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since [[Mac OS X]] users can use a [[dual boot|dual-boot]] setup or a Wine variant (such as [[CrossOver Mac]] or [[Darwine]]) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could be a boon to [[Apple Switch ad campaign|switchers]], since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of [[Mac OS X]] being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/05/06/08/apple_vp_says_mac_os_x_wont_run_on_other_pcs|title=Apple VP says Mac OS X won\\'t run on other PCs|website=AppleInsider}}</ref> The [[OSx86]] Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the [[Extensible Firmware Interface]], it would not be run on Intel-based Macs.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Engadget]]|date=January 11, 2006|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/01/11/no-xp-on-intel-macs-but-vista-is-good-to-go/|title=New Macs not XP friendly, but Vista is good to go|first=Marc|last=Perton}}</ref> Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest<ref name=onmac>{{cite web|website=Onmac.net|date=March 16, 2006|url=http://onmac.net/|title=Windows XP on an Intel Mac}}</ref> resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that [[Windows Vista]] will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.\n\nIntel was seen among the Mac community as a purveyor of hot-running chips (especially the [[Pentium 4]]). Apple themselves mocked the Pentium range in their \"Toasted [[Cleanroom suit|Bunnies]]\" advertisements of the late 1990s. However, the [[Pentium M]] chips, which were designed for laptop use, run much cooler than the Pentium 4. Apple claimed the then-new Intel Core chips, which are based on the Pentium M microarchitecture, would have dramatically better performance per watt than the PowerPC G4 and G5.\n\nFinally, the relative quality of the x86 architecture has been discussed. Critics of the switch say that x86 was a poor choice because of its lack of [[hardware register]]s compared to the PowerPC, and the lack of [[AltiVec]] (also known as [[Velocity Engine]]). Proponents have responded by saying that the x86 architecture has evolved greatly since the original 8086 was introduced, and that CPUs in general have combined [[RISC]] and [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] philosophies in their internal designs for some time, making the distinction obsolete. They also point out that improved [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] could equal [[AltiVec]], and that most programmers rarely deal with x86's peculiarities because the [[compiler]] does the work.\n\nThe PowerPC G5 was a 64-bit design, although very few applications made use of the increased address space. In contrast the original Core Solo and Core Duo chips were [[32-bit]]. On August 7, 2006, Apple released the [[Mac Pro]] and Intel-based [[Xserve]], introducing Intel 64 (Intel's implementation of [[x86-64]]) architecture into the lineup through the use of the [[Xeon]] processor. By August 7, 2007, all other computers in Apple's product line had been updated with the 64-bit Core 2 Duo; all subsequent Macs have had 64-bit processors.\n\nWhile the current benchmarks comparing Core Duo to Core 2 Duo processors show very little difference when running in 32 bit, the 64 bit edge has become more of an issue with the release of [[Mac OS X v10.6]] (Snow Leopard), and now users can dual boot Windows 7 in full 64-bit mode.{{Update inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Existing PowerPC applications===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Universal Binary Logo.png|thumb|right|125px|The Universal badge indicates software that will run at full speed on both PPC and Intel Macs.]]  -->Java applications (that do not rely on [[Java Native Interface]]), some [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]] [[Widget (computing)|Widgets]], and [[Scripting programming language|scripts]] that execute inside an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] all work immediately on both processors and are immune to changes.\n\nIn [[Mac OS X v10.4|Mac OS X 10.4]] to [[Mac OS X v10.6|Mac OS X 10.6]], PowerPC applications that cannot be migrated ran inside a PowerPC [[Binary translation|dynamic translator]] on Intel called \"[[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]].\" Rosetta is an instruction translator comparable to the 68k emulator that allows PowerPC Macintoshes to run pre-PowerPC code, rather than a virtual system like [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]]; it does not require a second operating system to be loaded as a subsystem before the application can work. It was originally limited to a [[PowerPC G3|G3]] instruction set, but later supported [[AltiVec]] and the [[PowerPC G4|G4]] instruction set, leaving only the [[PowerPC G5|G5]] additions unsupported. Rosetta was discontinued in [[Mac OS X v10.7|Mac OS X 10.7]] and is no longer available.\n\nAltiVec itself has been encapsulated since [[Mac OS X v10.3|Mac OS 10.3]] by a vectorization library; this library uses AltiVec on the PowerPC and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] (or equivalent regular instructions) on x86.\n\nA new version of [[Xcode]] was released that supported the generation of [[Universal Binaries]] for Intel and PowerPC, the new system's equivalent of the earlier 68k-PowerPC [[fat binary|fat binaries]]. [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] applications can be ported simply by recompiling them and checking for endianness problems. [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] applications required some additional tuning, but not of the complexity of the transition from Mac OS 9. Applications written using [[Metrowerks]] [[CodeWarrior]] suite had to be modified; those that use [[PowerPlant]] required further code changes, described by Apple and Metrowerks.\n\n[[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] is not supported on the x86 architecture. This means that pre-Mac OS X software does not run on Mac OS X out of the box, to which some users running older applications (such as [[QuarkXPress]] 4 and 5) objected.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} However, third-party emulators, such as [[Mini vMac]], [[Basilisk II]], and [[SheepShaver]], have been ported to Intel-based Macs, allowing some pre-Mac OS X software to run.\n\n==See also==\n* [[OSx86]]\n* [[Star Trek project]]\n\n==References==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

He went on the [[Munster]] Circuit, where he quickly acquired a large practice. He was a fine lawyer and an eloquent public  speaker. [[Maurice Healy (writer)|Maurice Healy]] recalled his \"beautiful voice\", which  was sometimes compared  to that of the great Russian singer [[Feodor Chaliapin]]: this, combined with a certain natural acting ability, made his arguments extraordinarily persuasive.\n\nHis  Courtroom victories included the [[libel]] action ''O'Keeffe v Cardinal Cullen'', an unprecedented legal victory by a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priest]] against [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Paul Cullen (cardinal)|Paul Cullen]] (although the verdict was reversed on appeal).<ref>(1873) I.R. 7 C.L. 319; the alleged libel was in fact a sentence of suspension.</ref>\n\nAnother  triumph  was in the disputed [[Will (law)|will]] case  of ''Bagot v Bagot'', where he appeared for Mrs. Alice Bagot (ne Verner), daughter of [[Sir William Verner, 2nd Baronet]] and Mary Pakenham, and  widow of Christopher  Nevile Bagot,  of Aughrane Castle,  [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[County Galway]]. Her husband had denied [[paternity (law)|paternity]] of her son, William,  and [[inheritance|disinherited]]  him in favour  \nof Christopher's brother John.

He  served on that Court with immense distinction for more than thirty years.\n\n===Reputation===\nThe old Court of Appeal  has been  described as  probably the strongest judicial tribunal ever to exist in Ireland, due to the presence of such exceptional judges as Fitzgibbon himself, [[Hugh Holmes]], [[Christopher Palles]] and [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]].  While Palles is usually regarded as the greatest of the  Irish judges, some contemporaries thought that FitzGibbon was at least his equal: it is noteworthy that when the [[House of Lords]] heard  appeals from  decisions where FitzGibbon had dissented, they almost always preferred his view to that of his colleagues.<ref>Fitzgerald p.30</ref>\n\nMaurice Healy believed that FitzGibbon as a judge fell short of true greatness due to a certain lack of judicial impartiality, in that if he had a strong sympathy for one party to the appeal, he always found a way of deciding  the case  in their favour.<ref>Maurice Healy, ''The Old Munster Circuit'' (1939), Mecier Press edition, pp. 260\u20131</ref> On the other hand, Healy thought that the courtesy with which he conducted every appeal, and the deep interest he took in the legal arguments, made appearing in front of him \"an intellectual treat\".<ref>Healy p.260</ref> Delaney praises Fitzgibbon  both for his profound erudition and his innate sense of justice.<ref>V.T.H. Delaney, ''Christopher Palles'',  Allen Figgis and Co Dublin (1960) p.138</ref> However he  agrees with Healy that FitzGibbon, like Lord Ashbourne, was a pragmatist, who would always try to find in favour of the party he believed to have justice on their side, even if the precedents  pointed  the other way. Palles and Holmes, by contrast, although they were no less anxious to do justice between the parties, went strictly by the precedents.<ref>Delaney p.158</ref>\n\n===''Quinn v Leathem''===\nFitzgibbon went regularly on [[assizes]], most often to Belfast. It was there in 1896 that he sat as the trial judge, with a jury, in the controversial case of ''[[Quinn v Leathem]]''.<ref>[1901] A.C 495</ref> The House of Lords subsequently found that for several members of a [[trade union]] to ask a businessman only to deal with customers who employ union labour amounts to a [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] to injure him, even though such a request, when made by an individual, had previously been found by the same tribunal in ''[[Allen v Flood]]''<ref>[1898] A.C. 1</ref> to be perfectly lawful. While the judgment on appeal aroused great indignation among trade unions, FitzGibbon, from the report of his summing up to the jury, seems to have stated the law (as it stood at the time) correctly.\n\n===Judicial style===\nHis judgments were written in a clear, sharp and decisive style, often with an abrupt opening sentence such as:  \"I doubt that the [Court of]  King's Bench can have been conscious of the consequences of its decision in this case\".<ref>''Antrim County Land, Building and Investment Co. v Stewart'' [1904] 2 I.R 357</ref>\n\nA good example of his judicial style can be found in  ''Aaron's Reefs v Twiss'',<ref>[1895] 2 1R 207</ref> where the Court of Appeal were divided on the question of whether certain statements in a company's [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] were simply \"optimistic\" or actually [[fraudulent]]. FitzGibbon found that there is no legal difference between a company which omits crucial facts from its prospectus and one which deliberately misrepresents the facts, remarking that:  \"if a company cannot be floated if the whole truth be disclosed by its prospectus, it cannot be honestly launched at all\". To the argument that the application of this standard of commercial honesty would be fatal to most company prospectuses, he observed drily: \"So much the better\".<ref>[1895] 2 IR 207, at 269</ref>\n\n==Political and social life==\nHe was a  Conservative in politics, and a close friend of [[Lord Randolph Churchill]];<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''Churchill''  Macmillan London 2001, p.13</ref> it was in a letter to FitzGibbon in 1886 that Churchill remarked that to effectively oppose the support of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]  for  [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]], \"the [[Orange Order|Orange]] card would be the one to play\".<ref>Kenneth Ferguson, ''King's Inns Barristers 1868\u20132004'', Dublin 2005 p.48</ref> Yet FitzGibbon  was noted for his political moderation: he had a wide circle of friends of differing political views, and his daughter Anne married a close relative of Gladstone.

It was initially coordinated by the [[European Cyclists' Federation|ECF]], ''De Frie Fugle'' (Denmark) and [[Sustrans]] (UK) and the original plan was to create 12 [[long-distance cycling route]]s.\n\nSince August 2007, the ECF has assumed full responsibility for the project. Despite sometimes tight financial constraints, the EuroVelo project has already begun to fulfil the vision of its founders with sections of the network being implemented in countries as far apart as Finland, Cyprus, Spain and the UK.  In addition, the EuroVelo brand has become widely known and is increasingly seen as a sign of quality.\n\nThere have been various changes to the network over the years, most notably the addition of two new routes \u2014 EuroVelo 13 (the [[Iron Curtain Trail]]) and EuroVelo 15 (the [[EV15 The Rhine Cycle Route|Rhine Cycle Route]]) \u2014 in September 2011, which are the longest and shortest of the EuroVelo routes.<ref>{{cite web|title=History - EuroVelo - the European cycle route network|url=http://www.eurovelo.org/home/history/|work=EuroVelo website|publisher=[[European Cyclists' Federation]]|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Main points on the EuroVelo routes==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+EuroVelo routes (connections to other EV routes are in parentheses)\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Route number\n! rowspan=2|Route name\n! rowspan=2|Passes through these cities\n! rowspan=2|Through these countries\n! colspan=2 |Length\n|-\n! km \n! mi\n|-style=\"background:#ddffdd;\"\n!

It was initially coordinated by the [[European Cyclists' Federation|ECF]], ''De Frie Fugle'' (Denmark) and [[Sustrans]] (UK) and the original plan was to create 12 [[long-distance cycling route]]s.\n\nSince August 2007, the ECF has assumed full responsibility for the project. Despite sometimes tight financial constraints, the EuroVelo project has already begun to fulfil the vision of its founders with sections of the network being implemented in countries as far apart as Finland, Cyprus, Spain and the UK.  In addition, the EuroVelo brand has become widely known and is increasingly seen as a sign of quality.\n\nThere have been various changes to the network over the years, most notably the addition of two new routes \u2014 EuroVelo 13 (the [[Iron Curtain Trail]]) and EuroVelo 15 (the [[EV15 The Rhine Cycle Route|Rhine Cycle Route]]) \u2014 in September 2011, which are the longest and shortest of the EuroVelo routes.<ref>{{cite web|title=History - EuroVelo - the European cycle route network|url=http://www.eurovelo.org/home/history/|work=EuroVelo website|publisher=[[European Cyclists' Federation]]|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Main points on the EuroVelo routes==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+EuroVelo routes (connections to other EV routes are in parentheses)\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Route number\n! rowspan=2|Route name\n! rowspan=2|Passes through these cities\n! rowspan=2|Through these countries\n! colspan=2 |Length\n|-\n! km \n! mi\n|-style=\"background:#ddffdd;\"\n!

Enfield, including its localities such as [[Ponders End]], [[Crews Hill]] and [[Freezywater]], had a total population of 132,640 in 2011; the wider borough meanwhile had a population of 333,869.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Edmonton Hundred}}\nEnfield was a set settlements united by one church, including by the [[High Middle Ages]] in 1303 a small agrarian market town, otherwise [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s spread around the royal hunting grounds of [[Enfield Chase]]. At the time of the [[Domesday Book]] the area was spelt 'Enefelde', and had a priest who almost certainly resided in [[St Andrew's Enfield|St. Andrew's Church]]. By 1572 most of the long-distance streets had been completed. The village green, in 1303, became a marketplace making the place a market town; the area between the church and the present fountain. Traders sell products at the regular market, on licence by a non-discriminatory poor relief charity covering the whole Borough. Its name most likely came from [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''\u0112anafeld'' or similar, meaning \"open land belonging to a man called \u0112ana\" or \"open land for lambs\".  The parish was the largest in [[Middlesex]] if excluding from [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] its [[Pinner]] north-west corner, which broke away in 1766; Enfield measured 12,460 acres in 1831, i.e. {{convert|19.5|sqmi}}.<ref>A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton, Eileen P Scarff and G C Tyack, 'Enfield: Introduction', in ''[[Victoria County History|A History of the County of Middlesex]]'': Volume 5 ed.

Enfield, including its localities such as [[Ponders End]], [[Crews Hill]] and [[Freezywater]], had a total population of 132,640 in 2011; the wider borough meanwhile had a population of 333,869.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Edmonton Hundred}}\nEnfield was a set settlements united by one church, including by the [[High Middle Ages]] in 1303 a small agrarian market town, otherwise [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s spread around the royal hunting grounds of [[Enfield Chase]]. At the time of the [[Domesday Book]] the area was spelt 'Enefelde', and had a priest who almost certainly resided in [[St Andrew's Enfield|St. Andrew's Church]]. By 1572 most of the long-distance streets had been completed. The village green, in 1303, became a marketplace making the place a market town; the area between the church and the present fountain. Traders sell products at the regular market, on licence by a non-discriminatory poor relief charity covering the whole Borough. Its name most likely came from [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''\u0112anafeld'' or similar, meaning \"open land belonging to a man called \u0112ana\" or \"open land for lambs\".  The parish was the largest in [[Middlesex]] if excluding from [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] its [[Pinner]] north-west corner, which broke away in 1766; Enfield measured 12,460 acres in 1831, i.e. {{convert|19.5|sqmi}}.<ref>A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton, Eileen P Scarff and G C Tyack, 'Enfield: Introduction', in ''[[Victoria County History|A History of the County of Middlesex]]'': Volume 5 ed.
