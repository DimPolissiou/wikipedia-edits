At the time of the declaration of independence of Belgium in 1830, three state universities existed in the cities of [[Ghent]], [[Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Leuven]]. In Brussels, the capital of the newly established country, a university was lacking. A group of leading [[intellectual]]s in the fields of arts, science, and education \u2013 amongst whom [[Auguste Baron]] and the astronomer and mathematician [[Adolphe Quetelet]] \u2014 pointed out the advantages of a university to the new capital and country.<ref name=\"Witte1996\"/> Initially, they sought for the establishment of a state university, but the Belgian government showed little enthusiasm due to the onerous financial burden of yet another state university.\n\nIn 1834, the Belgian [[episcopate]] decided to establish a Catholic university in [[Mechelen]] with the aim of regaining the influence of the Catholic Church on the academic scene in Belgium, and the Belgian government had the intent to close the state university at Leuven and donate the buildings to the Catholic institution.<ref name=\"Lamberts1990\">{{Cite book\n | last = Lamberts\n | first = Emiel\n | last2 = Roegiers\n | first2 = Jan (eds.)\n | year = 1990\n | title = Leuven University, 1425\u20131985\n | publication-place = Leuven\n | publisher = Leuven University Press\n | isbn = 90-6186-418-6\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref> The liberals in Belgium strongly opposed to this decision, and furthered their ideas for a university in Brussels as a counterbalance to the Catholic institution. At the same time, Auguste Baron had just become a member of the [[Freemasonry|freemasonic]] lodge \"Les Amis Philantropes\", as had a large number of other intellectuals with enlightened ideas. Baron was able to convince [[Pierre-Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]], the president of the lodge, to support the idea for a new university. On 24 June 1834, Verhaegen presented his plan to establish a free university.<ref name=\"Witte1996\"/>\n\nAfter sufficient funding was collected among advocates, the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles was inaugurated on 20 November 1834, in the Gothic room of the city hall of Brussels. After its establishment, the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles faced difficult times, since it did receive no [[Subsidy|subsidies]] or grants from the government; yearly fundraising events and tuition fees provided the only financial means. Verhaegen, who became a professor and later head of the new university, gave it a mission statement which he summarized in a speech to [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]]: the principle of ''free inquiry'' and academic freedom uninfluenced by any political or religious [[authority]].<ref name=\"Witte1996\"/>\n\n=== Splitting of the university ===\nIn the nineteenth century, courses at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles were taught exclusively in French, the language of the upper class in Belgium at that time. However, with the Dutch-speaking population asking for more rights in Belgium, some courses were already taught in Dutch at the Faculty of Law as early as 1935. Nevertheless, it was not until 1963 that all faculties offered their courses in Dutch.<ref name=\"HistoryVrijeUniversiteitBrussel\">{{cite web\n |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/about.html\n |title = About the University: Culture and History\n |accessdate = 25 November 2007\n |publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n}}</ref> On 1 October 1969, the university was finally split in two sister institutions: the French-speaking Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles and the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel. This splitting became official by the law of 28 May 1970, of the Belgian parliament, by which the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles became two separate [[Juristic person|legal entities]].<ref name=\"Law28May1970\">{{cite web\n |url = http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/edulex/database/document/document.asp?docid=12770\n |title = Law of 28 May 1970, concerning the splitting of the universities in Brussels and Leuven\n |accessdate = 25 November 2007\n |publisher = Belgisch Staatsblad/Flemish Government\n|language=nl}}</ref>\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe Vrije Universiteit Brussel is an independent institution. The members of all its governing entities are elected by the entire academic community \u2013 including [[Faculty (division)|faculty staff]], researchers, personnel, and students.<ref name=\"Statutes\"/> This system guarantees the democratic process of decision-making and the independence from state and outside organisations. Nevertheless, the university receives significant funding from the Flemish government, although less than other [[List of Belgian universities|Flemish universities]]. Other important funding sources are grants for research projects (mostly from [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[European Union|European]] funding agencies), scholarships of academic members, revenues from cooperation with industry, and [[Tuition|tuition fees]] to a lesser extent.\n\nThe main organisational structure of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is its division into [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]:<ref name=\"VUB Faculties\">See the {{cite web\n |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/faculties.html\n |title = Faculties of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n |accessdate = 15 August 2013\n |publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n}}</ref>\n*Faculty of Law and Criminology\n*Faculty of Social Sciences & Solvay Business School\n*Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences\n*Faculty of Sciences and Bio-engineering Sciences\n*Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy\n*Faculty of Arts and Philosophy\n*Faculty of Engineering\n*Faculty of Physical Education and Physiotherapy\nThese faculties benefit a wide [[autonomy]] over how they structure their educational programmes and research efforts, although their decisions need to comply with the university's statutes and must be approved by the central administration.\n\nThe [[Central Administration|central administration]] is formed by the Governing Board, which is currently presided by Eddy Van Gelder. It decides the university's long-term vision and must approve all decisions made by the faculties. The Governing Board is supported by three advising bodies: the Research Council, the Education Council, and the Senate. These bodies provide advice to the Governing Board on all issues regarding research, education, and the academic excellence of faculty staff, and may also propose changes to the university's strategy. The daily management of the university is the responsibility of the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] and three Vice-Rectors.

In agreement with the [[Bologna process]], the university has implemented the so-called bachelor-master system. It therefore issues four types of [[Academic degree|degrees]]: bachelor's, master's, master after master's, and [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees.\n\n[[University and college admissions|Admission]] to the programmes is generally not restricted; anyone can subscribe to the programme of his/her choice. However, prerequisite degrees may be mandatory for advanced programmes, e.g., a bachelor's degree is required to subscribe to a master's programme, and a master's degree is required to subscribe to a master after master's or doctoral programme. An exception to this is the admission exam to the bachelor in medicine, which is required following ruling of the Flemish government. Tuition fees are low, and even decreased or eliminated for some students with less financial means.\n\nThe [[Academic term|academic year]] is divided into two semesters, each spanning thirteen course weeks: the first semester lasts from October to January, the second semester from February to June. Students take [[Test (student assessment)|exams]] in January and June. Apart from the Christmas and Easter holidays (both lasting two weeks) that are normally used to prepare for the exams, students are free the week between both semesters and during the summer vacations from July to September.\n\nThe university has implemented several [[quality control]] schemes in order to preserve the high quality of its educational programmes. Each semester, all students [[Evaluation|evaluate]] the courses they have followed. All programmes are also regularly assessed by internal panels and by external international visitation committees. Furthermore, all programmes are accredited by the [[NVAO|Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie]], an independent accreditation organisation charged with the [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] of higher education programmes in both [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=\"NVAO\">Accreditation details can be consulted at {{cite web\n |url = http://search.nvao.net/search-detail-institution/23/43427/-1\n |title = the website of NVAO\n |accessdate = 15 August 2013\n |publisher = NVAO\u2014Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders\n}}</ref>\n\n== Research ==\nNotable faculty:\n* [[Diederik Aerts]]\n* [[Kris Deschouwer]]\n* [[Paul Devroey]]\n* Mark Elchardus\n* [[Francis Heylighen]]\n* Jonathan Holslag\n* [[Dave Sinardet]]\n* Hugo Soly\n* [[Luc Steels]]\n* [[Jean-Paul Van Bendegem]]\n* Andre Van Steirteghem\n* Irina Veretennicoff\n* [[Els Witte]]\n* [[Lode Wyns]]\n\n== Basic principles ==\nThe Vrije Universiteit Brussel considers itself an open-minded and tolerant university.<ref name=\"Smaakmaker\">{{Cite journal\n | year = 2012\n | title = Welcoming the World\n | publication-place = Brussels\n | publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n | url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/downloads/VUB_CorporateBrochure.pdf\n | accessdate = 2013-08-15\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n|language=nl}}</ref> Its central principles are the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and in particular the principle of ''free inquiry'' for the progress of humanity. The latter includes the dismissal of any argument of authority and the right of free opinion.<ref name=\"Statutes\"/> The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is the only Flemish university that has incorporated such principle in its statutes. The principle of free inquiry is often described by a quotation of the French [[mathematician]] and philosopher [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]]:\n[[File:VUB schild2.png|right|225px|Seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]\n{{quote\n |text= \nThinking must never submit itself,<br />\nneither to a dogma,<br />\nnor to a party,<br />\nnor to a passion,<br />\nnor to an interest,<br />\nnor to a preconceived idea,<br />\nnor to anything whatsoever,<br />\nexcept to the facts themselves,<br />\nbecause for it to submit to anything else would be the end of its existence.\n|sign=}}\nThis principle is also reflected in the university's [[motto]] ''Scientia vincere tenebras'', or ''Conquering darkness by science'', and in its seal. The seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel displays a beggar's wallet and joined hands on the orange-white-blue (the colours of the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]]) [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] in the [[emblem]], referring to the struggle of the Protestant [[Geuzen]] and the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]] against the oppressive Spanish rule and the [[Inquisition]] in the sixteenth century.\n\nAnother basic principle of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel \u2013 also incorporated in the university's statutes \u2013 is that the institution must be managed according to the model of democracy.<ref name=\"Statutes\"/> Practically, this means that all members of the academic community \u2014 [[Faculty (division)|faculty staff]], researchers, personnel, and students \u2013 are represented in all governing bodies. In this way, the university ensures that everyone has a voice in its decision-making processes and participates in its management. This principle must also guarantee the independence of the university and the academic freedom.\n\n== Campus and facilities ==\n[[File:VUB campus Etterbeek.JPG|thumb|[[Etterbeek]] campus]]\n''Brussels Humanities, Sciences & Engineering Campus''<br>\nMost of the faculties are located on the [[Etterbeek]] campus (which is actually located on the territory of the neighbouring borough of [[Elsene]]).

In addition, there is a modern sports centre, a football pitch encircled by a running track, and a swimming pool.

Together with their French-speaking counterparts ACE at the [[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles|ULB]], they organise the annual [[St V]] memorial.\n\nThese are some of the student organizations at the VUB:\n*Studiekring vrij onderzoek: a collective of students from various faculties, promoting free inquiry through the organisation of debates, lectures and more\n*Letteren-en Wijsbegeertekring (LWK): for students studying at the Arts and Philosophy faculty\n*Perskring (Pers): for students studying Communication Sciences <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.perskring.com/over-perskring/|last=PERS}}</ref>\n*Geneeskundige Kring (GK) and Farmaceutische Kring (FK): for students studying at the Medicine and Pharmacy faculty\n*Polytechnische Kring (PK) for students studying at the Engineering faculty\n*Psycho-Pedagogische Kring (PPK): for students studying at the Psychology and Educational Sciences faculty\n*Kring der Politieke Economische en Sociale Wetenschappen (KEPS) and Solvay ($); for students studying at the Economics and Political faculty\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|Wetenschappelijke Kring (WK)|nl}}: for students studying at the faculty of Sciences and Bio-engineering Sciences\n*Mens Sana in Corpore Sano (Mesacosa or MC): for students studying at the Physical Education and Physiotherapy faculty\n*Vlaams Rechtsgenootschap (VRG): for students studying at the Law and Criminology faculty\n*Vrije Universiteit Brussel Model United Nations (VUBMUN): for all students of the VUB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/vubmun/|title=Vrije Universiteit Brussel Model United Nations|last=VUBMUN}}</ref>\n\nMembers of these organizations ''(except VUBMUN)'' wear a ''[[Student cap|klak]]'' (Dutch) or ''penne'' (French).\n\nFurthermore, the VUB has student organizations for students with a specific regional background. They are: Antverpia ([[Antwerp]]), Westland ([[Westhoek (region)|Westhoek]]), WUK ([[West Flanders]]), KBS ([[Brussels]] and [[Flemish Brabant]]), Campina ([[Campine]]), Kinneke Baba ([[East Flanders]]), Limburgia ([[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]), VSKM ([[Mechelen]]) and Hesbania ([[Haspengouw]]). There are also several organizations for specific majors within a faculty, such as Infogroep (computer science), Biotecho (bio-engineering), bru:tecture (previously Pantheon) (architecture) and Promeco (economics). Last but not least there are organizations centered around a common interest, such as the Society of Weird And Mad People (SWAMP, for all kinds of games) and BierKultuur (based on the rich beer culture in Belgium).\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn 2017 and 2018, it was reported <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/picktherightschool|title=}}</ref> that the Vrije Universiteit Brussels did unscrupulous practices of not fully refunding deposit monies of international applicants who decided not to attend or who were not able to attend for some reason (e.g. chose another university, or student visa was denied, etc.), thereby not honoring the deposit contracts with applicant students. The university was reported to use undisclosed and excessively favorable exchange rates for the university to hold up to 7-10% of the deposit amounts within a few months, which amounted to 600-900 Euros or approximately $700-$1000 per applicant; so it was estimated that the university was making equivalent of millions of Euros from hundreds of international applicants this way in the past couple of years.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n{{see also|List of people from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel}}\n\n=== Scientists & Academics ===\n* [[Patrick Baert]] (1961\u2013)\n* Willy Gepts

At the time of the declaration of independence of Belgium in 1830, three state universities existed in the cities of [[Ghent]], [[Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Leuven]]. In Brussels, the capital of the newly established country, a university was lacking. A group of leading [[intellectual]]s in the fields of arts, science, and education \u2013 amongst whom [[Auguste Baron]] and the astronomer and mathematician [[Adolphe Quetelet]] \u2014 pointed out the advantages of a university to the new capital and country.<ref name=\"Witte1996\"/> Initially, they sought for the establishment of a state university, but the Belgian government showed little enthusiasm due to the onerous financial burden of yet another state university.\n\nIn 1834, the Belgian [[episcopate]] decided to establish a Catholic university in [[Mechelen]] with the aim of regaining the influence of the Catholic Church on the academic scene in Belgium, and the Belgian government had the intent to close the state university at Leuven and donate the buildings to the Catholic institution.<ref name=\"Lamberts1990\">{{Cite book\n | last = Lamberts\n | first = Emiel\n | last2 = Roegiers\n | first2 = Jan (eds.)\n | year = 1990\n | title = Leuven University, 1425\u20131985\n | publication-place = Leuven\n | publisher = Leuven University Press\n | isbn = 90-6186-418-6\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref> The liberals in Belgium strongly opposed to this decision, and furthered their ideas for a university in Brussels as a counterbalance to the Catholic institution. At the same time, Auguste Baron had just become a member of the [[Freemasonry|freemasonic]] lodge \"Les Amis Philantropes\", as had a large number of other intellectuals with enlightened ideas. Baron was able to convince [[Pierre-Th\u00e9odore Verhaegen]], the president of the lodge, to support the idea for a new university. On 24 June 1834, Verhaegen presented his plan to establish a free university.<ref name=\"Witte1996\"/>\n\nAfter sufficient funding was collected among advocates, the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles was inaugurated on 20 November 1834, in the Gothic room of the city hall of Brussels. After its establishment, the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles faced difficult times, since it did receive no [[Subsidy|subsidies]] or grants from the government; yearly fundraising events and tuition fees provided the only financial means. Verhaegen, who became a professor and later head of the new university, gave it a mission statement which he summarized in a speech to [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]]: the principle of ''free inquiry'' and academic freedom uninfluenced by any political or religious [[authority]].<ref name=\"Witte1996\"/>\n\n=== Splitting of the university ===\nIn the nineteenth century, courses at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles were taught exclusively in French, the language of the upper class in Belgium at that time. However, with the Dutch-speaking population asking for more rights in Belgium, some courses were already taught in Dutch at the Faculty of Law as early as 1935. Nevertheless, it was not until 1963 that all faculties offered their courses in Dutch.<ref name=\"HistoryVrijeUniversiteitBrussel\">{{cite web\n |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/about.html\n |title = About the University: Culture and History\n |accessdate = 25 November 2007\n |publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n}}</ref> On 1 October 1969, the university was finally split in two sister institutions: the French-speaking Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles and the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel. This splitting became official by the law of 28 May 1970, of the Belgian parliament, by which the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles became two separate [[Juristic person|legal entities]].<ref name=\"Law28May1970\">{{cite web\n |url = http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/edulex/database/document/document.asp?docid=12770\n |title = Law of 28 May 1970, concerning the splitting of the universities in Brussels and Leuven\n |accessdate = 25 November 2007\n |publisher = Belgisch Staatsblad/Flemish Government\n|language=nl}}</ref>\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe Vrije Universiteit Brussel is an independent institution. The members of all its governing entities are elected by the entire academic community \u2013 including [[Faculty (division)|faculty staff]], researchers, personnel, and students.<ref name=\"Statutes\"/> This system guarantees the democratic process of decision-making and the independence from state and outside organisations. Nevertheless, the university receives significant funding from the Flemish government, although less than other [[List of Belgian universities|Flemish universities]]. Other important funding sources are grants for research projects (mostly from [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[European Union|European]] funding agencies), scholarships of academic members, revenues from cooperation with industry, and [[Tuition|tuition fees]] to a lesser extent.\n\nThe main organisational structure of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is its division into [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]:<ref name=\"VUB Faculties\">See the {{cite web\n |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/faculties.html\n |title = Faculties of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n |accessdate = 15 August 2013\n |publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n}}</ref>\n*Faculty of Law and Criminology\n*Faculty of Social Sciences & Solvay Business School\n*Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences\n*Faculty of Sciences and Bio-engineering Sciences\n*Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy\n*Faculty of Arts and Philosophy\n*Faculty of Engineering\n*Faculty of Physical Education and Physiotherapy\nThese faculties benefit a wide [[autonomy]] over how they structure their educational programmes and research efforts, although their decisions need to comply with the university's statutes and must be approved by the central administration.\n\nThe [[Central Administration|central administration]] is formed by the Governing Board, which is currently presided by Eddy Van Gelder. It decides the university's long-term vision and must approve all decisions made by the faculties. The Governing Board is supported by three advising bodies: the Research Council, the Education Council, and the Senate. These bodies provide advice to the Governing Board on all issues regarding research, education, and the academic excellence of faculty staff, and may also propose changes to the university's strategy. The daily management of the university is the responsibility of the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] and three Vice-Rectors.

About 12,000 students follow one of its [[List of educational programmes at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel|128 educational programmes]].<ref name=\"EducationalProgrammes\">According to the {{cite web\n |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/en/programmes\n |title = official list of educational programmes at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n |accessdate = 15 August 2013\n |publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n}}</ref> All programmes are taught in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but 59 are also taught in English. In agreement with the [[Bologna process]], the university has implemented the so-called bachelor-master system. It therefore issues four types of [[Academic degree|degrees]]: bachelor's, master's, master after master's, and [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees.\n\n[[University and college admissions|Admission]] to the programmes is generally not restricted; anyone can subscribe to the programme of his/her choice. However, prerequisite degrees may be mandatory for advanced programmes, e.g., a bachelor's degree is required to subscribe to a master's programme, and a master's degree is required to subscribe to a master after master's or doctoral programme. An exception to this is the admission exam to the bachelor in medicine, which is required following ruling of the Flemish government. Tuition fees are low, and even decreased or eliminated for some students with less financial means.\n\nThe [[Academic term|academic year]] is divided into two semesters, each spanning thirteen course weeks: the first semester lasts from October to January, the second semester from February to June. Students take [[Test (student assessment)|exams]] in January and June. Apart from the Christmas and Easter holidays (both lasting two weeks) that are normally used to prepare for the exams, students are free the week between both semesters and during the summer vacations from July to September.\n\nThe university has implemented several [[quality control]] schemes in order to preserve the high quality of its educational programmes. Each semester, all students [[Evaluation|evaluate]] the courses they have followed. All programmes are also regularly assessed by internal panels and by external international visitation committees. Furthermore, all programmes are accredited by the [[NVAO|Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie]], an independent accreditation organisation charged with the [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] of higher education programmes in both [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=\"NVAO\">Accreditation details can be consulted at {{cite web\n |url = http://search.nvao.net/search-detail-institution/23/43427/-1\n |title = the website of NVAO\n |accessdate = 15 August 2013\n |publisher = NVAO\u2014Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders\n}}</ref>\n\n== Research ==\nNotable faculty:\n* [[Diederik Aerts]]\n* [[Kris Deschouwer]]\n* [[Paul Devroey]]\n* Mark Elchardus\n* [[Francis Heylighen]]\n* Jonathan Holslag\n* [[Dave Sinardet]]\n* Hugo Soly\n* [[Luc Steels]]\n* [[Jean-Paul Van Bendegem]]\n* Andre Van Steirteghem\n* Irina Veretennicoff\n* [[Els Witte]]\n* [[Lode Wyns]]\n\n== Basic principles ==\nThe Vrije Universiteit Brussel considers itself an open-minded and tolerant university.<ref name=\"Smaakmaker\">{{Cite journal\n | year = 2012\n | title = Welcoming the World\n | publication-place = Brussels\n | publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n | url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/downloads/VUB_CorporateBrochure.pdf\n | accessdate = 2013-08-15\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n|language=nl}}</ref> Its central principles are the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and in particular the principle of ''free inquiry'' for the progress of humanity. The latter includes the dismissal of any argument of authority and the right of free opinion.<ref name=\"Statutes\"/> The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is the only Flemish university that has incorporated such principle in its statutes. The principle of free inquiry is often described by a quotation of the French [[mathematician]] and philosopher [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]]:\n[[File:VUB schild2.png|right|225px|Seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]\n{{quote\n |text= \nThinking must never submit itself,<br />\nneither to a dogma,<br />\nnor to a party,<br />\nnor to a passion,<br />\nnor to an interest,<br />\nnor to a preconceived idea,<br />\nnor to anything whatsoever,<br />\nexcept to the facts themselves,<br />\nbecause for it to submit to anything else would be the end of its existence.\n|sign=}}\nThis principle is also reflected in the university's [[motto]] ''Scientia vincere tenebras'', or ''Conquering darkness by science'', and in its seal. The seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel displays a beggar's wallet and joined hands on the orange-white-blue (the colours of the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]]) [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] in the [[emblem]], referring to the struggle of the Protestant [[Geuzen]] and the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]] against the oppressive Spanish rule and the [[Inquisition]] in the sixteenth century.\n\nAnother basic principle of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel \u2013 also incorporated in the university's statutes \u2013 is that the institution must be managed according to the model of democracy.<ref name=\"Statutes\"/> Practically, this means that all members of the academic community \u2014 [[Faculty (division)|faculty staff]], researchers, personnel, and students \u2013 are represented in all governing bodies. In this way, the university ensures that everyone has a voice in its decision-making processes and participates in its management. This principle must also guarantee the independence of the university and the academic freedom.\n\n== Campus and facilities ==\n[[File:VUB campus Etterbeek.JPG|thumb|[[Etterbeek]] campus]]\n''Brussels Humanities, Sciences & Engineering Campus''<br>\nMost of the faculties are located on the [[Etterbeek]] campus (which is actually located on the territory of the neighbouring borough of [[Elsene]]).

Some are decaying rapidly but at least one, the Rectoraat designed by [[Renaat Braem]], is heritage-listed.<ref>https://www.vub.ac.be/downloads/GebouwM-NL.pdf</ref>  Activities take place in numerous auditoriums and labs. In addition, there is a modern sports centre, a football pitch encircled by a running track, and a swimming pool. For eating out, there is a restaurant with subsidies for students and staff, and the bars/cafes 't Complex, Opinio, and KultuurKaffee. The {{Interlanguage link multi|KultuurKaffee|nl}} was a full-fledged concert venue during the evening/night, offering the university a cultural scene and organising free concerts and events. It was demolished to make space for the new XY construction project in 2015.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.demorgen.be/muziek/kultuurkaffee-van-vub-sluit-na-dit-weekend-de-deuren-b89937bc | title = KultuurKaffee van VUB sluit na dit weekend de deuren | date = 2015 | publisher = DeMorgen | access-date = 22 November 2015|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n[[File:Renaat Braem Rectoraat VUB.JPG|thumbnail|right|Rectoraat, VUB]]\n\n''Brussels Health Campus''<br>\nThe campus in [[Jette]] is also a fully-fledged campus.

The clinical activities soon rocketed to the #1 position in Belgium, and has been paralleled by important scientific production. Emerging fields of activity are multidisciplinary (clinical) and translational (research) programs in collaboration with the departments of Genetics, Pediatrics, Neonatology, Geriatrics, Neurology, as well as a fundamental research program in Physiology. \nThe large scope of clinical activities, fuelled by increasing patient demand in Belgium and elsewhere, together with the presence of a state-of-the-art infrastructure and a research-stimulating multidisciplinary academic environment unique in Europe, as well as the intrinsic qualities of Professor Prof. Dr. Pedro Brugada and his team, are a unique opportunity for the Vrije Universiteit Brussel to implement this academic training program.\n\nThis Postgraduate course in Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacing \u2013 is offered within the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy \u2013 after a specialization in Cardiology, and is supported by the Institute for Postgraduate Training of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (iPAVUB). The core faculty for the Postgraduate program includes Prof. Dr. Pedro Brugada, who directs the EP fellowship training and the Cardiovascular Department, Prof. Dr. Carlo de Asmundis, Director of the Heart rhythm Management Centre, Prof. Dr. Gian Battista Chierchia, Director of Atrial Fibrillation Program, Prof. Dr. Marc La Meir and Prof. Dr. Francis Wellens, Director of Cardiac Surgery Service. Additional faculty who participate in the program includes: Prof. Dr. Bonduelle Mary-Louise and Prof. Dr. Ramon Brugada, who trains fellows in cardiac genetics, Prof. Dr. Joel Smets, University of Nijmegen, Nederland, who trains fellows in electrocardiography and basic electrophysiology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/en/study/cardiac-electrophysiology-and-pacing|title=Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacing|publisher=vub.ac.be}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\n[[File:Penne CM.jpg|thumb|A traditional ''klak'' or ''penne'']]\n\nEvery student that enrolls at the VUB, automatically becomes a member of the Brussels Studentengenootschap (BSG \u2013 ''Brussels Student Society''), unless they refuse to be. This means that every student has the right to vote and participate in the annual elections for the BSG committee. The BSG is the umbrella organisation for all other student organizations and acts as the defender of the moral interests of the students. Together with their French-speaking counterparts ACE at the [[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles|ULB]], they organise the annual [[St V]] memorial.\n\nThese are some of the student organizations at the VUB:\n*Studiekring vrij onderzoek: a collective of students from various faculties, promoting free inquiry through the organisation of debates, lectures and more\n*Letteren-en Wijsbegeertekring (LWK): for students studying at the Arts and Philosophy faculty\n*Perskring (Pers): for students studying Communication Sciences <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.perskring.com/over-perskring/|last=PERS}}</ref>\n*Geneeskundige Kring (GK) and Farmaceutische Kring (FK): for students studying at the Medicine and Pharmacy faculty\n*Polytechnische Kring (PK) for students studying at the Engineering faculty\n*Psycho-Pedagogische Kring (PPK): for students studying at the Psychology and Educational Sciences faculty\n*Kring der Politieke Economische en Sociale Wetenschappen (KEPS) and Solvay ($); for students studying at the Economics and Political faculty\n*{{Interlanguage link multi|Wetenschappelijke Kring (WK)|nl}}: for students studying at the faculty of Sciences and Bio-engineering Sciences\n*Mens Sana in Corpore Sano (Mesacosa or MC): for students studying at the Physical Education and Physiotherapy faculty\n*Vlaams Rechtsgenootschap (VRG): for students studying at the Law and Criminology faculty\n*Vrije Universiteit Brussel Model United Nations (VUBMUN): for all students of the VUB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/vubmun/|title=Vrije Universiteit Brussel Model United Nations|last=VUBMUN}}</ref>\n\nMembers of these organizations ''(except VUBMUN)'' wear a ''[[Student cap|klak]]'' (Dutch) or ''penne'' (French).\n\nFurthermore, the VUB has student organizations for students with a specific regional background. They are: Antverpia ([[Antwerp]]), Westland ([[Westhoek (region)|Westhoek]]), WUK ([[West Flanders]]), KBS ([[Brussels]] and [[Flemish Brabant]]), Campina ([[Campine]]), Kinneke Baba ([[East Flanders]]), Limburgia ([[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]), VSKM ([[Mechelen]]) and Hesbania ([[Haspengouw]]). There are also several organizations for specific majors within a faculty, such as Infogroep (computer science), Biotecho (bio-engineering), bru:tecture (previously Pantheon) (architecture) and Promeco (economics). Last but not least there are organizations centered around a common interest, such as the Society of Weird And Mad People (SWAMP, for all kinds of games) and BierKultuur (based on the rich beer culture in Belgium).\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn 2017 and 2018, it was reported <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/picktherightschool|title=}}</ref> that the Vrije Universiteit Brussels did unscrupulous practices of not fully refunding deposit monies of international applicants who decided not to attend or who were not able to attend for some reason (e.g. chose another university, or student visa was denied, etc.), thereby not honoring the deposit contracts with applicant students. The university was reported to use undisclosed and excessively favorable exchange rates for the university to hold up to 7-10% of the deposit amounts within a few months, which amounted to 600-900 Euros or approximately $700-$1000 per applicant; so it was estimated that the university was making equivalent of millions of Euros from hundreds of international applicants this way in the past couple of years.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n{{see also|List of people from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel}}\n\n=== Scientists & Academics ===\n* [[Patrick Baert]] (1961\u2013)\n* Willy Gepts (1922\u20131991)\n* [[Leo Apostel]] (1925\u20131995)\n* Clement Hiel (1952\u2013)\n* [[Christine Van Den Wyngaert]] (1952\u2013)\n* [[Jean Bourgain]] (1954\u20132018)\n* [[Ingrid Daubechies]] (1954\u2013)\n* [[Sophie de Schaepdrijver]] (1961\u2013)\n* [[Kris Deschouwer]]\n* [[Raymond Hamers]]\n* [[Steven Laureys]]\n* Wim Leemans\n* [[Pattie Maes]]\n* Helena Van Swygenhoven\n* [[Els Witte]]\n* Guido Geerts\n* Johan Schoukens\n\n=== Artists ===\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Delvaux]] (1926\u20132002)\n* [[Jef Geeraerts]] (1930\u2013)\n* [[Erik Pevernagie]] (1939)\n* [[Fabienne Demal]] ([[Axelle Red]]) (1968\u2013)\n\n=== Businesspeople ===\n* Pieter De Leenheer\n*[[Tony Mary]] (1950\u2013)\n*Felix Van de Maele \n\n=== Politicians ===\n* [[Louis Tobback]] (1938\u2013)\n* [[Annemie Neyts]] (1944\u2013)\n* Norbert De Batselier (1947\u2013)\n* [[Karel De Gucht]] (1954\u2013)\n* [[Christian Leysen]] (1954\u2013)\n* [[Patrick Dewael]] (1955\u2013)\n* [[Frank Vanhecke]] (1959\u2013)\n* [[Bert Anciaux]] (1959\u2013)\n* Gunther Sleeuwagen (1958\u2013)\n* [[Jan Jambon]] (1960\u2013)\n* [[Maggie De Block]] (1962\u2013)\n* [[Willy Claes]] (1938\u2013)\n* [[Zoran Milanovi\u0107]] (1966\u2013)\n*[[Alexander De Croo]] (1975-)\n\n=== Athletes ===\n* [[S\u00e9bastien Godefroid]] (1971\u2013), olympic sailor\n\n=== Journalists ===\n* Yves Desmet\n* Jean Mentens\n\n==Honorary doctorates==\nNotable recipients of honorary doctorates (doctor ''honoris causa'') at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel include:\n* [[Nelson Mandela]]\n* [[V\u00e1clav Havel]]\n* [[Jacques Cousteau]]\n* [[Hans Blix]]\n* [[Julia Gillard]]\n* [[Noam Chomsky]]\n* [[Dario Fo]], [[Sonia Gandhi]]\n* Natan Ramet\n* [[Richard Stallman]]\n* [[Johann Olav Koss]]\n* [[Herman van Veen]] \n* [[Richard Dawkins]]\n* [[Kim Clijsters]]\n* [[Rom Harr\u00e9]]\n* [[Daniel Barenboim]]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- * [[Brussels Faculty of Engineering (BRUFACE)]] http://www.bruface.eu --> \n* [[Flanders Interuniversity Institute of Biotechnology]] (VIB)\n* [[Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre]] (IMEC)\n* [[Science and technology in Brussels]]\n* [[Science and technology in Flanders]]\n* [[Top Industrial Managers for Europe]]\n* [[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles|Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]]\n* [[University Foundation]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.vub.ac.be/en Official website] of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n* {{in lang|nl}} [http://www.vub.ac.be/ Official website] of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n* [http://www.vub.ac.be/vlaamsestudenteninbrussel/markante.html More complete list of famous alumni (in Dutch)]\n* [http://www.highereducation.be/content.php?section=zoekmachine&subsection=eenvoudig&action=zoeken Find an officially recognised programme of this institution in the Higher Education Register]\n* [http://www.virbr.be/ V.Ir.Br. \u2013 VUB Engineering Alumni Association]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/picktherightschool]\n\n{{Top Industrial Managers for Europe}}\n{{UNICA}}\n{{Belgian universities}}\n\n{{coord|50.82242|N|4.39573|E|source:placeopedia|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Vrije Universiteit Brussel| ]]\n[[Category:Research institutes in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Flanders]]\n[[Category:History of Brussels]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1970]]\n[[Category:Business schools in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Engineering universities and colleges in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Information schools]]\n[[Category:1970 establishments in Belgium]]\n", "name_user": "Me, Myself, and I are Here", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:adjust bold, dash", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrije_Universiteit_Brussel"}

For more than 150 years, most historians denied rumors from Jefferson's presidency that he had a slave [[concubine]]. Based on his grandson's report, they said that one of his nephews had been the father of Hemings' children. Before changing his mind following the results of DNA analysis in 1998, Jefferson biographer [[Joseph J. Ellis]] had said, \"The alleged liaison between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings may be described as the longest-running miniseries in American history.\"<ref>[http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/jefferson/ Edward J.

Brodie]] suggested Jefferson had been the father of Hemings' children. Her writings were widely discussed, and Jefferson historians began to lose control of the narrative. While mainstream historians criticized Brodie for her psychological analysis, her publications included detailed footnotes and interviews with descendants of Jefferson's mixed-race children.\n\nIn 1979 [[Barbara Chase-Riboud]] published a well-received and bestselling novel on Hemings that gave her a \"compelling\" voice, portraying her as both an independent woman and Jefferson's concubine.<ref>Gallagher, \"Episodes\", ''The Jefferson-Hemings Controversy''</ref> Jefferson historians succeeded in suppressing a planned CBS [[television film]] based on this novel.<ref name=\"CBS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/ |title=The History of a Secret |work=Jefferson's Blood | publisher=PBS Frontline|date= May 2000 |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}Quote: \"More than 20 years after CBS executives were pressured by Jefferson historians to drop plans for a mini-series on Jefferson and Hemings, the network airs ''Sally Hemings: An American Scandal.''

CBS aired the television film ''[[Sally Hemings: An American Scandal]]'' (1999), also portraying this relationship; it was not challenged by any major historian.<ref name=\"CBS\"/>\n\nIn 1997 the issue was rejoined when [[Annette Gordon-Reed]] published a challenging analysis of the historiography on this issue, deconstructing previous versions and detailing oversights and bias.<ref name=\"ep12\">[http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/jefferson/episodes/list/12_1 Gallagher, \"Episode 12: Overview\"], ''Jefferson-Hemings Controversy''</ref> That year [[Ken Burns]] released his documentary on Jefferson as a PBS series. In discussions of the potential liaison, white historians gave reasons why it was unlikely Jefferson had one. African-American historian [[John Hope Franklin]] (and others) noted all the [[mulatto]]s and mixed-race slaves of the period and said, \"These things [interracial liaisons] were part of the natural landscape in Virginia, and Mr. Jefferson was as likely as any others to have done this because it's in character with the times\u2014and indeed, with him, who believed in exploiting these people that he controlled completely.\"<ref name=\"ep12\"/>\n\nHistorically, in the 1850s Jefferson's eldest grandson, [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]], told historian Henry Randall that the late [[Peter Carr (Virginia politician)|Peter Carr]], a married nephew of Jefferson's (the son of his sister), had fathered Hemings' children; Randolph asked Randall to refrain from addressing the issue in his biography. Randall passed on this information to James Parton, another historian. Parton published the Carr story, and major historians of Jefferson generally asserted the denial of Jefferson's paternity for nearly 150 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Looney|first1=J.

The DNA study showed a match between a descendant of the Jefferson male line, a descendant of Field Jefferson, and a descendant of [[Eston Hemings]], Sally's youngest son. It showed no match between the Carr line and the Hemings descendant.\n\nIn 2000, a consensus, generated by the DNA study titled \"Jefferson Fathered Slave's Last Child,\" emerged among historians. In the majority view, the DNA evidence is consistent with Jefferson being the father of Eston Hemings, plus the historical evidence favors Jefferson's paternity for all of Hemings' children.<ref name=\"PBS\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/true/ ''Jefferson's Blood''], PBS Frontline, 2000, accessed March 10, 2012.

Since then the organization has reflected this change in its exhibits, as well as publications about Jefferson and his times. The revelations have stimulated works by a variety of scholars, who have used the consensus as a basis for studies into Jefferson, the Hemings family, and interracial American society. In June 2018, Thomas Jefferson Foundation, with introduction of the new exhibit on Sally Hemings, asserted the relationship is \"settled historical matter\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/blog-and-community/monticello-affirms-thomas-jefferson-fathered-children-sally-hemings|title=Monticello Affirms Thomas Jefferson Fathered Children with Sally Hemings|website=monticello|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nJefferson became a widower at age 39 in 1782. He never remarried and died in 1826. Sally Hemings was his much younger slave and a likely half-sister of his wife. She accompanied his daughter Maria to France, where they are believed to have started a sexual relationship, and returned with him to Monticello. Most historians now believe that Jefferson had a relationship with Sally Hemings that lasted nearly four decades, until his death, and that Jefferson fathered her six children.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-sally-hemings-brief-account | title=Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account | publisher=Thomas Jefferson Foundation | accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/biography/jefferson-life-in-brief |title = Thomas Jefferson | publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia |author = Peter Onuf, editor | accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFour of Hemings' children survived to adulthood.

Since the mid-20th century, there have been challenges to that denial, as historians have re-examined some of the evidence and thought to interpret it differently. Disagreements have arisen since the late 20th century over how to interpret historical evidence related to the issue. According to an 1868 letter by Jefferson biographer Henry Randall to the historian James Parton, Jefferson's grandson, [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]], said that Jefferson's surviving daughter Martha stated on her deathbed that Jefferson had been away from Monticello for 15 months before one of Hemings' children was born, so could not be the father. But historian [[Dumas Malone]] later documented that Jefferson had been at Monticello nine months before the birth of each of Hemings' children.<ref name=\"auto\">Gordon-Reed, ''An American Controversy'', 1997, pp.&nbsp;80\u201383</ref>\n\nRandolph also said: \n \n{{quote|[S]he [Hemings] had children which resembled Mr. Jefferson so closely that it was plain that they had his blood in their veins&nbsp;...

According to legal professor [[Annette Gordon-Reed]], by this act, he was violating a strong social taboo against naming a white man as the father of slave children, to explain the strong physical resemblance seen by visitors. She suggested he would only have done so for the more compelling reason of protecting his grandfather.<ref name=\"Gordon-Reed, pp. 80\u201383\">Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' pp.&nbsp;80\u201383</ref>\n\nBecause of the social taboos about this topic, Randolph requested, and Randall agreed, to omit any mention of Hemings and her children in Randall's three-volume biography, ''Life of Thomas Jefferson'' (1858).<ref name=\"Randall\">{{cite web|title=Letter from Henry Randall to James Parton, June 1, 1868|work=Jefferson's Blood|publisher=PBS Frontline| year=2000| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/1868randall.html|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}</ref> But Randall passed on the Randolph oral history in a letter to the historian [[James Parton]]. He also suggested that he had personally seen records supporting it \u2013 but no such record has been found.

He was interviewed about his life as a slave at Monticello, and his account was published in an Ohio newspaper. Then age 68, Hemings claimed Jefferson as his and his siblings' father. He said that when Jefferson and Sally Hemings were still in Paris, she became pregnant with his child.

He and other critics essentially discounted Hemings' memoir, while attributing to him a range of negative motives for telling his story. In his work, Parton repeated the Jefferson family's oral history about a Carr paternity and the claim that Jefferson was absent during the conception period of one of Hemings' children.<ref>Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' pp. 24, 81</ref><ref>Allison, Andrew, K.

In the 1970s, as part of his six-volume biography of Jefferson, Malone was the first to publish a letter by Ellen Randolph Coolidge, Randolph's sister that added to the Carr paternity story. But she claimed that the late Samuel Carr, brother to Peter and also a nephew of Jefferson's through his sister, had fathered Hemings' children. Like Peter, Samuel was married when Hemings' children were born. Neither of the Randolphs named Jefferson's nephews as putative fathers of Hemings' children until after the men had died.<ref>Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' pp.&nbsp;81\u201383</ref>\n\nThe above 20th-century historians and other major biographers of the late 20th century, such as [[Joseph Ellis]] and [[Andrew Burstein]], \"defended\" Jefferson based on the Jefferson/Randolph family testimony: saying that he was absent at the conception of one Hemings child, and the family identified Peter or Samuel Carr as father(s) of Hemings' children.<ref>Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy'', pp.&nbsp;83\u201384</ref> Also, the historians concluded from their interpretations of Jefferson's personality and views that he would not have had such a relationship. They noted he had expressed antipathy to blacks and [[miscegenation]] in his writings, and he was thought to have a \"high\" moral character.<ref name=\"Gordon-Reed, pp. 14-22\">Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' pp.&nbsp;14\u201322</ref>\n\nThe manuscripts for ''Thomas Jefferson's Farm Books'' were rediscovered and published for the first time in 1953, edited by Edwin M. Betts. They provided extensive data about slaves and slave births, including all of Sally Hemings' children, and have been used extensively by researchers.\n\nBlack oral history preserved the account of the Jefferson-Hemings relationship and the place of African Americans at the center of United States history. Black historians began to publish material related to the mixed-race Hemings descendants.

Graham published an article in the ''[[Journal of Negro History]]'' on Jefferson and Hemings. It was based on material from the ''Farm Books,'' as well as a detailed timeline of Jefferson's activities developed by historian [[Dumas Malone]] in his extensive biography. This was published in several volumes beginning in the 1940s.

When mixed-race children were sired by the master, they were frequently named after people from his family.<ref name=\"Annette Gordon-Reed 1997 pp. 210-223\">Annette Gordon-Reed (1997), ''American Controversy'', pp.&nbsp;210\u201323</ref> Jefferson gave the Hemings family special treatment: the three boys while young had very light household duties.

This would provide them with skills to make a good living as free adults.<ref name=\"Annette Gordon-Reed 1997 pp. 210-223\"/>\n\nAccording to Annette Gordon-Reed, Thomas Jefferson's treatment of Sally Hemings children is a good indication that he could have fathered the children.

Another example is that unlike other slaves, Madison Hemings stated that until they were put to work, they would run errands with Sally. This was very uncommon.\n\nMost importantly, Gordon-Reed notes that Jefferson freed all the Hemings children.

To enable them to stay in Virginia, Jefferson's will petitioned the legislature for permission for them to stay in the state with their families. (Such legislative approval was required by laws related to manumission and free blacks.) Jefferson also freed three older males from the extended [[Elizabeth Hemings]] family; they had each served him for decades.

For more than 150 years, most historians denied rumors from Jefferson's presidency that he had a slave [[concubine]]. Based on his grandson's report, they said that one of his nephews had been the father of Hemings' children. Before changing his mind following the results of DNA analysis in 1998, Jefferson biographer [[Joseph J. Ellis]] had said, \"The alleged liaison between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings may be described as the longest-running miniseries in American history.\"<ref>[http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/jefferson/ Edward J.

Brodie]] suggested Jefferson had been the father of Hemings' children. Her writings were widely discussed, and Jefferson historians began to lose control of the narrative. While mainstream historians criticized Brodie for her psychological analysis, her publications included detailed footnotes and interviews with descendants of Jefferson's mixed-race children.\n\nIn 1979 [[Barbara Chase-Riboud]] published a well-received and bestselling novel on Hemings that gave her a \"compelling\" voice, portraying her as both an independent woman and Jefferson's concubine.<ref>Gallagher, \"Episodes\", ''The Jefferson-Hemings Controversy''</ref> Jefferson historians succeeded in suppressing a planned CBS [[television film]] based on this novel.<ref name=\"CBS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/ |title=The History of a Secret |work=Jefferson's Blood | publisher=PBS Frontline|date= May 2000 |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}Quote: \"More than 20 years after CBS executives were pressured by Jefferson historians to drop plans for a mini-series on Jefferson and Hemings, the network airs ''Sally Hemings: An American Scandal.''

CBS aired the television film ''[[Sally Hemings: An American Scandal]]'' (1999), also portraying this relationship; it was not challenged by any major historian.<ref name=\"CBS\"/>\n\nIn 1997 the issue was rejoined when [[Annette Gordon-Reed]] published a challenging analysis of the historiography on this issue, deconstructing previous versions and detailing oversights and bias.<ref name=\"ep12\">[http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/jefferson/episodes/list/12_1 Gallagher, \"Episode 12: Overview\"], ''Jefferson-Hemings Controversy''</ref> That year [[Ken Burns]] released his documentary on Jefferson as a PBS series. In discussions of the potential liaison, white historians gave reasons why it was unlikely Jefferson had one. African-American historian [[John Hope Franklin]] (and others) noted all the [[mulatto]]s and mixed-race slaves of the period and said, \"These things [interracial liaisons] were part of the natural landscape in Virginia, and Mr. Jefferson was as likely as any others to have done this because it's in character with the times\u2014and indeed, with him, who believed in exploiting these people that he controlled completely.\"<ref name=\"ep12\"/>\n\nHistorically, in the 1850s Jefferson's eldest grandson, [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]], told historian Henry Randall that the late [[Peter Carr (Virginia politician)|Peter Carr]], a married nephew of Jefferson's (the son of his sister), had fathered Hemings' children; Randolph asked Randall to refrain from addressing the issue in his biography. Randall passed on this information to James Parton, another historian. Parton published the Carr story, and major historians of Jefferson generally asserted the denial of Jefferson's paternity for nearly 150 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Looney|first1=J.

The DNA study showed a match between a descendant of the Jefferson male line, a descendant of Field Jefferson, and a descendant of [[Eston Hemings]], Sally's youngest son. It showed no match between the Carr line and the Hemings descendant.\n\nIn 2000, a consensus, generated by the DNA study titled \"Jefferson Fathered Slave's Last Child,\" emerged among historians.

Since then the organization has reflected this change in its exhibits, as well as publications about Jefferson and his times.

He never remarried and died in 1826. Sally Hemings was his much younger slave and a likely half-sister of his wife.

Since the mid-20th century, there have been challenges to that denial, as historians have re-examined some of the evidence and thought to interpret it differently. Disagreements have arisen since the late 20th century over how to interpret historical evidence related to the issue. According to an 1868 letter by Jefferson biographer Henry Randall to the historian James Parton, Jefferson's grandson, [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]], said that Jefferson's surviving daughter Martha stated on her deathbed that Jefferson had been away from Monticello for 15 months before one of Hemings' children was born, so could not be the father. But historian [[Dumas Malone]] later documented that Jefferson had been at Monticello nine months before the birth of each of Hemings' children.<ref name=\"auto\">Gordon-Reed, ''An American Controversy'', 1997, pp.&nbsp;80\u201383</ref>\n\nRandolph also said: \n \n{{quote|[S]he [Hemings] had children which resembled Mr. Jefferson so closely that it was plain that they had his blood in their veins&nbsp;...

According to legal professor [[Annette Gordon-Reed]], by this act, he was violating a strong social taboo against naming a white man as the father of slave children, to explain the strong physical resemblance seen by visitors.

In the 1970s, as part of his six-volume biography of Jefferson, Malone was the first to publish a letter by Ellen Randolph Coolidge, Randolph's sister that added to the Carr paternity story. But she claimed that the late Samuel Carr, brother to Peter and also a nephew of Jefferson's through his sister, had fathered Hemings' children. Like Peter, Samuel was married when Hemings' children were born.

They provided extensive data about slaves and slave births, including all of Sally Hemings' children, and have been used extensively by researchers.\n\nBlack oral history preserved the account of the Jefferson-Hemings relationship and the place of African Americans at the center of United States history. Black historians began to publish material related to the mixed-race Hemings descendants.

Graham published an article in the ''[[Journal of Negro History]]'' on Jefferson and Hemings. It was based on material from the ''Farm Books,'' as well as a detailed timeline of Jefferson's activities developed by historian [[Dumas Malone]] in his extensive biography. This was published in several volumes beginning in the 1940s. Graham noted that Hemings conceived her children only when Jefferson was in residence at Monticello, during a time when he traveled frequently and was away for lengthy periods. Graham also provided biographical information on Sally's children; she supported accounts that Hemings and Jefferson had several children together.<ref>Graham, Pearl M. \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings,\" ''[[Journal of Negro History]]'' 46, Vol. XLIX, No. 2 (April 1961): 89\u2013103.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, [[Fawn M.

His documentation in his multi-volume biography (published 1948\u20131981) provided the details that Pearl Graham analyzed to show Jefferson was at Monticello for the conception of each of Hemings' children. She never conceived when he was not there. Martha Randolph, Jefferson's daughter with Martha Wayles Jefferson, had made a deathbed claim that Jefferson was away for a 15-month period during which one of the Hemings children was conceived.

This would provide them with skills to make a good living as free adults.<ref name=\"Annette Gordon-Reed 1997 pp. 210-223\"/>\n\nAccording to Annette Gordon-Reed, Thomas Jefferson's treatment of Sally Hemings children is a good indication that he could have fathered the children.

Another example is that unlike other slaves, Madison Hemings stated that until they were put to work, they would run errands with Sally. This was very uncommon.\n\nMost importantly, Gordon-Reed notes that Jefferson freed all the Hemings children. Theirs was the only slave family to all go free from Monticello; they were the only slaves freed in their youth and as they came of age, and Harriet Hemings was the only female slave he ever freed.<ref name=\"monticello.org\">[http://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-sally-hemings-brief-account \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\"], Monticello, accessed March 4, 2011</ref> He allowed Beverley (male) and Harriet to \"escape\" in 1822 at ages 23 and 21, although Jefferson was already struggling financially and would be $100,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100,000|1826}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in debt at his death.<ref name=\"Annette Gordon-Reed 1997 pp. 210-223\"/> He gave his overseer money to give to Harriet for her journey.

To enable them to stay in Virginia, Jefferson's will petitioned the legislature for permission for them to stay in the state with their families. (Such legislative approval was required by laws related to manumission and free blacks.) Jefferson also freed three older males from the extended [[Elizabeth Hemings]] family; they had each served him for decades.

She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her feelings were irrelevant. But it does mean that he had extraordinary power, and she very little, and so, as his [[concubine]], she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; for she was, in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and I have described the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.<ref name=autogenerated2 /></blockquote>\n\nIn 2005 [[Christopher Hitchens]] published a new biography of Jefferson, whom he had always admired and praised.

He said,\n\n<blockquote>Then there's the odd, of course, fact that he had a very long love affair with a woman who he owned, who he inherited from his father-in-law, who was his wife's half-sister, and produced several children by her, whose descendants have mainly been brought up on the white side of the color line.

{"title_page": "Source criticism", "text_new": "{{short description|Process of evaluating an information source}}\n'''Source criticism''' (or '''information evaluation''') is the process of evaluating an [[source text|information source]], i.e. a document, a person, a speech, a fingerprint, a photo, an observation, or anything used in order to obtain knowledge. In relation to a given purpose, a given information source may be more or less valid,  reliable or relevant. Broadly, \"source criticism\" is the interdisciplinary study of how information sources are evaluated for given tasks.\n\n== Meaning ==\nProblems in translation: The Danish word ''kildekritik'', like the Norwegian word ''kildekritikk'' and the Swedish word ''k\u00e4llkritik'', derived from the German ''Quellenkritik'' and is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&ndash;1886). Historian [[:de:Wolfgang Hardtwig|Wolfgang Hardtwig]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nHis [Ranke's] first work ''Geschichte der romanischen und germanischen V\u00f6lker von 1494&ndash;1514'' (History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514) (1824) was a great success. It already showed some of the basic characteristics of his conception of Europe, and was of historiographical importance particularly because Ranke made an exemplary critical analysis of his sources in a separate volume, ''Zur Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber'' (On the Critical Methods of Recent Historians). In this work he raised the method of [[textual criticism]] used in the late eighteenth century, particularly in classical philology to the standard method of scientific historical writing. (Hardtwig, 2001, p.&nbsp;12739)\n</blockquote>\n\nHistorical theorist Chris Lorenz wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe larger part of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries would be dominated by the research-oriented conception of historical method of the so-called Historical School in Germany, led by historians as Leopold Ranke and Berthold Niebuhr. Their conception of history, long been regarded as the beginning of modern, 'scientific' history, harked back to the 'narrow' conception of historical method, limiting the methodical character of history to source criticism. (Lorenz, 2001)\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the early 21st century, source criticism is a growing field in, among other fields, [[library and information science]]. In this context source criticism is studied from a broader perspective than just, for example, history or biblical studies.<ref>Hj\u00f8rland, Birger (2012). Methods for evaluating information sources: An annotated catalogue. ''Journal of Information Science'' 38(3), 258\u2013268. {{DOI|10.1177/0165551512439178}}</ref><ref>Balin, A. & Grafstein, A. (2010). The critical assessment of research: Traditional and new methods of evaluation. Oxford: Chandos Publishing.</ref>\n\n==Principles==\nThe following principles are cited from two Scandinavian textbooks on source criticism, written by the historians Olden-J\u00f8rgensen (1998) and Thur\u00e9n (1997):\n* Human sources may be relics (e.g. a fingerprint) or narratives (e.g. a statement or a letter). Relics are more credible sources than narratives.\n*  A given source may be forged or corrupted; strong indications of the originality of the source increases its reliability.\n*  The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate description of what really happened\n* A [[primary source]] is more reliable than a [[secondary source]], which in turn is more reliable than a [[tertiary source]] and so on.\n*  If a number of ''independent'' sources contain the same message, the credibility of the message is strongly increased.\n* The tendency of a source is its motivation for providing some kind of bias. Tendencies should be minimized or supplemented with opposite motivations.\n*  If it can be demonstrated that the witness (or source) has no direct interest in creating bias, the credibility of the message is increased.\n\nTwo other principles are:\n* Knowledge of source criticism cannot substitute for subject knowledge:\n<blockquote>\n\"Because each source teaches you more and more about your subject, you will be able to judge with ever-increasing precision the usefulness and value of any prospective source. In other words, the more you know about the subject, the more precisely you can identify what you must still find out\". (Bazerman, 1995, p. 304).\n</blockquote>\n* The reliability of a given source is relative to the questions put to it.\n<blockquote>\"The empirical case study showed that most people find it difficult to assess questions of cognitive authority and media credibility in a general sense, for example, by comparing the overall credibility of newspapers and the Internet. Thus these assessments tend to be situationally sensitive. Newspapers, television and the Internet were frequently used as sources of orienting information, but their credibility varied depending on the actual topic at hand\" (Savolainen, 2007).\n</blockquote>\n\nThe following questions are often good ones to ask about any source according to the American Library Association (1994) and Engeldinger (1988):\n\n#How was the source located?\n#What type of source is it?\n#Who is the author and what are the qualifications of the author in regard to the topic that is discussed?\n#When was the information published?\n#In which country was it published?\n#What is the reputation of the publisher?\n#Does the source show a particular cultural or political bias?\n\nFor literary sources complementing criteria are:\n\n#Does the source contain a bibliography?\n#Has the material been reviewed by a group of peers, or has it been edited?\n#How does the article/book compare with similar articles/books?\n\n==Levels of generality==\nSome principles of source criticism are universal, other principles are specific for certain kinds of information sources.\n\nThere is today no consensus about the similarities and differences between source criticism in the natural science and humanities. [[Logical positivism]] claimed that all fields of knowledge were based on the same principles. Much of the criticism of logical positivism claimed that positivism is the basis of the sciences, whereas [[hermeneutics]] is the basis of the humanities. This was, for example, the position of [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]. A newer position, in accordance with, among others, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]], understands both science and humanities as determined by researchers' preunderstanding and paradigms. Hermeneutics is thus a universal theory. The difference is, however, that the sources of the humanities are themselves products of human interests and preunderstanding, whereas the sources of the natural sciences are not. Humanities are thus \"doubly hermeneutic\".\n\nNatural scientists, however, are also using human products (such as scientific papers) which are products of preunderstanding (and can lead to, for example, [[academic fraud]]).\n\n==Contributing fields==\n\n===Epistemology===\nEpistemological theories are the basic theories about how knowledge is obtained and are thus the most general theories about how to evaluate information sources.\n* [[Empiricism]] evaluates sources by considering the observations (or sensations) on which they are based. Sources without basis in experience are not seen as valid.\n* [[Rationalism]] provides low priority to sources based on observations. In order to be meaningful, observations must be explained by clear ideas or concepts. It is the logical structure and the well definedness that is in focus in evaluating information sources from the rationalist point of view.\n* [[Historicism]] evaluates information sources on the basis of their reflection of their sociocultural context and their theoretical development.\n* [[Pragmatism]] evaluate sources on the basis of how their values and usefulness to accomplish certain outcomes. Pragmatism is skeptical about claimed neutral information sources.\n\nThe evaluation of knowledge or information sources cannot be more certain than is the construction of knowledge. If one accepts the principle of [[fallibilism]] then one also has to accept that source criticism can never 100% verify knowledge claims. As discussed in the next section, source criticism is intimately linked to [[scientific method]]s.\n\nThe presence of [[Fallacy|fallacies]] of argument in sources is another kind of philosophical criterion for evaluating sources. Fallacies are presented by Walton (1998). Among the fallacies are the ''[[ad hominem]]'' fallacy (the use of personal attack to try to undermine or refute a person's argument) and the [[straw man]] fallacy (when one arguer misrepresents another's position to make it appear less plausible than it really is, in order more easily to criticize or refute it.)\n\n===Research methodology===\n{{See also|Unobtrusive measures|Triangulation (social science)}}\nResearch methods are methods used to produce scholarly knowledge. The methods that are relevant for producing knowledge are also relevant for evaluating knowledge. An example of a book that turns methodology upside-down and uses it to evaluate produced knowledge is Katzer; Cook & Crouch (1998).\n\n===Science studies===\nStudies of quality evaluation processes such as [[peer review]], [[book review]]s and of the normative criteria used in evaluation of scientific and scholarly research. Another field is the study of [[scientific misconduct]].\n\nHarris (1979) provides a case study of how a famous experiment in psychology, [[Little Albert]], has been distorted throughout the history of psychology, starting with the author (Watson) himself, general textbook authors, behavior therapists, and a prominent learning theorist. Harris proposes possible causes for these distortions and analyzes the Albert study as an example of myth making in the history of psychology. Studies of this kind may be regarded a special kind of [[reception history]] (how Watson's paper was received).  It may also be regarded as a kind of critical history (opposed to ceremonial history of psychology, cf. Harris, 1980). Such studies are important for source criticism in revealing the bias introduced by referring to classical studies.\n\n===Textual criticism===\nTextual criticism (or broader: text philology) is a part of [[philology]], which is not just devoted to the study  of texts, but also to edit and produce \"scientific editions\", \"scholarly editions\", \"standard editions\", \"historical editions\", \"reliable editions\", \"reliable texts\", \"text editions\"  or \"critical editions\", which are editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the information contained within is as close to the author's/composer's original intentions as possible (and which allows the user to compare and judge changes in editions published under influence by the author/composer). The relation between these kinds of works and the concept \"source criticism\" is evident in Danish, where they may be termed \"kildekritisk udgave\" (directly translated \"source critical edition\").\n\nIn other words, it is assumed that most editions of a given works is filled with noise and errors provided by publishers, why it is important to produce \"scholarly editions\". The work provided by text philology is an important part of source criticism in the humanities.\n\n===Psychology===\n{{See also|Cognitive bias}}\nThe study of [[eyewitness testimony]] is an important field of study used, among other purposes, to evaluate testimony in courts. The basics of eyewitness fallibility includes factors such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress. More  subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes can intervene to create erroneous reports. Loftus (1996) discuss all such factors and also shows that [[eyewitness memory]] is chronically inaccurate in surprising ways. An ingenious series of experiments reveals that memory can be radically altered by the way an eyewitness is questioned after the fact. New memories can be implanted and old ones unconsciously altered under interrogation.\n\nAnderson (1978) and Anderson & Pichert (1977) reported an elegant experiment demonstrating how change in perspective affected people's ability to recall information that was unrecallable from another perspective.\n\nIn [[psychoanalysis]] the concept of [[defence mechanism]] is important and may be considered a contribution to the theory of source criticism because it explains psychological mechanisms, which distort the reliability of human information sources.\n\n===Library and information science (LIS)===\n{{See also|CRAAP test}}\n{{Expand section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2020|small=y}}\nIn schools of [[library and information science]] (LIS), source criticism is taught as part of the growing field of [[information literacy]].\n\nIssues such as [[relevance]], quality indicators for documents, kinds of documents and their qualities (e.g. scholarly editions) are studied in LIS and are relevant for source criticism. [[Bibliometrics]] is often used to find the most influential journal, authors, countries and institutions. Librarians study [[book review]]s and their function in evaluating books.\n\nIn library and information science the checklist approach has often been used.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |title=Checklists for Internet sources |access-date=2012-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210212549/http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |archive-date=2013-02-10}}</ref> A criticism of this approach is given by Meola (2004): \"Chucking the checklist\".\n\nLibraries sometimes provide advice on how their users may evaluate sources.<ref>[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html General Source Criticism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304184332/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html |date=2007-03-04 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html Topicality and Reliability of Printed Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215004102/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html |date=2008-12-15 }}</ref>\n\nThe Library of Congress has a \"Teaching with Primary Sources\" (TPS) program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/tps/about/|title=About the Program: Teaching with Primary Sources \u2013 Teacher Resources \u2013 Library of Congress|author=|date=|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Ethics===\n{{expand section|date=September 2019}}\nSource criticism is also about ethical behavior and culture. It is about a free press and an open society, including the  protecting information sources from being persecuted (cf., [[Whistleblower]]).\n\n==In specific domains==\n\n===Photos===\n{{See also|Photo manipulation}}\nPhotos are often manipulated during wars and for political purposes. One well known example is Joseph Stalin's manipulation of a photograph from May 5, 1920 on which Stalin's predecessor Lenin held a speech for Soviet troops that Leon Trotsky attended. Stalin had later Trotsky retouched out of this photograph. (cf. King, 1997). A recent example is reported by Healy (2008) about North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Il]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/was-the-dear-leader-photoshopped-in/?scp=7&sq=Kim%20Jong-il&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Was the Dear Leader Photoshopped In? | first=Jack | last=Healy | date=2008-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Internet sources===\n{{See also|E-mail fraud|Internet fraud|Reliability of Wikipedia}}\nMuch interest in evaluating Internet sources (such as [[Wikipedia]]) is reflected in the scholarly literature of [[library and information science]] and in other fields. Mintz (2002) is an edited volume about this issue. Examples of literature examining Internet sources include Chesney (2006), Fritch & Cromwell (2001), Leth & Thur\u00e9n (2000) and Wilkinson, Bennett, & Oliver (1997).\n\n=== Archaeology and history ===\n\"In history, the term historical method was first introduced in a systematic way in the sixteenth century by Jean Bodin in his treatise of source criticism, ''Methodus ad facilem historiarium cognitionem'' (1566). Characteristically, Bodin's treatise intended to establish the ways by which reliable knowledge of the past could be established by checking sources against one another and by so assessing the reliability of the information conveyed by them, relating them to the interests involved.\" (Lorenz, 2001, p.&nbsp;6870).\n\nAs written above, modern source criticism in history is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&ndash;1886), who influenced historical methods on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, although in rather different ways. American history developed in a more empirist and antiphilosophical way (cf., Novick, 1988).\n\nTwo of the best-known rule books from the 19th century are Bernheim (1889) and Langlois & Seignobos (1898). These books provided a seven-step procedure (here quoted from Howell & Prevenier, 2001, p.&nbsp;70\u201371):\n# If the sources all agree about an event, historians can consider the event proved.\n# However, majority does not rule; even if most sources relate events in one way, that version will not prevail unless it passes the test of critical textual analysis.\n# The source whose account can be confirmed by reference to outside authorities in some of its parts can be trusted in its entirety if it is impossible similarly to confirm the entire text.\n# When two sources disagree on a particular point, the historian will prefer the source with most \"authority\"\u2014i.e. the source created by the expert or by the eyewitness.\n# Eyewittnesses are, in general, to be preferred, especially in circumstances where the ordinary observer could have accurately reported what transpired and, more specifically, when they deal with facts known by most contemporaries.\n# If two independently created sources agree on a matter, the reliability of each is measureably enhanced.\n# When two sources disagree (and there is no other means of evaluation), then historians take the source which seems to accord best with common sense.\n\nGudmundsson (2007, p.&nbsp;38) wrote:  \"Source criticism should not totally dominate later courses. Other important perspectives, for example, philosophy of history/view of history, should not suffer by being neglected\" (Translated by BH). This quote makes a distinction between source criticism on the one hand and historical philosophy on the other hand. However, different views of history and different specific theories about the field being studied may have important consequences for how sources are selected, interpreted and used. Feminist scholars may, for example, select sources made by women and may interpret sources from a feminist perspective. Epistemology should thus be considered a part of source criticism. It is in particular related to \"tendency analysis\".\n\nIn [[archaeology]], [[radiocarbon dating]] is an important technique to establish the age of information sources. Methods of this kind were the ideal when history established itself as both a scientific discipline and as a profession based on \"scientific\" principles in the last part of the 1880s (although radiocarbon dating is a more recent example of such methods). The empiricist movement in history brought along both \"source criticism\" as a research method and also in many countries large scale publishing efforts to make valid editions of \"source materials\" such as important letters and official documents (e.g. as [[facsimile]]s or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s).\n\n[[Historiography]] and [[historical method]] include the study of the reliability of the sources used, in terms of, for example, authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.\n\n===Biblical studies===\n{{Main|Source criticism (biblical studies)}}\nSource criticism, as the term is used in [[biblical criticism]], refers to the attempt to establish the sources used by the author and/or redactor of the final text. The term \"[[literary criticism]]\" is occasionally used as a synonym.\n\nBiblical source criticism originated in the 18th century with the work of [[Jean Astruc]], who adapted the methods already developed for investigating the texts of classical antiquity ([[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] in particular) to his own investigation into the sources of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It was subsequently considerably developed by German scholars in what was known as \"the [[higher criticism]]\", a term no longer in widespread use. The ultimate aim of these scholars was to reconstruct the history of the biblical text, as well as the religious history of ancient Israel.\n\nRelated to source criticism is [[redaction criticism]] which seeks to determine how and why the redactor (editor) put the sources together the way he did. Also related is [[form criticism]] and [[tradition history]] which try to reconstruct the oral prehistory behind the identified written sources.\n\n===Journalism===\n{{See also|Journalism fraud}}\nJournalists often work with strong time pressure and have access to only a limited number of [[source text|information sources]] such as [[news bureau]]s, persons which may be interviewed, [[newspaper]]s, [[Academic journal|journals]] and so on (see [[journalism sourcing]]). Journalists' possibility for conducting serious source criticism is thus limited compared to, for example, historians' possibilities.\n\n===Legal studies===\n{{See also|Evidence (law)}}\nThe most important legal sources are created by parliaments, governments, courts, and legal researchers. They may be written or informal and based on established practices. Views concerning the quality of sources differ among legal philosophies: [[Legal positivism]] is the view that the text of the law should be considered in isolation, while [[legal realism]], [[interpretivism (legal)]], [[critical legal studies]] and feminist legal criticism interprets the law on a broader cultural basis.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Argumentation theory]]\n* [[Bias]]\n* [[Deception]]\n* [[Fabrication (science)]]\n* [[Exegesis]]\n* [[False document]]\n* [[Fraud]]\n* [[Plagiarism]]\n* [[Psychological warfare]]\n* [[Q source]]\n* [[Scholarly method]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* American Library Association (1994) ''Evaluating Information: A Basic Checklist''.

'''Abstract''':  When classifying the array of interpretive methods currently available, biblical critics regularly distinguish between historical-critical methods, on the one hand, and literary critical methods, on the other. Frequently, methods on one side of the divide are said to be antagonistic to certain methods on the other. This article examines two such presumed antagonistic methods, source criticism and deconstructive criticism, and argues that they are not, in fact, antagonistic, but similar: both are postmodern movements, and both share an interpretive methodology (insofar as it is correct to speak of a deconstructive methodology). This argument is illustrated with a source-critical and a deconstructive reading of Exodus 14.\n* Mattus, Maria (2007). Finding Credible Information: A Challenge to Students Writing Academic Essays.

In relation to a given purpose, a given information source may be more or less valid,  reliable or relevant. Broadly, \"source criticism\" is the interdisciplinary study of how information sources are evaluated for given tasks.\n\n== Meaning ==\nProblems in translation: The Danish word ''kildekritik'', like the Norwegian word ''kildekritikk'' and the Swedish word ''k\u00e4llkritik'', derived from the German ''Quellenkritik'' and is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&ndash;1886). Historian [[:de:Wolfgang Hardtwig|Wolfgang Hardtwig]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nHis [Ranke's] first work ''Geschichte der romanischen und germanischen V\u00f6lker von 1494&ndash;1514'' (History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514) (1824) was a great success. It already showed some of the basic characteristics of his conception of Europe, and was of historiographical importance particularly because Ranke made an exemplary critical analysis of his sources in a separate volume, ''Zur Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber'' (On the Critical Methods of Recent Historians). In this work he raised the method of [[textual criticism]] used in the late eighteenth century, particularly in classical philology to the standard method of scientific historical writing. (Hardtwig, 2001, p.&nbsp;12739)\n</blockquote>\n\nHistorical theorist Chris Lorenz wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe larger part of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries would be dominated by the research-oriented conception of historical method of the so-called Historical School in Germany, led by historians as Leopold Ranke and Berthold Niebuhr. Their conception of history, long been regarded as the beginning of modern, 'scientific' history, harked back to the 'narrow' conception of historical method, limiting the methodical character of history to source criticism. (Lorenz, 2001)\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the early 21st century, source criticism is a growing field in, among other fields, [[library and information science]]. In this context source criticism is studied from a broader perspective than just, for example, history or biblical studies.<ref>Hj\u00f8rland, Birger (2012).

(2010). The critical assessment of research: Traditional and new methods of evaluation. Oxford: Chandos Publishing.</ref>\n\n==Principles==\nThe following principles are cited from two Scandinavian textbooks on source criticism, written by the historians Olden-J\u00f8rgensen (1998) and Thur\u00e9n (1997):\n* Human sources may be relics (e.g. a fingerprint) or narratives (e.g. a statement or a letter). Relics are more credible sources than narratives.\n*  A given source may be forged or corrupted; strong indications of the originality of the source increases its reliability.\n*  The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate description of what really happened\n* A [[primary source]] is more reliable than a [[secondary source]], which in turn is more reliable than a [[tertiary source]] and so on.\n*  If a number of ''independent'' sources contain the same message, the credibility of the message is strongly increased.\n* The tendency of a source is its motivation for providing some kind of bias. Tendencies should be minimized or supplemented with opposite motivations.\n*  If it can be demonstrated that the witness (or source) has no direct interest in creating bias, the credibility of the message is increased.\n\nTwo other principles are:\n* Knowledge of source criticism cannot substitute for subject knowledge:\n<blockquote>\n\"Because each source teaches you more and more about your subject, you will be able to judge with ever-increasing precision the usefulness and value of any prospective source. In other words, the more you know about the subject, the more precisely you can identify what you must still find out\". (Bazerman, 1995, p. 304).\n</blockquote>\n* The reliability of a given source is relative to the questions put to it.\n<blockquote>\"The empirical case study showed that most people find it difficult to assess questions of cognitive authority and media credibility in a general sense, for example, by comparing the overall credibility of newspapers and the Internet. Thus these assessments tend to be situationally sensitive. Newspapers, television and the Internet were frequently used as sources of orienting information, but their credibility varied depending on the actual topic at hand\" (Savolainen, 2007).\n</blockquote>\n\nThe following questions are often good ones to ask about any source according to the American Library Association (1994) and Engeldinger (1988):\n\n#How was the source located?\n#What type of source is it?\n#Who is the author and what are the qualifications of the author in regard to the topic that is discussed?\n#When was the information published?\n#In which country was it published?\n#What is the reputation of the publisher?\n#Does the source show a particular cultural or political bias?\n\nFor literary sources complementing criteria are:\n\n#Does the source contain a bibliography?\n#Has the material been reviewed by a group of peers, or has it been edited?\n#How does the article/book compare with similar articles/books?\n\n==Levels of generality==\nSome principles of source criticism are universal, other principles are specific for certain kinds of information sources.\n\nThere is today no consensus about the similarities and differences between source criticism in the natural science and humanities. [[Logical positivism]] claimed that all fields of knowledge were based on the same principles. Much of the criticism of logical positivism claimed that positivism is the basis of the sciences, whereas [[hermeneutics]] is the basis of the humanities. This was, for example, the position of [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]. A newer position, in accordance with, among others, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]], understands both science and humanities as determined by researchers' preunderstanding and paradigms. Hermeneutics is thus a universal theory. The difference is, however, that the sources of the humanities are themselves products of human interests and preunderstanding, whereas the sources of the natural sciences are not. Humanities are thus \"doubly hermeneutic\".\n\nNatural scientists, however, are also using human products (such as scientific papers) which are products of preunderstanding (and can lead to, for example, [[academic fraud]]).\n\n==Contributing fields==\n\n===Epistemology===\nEpistemological theories are the basic theories about how knowledge is obtained and are thus the most general theories about how to evaluate information sources.\n* [[Empiricism]] evaluates sources by considering the observations (or sensations) on which they are based. Sources without basis in experience are not seen as valid.\n* [[Rationalism]] provides low priority to sources based on observations. In order to be meaningful, observations must be explained by clear ideas or concepts. It is the logical structure and the well definedness that is in focus in evaluating information sources from the rationalist point of view.\n* [[Historicism]] evaluates information sources on the basis of their reflection of their sociocultural context and their theoretical development.\n* [[Pragmatism]] evaluate sources on the basis of how their values and usefulness to accomplish certain outcomes. Pragmatism is skeptical about claimed neutral information sources.\n\nThe evaluation of knowledge or information sources cannot be more certain than is the construction of knowledge. If one accepts the principle of [[fallibilism]] then one also has to accept that source criticism can never 100% verify knowledge claims. As discussed in the next section, source criticism is intimately linked to [[scientific method]]s.\n\nThe presence of [[Fallacy|fallacies]] of argument in sources is another kind of philosophical criterion for evaluating sources. Fallacies are presented by Walton (1998). Among the fallacies are the ''[[ad hominem]]'' fallacy (the use of personal attack to try to undermine or refute a person's argument) and the [[straw man]] fallacy (when one arguer misrepresents another's position to make it appear less plausible than it really is, in order more easily to criticize or refute it.)\n\n===Research methodology===\n{{See also|Unobtrusive measures|Triangulation (social science)}}\nResearch methods are methods used to produce scholarly knowledge. The methods that are relevant for producing knowledge are also relevant for evaluating knowledge. An example of a book that turns methodology upside-down and uses it to evaluate produced knowledge is Katzer; Cook & Crouch (1998).\n\n===Science studies===\nStudies of quality evaluation processes such as [[peer review]], [[book review]]s and of the normative criteria used in evaluation of scientific and scholarly research. Another field is the study of [[scientific misconduct]].\n\nHarris (1979) provides a case study of how a famous experiment in psychology, [[Little Albert]], has been distorted throughout the history of psychology, starting with the author (Watson) himself, general textbook authors, behavior therapists, and a prominent learning theorist. Harris proposes possible causes for these distortions and analyzes the Albert study as an example of myth making in the history of psychology. Studies of this kind may be regarded a special kind of [[reception history]] (how Watson's paper was received).  It may also be regarded as a kind of critical history (opposed to ceremonial history of psychology, cf. Harris, 1980). Such studies are important for source criticism in revealing the bias introduced by referring to classical studies.\n\n===Textual criticism===\nTextual criticism (or broader: text philology) is a part of [[philology]], which is not just devoted to the study  of texts, but also to edit and produce \"scientific editions\", \"scholarly editions\", \"standard editions\", \"historical editions\", \"reliable editions\", \"reliable texts\", \"text editions\"  or \"critical editions\", which are editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the information contained within is as close to the author's/composer's original intentions as possible (and which allows the user to compare and judge changes in editions published under influence by the author/composer). The relation between these kinds of works and the concept \"source criticism\" is evident in Danish, where they may be termed \"kildekritisk udgave\" (directly translated \"source critical edition\").\n\nIn other words, it is assumed that most editions of a given works is filled with noise and errors provided by publishers, why it is important to produce \"scholarly editions\". The work provided by text philology is an important part of source criticism in the humanities.\n\n===Psychology===\n{{See also|Cognitive bias}}\nThe study of [[eyewitness testimony]] is an important field of study used, among other purposes, to evaluate testimony in courts. The basics of eyewitness fallibility includes factors such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress. More  subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes can intervene to create erroneous reports. Loftus (1996) discuss all such factors and also shows that [[eyewitness memory]] is chronically inaccurate in surprising ways. An ingenious series of experiments reveals that memory can be radically altered by the way an eyewitness is questioned after the fact. New memories can be implanted and old ones unconsciously altered under interrogation.\n\nAnderson (1978) and Anderson & Pichert (1977) reported an elegant experiment demonstrating how change in perspective affected people's ability to recall information that was unrecallable from another perspective.\n\nIn [[psychoanalysis]] the concept of [[defence mechanism]] is important and may be considered a contribution to the theory of source criticism because it explains psychological mechanisms, which distort the reliability of human information sources.\n\n===Library and information science (LIS)===\n{{See also|CRAAP test}}\n{{Expand section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2020|small=y}}\nIn schools of [[library and information science]] (LIS), source criticism is taught as part of the growing field of [[information literacy]].\n\nIssues such as [[relevance]], quality indicators for documents, kinds of documents and their qualities (e.g. scholarly editions) are studied in LIS and are relevant for source criticism. [[Bibliometrics]] is often used to find the most influential journal, authors, countries and institutions. Librarians study [[book review]]s and their function in evaluating books.\n\nIn library and information science the checklist approach has often been used.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |title=Checklists for Internet sources |access-date=2012-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210212549/http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |archive-date=2013-02-10}}</ref> A criticism of this approach is given by Meola (2004): \"Chucking the checklist\".\n\nLibraries sometimes provide advice on how their users may evaluate sources.<ref>[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html General Source Criticism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304184332/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html |date=2007-03-04 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html Topicality and Reliability of Printed Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215004102/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html |date=2008-12-15 }}</ref>\n\nThe Library of Congress has a \"Teaching with Primary Sources\" (TPS) program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/tps/about/|title=About the Program: Teaching with Primary Sources \u2013 Teacher Resources \u2013 Library of Congress|author=|date=|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Ethics===\n{{expand section|date=September 2019}}\nSource criticism is also about ethical behavior and culture. It is about a free press and an open society, including the  protecting information sources from being persecuted (cf., [[Whistleblower]]).\n\n==In specific domains==\n\n===Photos===\n{{See also|Photo manipulation}}\nPhotos are often manipulated during wars and for political purposes. One well known example is Joseph Stalin's manipulation of a photograph from May 5, 1920 on which Stalin's predecessor Lenin held a speech for Soviet troops that Leon Trotsky attended. Stalin had later Trotsky retouched out of this photograph. (cf. King, 1997). A recent example is reported by Healy (2008) about North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Il]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/was-the-dear-leader-photoshopped-in/?scp=7&sq=Kim%20Jong-il&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Was the Dear Leader Photoshopped In? | first=Jack | last=Healy | date=2008-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Internet sources===\n{{See also|E-mail fraud|Internet fraud|Reliability of Wikipedia}}\nMuch interest in evaluating Internet sources (such as [[Wikipedia]]) is reflected in the scholarly literature of [[library and information science]] and in other fields. Mintz (2002) is an edited volume about this issue. Examples of literature examining Internet sources include Chesney (2006), Fritch & Cromwell (2001), Leth & Thur\u00e9n (2000) and Wilkinson, Bennett, & Oliver (1997).\n\n=== Archaeology and history ===\n\"In history, the term historical method was first introduced in a systematic way in the sixteenth century by Jean Bodin in his treatise of source criticism, ''Methodus ad facilem historiarium cognitionem'' (1566). Characteristically, Bodin's treatise intended to establish the ways by which reliable knowledge of the past could be established by checking sources against one another and by so assessing the reliability of the information conveyed by them, relating them to the interests involved.\" (Lorenz, 2001, p.&nbsp;6870).\n\nAs written above, modern source criticism in history is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&ndash;1886), who influenced historical methods on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, although in rather different ways. American history developed in a more empirist and antiphilosophical way (cf., Novick, 1988).\n\nTwo of the best-known rule books from the 19th century are Bernheim (1889) and Langlois & Seignobos (1898). These books provided a seven-step procedure (here quoted from Howell & Prevenier, 2001, p.&nbsp;70\u201371):\n# If the sources all agree about an event, historians can consider the event proved.\n# However, majority does not rule; even if most sources relate events in one way, that version will not prevail unless it passes the test of critical textual analysis.\n# The source whose account can be confirmed by reference to outside authorities in some of its parts can be trusted in its entirety if it is impossible similarly to confirm the entire text.\n# When two sources disagree on a particular point, the historian will prefer the source with most \"authority\"\u2014i.e. the source created by the expert or by the eyewitness.\n# Eyewittnesses are, in general, to be preferred, especially in circumstances where the ordinary observer could have accurately reported what transpired and, more specifically, when they deal with facts known by most contemporaries.\n# If two independently created sources agree on a matter, the reliability of each is measureably enhanced.\n# When two sources disagree (and there is no other means of evaluation), then historians take the source which seems to accord best with common sense.\n\nGudmundsson (2007, p.&nbsp;38) wrote:  \"Source criticism should not totally dominate later courses. Other important perspectives, for example, philosophy of history/view of history, should not suffer by being neglected\" (Translated by BH). This quote makes a distinction between source criticism on the one hand and historical philosophy on the other hand. However, different views of history and different specific theories about the field being studied may have important consequences for how sources are selected, interpreted and used. Feminist scholars may, for example, select sources made by women and may interpret sources from a feminist perspective. Epistemology should thus be considered a part of source criticism. It is in particular related to \"tendency analysis\".\n\nIn [[archaeology]], [[radiocarbon dating]] is an important technique to establish the age of information sources. Methods of this kind were the ideal when history established itself as both a scientific discipline and as a profession based on \"scientific\" principles in the last part of the 1880s (although radiocarbon dating is a more recent example of such methods). The empiricist movement in history brought along both \"source criticism\" as a research method and also in many countries large scale publishing efforts to make valid editions of \"source materials\" such as important letters and official documents (e.g. as [[facsimile]]s or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s).\n\n[[Historiography]] and [[historical method]] include the study of the reliability of the sources used, in terms of, for example, authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.\n\n===Biblical studies===\n{{Main|Source criticism (biblical studies)}}\nSource criticism, as the term is used in [[biblical criticism]], refers to the attempt to establish the sources used by the author and/or redactor of the final text. The term \"[[literary criticism]]\" is occasionally used as a synonym.\n\nBiblical source criticism originated in the 18th century with the work of [[Jean Astruc]], who adapted the methods already developed for investigating the texts of classical antiquity ([[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] in particular) to his own investigation into the sources of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It was subsequently considerably developed by German scholars in what was known as \"the [[higher criticism]]\", a term no longer in widespread use. The ultimate aim of these scholars was to reconstruct the history of the biblical text, as well as the religious history of ancient Israel.\n\nRelated to source criticism is [[redaction criticism]] which seeks to determine how and why the redactor (editor) put the sources together the way he did. Also related is [[form criticism]] and [[tradition history]] which try to reconstruct the oral prehistory behind the identified written sources.\n\n===Journalism===\n{{See also|Journalism fraud}}\nJournalists often work with strong time pressure and have access to only a limited number of [[information source]]s such as [[news bureau]]s, persons which may be interviewed, [[newspaper]]s, [[Academic journal|journals]] and so on (see [[journalism sourcing]]). Journalists' possibility for conducting serious source criticism is thus limited compared to, for example, historians' possibilities.\n\n===Legal studies===\n{{See also|Evidence (law)}}\nThe most important legal sources are created by parliaments, governments, courts, and legal researchers. They may be written or informal and based on established practices. Views concerning the quality of sources differ among legal philosophies: [[Legal positivism]] is the view that the text of the law should be considered in isolation, while [[legal realism]], [[interpretivism (legal)]], [[critical legal studies]] and feminist legal criticism interprets the law on a broader cultural basis.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Argumentation theory]]\n* [[Bias]]\n* [[Deception]]\n* [[Fabrication (science)]]\n* [[Exegesis]]\n* [[False document]]\n* [[Fraud]]\n* [[Plagiarism]]\n* [[Psychological warfare]]\n* [[Q source]]\n* [[Scholarly method]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* American Library Association (1994) ''Evaluating Information: A Basic Checklist''.

''[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]]''   no98, pp.&nbsp;3&ndash;28. '''Abstract''':  When classifying the array of interpretive methods currently available, biblical critics regularly distinguish between historical-critical methods, on the one hand, and literary critical methods, on the other. Frequently, methods on one side of the divide are said to be antagonistic to certain methods on the other. This article examines two such presumed antagonistic methods, source criticism and deconstructive criticism, and argues that they are not, in fact, antagonistic, but similar: both are postmodern movements, and both share an interpretive methodology (insofar as it is correct to speak of a deconstructive methodology). This argument is illustrated with a source-critical and a deconstructive reading of Exodus 14.\n* Mattus, Maria (2007). Finding Credible Information: A Challenge to Students Writing Academic Essays.

which [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] competed at national level, entering the [[Scottish Football League]] for the 43rd time, the [[Scottish Cup]] for the 54th time, the [[Scottish League Cup]] for the 3rd time and the [[B Division Supplementary Cup|Supplementary Cup]] for the 4th time.\n\n== Overview ==\nBy mid November, Dumbarton were challenging the leaders of the B Division, but a disastrous spell, which saw only one victory from 17 games, meant that hopes faded and Dumbarton eventually finished 15th out of 16 with 22 points - 20 behind champions Raith Rovers.\n\nIn the Scottish Cup, as in previous seasons where league performances were poor, Dumbarton brought some cheer to their fans before losing out in the third round to A Division opponents Hearts.\n\nProgress from their League Cup section was again to prove too much of a challenge, finishing 4th and last, with just a draw being taken from their 6 games.\n\nThe Supplementary Cup was a similar story with a first round exit to Cowdenbeath.\n\nIn the Stirlingshire Cup, Dumbarton won a thrilling first round tie against A Division Falkirk but due to other teams' commitments the competition was never completed.\n\n==Results &

Roosevelt]] across the Atlantic to [[Mers El K\u00e9bir]], Algeria, en route to a meeting of vital importance in 1943 in Tehran with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] of Britain and [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union. When transferred to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] in 1944, ''Iowa'' shelled beachheads at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] in advance of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] amphibious landings and screened [[aircraft carrier]]s operating in the [[Marshall Islands]]. It also served as the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]] [[flagship]], flying [[William Halsey, Jr.|Admiral William F. Halsey]]'s flag at the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in [[Tokyo Bay]]. During the [[Korean War]], ''Iowa'' was involved in raids on the North Korean coast, after which it was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]], better known as the \"mothball fleet.\" It was reactivated in 1984 as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] plan and operated in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets to counter the recently expanded [[Soviet Navy]]. In April 1989, [[USS Iowa turret explosion|an explosion of undetermined origin]] wrecked its No. 2 gun turret, killing 47 sailors.\n\n''Iowa'' was decommissioned for the last time in October 1990 after 19 total years of active service, and was initially stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] (NVR) in 1995, before being reinstated from 1999 to 2006 to comply with federal laws that required retention and maintenance of two ''Iowa''-class battleships. In 2011 ''Iowa'' was donated to the [[Los Angeles]]\u2013based non-profit Pacific Battleship Center and was permanently moved to Berth 87 at the [[Port of Los Angeles]] in 2012, where it was opened to the public as the [[USS Iowa Museum|USS ''Iowa'' Museum]].\n\n==Construction==\n{{Main|Iowa-class battleship|Armament of the Iowa class battleship}}\n\nOrdered in July 1939,<ref name=\"Order\">{{NVR url|id=BB61 |title=''Iowa''}}.

Her next assignment was to support [[Operation Hailstone|air strikes]] against the major Japanese naval and logistics base at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], [[Caroline Islands]]. ''Iowa'', in company with other ships, was detached from the support group on 16 February 1944 to conduct an anti-shipping sweep around Truk, with the objective of destroying enemy naval vessels escaping to the north. On 21 February, she was underway with the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] (TF 58 or TF 38, depending on whether it was part of the [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]] or [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]]) while it conducted the first strikes against [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]], [[Rota (island)|Rota]], and [[Guam]] in the [[Mariana Islands]].

''Iowa'' then joined in the pursuit of the fleeing enemy fleet, shooting down one [[torpedo plane]] and assisting in splashing another.<ref name=\"Iowa-DANFS\"/><ref name=\"Iowa I\"/>\n\nThroughout July, ''Iowa'' remained off the Marianas supporting air strikes on the Palaus and landings on Guam. After a month's rest, ''Iowa'' sailed from Eniwetok as part of the Third Fleet, and helped support the [[Battle of Peleliu|landings on Peleliu]] on 17 September. She then protected the carriers during air strikes against the Central Philippines to neutralize enemy air power for the long-awaited invasion of the Philippines. On 10 October, ''Iowa'' arrived off [[Okinawa]] for a series of air strikes on the [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. She then supported air strikes against [[Luzon]] on 18 October and continued this duty during General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[Battle of Leyte|landing on Leyte]] on 20 October.<ref name=\"Iowa-DANFS\"/>\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to halt the United States campaign to recapture the Philippines, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] struck back with ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 1, a three-pronged attack aimed at the destruction of American amphibious forces in [[Leyte Gulf]]. The plan called for Vice-Admiral [[Jisabur\u014d Ozawa]] to use the surviving Japanese carriers as bait to draw US carriers of TF 38 away from the Philippine beachheads, allowing Imperial Japanese Admirals [[Takeo Kurita]], [[Kiyohide Shima]], and [[Sh\u014dji Nishimura]] to take surface task forces through the [[San Bernardino Strait]] and [[Surigao Strait]], where they would rendezvous and attack the US beachheads.<ref>Fuller, 1956</ref><ref>Morison, 1956</ref> ''Iowa'' accompanied TF 38 during attacks against the Japanese Central Force under the command of Admiral Kurita as it steamed through the [[Sibuyan Sea]] toward San Bernardino Strait. The reported results of these attacks and the apparent retreat of the Japanese Central Force led Admiral [[William F. Halsey|William \"Bull\" Halsey]] to believe that this force had been ruined as an effective fighting group; as a result, ''Iowa'', with TF 38, steamed after the Japanese Northern Force off [[Cape Enga\u00f1o (Luzon)|Cape Enga\u00f1o]], Luzon. On 25 October 1944, when the ships of the Northern Force were almost within range of ''Iowa''{{'}}s guns, word arrived that the Japanese Central Force was attacking a group of American [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] off [[Samar (island)|Samar]]. This threat to the American beachheads forced TF 38 to reverse course and steam to support the vulnerable escort carrier fleet, but fierce resistance by the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] in the [[Battle off Samar]] had already caused the Japanese to retire and ''Iowa'' was denied a surface action. Following the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], ''Iowa'' remained in the waters off the Philippines screening carriers during strikes against Luzon and Formosa. She sailed for the West Coast late in December 1944.<ref name=\"Iowa-DANFS\"/>\n\n[[Image:ABSD-2-USNavy_USSIowaBB-61.jpg|thumb|[[USS AFDB-2|USS ABSD-2]] repairing the USS ''Iowa'' in early 1945 at Manus, Admiralty Islands]]\n[[Image:USS Iowa 1945 LOC 182971pu.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A shipyard with a large dry dock occupied by a massive gunship.

Rejecting this advice, Lehman instead instructed the leaders of the Atlantic Fleet to ensure that ''Iowa''{{'}}s deficiencies were corrected.<ref>Thompson, pp. 26\u201327. The problems discovered during Bulkeley's inspection included [[hydraulic fluid]] leaks in all three main gun turrets, totaling 55&nbsp;gallons per turret per week; Cosmoline (anticorrosion lubricant) which had not been removed from all the guns; deteriorated bilge piping; frequent shorts in the electrical wiring; pump failures; unrepaired soft patches on high-pressure steam lines; and frozen valves in the ship's firefighting system. Main Turret Three leaked so much oil, hydraulic fluid, and water that the crew referred to it as the \"rain forest\".</ref>\n\nAfterward, ''Iowa'' returned to the waters around Central America and conducted drills and exercises while providing a military presence to friendly nations. On 4 July, President [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]] boarded ''Iowa'' for the International [[Naval Review]], which was held in the [[Hudson River]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Foster-Simeon |first=E. |date=September 1986 |title=Liberty Weekend |journal=All Hands |issue=834 |page=21 |publisher=Naval Media Center |location=Washington D.C. |url=http://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/ah198609.pdf |accessdate=12 January 2009 |issn=0002-5577 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060416132341/https://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/AH198609.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2006 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 25 April, CAPT [[Larry Seaquist|Larry Ray Seaquist]] assumed command of the battleship and her crew during Naval Gunfire Support requalification off Vieques Island near Puerto Rico.<ref name=\"Iowa I\"/><ref>Thompson, p. 28, gives 25 April as the date of the change of command.</ref>\n\nOn 17 August, ''Iowa'' set sail for the North Atlantic, and in September she participated in Exercise Northern Wedding by ferrying [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] ashore and assisting helicopter gunships.

On 26 May, [[Fred Moosally]] replaced Larry Seaquist as Captain of ''Iowa''.<ref>Thompson, pp. 33\u201335.</ref> After the overhaul, Moosally took ''Iowa'' on a shakedown cruise around [[Chesapeake Bay]] on 25 August.

After one hour, ''Iowa'' was able to extricate herself without damage and return to port.<ref>Thompson, pp. 58\u201360. According to Thompson, the near-misses with the other navy ships were recorded in ''Iowa''{{'}}s log as attempts to \"render honors\" to them. Although other US Navy vessels observed ''Iowa'' grounded in the mud, the incident apparently was not acted upon by Moosally's superiors. Mike Fahey, the ship's executive officer, warned the other officers on ''Iowa'' to never mention the grounding to anyone, including superior Navy officers.</ref> ''Iowa'' continued with sea trials throughout August and September, then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October, during which the ship passed an Operation Propulsion Program Evaluation.<ref name=\"Iowa I\"/><ref>Thompson, pp. 65\u201367.</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 1989, during an improperly authorized gunnery experiment off [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques Island]], ''Iowa'' fired a {{convert|16|in|0|adj=on}} shell {{convert|23.4|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}, setting a record for the longest-ranged {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} shell ever fired.

Owing to the cancellation of the {{sclass-|Montana|battleship|2}}s, ''Iowa'' is the last lead ship of any class of United States battleships and was the only ship of her class to have served in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, it carried President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] across the Atlantic to [[Mers El K\u00e9bir]], Algeria, en route to a meeting of vital importance in 1943 in Tehran with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] of Britain and [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union. When transferred to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] in 1944, ''Iowa'' shelled beachheads at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] in advance of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] amphibious landings and screened [[aircraft carrier]]s operating in the [[Marshall Islands]]. It also served as the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]] [[flagship]], flying [[William Halsey, Jr.|Admiral William F. Halsey]]'s flag at the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in [[Tokyo Bay]]. During the [[Korean War]], ''Iowa'' was involved in raids on the North Korean coast, after which it was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]], better known as the \"mothball fleet.\" It was reactivated in 1984 as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] plan and operated in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets to counter the recently expanded [[Soviet Navy]]. In April 1989, [[USS Iowa turret explosion|an explosion of undetermined origin]] wrecked its No. 2 gun turret, killing 47 sailors.\n\n''Iowa'' was decommissioned for the last time in October 1990 after 19 total years of active service, and was initially stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] (NVR) in 1995, before being reinstated from 1999 to 2006 to comply with federal laws that required retention and maintenance of two ''Iowa''-class battleships. In 2011 ''Iowa'' was donated to the [[Los Angeles]]\u2013based non-profit Pacific Battleship Center and was permanently moved to Berth 87 at the [[Port of Los Angeles]] in 2012, where it was opened to the public as the [[USS Iowa Museum|USS ''Iowa'' Museum]].\n\n==Construction==\n{{Main|Iowa-class battleship|Armament of the Iowa class battleship}}\n\nOrdered in July 1939,<ref name=\"Order\">{{NVR url|id=BB61 |title=''Iowa''}}.

Her next assignment was to support [[Operation Hailstone|air strikes]] against the major Japanese naval and logistics base at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], [[Caroline Islands]]. ''Iowa'', in company with other ships, was detached from the support group on 16 February 1944 to conduct an anti-shipping sweep around Truk, with the objective of destroying enemy naval vessels escaping to the north. On 21 February, she was underway with the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] (TF 58 or TF 38, depending on whether it was part of the [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]] or [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]]) while it conducted the first strikes against [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]], [[Rota (island)|Rota]], and [[Guam]] in the [[Mariana Islands]]. During this action, ''Iowa'', along with her sister ''New Jersey'', sank the Japanese [[light cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Katori||2}}, the cruiser having escaped Truk the day before following [[Operation Hailstone]], the US air attack on Truk.<ref name=\"Iowa I\"/>\n\nOn 18 March 1944, ''Iowa'', flying the flag of Vice Admiral [[Willis A. Lee]] ([[ComBatPac|Commander Battleships, Pacific]]), joined in the bombardment of [[Mili Atoll]] in the Marshall Islands. Although struck by two Japanese {{convert|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} projectiles, ''Iowa'' suffered negligible damage. She then rejoined TF 58 on 30 March, and supported air strikes against the [[Palau Islands]] and [[Woleai]] of the Carolines for several days.<ref name=\"Iowa-DANFS\"/>\n\nFrom 22\u201328 April, ''Iowa'' supported air raids on [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] (now known as Jayapura), [[Aitape]], and [[Wake Island]]s to support Army forces on Aitape and at [[Tanahmerah Bay|Tanahmerah]] and [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bays]] in [[New Guinea]]. She then joined the Task Force's second strike on [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], on 29 and 30 April, and bombarded Japanese facilities on [[Pohnpei|Ponape]] in the Carolines on 1 May.<ref name=\"Iowa-DANFS\"/>\n\nIn the opening phases of the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]], ''Iowa'' protected the American carriers during air strikes on the islands of Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Rota, and [[Pagan Island]] on 12 June. ''Iowa'' was then detached to bombard enemy installations on Saipan and Tinian on 13\u201314 June, which resulted in the destruction of a Japanese ammunition dump. On 19 June, in an engagement known as the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], ''Iowa'', as part of the battle line of TF 58, helped repel four massive air raids launched by the Japanese Middle Fleet. This resulted in the almost complete destruction of Japanese carrier-based air-forces, with ''Iowa'' claiming the destruction of three enemy aircraft. ''Iowa'' then joined in the pursuit of the fleeing enemy fleet, shooting down one [[torpedo plane]] and assisting in splashing another.<ref name=\"Iowa-DANFS\"/><ref name=\"Iowa I\"/>\n\nThroughout July, ''Iowa'' remained off the Marianas supporting air strikes on the Palaus and landings on Guam. After a month's rest, ''Iowa'' sailed from Eniwetok as part of the Third Fleet, and helped support the [[Battle of Peleliu|landings on Peleliu]] on 17 September. She then protected the carriers during air strikes against the Central Philippines to neutralize enemy air power for the long-awaited invasion of the Philippines. On 10 October, ''Iowa'' arrived off [[Okinawa]] for a series of air strikes on the [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. She then supported air strikes against [[Luzon]] on 18 October and continued this duty during General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[Battle of Leyte|landing on Leyte]] on 20 October.<ref name=\"Iowa-DANFS\"/>\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to halt the United States campaign to recapture the Philippines, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] struck back with ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 1, a three-pronged attack aimed at the destruction of American amphibious forces in [[Leyte Gulf]]. The plan called for Vice-Admiral [[Jisabur\u014d Ozawa]] to use the surviving Japanese carriers as bait to draw US carriers of TF 38 away from the Philippine beachheads, allowing Imperial Japanese Admirals [[Takeo Kurita]], [[Kiyohide Shima]], and [[Sh\u014dji Nishimura]] to take surface task forces through the [[San Bernardino Strait]] and [[Surigao Strait]], where they would rendezvous and attack the US beachheads.<ref>Fuller, 1956</ref><ref>Morison, 1956</ref> ''Iowa'' accompanied TF 38 during attacks against the Japanese Central Force under the command of Admiral Kurita as it steamed through the [[Sibuyan Sea]] toward San Bernardino Strait. The reported results of these attacks and the apparent retreat of the Japanese Central Force led Admiral [[William F. Halsey|William \"Bull\" Halsey]] to believe that this force had been ruined as an effective fighting group; as a result, ''Iowa'', with TF 38, steamed after the Japanese Northern Force off [[Cape Enga\u00f1o (Luzon)|Cape Enga\u00f1o]], Luzon. On 25 October 1944, when the ships of the Northern Force were almost within range of ''Iowa''{{'}}s guns, word arrived that the Japanese Central Force was attacking a group of American [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] off [[Samar (island)|Samar]]. This threat to the American beachheads forced TF 38 to reverse course and steam to support the vulnerable escort carrier fleet, but fierce resistance by the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] in the [[Battle off Samar]] had already caused the Japanese to retire and ''Iowa'' was denied a surface action. Following the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], ''Iowa'' remained in the waters off the Philippines screening carriers during strikes against Luzon and Formosa. She sailed for the West Coast late in December 1944.<ref name=\"Iowa-DANFS\"/>\n\n[[Image:ABSD-2-USNavy_USSIowaBB-61.jpg|thumb|[[USS AFDB-2|USS ABSD-2]] repairing the USS ''Iowa'' in early 1945 at Manus, Admiralty Islands]]\n[[Image:USS Iowa 1945 LOC 182971pu.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A shipyard with a large dry dock occupied by a massive gunship.

In April, she participated in the annual Fleet Week celebrations before returning to Norfolk for an overhaul. On 26 May, [[Fred Moosally]] replaced Larry Seaquist as Captain of ''Iowa''.<ref>Thompson, pp. 33\u201335.</ref> After the overhaul, Moosally took ''Iowa'' on a shakedown cruise around [[Chesapeake Bay]] on 25 August. Encountering difficulty in conning the ship through shallow water, Moosally narrowly missed colliding with the [[frigate]] {{USS|Moinester|FF-1097|2}}, destroyer {{USS|Farragut|DDG-37|2}}, and the cruiser {{USS|South Carolina|CGN-37|2}} before running aground in soft mud outside the bay's main ship channel near the Thimble Shoals. After one hour, ''Iowa'' was able to extricate herself without damage and return to port.<ref>Thompson, pp. 58\u201360. According to Thompson, the near-misses with the other navy ships were recorded in ''Iowa''{{'}}s log as attempts to \"render honors\" to them. Although other US Navy vessels observed ''Iowa'' grounded in the mud, the incident apparently was not acted upon by Moosally's superiors. Mike Fahey, the ship's executive officer, warned the other officers on ''Iowa'' to never mention the grounding to anyone, including superior Navy officers.</ref> ''Iowa'' continued with sea trials throughout August and September, then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October, during which the ship passed an Operation Propulsion Program Evaluation.<ref name=\"Iowa I\"/><ref>Thompson, pp. 65\u201367.</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 1989, during an improperly authorized gunnery experiment off [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques Island]], ''Iowa'' fired a {{convert|16|in|0|adj=on}} shell {{convert|23.4|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}, setting a record for the longest-ranged {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} shell ever fired.

The Turret One gun crew leaders considered defying the order because of the unauthorized nature and perceived danger of the experiment, but in the end fired the experimental loads.
