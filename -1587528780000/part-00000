Substantial waves of Turkish colonisers began from 1389-1455 when, during the Ottoman conquest, soldiers, officials, and merchants began to make their appearance in the major towns of Kosovo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elsie|2010|loc=276}}.</ref> \n\nIn 1912 the Ottoman Turks lost control over Kosovo and the region became a part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Kingdoms of Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]]. From this point, Kosovo as a political entity was discontinued as the region was divided among new administrative units. Following the Austrian and Bulgarian occupation during [[World War I]], Serbia and Montenegro became part of the newly created [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918. When the [[Axis powers]] occupied [[Yugoslavia]] in 1941, the former territory of Kosovo became part of [[Albania]], which was itself controlled by [[Italy]]. With the defeat of the Axis powers, Yugoslavia, then ruled by Communists led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], regained control over the region. In 1946, Kosovo returned to maps when a region bearing the name ''Kosovo and Metohija'' was granted autonomous status within [[FPR Yugoslavia]]. Meanwhile, Turks officially became a recognised minority by Yugoslavia; as a result, the number of registered Turks in Kosovo jumped from a mere 1,313 (or 0.2% of the population) in 1948 to 34,343 (4.3% of Kosovo's population) in the 1953 census. However, many Turkish inhabitants began to emigrate to [[Turkey]] until 1958 on the basis of a bilateral agreement between Yugoslavia and Turkey.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baltic|2007|loc=29}}.</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=80% align=\"center\" rules=\"all\" style=\"margin: 1em; background: #ffffff; border: 2px solid #aaa; font-size: 100%;\"\n|- bgcolor=#DDDDDD\n| colspan=8 align=\"center\" | Turks in Kosovo according to official censuses<ref>{{Harvnb|Mertus|1999|loc=316-317}}.</ref>\n|- bgcolor=#f0f0f0 align=\"center\"\n!

Kosovo''', also known as '''Kosovo Turks''', '''Kosovan Turks''' ({{lang-tr|{{italics correction|Kosova T\u00fcrkleri}}}}) are the ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] who constitute a minority group in [[Kosovo]].\n\n==History==\nTurkish settlement into [[Kosovo]] began in the late 14th century after the medieval [[Moravian Serbia|Serbian]] state lost the [[Battle of Kosovo]] and the territory came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. Substantial waves of Turkish colonisers began from 1389-1455 when, during the Ottoman conquest, soldiers, officials, and merchants began to make their appearance in the major towns of Kosovo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elsie|2010|loc=276}}.</ref> \n\nIn 1912 the Ottoman Turks lost control over Kosovo and the region became a part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Kingdoms of Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]]. From this point, Kosovo as a political entity was discontinued as the region was divided among new administrative units. Following the Austrian and Bulgarian occupation during [[World War I]], Serbia and Montenegro became part of the newly created [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918. When the [[Axis powers]] occupied [[Yugoslavia]] in 1941, the former territory of Kosovo became part of [[Albania]], which was itself controlled by [[Italy]]. With the defeat of the Axis powers, Yugoslavia, then ruled by Communists led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], regained control over the region. In 1946, Kosovo returned to maps when a region bearing the name ''Kosovo and Metohija'' was granted autonomous status within [[FPR Yugoslavia]]. Meanwhile, Turks officially became a recognised minority by Yugoslavia; as a result, the number of registered Turks in Kosovo jumped from a mere 1,313 (or 0.2% of the population) in 1948 to 34,343 (4.3% of Kosovo's population) in the 1953 census. However, many Turkish inhabitants began to emigrate to [[Turkey]] until 1958 on the basis of a bilateral agreement between Yugoslavia and Turkey.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baltic|2007|loc=29}}.</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=80% align=\"center\" rules=\"all\" style=\"margin: 1em; background: #ffffff; border: 2px solid #aaa; font-size: 100%;\"\n|- bgcolor=#DDDDDD\n| colspan=8 align=\"center\" | Turks in Kosovo according to official censuses<ref>{{Harvnb|Mertus|1999|loc=316-317}}.</ref>\n|- bgcolor=#f0f0f0 align=\"center\"\n!

To give an example, in Lipjan/Lipljan, the figure of Turks decreases from 400-500 to 128. However, in the 2010 general elections, the Turkish political parties KDTP and KTB received together a total of 207 votes. Although members from other communities sometimes vote for Turkish parties and other issues need to be taken into account, this figure suggests that for this municipality the census figure may not be representative and that further analysis is needed.<ref name=\"European Centre for minority Issues Kosovo 2012 loc=6\">{{Harvnb|European Centre for minority Issues Kosovo|2012|loc=6}}.</ref>}}\n\n===Areas of settlement===\nThe Turkish minority of Kosovo have a majority population in [[Mamu\u0161a]].
